The '''Accounting Standards Board''' (AcSB) establishes accounting standards&lt;ref name="Previts2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Previts|first=Gary|title=Global History of Accounting, Financial Reporting and Public Policy: Americas|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=0857248111|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use by private enterprises and private sector not-for-profit organizations. The AcSB contributes to the development of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) by participating in consultations and activities of the [[International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)]] to ensure Canadian publicly accountable entities' financial reporting needs are considered. The AcSB develops and participates in the development of high-quality financial reporting standards.

As an independent body, the AcSB is intended to make clients confident and promote objectivity {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}, which helps organizations make informed decisions on where to allocate their financial assets.

== Responsibilities ==
According to their Terms of Reference, their responsibilities include:
* the creation of financial accounting standards following review, 
* implementing effective working standards for themselves, 
* researching financial reporting standards in order to refine theirs, 
* communication with stakeholders,
* being accountable to the oversight council,
* advising the oversight council as to what budget and amount of human resources and are needed to accomplish their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AcSB's Responsibilities|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-board/what-we-do/terms-of-reference/index.aspx |publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stakeholders ==
The AcSB's stakeholders include preparers, auditors, advisors and financial statement users in the following sectors: 
* Private enterprises. 
* Not-for-profit organizations (NFPOs).
* Publicly accountable entities.

== Members ==
Ten voting and three non-voting members make up the AcSB, including a paid Chair. View current AcSB members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcSB Members|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-board/members/acsb/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AcSB membership consists of a diverse group of members with a range of experience from various locations across Canada.

The Board's support staff comprises:
* a Director;  
* 11 principals; and  
* two administrative assistants.

The Board also hires consultants as the need arises.

== Setting standards ==
[[Generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) are intended to apply to general purposes financial statements that meet common information needs for a range of users, but there are limits to how much latitude GAAP can provide for diversity in practice. 
As a result, in 2005, the AcSB developed a strategy whereby separate accounting frameworks were adopted for publicly accountable enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcSB Strategic Plan|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-board/what-we-do/strategic-plan/item69476.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; private enterprises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Plan|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-board/what-we-do/strategic-plan/item69829.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private sector not-for-profit organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Plan|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-board/what-we-do/strategic-plan/item69839.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "one size does not fit all."

[[File:Relationship Between Accounting Standards Oversight Council with AcSB (Canada).jpg|thumb|The Accounting Standards Oversight Council (AcSOC) oversees the activities of the AcSB and PSAB. The AcSB's activities include the development and adoption of separate accounting frameworks for various types of entities.]]

=== International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) ===
For issues related to publicly accountable enterprises, agenda topics come from the following sources: 
* The AcSB adds a topic to its agenda when the IASB activates a project. Work proceeds in parallel with the IASB.  The AcSB contributes to the development of IFRSs by participating in consultations and activities of the IASB, as well as provides research for the IASB on certain projects. 
* The IFRS Discussion Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFRS Discussion Group|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/international-financial-reporting-standards/ifrs-discussion-group/about-the-group/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a regular public forum to discuss issues that arise in Canada when applying IFRSs. The Group assists the AcSB in identifying and analyzing these issues so that the Board can raise them with the IASB and IFRS Interpretations Committee.

=== Standards for Private Enterprises, Not-for-Profit Organizations and Pension Plans ===
Accounting standards for private enterprise (ASPE) issues come from many sources, including the following:
* The Private Enterprise Advisory Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Enterprise Advisory Committee|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/standards-for-private-enterprises/private-enterprise-advisory-committee/about-the-committee/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes recommendations to the AcSB on potential changes to accounting standards for private enterprises. The AcSB staff also notifies the Committee of relevant developments in other jurisdictions.
* Committees, the AcSB or members of the public may raise issues, including issues regarding the application of ASPE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Enterprise Advisory Committee - Submit an Issue|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/standards-for-private-enterprises/private-enterprise-advisory-committee/submit-an-issue/item55442.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the AcSB's request, the Committee also reviews each new IFRS and standards developed by other Boards, including the U.S. FASB, and considers whether to recommend that some or all provisions of a standard be included in ASPE.

Not-for-profit organization issues also come from many sources, including:
* proposed changes to accounting standards for private enterprises that also apply to not-for-profit organizations; 
* the AcSB/PSAB Joint Not-for-Profit Task Force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Not-for-Profit Task Force|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/public-sector-accounting-board/members/joint-not-for-profit-task-force/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its members; 
* AcSB members; and 
* members of the public.

For matters related to pension plans, AcSB members or members of the public may raise these.

== Meetings ==
The AcSB schedules meetings almost every month.

View the AcSB meeting calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcSB Meeting Calendar|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-board/meetings/calendar/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with CPA Canada ==
CPA Canada is the national organization representing the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) profession in Canada. CPA Canada provides funding, staff and other resources to support an independent standard-setting process.

CPA Canada and the boards and oversight councils function at arms-length from one another. As a result, the boards and oversight councils as well as their staff carry out their standard-setting operations in an independent manner.

[[File:Relationship Between Accounting Standards Councils and Boards (Canada).jpg|thumb|CPA Canada provides funding, staff and other resources to support an independent standard setting process that is delivered through Canada's accounting and audit and assurance standards boards and oversight councils.]]

==Accounting Standards Oversight Council (AcSOC)==
The '''Accounting Standards Oversight Council''' (AcSOC) is an independent, volunteer body established by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA)* in 2000 to serve the public interest by overseeing and providing input into the activities of the Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). In 2003, AcSOC started overseeing and providing input into the activities of the [[Public Sector Accounting Board]] (PSAB).
It oversees the activities of the AcSB and the [[Public Sector Accounting Board]]. The Council ensures the Boards follow its rigorous due process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcSB Due Process|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-board/what-we-do/due-process/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AcSOC also appoints Board members and provides input on strategy and priorities. AcSOC also assesses and reports to the public on the performance of the Boards.

AcSOC serves the public interest by playing a key role in Canadian financial reporting by overseeing and evaluating the performance of, and providing input into, the activities of Canada's accounting standard-setting boards – the AcSB and PSAB.

== AcSOC's Responsibilities ==
See AcSOC's Terms of Reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcSOC What We Do|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-oversight-council/what-we-do/terms-of-reference/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: AcSOC is empowered by its terms of reference to take necessary, reasonable actions to carry out its responsibilities.

== AcSOC's Membership ==
AcSOC comprises between 20 and 25 voting members, including five non-voting members. View current AcSOC members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcSOC Council Members|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-oversight-council/members/acsoc/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AcSOC membership consists of senior members from, amongst others, the following: 
* Business  
* Finance  
* Government  
* Academia  
* Accounting and legal professions 
* Regulators  
* Private sector not-for-profits 
* Financial analyst communities.

Members have a broad perspective of the complex issues facing standard setters.

== AcSOC's Meetings ==
AcSOC normally meets three times a year. To better serve the Council's objectives, additional meetings and conference calls may take place.

With the exception of administrative matters, meetings are generally open to public observation. Read the Guidelines for Observers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcSOC Guidelines for Outside Observers|url=http://www.frascanada.ca/accounting-standards-oversight-council/meetings/guidelines-for-observers/index.aspx|publisher=FRASCA|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for information on attending AcSOC meetings.

'''Albert S. Humphrey''' (2 June 1926&amp;nbsp;– 31 October 2005) was an American business and [[Management consulting|management consultant]] who specialized in organizational management and [[Transformation of culture|cultural change]]. Initially earning degrees in chemical engineering in Illinois, he eventually moved to London.

Humphrey devoleped the [[SWOT analysis]] technique while working for the Stanford Research Institute, now known as [[SRI International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/dec-05.pdf|title=SWOT Analysis for Management Consulting|first=Albert|last=Humphrey|work=SRI Alumni Newsletter|publisher=[[SRI International]]|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; . SWOT is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses/Limitations, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business venture. The origin of the term SWOT remains obscure.

== Education ==
Albert Humphrey was educated at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], where he graduated with a B.Sc. in [[Chemical engineering|Chemical Engineering]]. After this he gained a master's degree in chemical engineering at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="father"/&gt;

== Career ==
His work at the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) produced a team method for planning which created SOFT analysis and this was developed into [[SWOT analysis]].

One client was [[W.H. Smith]] (1970–1987), which aligned its annual budget to long-range planning. This programme was the first to use the concept of employee involvement in business planning and can be seen as sowing the seeds for the [[Investors in People]] scheme.

While continuing work at Stanford, Humphrey was involved with the team that came up with the Stakeholder Concept, which has often been referenced by business leaders, economists and politicians. This programme became known as TAM ([[Team Action Management]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leader-values.com/content/detail.asp?ContentDetailID=872|title=Leadership Development - Results focused Leadership thinking and practice from around the Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his working life Humphrey acted as consultant to over 100 companies globally. In 2005 he was listed in:&lt;ref name="father"/&gt;

* ''[[Marquis Who's Who#General publications|Who's Who in the World]]''
* [[Debrett's#Debrett's People of Today|Debrett's ''People of Today'']]
* ''Who's Who in the City''
* ''The Directory of Directors''

In 2004 he was listed in the ''[[Marquis Who's Who#General publications|Who's Who in Science and Engineering]]'', 7th Edition (2003–2004).

== Family ==

'''Burr, Egan, Deleage &amp; Co.''' (BEDCO) was a [[venture capital]] firm which focused on investments in information technology, communications, and healthcare/biotechnology companies.

BEDCO was one of the first venture capital firm to set up a bi-coastal operation with a presence in both [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and [[Silicon Valley]] in California.

The firm was founded in 1979 and dissolved in 1996, with [[Alta Partners]] and [[Alta Communications]] assuming management responsibility for certain existing investments.  Other successor firms include [[Polaris Venture Partners]] and Alta Berkeley.

==History==
{{history of private equity and venture capital}}
The firm was founded in 1979 by [[Craig Burr]], [[William P. Egan]], and [[Jean Deleage|Dr. Jean Deleage, Ph.D.]]  Burr and Egan had worked together at the pioneering private equity firm [[TA Associates]].  Deleage had come from Sofinnova Partners, a venture capital firm in France that he had co-founded in 1971.  In 1976, Deleage had founded Sofinnova’s US affiliate, based in San Francisco.  At its zenith the company managed over $700 million in assets and today is the direct predecessor of four venture capital firms with aggregate capital in excess of $5.7 billion: 
* [[Polaris Venture Partners]] based in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]
* [[Alta Partners]] based in California
* [[Alta Communications]] based in Boston
* Alta Berkeley Capital based in London.

Among BEDCO’s most notable investments were [[Continental Cablevision]] with [[H. Irving Grousbeck]], [[Qwest]] with [[Philip Anschutz]], [[Cephalon]], [[American Superconductor]] and [[SyQuest Technology]].

==Investment funds==
From its founding in 1979 through its dissolution in 1996,{{fact|date=February 2018}} BEDCO raised more than a dozen venture capital funds with total investor commitments of approximately $700 million.

* 1980 - $12m - Alta Company
* 1982 - $60m - Alta II (Late Stage) 
* 1982 - $10m - Alta Berkeley Venture Partners (Bal. Stage) 
* 1983 - $18m - Alta Berkeley LP Liquidating Trust (Early Stage) 
* 1984 - $15.7m - Alta Berkeley Eurofund (Early Stage) 
* 1986 - $45m - Alta Subordinated Debt (Mezzanine) 
* 1986 - $32.3m - Alta Berkeley L.P. II (Early Stage) 
* 1988 - $35m - Alta Communications IV  (Late Stage) 
* 1988 - $124m - Alta IV (Late Stage) 
* 1988 - $68m - Alta Subordinated Debt II (Mezzanine) 
* 1992 - $161m - Alta V
* 1993 - $96m - Alta Subordinated Debt III (Mezzanine) 
* 1993 - $27m - Alta Berkeley III (Early Stage)

==Successor firms==

===Polaris Venture Partners===
[[Polaris Venture Partners]] was the first of four successors to BEDCO.  One of the contributing factors in the dissolution was the departure of three of BEDCO’s junior partners, [[Jon Flint]], [[Terry McGuire]], [[Steve Arnold (Venture Capitalist)]].  The three founders, left BEDCO in 1995 and began raising their first independent venture capital fund.  Today, Polaris Venture Partners is a venture capital firm specializing in seed and early stage investments particularly in companies engaged in the information technology and life sciences sectors.  Polaris is based in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] with an additional office in [[Seattle, Washington]].

Since 1995, Polaris has raised five venture capital funds with over $2.6 billion of investor commitments.  To date, all of the Polaris funds have been above average performers for their respective vintage years.  Polaris Venture Partners V, which was closed in 2006, raised $1 billion of investor commitments.

===Alta Partners===
[[Alta Partners]] was founded by BEDCO co-founder [[Jean Deleage|Dr. Jean Deleage, Ph.D.]], along with [[Garrett Gruener]], a former partner at BEDCO.  Today, the firm, which is based in [[San Francisco]], invests in [[biotechnology]] and [[life science]] companies and has made over 130 investments since its separation from BEDCO.

Since 1996, Alta has raised eight venture capital funds including four funds in its Alta California Funds series, three funds in its Alta Biopharma Partners series and most recently in 2006, Alta raised Alta Partners VIII with $500 million of investor commitments

===Alta Communications===
[[Alta Communications]] was founded by BEDCO co-founders Craig Burr and [[William P. Egan]].  Today the firm, which is based in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] (just outside Boston), invests primarily in later-stage opportunities in the traditional [[mass media|media]] and [[telecommunications]] sectors.

Since 1996, Alta Communications has raised four venture capital funds with over $1.4 billion of investor commitments.

===Alta Berkeley===
Alta Berkeley was formed from BEDCO’s European operations.  In 1982, Bryan Wood, who had been working in corporate finance in Britain, partnered with BEDCO to establish a presence in Europe.  Today, Alta Berkeley makes early stage investments in technology companies based in Europe and Israel.  Alta Berkeley's sixth and most recent fund raised approximately $145 million of investor commitments.

'''Distell Group Limited''', commonly referred to as Distell, is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[brewing]] and [[Beverage industry|beverage]] company, based in South Africa.

==Overview==
Distell Group Limited is a producer and marketer of spirits, fine wines, ciders and ready-to-drinks. The group's headquarters are in [[Stellenbosch]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.distell.co.za/version%202/contactus.aspx|title = Distell Contacts|date = |accessdate = 2 November 2014|website = |publisher = Distell Group Limited|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at February 2014, Distell had 5,300 employees worldwide and an annual turnover of [[South African rand|ZAR]] 17.7 Billion.

==History==
Distell Group Limited traces its roots to two major alcoholic beverage companies in South Africa, Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery (SFW) and Distillers Corporation, that merged on 4 December 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Merger ===
==== Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery ====
Stellenbosch Farmers Winery Group (SFW) the founder member of Distell Group was formed in 1925 by [[William Charles Winshaw]], an [[United States|American]] medical doctor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.distell.co.za/runtime/popcontentrun.aspx?pageidref=2577|title = Distell History|date = |accessdate = 3 November 2014|website = |publisher = Distell Group Limited|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As at the year 2000, SFW produced and distributed wine and spirits as well as non-alcoholic beverages through retail outlets South Africa and across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/SFW:SJ-stellenbosch-farmers-winery-group-ltd|title = Stellenbosch Farmers Winery Group Ltd|date = |accessdate = 3 November 2014|website = |publisher = Bloomberg LLP|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 Stellenbosch Farmers Winery Ltd was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://showme.co.za/stellenbosch/tourism/history-of-stellenbosch/|title = Modern day History Timeline of Stellenbosch|date = |accessdate = 3 November 2014|website = |publisher = ShowMe™|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distillers Corporation ====
Distillers Corporation was formed in 1945 by [[Anton Rupert]]. Distillers expanded energetically and very quickly set up marketing relationships and partnerships in the wine and spirits industry. The company became a major producer, focusing on distillates and in particular on the brandy market that it developed from relative obscurity to its current level of prominence. It is renowned for its Bergkelder concept, a marketing innovation that invited wine estates to make use of Distillers' bottling, sales and marketing expertise. In addition, it created a new African icon, [[Amarula|Amarula Cream]], which is one of the top-selling cream liqueurs in the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Distillers Corporation was also listed on the JSE.

==== Merger transaction ====
On 20 September 2000, Distillers' Corporation and Stellenbosch Farmers Winery directors announced the merger of the two firms. The merger was made possible because both firms had a similar shareholding structure i.e.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.comptrib.co.za/assets/Uploads/Case-Documents/08LMFEb02.pdf|title = Case No: 08/LM/Feb02 - Merger between Distillers Corporation (SA) Limited and Stellenbosch Farmers Winery Group Ltd|date = 13 March 2003|accessdate = 3 November 2011|website = |publisher = Competition Tribunal, Republic of South Africa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Remgro-KWV Investments – 60% of  Distillers' Corporation and a similar stake in SFW.
* Other Beverages Industries (Pty) Ltd – 30% of  Distillers' Corporation and a similar stake in SFW. Other Beverage Interests Proprietary Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[SABMiller]].
* Public via The JSE – 10%
This structure allowed the merger not to have any diluting effect on the lead shareholders' effective interest in the merged entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.remgro.com/financials/annual_report2001/ar2001.pdf|title = Remgro Group 2001 Annual Report|date = 31 March 2001|accessdate = 3 November 2014|website = |publisher = Remgro Group|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2000, the management announced the conclusion of the merger. The newly formed entity was known as '''Distell '''from the names of the two constituent companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.just-drinks.com/news/distillers-corporation-stellenbosch-farmers-winery-distell_id78854.aspx|title = SOUTH AFRICA: Distillers' Corporation + Stellenbosch Farmers Winery = Distell|date = 5 December 2000|accessdate = 3 November 2014|website = just-drinks.com|publisher = Aroq Limited|last = Kirkby|first = Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''duty of fair representation''' is incumbent upon [[United States|U.S.]] [[trade union|labor unions]] that are the exclusive bargaining representative of workers in a particular group. It is the obligation to represent all employees fairly, in good faith, and without discrimination. Originally recognized by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in a series of cases in the mid-1940s involving racial discrimination by railway workers' unions covered by the [[Railway Labor Act]], the duty of fair representation also applies to workers covered by the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and, depending on the terms of the statute, to public sector workers covered by state and local laws regulating labor relations.

==Application==
The duty applies to virtually every action that a union might take in dealing with an employer as the representative of employees, from its negotiation of the terms of a [[collective bargaining agreement]], to its handling of grievances arising under that agreement, as well as its operation of an exclusive [[hiring hall]] and its enforcement of the [[union shop|union security]] provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. However, the duty does not ordinarily apply to rights that a worker can enforce independently; the union has no duty to assist the employees it represents in filing claims under a [[workers' compensation]] statute or other laws.

The duty likewise does not apply for the most part to unions' internal affairs, such as their right to discipline employees for violation of the union's own rules or union officers' handling of union funds, which are regulated instead by the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]]. The courts have, on the other hand, applied the same principles that govern the duty of fair representation to union members' suits to enforce union constitutions.

==Courts' view==
Generally the courts have taken a deferential approach to reviewing unions' decisions challenged as a breach of their duty of fair representation. Recognizing that the collective bargaining process typically requires compromises, which may favor some workers at the expense of others, the courts have held that a union only breaches its duty if it acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily. Practical considerations have also led the courts to refuse to second-guess unions' decisions: if a court or jury could substitute its judgment as to whether a particular grievance had merit, then unions could not function, since their decisions would rarely be final in any practical sense. Accordingly, the courts have refused to overturn union decisions as arbitrary so long as they were based on a reasoned decision by the union, even if the court might believe that this decision was wrong.

==New applications==
In recent years the courts and the [[National Labor Relations Board]] have applied the duty of fair representation to regulate the manner in which unions enforce the union security provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Unlike the standard applied to unions' decisions concerning grievance handling and collective bargaining negotiations, the courts and the Board have regulated this area very extensively. They have specified the types of expenses that a union can include in the fees that it charges employees who choose not to join the union but are required to pay dues under an agency shop or union shop clause, the accounting procedures used to calculate those amounts, the procedures which the union and employees must follow if an individual worker objects to paying the full amount of dues or challenges the union's calculation of the lesser amount that non-members can be required to pay, and the procedures that the union must follow before it can force the employer to fire an employee for non-payment of dues. Even stricter standards are applied to unions covered by the Railway Labor Act and to unions of governmental employees on constitutional grounds.

The NLRB applies a similarly strict standard in reviewing unions' enforcement of exclusive hiring halls, i.e., those in which the employer is bound, by contract, to hire only employees referred to it by the union. The NLRB requires unions to establish clear procedures and to follow those procedures in order to minimize the likelihood that the union would use a hiring hall procedure to exclude non-members or those out of favour with the union from the workplace. On the other hand, the NLRB applies the more deferential standard applied to union decisions generally in the case of non-exclusive hiring halls, i.e., those in which the union has the power to refer applicants for employment but the employer may also hire employees "off the street"; in those cases the union is barred from acting arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily.

==Violations==
The NLRB recognizes a breach of the duty of fair representation as a violation of the National Labor Relations Act. However, because the duty of fair representation was originally created by judicial interpretation, rather than as an express statutory prohibition, employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act may sue their unions directly, without being required to first exhaust any administrative procedures provided under the National Labor Relations Board. The same is true for workers covered by the Railway Labor Act, which does not provide any administrative procedure for pursuing claims against a union. Employees' claims under either Act are governed by a six-month [[statute of limitations]].

The NLRB and the courts provide different solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce the collective bargaining agreement or to issue a remedial order against an employer that has violated it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff. These distinctions do not apply to workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no administrative procedures to enforce their rights.

A union may, in some limited circumstances, require employees to exhaust any internal appeals procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their rights under the grievance arbitration procedures provided for under the collective bargaining agreement before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.

'''Edward Mazur''' (born 1946) is a [[Polish-American]] businessman.

== Personal and Professional History ==

Mazur was born in Poland, [[immigrated]] to the U.S. as a child in the 1960s, and became [[naturalized]] in 1969. He obtained a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Chicago Technical College and held various executive positions at Cargill International and John Deere &amp; Co. After working with those companies on developing their markets in [[Central Europe]], he became involved in a number of his own business ventures in Poland after the end of the [[Communist]] rule in 1989. He was a co-founder of Bakoma S.A., the largest yogurt company in Poland, which was eventually acquired by Dannon Company. In 2003, Mazur was listed as one of the 25 richest Poles, with his family's permanent residence in Glenview, IL.

== Investigation and Dropped Charges ==

He was accused by Poland's prosecutors of contracting, in 1998, the murder of Polish National Police chief, General [[Marek Papała]]. In August 2014, the Polish prosecution dropped their case against Mazur. After a lengthy prosecution, they cited a lack of evidence against him to conclude that he committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/material-dowodowy-jest-niewystarczajacy-by-uznac-ze-mazur-dopuscil-sie-zarzucanego-mu-przestepstwa,460595.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazur was arrested in the U.S. in 2006 on a Polish [[extradition]] request. While that request dated back to 2005, the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had not taken any action on it until Poland's Minister of Justice [[Zbigniew Ziobro]] personally intervened with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]]. The Polish  government alleged that Mazur had paid Polish organized crime figures $40,000 to murder General Papała. On 20 July 2007, after Mazur spent nine months in federal detention, Poland's request was rejected by Federal Magistrate Arlander Keys (Northern Illinois District Court) for lack of [[probable cause]], mainly because the 
principal witness, Artur Zirajewski, lacked credibility in the court's view. Judge Keys harshly criticized the extradition request calling the government's reliance on Zirajewski's identification as "shocking and offensive" and stated that in his 12 years on the bench he hadn't even been close to rejecting an extradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/judge/keys/pdfs/Mazur_07202007.pdf U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. In the matter of Extradition of Edward Mazur] Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys, July 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazur's lawyer argued that his case exposed weaknesses in the U.S. [[extradition]] law  dealing with the countries "lacking many of the legal safeguards of the United States". He accused Polish authorities of framing his client out of vindictiveness and a desire to smear the leftist opposition, to which Mazur has close ties, and the U.S. government of pursuing this "paper-thin" case out of political expedience to placate an allied government.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jenner.com/files/tbl_s20Publications%5CRelatedDocumentsPDFs1252%5C1813%5CLegalTimes_Gair_9_10_07.pdf Whose Side is Uncle Sam on?] Chris C. Gair, Legal Times, Vol. XXX, No. 37, Sept 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the charges were dropped by Poland. The Polish authorities cited they lacked sufficient evidence that would suggest that he committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://wpolityce.pl/spoleczenstwo/210086-prokuratura-umorzyla-postepowanie-wobec-edwarda-mazura&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Financial District''' is a business district in [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It was originally planned as '''New Town''' in 1796 as an extension of the Town of York (later the [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence Ward]]).&lt;ref&gt;Historical Atlas of Toronto, Derek Hayes, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55365-290-8}}, Pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; It is the main financial district in Toronto and is considered the heart of Canada's finance industry. It is bounded roughly by [[Queen Street West]] to the north, [[Yonge Street]] to the east, [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] to the south, and [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]] to the west, though many office towers in the [[Downtown Toronto|downtown core]] are being constructed outside this area, which will extend the general boundaries. Examples of this trend are the [[Telus Harbour]] and [[RBC Centre]].

It is the most densely built-up area of Toronto, home to banking companies, corporate headquarters, high-powered legal and accounting firms, insurance companies and stockbrokers. In turn, the presence of so many decision-makers has brought advertising agencies and marketing companies. The banks have built large office towers, much of whose space is leased to these companies.

The bank towers, and much else in Toronto's core, are connected by a system of underground walkways, known as [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]], which is lined with retail establishments making the area one of Toronto's most important shopping districts. The vast majority of these stores are only open during weekdays during the business day when the financial district is populated. During the evenings and weekends, the walkways remain open but the area is almost deserted and most of the stores are closed.

It is estimated 100,000 commuters enter and leave the financial district each working day. Transport links are centered on [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] at the south end of the financial district, which is the hub of the [[GO Transit]] system that provides commuter rail and bus links to Toronto's suburbs.

==History==
The district's origins date back to the mid to late-19th century when a number of early banks had head offices located in Toronto. Most of these banks were regional and came and went. It was not until the second half of the 20th Century that the Big Five banks located their headquarters there.
[[File:Business Section of Toronto from an Aeroplane (HS85-10-35730).jpg|thumb|left|The Financial District from the air, 1920.]]
Of the big banks, only [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] and [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] (including the banks existing before mergers) had full head offices in Toronto:

* [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] (CIBC) (1961) — both [[Imperial Bank of Canada]] (1875) and [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]] (1867) had head offices in Toronto
* [[Royal Bank of Canada]] (RBC) (1976) — relocated corporate head offices from Montreal; maintains legal head office in Montreal
* [[Bank of Montreal]] (BMO) (1975) — relocated corporate head offices from Montreal; maintains legal head office in Montreal
* [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] (TD) (1955) — previous [[Bank of Toronto]] (1855) and [[The Dominion Bank]] (1869) had head offices in Toronto
* [[Scotiabank]] (1931) — relocated corporate head office from Halifax; maintains legal head office in Halifax

The Toronto Financial District Business Improvement Area was later resta in order to represent all commercial businesses in the within the district. The organization engages in streetscape improvements, addressing key issues that impact the area, and promoting the area's businesses online.

===Lost historic buildings===

{{Contract law}}

A '''firm offer''' is an [[Offer and acceptance|offer]] that will remain open for a certain period or until a certain time or occurrence of a certain event, during which it is incapable of being revoked. As a general rule, all offers are revocable at any time prior to acceptance, even those offers that purport to be irrevocable on their face.

In the [[United States]], an exception is the merchant firm offer rule set out in [[Uniform Commercial Code]] - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer to buy or sell goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-205 |title=Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205. Firm Offers|website=Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an offer is irrevocable even in the absence of [[consideration]]. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

However, even when the period of irrevocability expires, the offer may still remain open until revoked or rejected according to the general rules regarding termination of an offer.

If the offeree rejects, fails to accept the terms of the offer, fixed or otherwise, or makes a counter-offer, then the original offer is terminated.

==History==

Gerson Lehrman Group was founded by [[Yale Law School]] graduates [[Mark Gerson]] and Thomas Lehrman in 1998. Alexander Saint-Amand, a former Bloomberg reporter, joined GLG shortly after, and served as CEO until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming Professional Learning|url=http://www.leadersmag.com/issues/2014.4_Oct/New_York_City/LEADERS-Alexander-Saint-Amand-GLG.html|website=Leaders Mag|access-date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=3367944&amp;privcapId=134597205|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GLG, initially funded by friends and family, was formed as a [[publishing house]] to produce industry guidebooks for institutional investors. However, the founders discovered that their clients wanted to talk directly to experts in casual conversations, rather than reading formal written reports. Accordingly, in 1999, GLG abandoned its publishing business and began offering subscriptions to its network of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing; It's Not What They Know, but Whom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/23/business/investing-it-s-not-what-they-know-but-whom.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2001|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This business came to be called an [[expert network]].

GLG’s first customers were investors, and most of their growth from 1999 to 2005 was within the investment community. In 2006, they began working with big strategy consultancies and with companies in life sciences, chemicals and industrials, and technology. By 2010, [[The Wall Street Journal]] had described GLG as "dominating the U.S. expert networking industry".&lt;ref name=wsj2&gt;{{cite web|title=Talent holds key to growth in Asia for Gerson Lehrman boss|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703580904575130931563106648|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the design space, GLG is a pioneer of [[Activity Based Working|activity based working]] office design, which does away with seating assignments for workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More New York Companies Experiment With Innovative Office Space|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-new-york-companies-experiment-with-innovative-office-space-1404694528|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 7, 2014|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, GLG named Paul Todd as its new CEO.

In 2006, GLG worked with [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to provide new primary data and analysis relevant for any other recovery plans in the rebuilding of Louisiana following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebuilding after Katrina and Rita |url=https://www.swtlaw.com/sites/swtlawcom/files/779-RebuildingAfterKatrina.pdf|website=Schulten Ward Turner &amp; Weiss, LLP|date=April 12, 2006|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLG has also done other philanthropy work with smaller charities.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye-Care Charity Gets Free Fund-Raising Insights|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Eye-Care-Charity-Gets-Free/226491|website=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=November 11, 2011|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional partnerships==

As the use of alternative research providers within the financial industry has grown, brokerages themselves have been partnering with firms like GLG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman and Morgan Stanley Alphawise Tie Up|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/gerson-lehrman-and-morgan-stanley-alphawise-tie-up/|website=Integrity Research Associates|date=March 27, 2008|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2008, the company announced a deal with [[Credit Suisse]], whereby analysts from the financial services giant would be able to tap into GLG’s experts as part of their research process.  About 300 Credit Suisse analysts became members of the GLG expert network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Suisse in alliance with consultancy firm|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7b41e986-7eca-11dd-b1af-000077b07658|website=Financial Times|date=September 10, 2008|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Gerson Lehrman Group announced a partnership with [[Frost &amp; Sullivan]], making the company's 800+ market researchers available to consult with GLG clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman Group Announces Addition of Frost &amp; Sullivan to the Council Partners Program|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gerson-lehrman-group-announces-addition-of-frost--sullivan-to-the-council-partners-program-61927502.html|website=GLG Press Release|date=April 23, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, GLG announced that it has partnered with [[Amba Research]], a leading financial services [[knowledge process outsourcing]] (KPO) firm that provides equity and credit research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amba partners with Gerson Lehrman Group|url=http://www.ambaresearch.com/amba-partners-gerson-lehrman-group/|website=Amba Press Release|date=July 27, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719202222/http://www.ambaresearch.com/amba-partners-gerson-lehrman-group/|archivedate=July 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

The expert network business model has drawn scrutiny for concerns relating to adherence to disclosure rules and [[insider trading]] within the investment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmdutton.com/PDF_Files/mayhew-interview_0605.pdf Dutton Associates Online Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2005, for example, doctors who served as paid consultants to investment firms as a result of their role in an expert network generated a “fair share of controversy”.&lt;ref&gt;Marcy Tolkoff, April 21, 2006. "[http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/memag/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=319414 Consult for Wall Street? Consulting for Wall Street may be lucrative, but some critics say such arrangements involve inherent conflicts of interest]", ''Medical Economics''. Retrieved August 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; GLG was part of a lawsuit filed by [[Biovail]] in March 2006, in which Biovail claimed that its shares had been manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Anderson, February 23, 2006.

The '''grandfather principle''' is related to the [[Management accounting|control]] and order within [[hierarchical]] [[organisations]].

==Decisions making==

Examples of the principle's use in decision making:

* A major decision has to be approved by the [[Management|manager]]'s manager (the "grandparent").
* To guarantee fair and objective remuneration, all decisions concerning personal [[compensation and benefits]] made by a manager are also approved by the manager's manager.

==Responsibility/authorisation==

Examples of the principle's use related to responsibility and authorisation:

* A case of uncertainty about personal responsibility or authorisation should be cleared by the immediate manager in conjunction with the manager's manager.

==Flaws/corruption==

Examples of the principle's use to limit organisational corruption:

* An individual who identifies corruptive order within the organization hierarchical structure related to his/hers own manager is advised to contact the manager's manager concerning the matter. 
* An individual who identifies corruptive order within the organization hierarchical structure can bring up the matter before a manager at ANY hierarchical level within the organization. The "ANY" is related to where the corruptive part is located hierarchically and the immediate manager above that level, is the preferred manager to be addressed. The manager, acting Grandfather of the organization as entity, should treat the individual, acting Father and guard of the organization as entity, with a mutual respect related to the authority of the hierarchical level addressed, the importance of the subject being addressed and the courage undertaken to surface the subject in matter.

The '''International Association for Accounting Education &amp; Research''' (IAAER) is a non-profit organization that promotes excellence in accounting education and [[accounting research|research]]. The organization also seeks to ensure that accounting academics make the maximum contribution to development of excellent accounting standards.&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;

==Foundation==

The origins of the IAAER can be traced back to meetings of the International Congresses on Accounting that started in 1904. The [[International Federation of Accountants]] began holding separate International Conferences on Accounting Education in 1962. IAAER was founded in 1984 to serve as a co-host with the Japanese Accounting Association for the sixth of these conferences, which was scheduled to be held in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]] in 1987. 
Its organization was defined at a meeting in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] on 17 August 1984, with representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Membership==

IAAER offers institutional, university, individual, and student memberships.  
As of 2009, IAAER had about 50 institutional members, including professional accounting bodies such as the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] and accounting academic organizations such as the [[American Accounting Association]].
In 2009, IAAER announced that all members would have access to eIFRS, an online repository of material about [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=IAAER Announces Free eIFRS Access for Academic Members 
 |publisher=Deloitte Global Services Limited
 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

IAAER contributes to international accounting and auditing standards through relationships with various international bodies, bringing a research-based academic viewpoint. Specifically, IAAER is represented on the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), the Education Advisory Group of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation and the Standards Advisory Council of the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;
 
IAAER commissions research projects to develop improvements to international accounting and educational standards, and promotes development of accounting skills by working with local and regional bodies and organizing conferences and workshops.&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;
For example, in 2006 IAAER and [[KPMG]] invited research proposals under the Defining, Recognizing and Measuring Liabilities Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Canadian Academic Accounting Association
 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2007, IAAER and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) announced that they were providing up to five research grants of up to $25,000, funded by ACCA, to support the work of the IAESB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=ACCA AND IAAER LAUNCH INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RESEARCH CALL
 |date=7 Nov 2007
 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2010 IAAER and ACCA again issued a call for proposals for research supporting development of international standards of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAAER sponsors and coordinates the World Congress of Accounting Educators and Researchers, which is held every four years in conjunction with IFAC World Congress. IAAER issues the COSMOS Accountancy Chronicle, a newsletter, supports the ''[[Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting]]'' and ''Accounting and Accounting Education: An International Journal'', the official journals of the organization.&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;

[[File:Jack thinker.jpg|thumb|Jack Sim pictured as if thinking on a toilet - to raise attention for the importance of [[toilets]].]]
'''Jack Sim''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|沈|锐|华}}|t={{linktext|沈|銳|華}}|p=Shěn Ruìhuá}}) is the founder of the [[Restroom Association]] of Singapore, the [[World Toilet Organization]], the [[World Toilet Day]] initiative and [[Bottom of the Pyramid]] (BoP) Hub.  Formerly from the [[construction industry]], he decided to devote the rest of his life to social work after attaining financial independence at the age of 40.

In 2001, for "creating good will and bringing the subject into the open" and "mobilizing national support in providing on-the-ground expertise" he received the [[Schwab Foundation]] award for Social Entrepreneur of the Year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schwabfound.org/content/jack-sim|title=Jack Sim {{!}} Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship|website=www.schwabfound.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301120549/http://www.schwabfound.org/content/jack-sim|archive-date=1 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Jack was elected a Fellow of [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public]], and also became one of the key members to convene the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] which is composed of key players in the [[sanitation]] space.

Jack was named one of the [[Heroes of the Environment (2008)|Heroes of the Environment]] for 2008 by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1841778_1841781_1841822,00.html|title=Jack Sim|last=Beech|first=Hannah|work=Time|accessdate=31 October 2009|date=24 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501144846/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1841778_1841781_1841822,00.html|archive-date=1 May 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also founded the BOP HUB and a series of social businesses and startups. He is now constructing a 65,000 sq ft World Trade Center for the Poor in Singapore to coordinate and transform the 4 billions poor into a massively efficient marketplace to end global poverty.

== Achievements in sanitation ==

=== Restroom Association ===
He established the [[Restroom Association]] of Singapore (RAS) in 1998, which addresses the state of dirty public toilets in designs, building codes and poorly trained cleaners.

=== World Toilet Organization ===
{{Main article|World Toilet Organization}}

Realising the need for a global body on the subject, Jack created the [[World Toilet Organization]] (WTO) in 2001 as a global network and service platform for toilet associations, academia, government, UN agencies and toilet stakeholders to learn from one another and leverage media and corporate support that in turn influenced governments to promote sound sanitation and public health policies.

Since its inception, WTO organized 17 [[World Toilet Organization#World Toilet Summit|World Toilet Summits]] and two World Toilet Expo and Forum straddling Singapore, Seoul, Taipei, Beijing, Belfast, Moscow, New Delhi, Macau, Shanghai, Bangkok, Philadelphia, Durban (South Africa), Hainan China, Solo Indonesia, Kuching Malaysia, Melbourne, Mumbai . 

It supports Prime Minister Modi's Swachh Bharat Mission in implementing 110 millions toilets in India and President Xi China Toilet Revolution in Tourism Toilets and Rural Toilets. WTO also build 13 blocks of Rainbow Schools Toilets in rural China.

=== World Toilet Day ===
{{Main article|World Toilet Day}}
World Toilet Organization declared its founding day 19 November in 2001, as [[World Toilet Day]] and this is now celebrated worldwide each year towards improving the state of toilets and sanitation globally. In 2013, all 193 countries of the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted 19 November as the official UN World Toilet Day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4669">'''James Hamilton''' (1769–1829) was an Irish language teacher, who introduced the "Hamiltonian system" of teaching languages.

==Life==
Hamilton was taught for four years at a [[Dublin]] school run by two [[Jesuits]], Beatty and Mulhall. He went into business, and for about three years before the [[French Revolution]] was living in France.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hamilton, James (1769-1829)|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798 Hamilton was established as a merchant in [[Hamburg]], and went for instruction in German to General D'Angeli, a French émigré. D'Angeli, without using a grammar book, translated to him word for word a German book of anecdotes, parsing as he proceeded; and after about twelve lessons Hamilton found that he could read some German books. Beatty and Mulhall had had a somewhat similar system.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Moving to Paris Hamilton with the banking-house of Karcher &amp; Co., did business with England at the time of the [[Peace of Amiens]]. At the end of the Pace in 1803 he was detained, and his business was ruined.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Hamilton went to New York in October 1815, with the idea of becoming a farmer and manufacturing [[potash]]. He changed his mind, and began to teach languages. His method started with a word-for-word translation, and left instruction in grammar till a later stage. His first pupils were three ministers and Judge [[William P. Van Ness]] of the District Court; he charged a dollar a lesson, and taught pupils to read French in 24 lessons of four hours each.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In September 1816 Hamilton went to [[Philadelphia]], and gave a lecture on the "Hamiltonian System". In 1817 he moved on to [[Baltimore]], his wife and daughters teaching with him. The professors at Baltimore College ridiculed him in a play, ''The New Mode of Teaching'', acted by their pupils. Hamilton went to the play, and three days later published it in a newspaper, with his own comments. He claimed a Hamiltonian school at Baltimore, with more than 160 pupils and 20 teachers. Bad health and money troubles meant he went on to Washington.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

At Boston, Hamilton could only obtain four pupils. A professor at [[Boston University]] attacked him as a charlatan, but a committee examined his pupils, and he soon had 200. He taught also at colleges in Schenectady, Princeton, Yale, Hartford, and Middleburg.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1822 Hamilton went to [[Montreal]], and then to [[Quebec]]. At Montreal he instructed a gaoler, and then successfully taught reading to eight English prisoners there. He left America in July 1823, and came to London, where in eighteen months he had more than 600 pupils learning different languages, and seven teachers. He left his school to the teachers, and afterwards taught his system in Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh, Dublin, Belfast, and at least other places. In London he taught at his house, No. 25 Cecil Street, [[Strand, London|Strand]], and then in [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

As an experiment over six months in 1825 saw ten school boys live in Hamilton's house. At the end of the period they were examined in Latin translation, French and Italian. The expenses of this experiment were partly borne by John Smith, M.P. Hamilton's system and extensive advertising were attacked by school-masters and others. A defence by [[Sydney Smith]] appeared in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' for June 1826. The Hamiltonian system was also defended in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Hamilton died in Dublin on 16 September 1829, in his sixtieth year.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Jul. Cesar Commentarii De Bello Gallico Liber Primus.jpg|thumb|Hamiltonian system, interlinear Swedish text for ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'']]
In Philadelphia Hamilton printed his first reading-book, chapters i–iii. of St. John's Gospel, in French, with an interlinear translation. Further books with literal and interlinear English translations published by Hamilton, and mostly of gospels and classics, appeared in [[Ancient Greek]], Latin including [[Charles François Lhomond]]'s ''Epitome Historiæ Sacræ'', French including [[Jean Baptiste Perrin (fl. 1786)|Jean Baptiste Perrin]]'s ''Fables'', German including [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]]'s ''Robinson Crusoe'', and Italian. In time unauthorised books appeared, professing to be adapted to his system.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Japanese used vehicle exporting''' is a [[Grey import vehicle|grey market]] [[international trade]] involving the [[export]] of [[used car]]s and other vehicles from Japan to other markets around the world since the 1980s.

Despite the high cost of transport, the sale of used cars and other vehicles to other countries is still profitable due to the relatively low cost and good condition of the vehicles being purchased. Contributing factors to the feasibility of such export include Japan's strict [[Motor-vehicle inspection (Japan)|motor-vehicle inspections]] and high [[depreciation]] which make such vehicles worth very little in Japan after six years, and strict environmental-protection regulations that make vehicle disposal very expensive in Japan. Japan has very stringent [[Emission standard#Japan|vehicle emission test standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/koizumispeech/2003/03/28yosan_e.html |title=Opening Statement by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at the Press Conference on the Passage of the FY2003 Budget |accessdate=2008-10-14 |date=2003-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 1.4 million used vehicles were exported from Japan in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The most popular destinations for used cars from Japan are [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[New Zealand]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Kenya]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Hong Kong]] and (until recently) [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]]. Additionally, [[Chile]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] are used as popular transit hubs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Overview==

===Supply of used cars===
In Japan, used cars are mainly sold at [[auto auction]]s by car owners and dealers. At auto auctions, owners are hidden from bidders while the auctioneers provide independent car evaluations called inspection sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japan-used-car-exporting.info/import/inspection-sheets.html |title=Japanese Used Car Exporting - Inspection Sheets|publisher=Japan-used-car-exporting.info |date= |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exporters, acting as bidding agents for importers, use the auto auctions as their main supply.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There are over 200 auto auction groups operating throughout Japan including JAA, JU Group, TAA, USS, and ZIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japan-used-car-exporting.info/import/auto-auctions-in-japan.html |title=Japanese Used Car Exporting - Auto Auctions in Japan |publisher=Japan-used-car-exporting.info |date= |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides auto auctions, Japanese exports have access to vehicles from [[Dealerships#Japan|dealerships]] and private sellers.

===Exporting methods===
Vehicles which will be exported from Japan must be prepared before shipping. This includes de-registering the vehicle with the government, getting an export certificate, and cleaning the car to remove [[biosecurity]] risks. Car cleaning is especially necessary for the [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] (AQIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/vehicles-machinery/motor-vehicles |title=Importing Motor Vehicles |publisher=DAFF |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2011-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331193523/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/vehicles-machinery/motor-vehicles |archivedate=2011-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand's [[Ministry of Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/commercial-imports/other-imports/introduction Other Imports | MPI Biosecurity New Zealand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221113451/http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/commercial-imports/other-imports/introduction |date=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; agencies' clearances.

Exporters can ship the car that is ready by [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] or [[Containerization|container]] according to customer specification, ship schedules, and the capabilities of the destination port.

===Market differences===
The suitability of Japan's domestically sold cars for export to other countries is constrained by various factors. Vehicles in Japan have [[Right- and left-hand traffic|right-hand drive]]—the driver's seat is on the right side of the vehicle—in accord with Japan's left-hand traffic. Some countries with right-hand traffic permit right-hand drive vehicles, though [[Headlamp#Compatibility with traffic directionality|right-traffic headlamps]] are generally unavailable for models exclusive to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;''Considerations for Approval of Lighting Equipment on Vehicles Imported to Canada'', Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy, 2006, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries with right traffic do not allow right-hand drive cars, but in some such markets the extensive labor required to convert a car to left-hand drive is economically feasible; such conversions are sometimes done by the local importers. The Philippines is an example of a market where such conversion is common, until recently, when the importation of such used vehicles (except for heavy vehicles) was banned by E0 156.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com.ph/news/lto-customs-to-strictly-enforce-eo-156-ban-on-surplus-cars|title=LTO, Customs to strictly enforce EO 156 ban on 'surplus cars'|date=15 February 2013|work=Top Gear Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's [[automobile safety]] regulations also differ substantially from the [[ECE Regulations]] used throughout most of the world and the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|North American regulations]] that apply in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivoac.ca/docs/IVOACPerspective.pdf Perspective on Proposed Changes to Vehicle Import Regulations in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicle components such as [[Tempered glass#Uses|windows]] and [[windshield]]s, [[seat belt]]s, [[Automotive lighting|lamps and reflectors]], and [[Wing mirror|mirrors]], as well as design features for [[crashworthiness]] such as [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]], fuel tanks, and structural rigidity of vehicles meant for the Japanese market may not comply with non-Japanese standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanoid.com/stop25.php Stop the 25-year rule]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="15yadr1"&gt;[http://autospeed.com/cms/title_15yo-ADRing-Part-One/A_2306/article.html 15yo ADR-ing — Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://autospeed.com/cms/title_15yo-ADRing-Part-Two/A_2307/article.html 15yo ADR-ing — Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; They often lack structural reinforcements needed to meet side-impact crashworthiness standards in effect outside Japan.&lt;ref name="15yadr1"/&gt; Moreover, entire categories of vehicle, such as [[Kei car]]s, do not exist in regulations outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html ''63 FR 33913'' U.S. Department of Transportation Final Rule]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/4255883 Can America Find True Happiness in a Microcar?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibilities===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
Generally, most exporters are responsible for the organization and completion of the vehicle's transportation until it arrives at the importer's Port of Destination (POD). At the POD, possession of the vehicle, and the responsibility of possession, is laid on the importer. ''Financial responsibility'', on the other hand, is transferred when ownership is handed over. Ownership is switched after the car has been purchased and before being exported. In the case of damage or losses occurring during shipping, the buyer is the one bears all financial loss.

===Car export companies verification===
Whilst the majority of websites in Japan are of genuine business companies, there are [http://www.japancompanytrust.org/complaints/] scams and fraud in Japan. Foreign importers must verify each company, and transfer money only when transactions are satisfactorily completed. Verification of Japanese companies under the Japan Company Trust Organization can be helpful.

==To specific countries==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}

===Canada===
Any vehicle more than 15 years old may be imported into Canada without regard to its compliance with Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Vehicles are registered at the provincial level in Canada, and increasingly stringent sub-national vehicle safety requirements make it difficult to register a Japanese-market vehicle without replacement or modifications to the [[headlamp]]s and [[Automotive lighting|other lights and reflectors]], window glass, tires, seatbelts and other equipment.

===Chile===
In Chile, second hand imported vehicles may only be registered in the extreme regions of [[Arica and Parinacota Region|Arica and Parinacota]], [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]], [[Aisén Region|Aisén]] and [[Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes]]. Japanese used vehicles must meet emission standards and be converted to [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left hand drive]]. However, a big market of non converted cars exists in the duty-free zone of [[Iquique]], where customers from other countries buy them and sometimes drive them home.

===Hong Kong===

[[File:Toyota bB Front side view.jpg|thumb|2002 [[Toyota bB]], Japan Domestic version, exported and registered in Hong Kong.]]

There are quite a lot of used cars from Japan registered in [[Hong Kong]], including both Japanese makes and even European makes, since both Hong Kong and Japan are right hand drive. In order to register the car in Hong Kong, the car must be less than 7 years old, [[gasoline]] powered, meets [[Euro V]] emission and noise standard, with E-mark for all glass and safety belts,  and [[Unleaded gasoline|unleaded-fuel]] restrictor installed. For cars over 20 years old, they can be imported as classic cars and need not meet Euro V emission standard. In addition, Hong Kong does not accept privacy windows. If a Japanese used car is fitted with privacy windows, it must be converted to clear glass in order to register in Hong Kong.

===Ireland===
[[File:Greystones, Co Wicklow - Ireland (4572649828).jpg|thumb|[[Toyota WiLL]] in [[Dublin]]]]
[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has relatively loose vehicle importing laws for Japanese cars. To keep imports down, Irish Revenue Commissioners require all new and imported cars to pay the [[vehicle registration tax (Ireland)|VRT]]. Also, every car, both domestic and imported over four years old must pass the stringent [[National Car Test]] (NCT) in order to be given a road worthiness certificate. In the case of cars imported from Japan, all glass, tyres, noise, must meet EU approved levels.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, second-hand imported Japanese vehicles must undergo a worthiness inspection conducted by the Japan Export Vehicle Inspection Center as per mandate from the Kenya Bureau of Standards. The inspection aims to ensure that the vehicles are not more than 8 years old, are right hand drive, have genuine mileage and that the vehicles pass a safety &amp; mechanical inspection similar to the Japanese periodic inspection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.carfromjapan.com/hc/en-us/articles/203105279--Import-Regulations-Kenya- Import Regulations (Kenya)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macau ===
Although [[Macau]] is right hand drive, it does not allow imports of used car from Japan or any other country, unlike Hong Kong. However, brand new parallel imported cars from Japan are allowed in Macau.

===Malta===
[[File:MHV Toyota Ist 2005 01.jpg|thumb|[[Toyota ist]], registered in Malta]]
In Malta, second-hand imported Japanese vehicles must comply with Road Worthiness regulations which address Emissions, Lights Operability &amp; Mechanical Operability. Vehicles thus in compliance can be imported and registered. Some Maltese importers apply corrosion protection to these vehicles due to the hot, humid climate.

===New Zealand===
[[File:2001 Nissan March Bolero (7159199865).jpg|thumb|Nissan March Bolero, imported to New Zealand]]
New Zealand has stringent safety and emission standards. Besides [[biosecurity]] and customs clearances, a vehicle must be Entry Certified by a Transport Services Delivery Agent (TSDA) which includes checking that paper data and physical data meet safety, emissions, and fuel consumption standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://aretcars.com/export-import-regulations/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
[[Pakistan]] applies strict controls on imports. Imported cars must be not more than 3 years old. High import taxes are levied on imported vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakmission-uk.gov.pk/commsection/downloads/import_of_vehicles_090904.pdf ''Import of Vehicles''], High Commission for Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; Special ships are sometimes used for exporting vehicles to Pakistan to meet the rising demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_7-8-2005_pg5_13 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |publisher=Daily Times |date=2005-08-07 |accessdate=2011-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607033034/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_7-8-2005_pg5_13 |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
While Russia has [[right hand traffic]], it allows the importation of LHT vehicles if they pass the technical inspection. This is compulsory for all street-legal vehicles in Russia. Although a prohibitively high import tariff is levied on cars more than 7 years old, to protect local industry, the oldest Japanese vehicles usually pass the inspection, if they were well maintained. Vehicles imported to Russia are sometimes exported to [[North Korea]] and [[Central Asia]].

===United Kingdom===
Importing rules for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] are stringent. All vehicles must undergo Individual Vehicle Approval to assure compliance with applicable [[ECE Regulations]] or British national equivalents. The [[speedometer]] must be converted from kilometres per hour to miles per hour, a [[Automotive lighting|rear fog light]] and [[Unleaded gasoline|unleaded-fuel]] restrictor installed.

===United States===
Vehicles at least 25 years old may be imported to the US regardless of non-compliance with that country's [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/FAQ%20Site/pages/page2.html#Anchor-28852&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles are registered at the state level in the US, and increasingly stringent sub-national vehicle safety requirements make it difficult to register a Japanese-market vehicle without replacement or modifications to the [[headlamp]]s and [[Automotive lighting|other lights and reflectors]], window glass, tires, seatbelts and other equipment.

'''Charles-Léon Metz''' (1 November 1842 – 25 June 1928)&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Luxembourg]]ish politician and industrialist.  He was a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] for forty-three years (1875–1918), and served as [[Mayor of Esch-sur-Alzette]] from 1906 to 1909.

The son of [[Auguste Metz]] and Petronille Laeis, he was a member of the prominent [[Metz family]], and he entered the family business of metallurgy.  He was first elected to the [[Esch-sur-Alzette communal council|communal council]] of [[Esch-sur-Alzette]] in 1873, and served for four years before becoming an ''[[Échevin (Luxembourg)|échevin]]'' on 16 January 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also elected to the national [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] as a liberal on 14 October 1875, representing [[Esch-sur-Alzette (canton)|Esch-sur-Alzette]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a liberal, he was a traditionalist, a practising [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], and had close ties to the religious establishment in Esch.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

Metz was named Mayor of Esch on 22 October 1906, which was renewed on 28 December 1908.  During his tenure as mayor, the most important decision was the [[Communes of Luxembourg|commune]]'s purchase of the Forest of Esch, and its replacement with new steel mills, in the district of [[Belval, Luxembourg|Belval]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Metz won re-election in the [[Luxembourgian communal elections, 1909|1909 communal elections]], he decided to resign on 28 November 1909, having served three years as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

Metz lost in his bid to be reelected to the Chamber of Deputies in the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1918|1918 election]],&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; and withdrew from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;  He died on 25 June 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorations==
Metz was awarded a number of decorations:&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

* Commander, [[Order of the Oak Crown]] (Luxembourg)
* Commander, [[Order of Adolphe of Nassau]] (Luxembourg)

'''Manuel Salvat Dalmau''' (October 4, 1925 in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalunya]] &amp;ndash; September 11, 2012) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[publisher]]. From a family of important publishing tradition, he directed the [[Editorial Salvat]] and served as President of the [[International Publishers Association]].

== Private life==
Son of [[Santiago Salvat Espasa]] and Rosa Dalmau Vilá and grandson of [[Manuel Salvat Xivixell]]. He studied in the [[Colegio Sant Ignasi - Sarrià]] of [[Barcelona]] where he was acknowledged as a brilliant student. Graduated with a degree in [[Law]] from the [[Universidad de Barcelona]] and a degree in [[Business Management]] from [[IESE Business School]]. He was married to Blanca Vilá Reyes and had six sons and one daughter. He was also the joint co-founder of the [[Escuela Patmos]] of [[Barcelona]] in 1958 with five other couples (the Amor Sagués, Tornos, Poblet, Puche, Comas, and  Latorre,) Priest [[Joan Alemany I Esteve]], and writer and pedagogue [[Emili Teixidor]].&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;Escola Patmos i Emili Teixidor (in Catalan), {{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0065418 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119010201/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0065418 |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional life ==

=== Editorial Salvat ===
Manuel Salvat Dalmau joined the family business, Salvat Editores S.A. (the publishing company known as [[Editorial Salvat]]), in the late 1940s, becoming manager, together with his brothers Santiago and Juan. The company was then leading the Spanish American market in [[dictionaries]] and medical works. From that position it developed an important change in the Spanish publishing sector by intensifying the sales of [[encyclopedias]] through fascicles. The Salvat Group associated with the Boroli family, owner of ''De Agostini'',&lt;ref name="gec"&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0058370 La Editorial Salvat] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121209063740/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0058370 |date=2012-12-09 }}, en la [[Enciclopedia Catalana]] (in Catalan).&lt;/ref&gt; which had initiated the sale through fascicles in [[Italy]]. For that purpose, they created a new distribution company, ''Marco Ibérica S.A.'' (MIDESA),&lt;ref name="gec"/&gt; reaching 22 thousand kiosks weekly, resulting in unprecedented success in 1965 with the ''Enciclopedia Monitor'',&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;Editorial Salvat, [http://www.salvat.com/paginas/informacion_corporativa.asp Información corporativa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922030007/http://www.salvat.com/paginas/informacion_corporativa.asp |date=2012-09-22 }} (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt; of which more than 300 thousand complete collections were sold.

Other outstanding achievements while he directed the publishing company were: [[Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente]]'s ''Enciclopedia de la Fauna'',&lt;ref name="gec"/&gt; with over 200 thousand sold copies and the paperback collection ''RTV'', of which the first edition in 1969 sold over a million copies. The [[Editorial Salvat]] created over 50 [[encyclopedias]], being also pioneer in incorporating CDs and cassettes in diverse works. In [[France]] it obtained a very important market quota.&lt;ref name="gec"/&gt; In [[Latin America]] it specialized in the sales of [[encyclopedias]] with notable success.

Manuel Salvat's trajectory led him to become President of the [[International Publishers Association]] (IPA) from 1980 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Salvat elegido Presidente de la UIE, [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1979/10/21/pagina-44/33440753/pdf.html?search=manuel%20salvat] (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s the Salvat Group was purchased by the French multinational [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]].&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

=== Matesa Affair ===
Manuel Salvat Dalmau was the second-most [[shareholder]] of one of his family-in-law's companies, ''Matesa'' (Maquinaria Textil del Norte de España S.A.). When the scandal broke out in 1969, he was required to pay the guaranteed part of the official [[export]] [[credit]]s that the company had arranged between 1963 and 1969. His brother-in-law and major shareholder (Juan Vilá Reyes) was condemned of swindling as he benefited from loans and export tax exemptions by falsifying sales contracts. The [[conviction]] was upheld by the Spanish [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="not"&gt;Ratificación Sentencia Matesa, [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1976/02/12/pagina-10/33780033/pdf.html] (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Salvat had secured these [[credit]]s without having knowledge of doing so because his brother-in-law had signed them, using his name fraudulently. Even though he was not charged in the ''Matesa Affair'', Manuel Salvat took care of the [[debt]] with the ''Liquidation of Export Credit Commission'' (Spanish [[Minister of Economy and Finance (Spain)|Ministry of Finance]],&lt;ref name="case"&gt;Matesa Case, [http://elpais.com/diario/1983/01/19/economia/411778806_850215.html](in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;) which allowed him to carry on with his [[publishing]] tasks.

'''Mohammed Hussein Ali Al-'Amoudi''' ({{lang-am|ሞሐመድ አልዐሙዲ}}, {{lang-ar|محمد حسين علي العمودي}}) is an Ethiopian and Saudi Arabian [[billionaire]] businessman. He was born in Ethiopia in 1946 to a Yemeni father and an Ethiopian mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/mohammed-al-amoudi/|title=Mohammed Al Amoudi|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, his net worth was estimated by ''[[Forbes]]'' at approximately $10.9 billion and a relative fall in net value was linked to the global fall in oil and gold prices at the time of estimation.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; He was also listed as Ethiopia's richest man, the second richest Saudi Arabian citizen in the world and the second richest black person in the world.&lt;ref name="mfonobong2013-03"&gt;{{cite web | first=Mfonobong | last=Nsehe | title=The Black Billionaires 2013 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2013/03/05/the-black-billionaires-2013/ | work=[[Forbes]] | date=5 March 2013 | accessdate=24 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Amoudi made his fortune in construction and [[real estate]] before branching out to buy [[oil refineries]] in Sweden and Morocco. He is the largest individual foreign investor in Ethiopia and a major investor in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Business activities==
Al Amoudi owns a broad portfolio of businesses in construction, energy, agriculture, mining, hotels, healthcare and manufacturing amongst others. His businesses are largely to be found within two [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[holding company|holding]] and operating companies, [[Corral Petroleum Holdings]] and [[MIDROC]], both which he owns and manages. He employs over 70,000 people through these companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info |title=Home - Sheikh Al Amoudi &amp;#124; Authorized &amp; Official |publisher=Sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi's construction company consortium, ''Mohammed International Development Research and Organization Companies'', also known as MIDROC, won a contract to build Saudi Arabia's estimated $30 billion nationwide [[underground oil storage]] complex in 1988. MIDROC acquired Yanbu Steel in Saudi Arabia in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bus-ex.com/article/yanbu-steel-company |title=Yanbu Steel Company &amp;#124; Business Excellence Magazine |publisher=Bus-ex.com |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his business interests in Ethiopia, he also owns oil refineries in [[Morocco]] and [[Sweden]] ([[Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB]]) and is engaged in [[energy exploration]] and production off West Africa and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr-inside.com/new-market-report-svenska-petroleum-exploration-r2542679.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614091935/http://www.pr-inside.com/new-market-report-svenska-petroleum-exploration-r2542679.htm|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Addis Ababa]] [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] is said to be among the finest hotels in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/mohammed-al-amoudi |title=Mohammed Al Amoudi |publisher=Forbes |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has recently pledged US$275 million alongside other Saudi and South Korean investors through MIDROC to finance a factory to build Saudi Arabia's first car, to be called [[KSU Gazal-1|Gazal-1]], in a project initiated by [[King Saud University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4774278|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230233319/http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4774278|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-30|title=KSU mobilizes $500 million for new car company|date=2010-12-30|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-29/midroc-to-get-55-of-saudi-car-plant-for-275-million-spa-says.html |title=Midroc to Get 55% of Saudi Car Plant for $275 Million, SPA Says - Bloomberg Business |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in September 2011, it was announced that he planned to invest around US$1.07bn (4bn Saudi Riyals) in two major Saudi industrial projects (phosphate derivatives and sulfur) in [[Ras Al Khair]] [Eastern Region] and [[Jubail Industrial City]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZW20110929000084]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopian investments===
Al Amoudi has invested in Ethiopia since the mid-1980s. He now has business interests there, largely operated through MIDROC Ethiopia which was created in 1994. In 2011 it made 1.4bn birr (US$70m) of profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2merkato.com/20111014451/midroc-ethiopia-announces-13-billion-birr-profit |title=Ethiopia Earns $71.1 Million From Leather Exports |publisher=2merkato.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural resources ===

He owns 70% of [[National Oil Ethiopia]], which competes with [[Yetebaberut Beherawi Petroleum|YBF]], [[TAF OIL]] and five other companies in the national petrol market&lt;ref&gt;[http://addisfortune.com/TAF%20Joins%20Tough%20Competition%20in%20Oil%20Market.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is establishing a steel plant (Tossa) in [[Amhara Region|Amhara]]. This latter is Ethiopia’s first industrial steel production plant and in intended to meet a major increase in domestic demand, estimated to rise from 1.2m tonnes to 3.1m tonnes per annum between 2011 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://addisfortune.com/Bidding%20for%201.3m%20tones%20Steel%20Factory%20Sees%20Nine%20Interest.htm |accessdate=27 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103195730/http://www.addisfortune.com/Bidding%20for%201.3m%20tones%20Steel%20Factory%20Sees%20Nine%20Interest.htm |archivedate=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Al Amoudi acquired 69% of Ethiopia’s sole tyre manufacturer [[Addis Tyre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://addisfortune.com/Al-Amoudi%E2%80%99s%20Horizon%20Acquires%20Matador-ATC%E2%80%99s%2069pc%20for%20$18m.htm |accessdate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211104613/http://www.addisfortune.com/Al-Amoudi%E2%80%99s%20Horizon%20Acquires%20Matador-ATC%E2%80%99s%2069pc%20for%20%2418m.htm |archivedate=11 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has a substantial investment in cement production through [[Durba]] Midroc which was founded in 2008.&lt;ref name="addisfortune1"&gt;[http://addisfortune.com/EEPCo%20Grants%20Cement%20Factory%20Own%20Power%20Station.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major cement plant near Chancho was backed in part by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-20/ethiopian-cement-plants-to-double-capacity-amid-construction-industry-boom.html |title=Ethiopian Cement Plants to Double Capacity Amid Building Boom - Bloomberg Business |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.addisfortune.com/Derba%20Midroc%20Wants%2050MW%20for%20Factory.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521045939/http://www.addisfortune.com/Derba%20Midroc%20Wants%2050MW%20for%20Factory.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-05-21|title=Derba Midroc Wants 50MW for Factory|date=2011-05-21|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, it was announced that the Ethiopian Electric Power Company [EEPco] would provide the Derba cement plant with 50MW of electricity.&lt;ref name="addisfortune1"/&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
The Al Amoudi-owned ''Saudi Star Agricultural Development'' Plc plans to [[Land development|develop]] up to {{convert|500000|ha|acre}} of Ethiopian land for sugar, [[edible oil]], and grain production.&lt;ref name="sheikhmohammedalamoudi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info/backgrounders/saudi-star-agribusiness|title=Official Web Site: Saudi Star Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Saudi Star announced a further investment of $2.5 billion in Ethiopian rice projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011032496586 |title=Al-Amoudi to invest $2.5b in Ethiopia farm &amp;#124; Business |publisher=Saudi Gazette |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003183339/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011032496586 |archivedate=3 October 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 10,000 hectares have been taken up in 60-year leases and the company plans to rent an additional 290,000 hectares.&lt;ref name="sheikhmohammedalamoudi2"/&gt; The company had reportedly purchased $80 million in equipment from [[Caterpillar Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLure |first=Jason |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aIFZN6VBgYR4 |title=Saudi Billionaire Invests in Ethiopian Farms, Fortune Reports |publisher=Bloomberg |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, President [[Girma Wolde-Giorgis]] of Ethiopia stated that “a substantial investment in agricultural development was key to improving the quality of life across Africa” and that Saudi Star’s investment programme would benefit both Ethiopia and its important trading partner, Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article481429.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802000556/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article481429.ece|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-02|title=Ethiopia pledges to work closely with the Kingdom in manpower sector - Arab News|date=2011-08-02|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi also owns [[coffee plantation|land used to produce coffee]]. Of the {{convert|2295|ha|acre}} of land acquired by Ethio Agri-CEFT (which he owns) in the [[Sheka Zone]] of Ethiopia, it has only covered 1,010 hectares with coffee and shade trees, with the rest remaining as natural vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newbusinessethiopia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=536:ethiopias-challenge-balancing-agriculture-with-environmental-protection-&amp;catid=28:enviroment&amp;Itemid=51|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016051551/http://newbusinessethiopia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=536:ethiopias-challenge-balancing-agriculture-with-environmental-protection-&amp;catid=28:enviroment&amp;Itemid=51|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-10-16|title=Ethiopia’s Challenge: Balancing Agriculture with Environmental Protection {{!}} NewBusinessEthiopia|date=2011-10-16|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he donated 10 million birr (US$500k) to the proposed Ethiopian National Coffee Museum in Ethiopia’s Kaffa Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waltainfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25334&amp;Itemid=134|title=Walta Information Center|website=www.waltainfo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, in response to an appeal from Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] for popular support for the financing of the [[Renaissance Dam]] in North West Ethiopia which will triple the country’s hydro-electric power, Al Amoudi pledged a donation of 1.5bn birr (around US$88m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsdire.com/news/2124-ethiopia-al-amoudi-pledges-15-billion-br-for-renaissance-dam.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927231547/http://www.newsdire.com/news/2124-ethiopia-al-amoudi-pledges-15-billion-br-for-renaissance-dam.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-27|title=Ethiopia: Al-Amoudi pledges 1.5 Billion Br. for Renaissance dam » Ethiopian News - Everything that Happens!|date=2011-09-27|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Amoudi has not been seen since his abduction and detention, and it is feared that he is being tortured to force him to transfer his wealth to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. It is also possible that he could have been murdered. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had tried to secure his release, but was unsuccessful.

==Philanthropy==
Al Amoudi has committed funds to support healthcare and sport in Saudi Arabia, the US, Europe and Africa.&lt;ref name="sheikhmohammedalamoudi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info/ |title=Official Web Site - Sheikh Al Amoudi &amp;#124; Authorized &amp; Official |publisher=Sheikhmohammedalamoudi.info |date= |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/speaker/3145|title=Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi|publisher=Economist Insights |date= |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He funded a [[breast cancer]] research centre at [[King Abdulaziz University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616061137/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-06-16|title=Arab News Newspaper|date=2012-06-16|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Al Amoudi funded King Saud University’s an [[enhanced oil recovery]] research chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enews.ksu.edu.sa/2011/06/29/alamoudi-chair-enhanced-oil-recovery/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323025053/http://enews.ksu.edu.sa/2011/06/29/alamoudi-chair-enhanced-oil-recovery/|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also fully funded the King Abdullah Institute for Nanotechnology at [[King Saud University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130210100817/http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20101213035404/1st%20nanotechnology%20institute%20in%20KSA%20to%20be%20launched%20on%2011-11-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi was named as one of the [[William J. Clinton Foundation]] Donors, according to information released as part of an obligation placed on former [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] when he supported [[Hillary Clinton]]'s nomination as Secretary of State. He is reported to have donated between US$5m and US$10m to the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apple.news/AaeO83PbKNCSae41afdwmKA |title=Fact-checking donations to the Clinton foundation |publisher=PolitiFact.com |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate=12 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510154417/https://apple.news/AaeO83PbKNCSae41afdwmKA |archive-date=10 May 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi sponsored the [[CECAFA Cup]], Africa's oldest football cup competition, in 2005 and 2006, the tournament was named the Al Amoudi Senior Challenge Cup as a result in those years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201009061000.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909174814/http://allafrica.com/stories/201009061000.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-09-09|title=allAfrica.com: Rwanda: Challenge Cup Preps on Course - Musonye|date=2010-09-09|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supports Ethiopian Premier League Club [[Saint George S.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Markos Berhanu |url=http://www.ethiosports.com/2010/11/29/ethiopia-football-can-giuseppe-dossena-end-saint-george%e2%80%99s-misery |title=Ethiopia Football: Can Giuseppe Dossena end Saint George’s Misery? |publisher=Ethiosports |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered the medical expenses of one of Ethiopia’s most celebrated footballers, [[Mengistu Worku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Solomon Amare |url=http://www.ethiosports.com/2010/12/08/ethiopia-football-legendary-player-coach-mengistu-worku-returns-home |title=Ethiopia Football: Legendary Player &amp; Coach Mengistu Worku returns home |publisher=Ethiosports |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before his death in December 2010.

==Defamation actions==
In December 2010 Al Amoudi initiated a claim in the English [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] against [[Elias Kifle]] of the Washington, D.C.-based ''[[Ethiopian Review]]'' claiming damages for [[libel]]. In July 2011 Kifle was ordered to pay £175,000 in damages for publishing false information.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14345007 | work=BBC News | title=Ethiopian billionaire wins libel action in UK | date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ethiopian Review'' had also repeated unwarranted material relating to his family and to matters previously dealt with in the ''Al Amoudi v. Brisard'' case of 2005. M. Brisard had made serious and unwarranted allegations concerning engagement in the funding of terrorism in the wake of 9/11 but had subsequently apologised for the accusation. The judge found the statements to be untrue and stated that Al Amoudi "is implacably opposed to terrorism in all its forms”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-7002 |title=Count the readers before suing for internet libel |publisher=Out-law.com |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and recognition==
Al Amoudi has been ranked among the 100 richest people by ''[[Forbes]]'' since 2006, being ranking 82nd on the list in 2015.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; He was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Addis Ababa University]] and has been honoured with the [[Order of the Polar Star]] by [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|King Carl XVI Gustaf]] of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summitreports.com/pdfs/yemen.pdf |format=PDF |title=Yemen : Moving Forward With Optimism |publisher=Summitreports.com |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Amoudi was honoured for his achievements in economics and philanthropy at the 19th Arab Economic Forum Summit in 2011, with special reference to his commitment to sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midroc-ceo.com/?q=Saudi%20Investor%20Honored |title=Saudi Investor Honored At Economic Forum &amp;#124; MIDROC Ethiopia Technology Group |publisher=Midroc-ceo.com |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Al Amoudi was born in the north-central Ethiopian city of Dessie, in Wollo region and brought up in Woldia, a town also in Wollo, Ethiopia. He was born to a father of [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] Yemeni origin and an Ethiopian mother of Wollo Amhara descent.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; He grew up in Ethiopia, before emigrating to Saudi Arabia with his brother Mauricet and becoming a Saudi citizen.

The common seal of the council is retained by the  municipal commissioner.

===As NAXION===
NAXION is the new name for National Analysts Worldwide, a [[market research]]/[[marketing research]] and consulting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxionthinking.com/about-us/our-history|title=Our History {{!}} NAXION  {{!}}  Research &gt; Consulting|website=www.naxionthinking.com|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was formed in 1911 when [[Curtis Publishing Company]] hired [[Charles Coolidge Parlin]] to oversee the Division of Commercial Research and conduct research that would help manufacturers understand their customers in the newly emerging [[consumer economy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingpower.com/Calendar/Pages/CharlesCoolidgeParlinAward.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of Marketing Thought, Robert Bartels, page 124 - 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Market Research and Modeling: Progress and Prospects, Youuram Wind, Paul E.

It is considered to be the "first commercial research company" ever formed.&lt;ref&gt;American Advertising Foundation www.advertisinghalloffame.org/members/member_bio.php?memid=748&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marketing/Research People: Their Behind-th-Scenes Stories, Jack J.

===National and Sub-National Report===
The National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria’s (NCCN) “National Competitiveness Report” will expand on the framework and methodology used in the World Economic Forum’s – Global Competitiveness Report and the World Bank’s – Doing business report to provide insight into the challenges to improved competitiveness and assess the regulation surrounding the ease with which businesses are able to set up and operate in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccnigeria.org/initiative/nccn-national-and-sub-national-report/ |title=National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria (NCCN)NCCN National and Sub-National Report - National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria (NCCN) |publisher=Nccnigeria.org |date=2014-03-29 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hope is that these reports will focus discourse around competitiveness issues and provide a platform for policy changes that will result in increased competitiveness.

'''Philippe Suchard''' (9 October 1797 &amp;ndash; 14 January 1884) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[chocolatier]] and [[industrialist]].

==Biography==
Suchard was born in 1797 in [[Boudry]]. According to the [[memoirs]] of his sister Rosalie, he became aware of the potentialities of chocolate manufacturing as an industry at the very early age of about twelve.&lt;ref name=swissworld&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.swissworld.org/en/people/portraits_chocolate_makers/philippe_suchard/ | title = Philippe Suchard biography | accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill his dream, six years later he started as an apprentice in his brother Frédéric's ''[[Konditorei]]'' in [[Bern]]. In 1824 he left Switzerland to visit the [[United States]]. At the end of the year he returned and opened a confectioner's business in Neuchâtel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finedarkchocolate.com/Swiss_Chocolate/Philippe_Suchard.asp |title=Philippe Suchard (1797&amp;ndash;1884), Swiss Master Chocolate Maker |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114022927/http://www.finedarkchocolate.com/Swiss_Chocolate/PHILIPPE_SUCHARD.asp |archivedate=November 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, Suchard opened the factory of Chocolat Suchard in [[Serrières, Neuchâtel|Serrières]]. He used [[hydropower]] of the nearby river to run the mills in his two-man factory. Suchard used a grinding mill consisting of a heated [[granite]] plate, and several granite rollers moving forwards and backwards. This design is still used to grind [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] paste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1026&amp;lang=en | title = Milka | accessdate = 2008-09-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091006/http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1026&amp;lang=en | archivedate = 2011-07-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chocolate was not cheap or a product for everybody. Suchard struggled financially early in his career as a chocolatier. His success came in 1842, with a bulk order from [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV, king of Prussia]], who was also the prince of [[Neuchâtel]]. This triggered a boom and soon his chocolates won prizes at the London [[Great Exhibition of 1851]] and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Universal Exposition of 1855]]. He opened his first factory abroad in 1880 in [[Lörrach]], [[Germany]], becoming the first to do so. The unusual purple color of the chocolate packaging was selected by Suchard, who believed it would be unique among chocolate packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1027&amp;lang=en | title = Brand News | accessdate = 2008-09-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091508/http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1027&amp;lang=en | archivedate = 2011-07-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, Suchard had become the largest chocolate producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chocosuisse.ch/page/2_1_geschichte-en.html | title = From cocoa to chocolate | accessdate=2008-09-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501145719/http://www.chocosuisse.ch/page/2_1_geschichte-en.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen years after his death in 1884 in Neuchâtel, his company produced the famous [[Milka]] chocolate for the Swiss market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theobroma-cacao.de/wissen/geschichte/personen/philippe-suchard/ | title = Lebenslauf von Philippe Suchard | accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his daughter Eugénie Suchard and her husband Karl Russ-Suchard, took over the functioning of his factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.le-musee.ch/500-Animations/veillee050608.htm | title = Philippe Suchard: de Boudry à l'Orient du Minaret | accessdate=2008-09-09| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the factory belongs to the [[Mondelez]] group and production has been moved to the [[Toblerone]] factory in Bern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kraftfoods.ch/kraft/page?siteid=kraft-prd&amp;locale=chde1&amp;PagecRef=2505&amp;Mid=2505 | title= Süsse Fakten zu Milka, Toblerone und Suchard | language = German | accessdate = 2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suchard was not only a chocolatier but also had interest in other areas. In 1834 he introduced and captained the first [[steamboat|steamer]], ''Industriel'', on [[Lake Neuchâtel]]. He also tried introducing [[silkworm]] culture in Switzerland in 1837, but the silkworms were destroyed during an epidemic in 1843. His interest in managing river water and controlling floods led to the sinking of the water level in Lake Neuchâtel. The lowered lake shoreline revealed the [[Celts|Celtic]] settlement of [[La Tène]] dating back to around 450 BC.&lt;ref name=swissworld /&gt;

The '''philosophy of business''' considers the fundamental principles that underlie the formation and operation of a [[business enterprise]]; the nature and purpose of a [[business]], and the [[moral obligation]]s that pertain to it.

== Influence ==

[[Philipp Blom]] summarises the development and impact of business-centric ideas in society prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008 | global financial crisis of 2008]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] [[Friedrich Hayek | Friedrich von Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] [...] were Europeans who had passed their formative years in the chaotic interwar years and whose conclusion was that state intervention and planned economies were hallmarks of dictatorship [...]. They believed that it was healthier to take ideology out of politics and base the workings of society on the objective, nonideological laws of the free market. [...] The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] cult of reason and of the common good was replaced by the concepts of rationalization and the maximization of profits, which were applied to a reevaluation of social institutions - infrastructure, schools, universities, prisons, health care, and so on - according to business-driven criteria of profitability and cost-effectiveness. Especially in the United States but also increasingly in Europe, we began to run our societies as businesses. Beginning in the late 1970s and gaining speed in the 1980s, this gospel changed and polarized our societies - but it also provided an umbrella of meaning and necessity under which we could hide from challenges from without as well as doubts from within. For many in the West, the idea of the market became their ideological home. Living in accordance with its guiding providence and iron laws created a sense of stability, of virtue even. But 2008 shattered this collective piety and made millions understand that they had been lied to [...].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Pradeep Paunrana''' (born 1959) is a [[businessman]], [[entrepreneur]], [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]] in [[Kenya]], the largest economy in the [[East African Community]]. He is the current [[Managing Director]] of [[ARM Cement Limited]], one of the leading cement manufacturers in Eastern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Background and education==
He was born in 1959 and was educated in Kenyan schools. He attended [[New York University Stern School of Business]] (NYU Stern), graduating in 1983, with the degree of [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA). His father, the late ''Harjivandas J. Paunrana'', who had dropped out of school at age 13, made sure his son received a good solid education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Career==
From 1983 until 1984, Pradeep worked at a software company in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/meet-the-boss-pradeep-paunrana-managing-director-arm-cement/|title=Meet the Boss: Pradeep Paunrana, managing director, ARM Cement|date=2014-02-07|work=How We Made It In Africa|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning US$40,000 annually. He returned to Kenya in 1984, at the age of 24 at the request of his father who handed him the keys to the business in exchange for a percentage ownership, but no salary. Pradeep, therefore became the [[Managing Director]] of ''Athi River Mining Limited'', as the company was known at the time.

From annual sales of KSh6 million (approx.US$70,000) in 1984, the business has grown to annual sales of KSh14 billion (approx.US$160 million), in 2014. In 1994, the company which started with manufacturing fertilizer, animal feeds, ceramics, glass and plastics, began making cement for the first time. In 2007, the company which had changed names to '''[[ARM Cement Limited]]''' listed its shares on the [[Nairobi Securities Exchange]] (NSE). Over the years, the company has grown into the largest manufacturer of cement in East Africa, producing 2.6 million tonnes annually. Pradeep Paunrana, personally owns 18% of the company shares, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Pradeep-Paunrana/-/1248928/1990146/-/item/0/-/kq4sgv/-/index.html|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">{{Economic systems sidebar|coordination}}
In [[economics]], a '''price system''' is a component of any [[economic]] system that uses [[prices]] expressed in any form of [[money]] for the [[Economic value|valuation]] and distribution of goods and services and the [[factors of production]]. Except for possible remote and primitive communities, all modern societies use price systems to allocate resources, although price systems are not used exclusively for all resource allocation decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475822/price-system | title = Price system | author = [[George J. Stigler]], [[William J. Baumol]] | work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate =2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A price system may be either a [[regulated market|fixed price system]] where [[Administered price|prices are administered]] by a government body, or it may be a [[free price system]] where prices are left to float "freely" as determined by supply and demand uninhibited by regulations. A mixed price system involves a combination of both administered and unregulated prices.

== History ==
Price systems have been around as long as there has been [[money]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} 

The price system has evolved into the system of global [[capitalism]] that is present in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728152736/http://www.technocracy.org/archives/185-langan I Am The Price System R. B. Langan Great lakes Technocrat  April 1944, # 66.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and other [[Communist state]]s with a centralized [[planned economy]] maintained controlled price systems. Whether the ruble or the dollar is used in the economic system, the criterion of a price system is the use of money as an arbiter and usual final arbiter of whether a thing is done or not. In other words, few things are done without consideration for the monetary costs and the potential making of a profit in a price system.

=== Debate on socialism ===
{{See also|Socialist calculation debate}}
The American economist [[Thorstein Veblen]] wrote a seminal tract on the development of the term as discussed in this article: ''The Engineers and the Price System''.&lt;ref&gt;Harbinger Edition, 1963. LCCCN 63-19639. First Published as a series of essays in [[The Dial]] (1919) then as a book in 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Veblen/Papers/Engineers.htm Full Text (HTML)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its chapter VI, ''A Memorandum on a Practicable Soviet of Technicians'' discusses the possibility of [[socialist]] revolution in the United States comparable to that then occurring in Russia (the Soviets had not yet at that time become a state (USSR formed in 1922)).

The original conception of socialism involved the substitution of money as a unit of calculation and monetary prices as a whole with [[calculation in kind]] (or valuation based on natural units), with business and financial decisions replaced by engineering and technical criteria for managing the economy. Fundamentally, this meant that socialism would operate under different economic dynamics than those of capitalism and the price system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 20|quote= According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories - such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent - and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1930s, the economists [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]] developed a comprehensive model of a socialist economy that utilized a price system and money for the allocation of [[capital good]]s. In contrast to a free-market price system, "socialist" prices would be set by a planning board to equal the [[marginal cost]] of production to achieve [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] Pareto efficiency. Because this model of socialism relied upon money and administered prices as opposed to non-monetary calculation in physical magnitudes, it was labelled "market socialism". In effect, Oskar Lange conceded that calculations in a socialist system would have to be performed in value terms with a functioning price system rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria as in the classic concept of socialism.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate"&gt;''Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate: The role of markets and finance in Hayek's response to Lange's challenge'', by Auerbach, Paul and Sotiropoulos, Dimitris. 2012. Kingston University London, Economics Discussion Paper 2012-6, pp. 1-2: "He readily acceded to the need for efficiency calculations to be made in value terms rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria, but claimed that these values could emerge along lines consistent with neoclassical value theory, without the need for a market in capital goods and without private ownership over the means of production."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hayek===
{{details|Price signal}}
[[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] argued that a free price system allowed economic coordination via the [[price signal]]s that changing prices send, which is regarded as one of his most significant and influential contributions to economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Skarbek | first = David | title = F. A. Hayek's Influence on Nobel Prize Winners | journal = [[Review of Austrian Economics]] | volume = 22 | number = 1 | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.davidskarbek.com/papers/HayekNobel.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945), Hayek wrote, "The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a [[division of labor]] but also a coördinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labor on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the "state" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type."&lt;ref name="Hayek45"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prodromos Bodosakis-Athanasiadis''' ({{lang-el|'''Πρόδρομος Μποδοσάκης Αθανασιάδης '''}}) (1890-1979) was one of the most important figures in 20th century [[Greece|Greek]] industrial history.

'''Rank Xerox''' was formed in 1956 as a [[joint venture]] between the [[Xerox]] Corporation of United States (a.k.a. Haloid Photographic) and the [[Rank Organisation]] of the United Kingdom, to manufacture and market Xerox equipment initially in Europe and later in Africa and Asia. A further joint venture between Rank Xerox and Modi Group in India formed '''Modi Xerox''' (now [[Xerox India]]) to manufacture and sell Xerox equipment in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==History==
The initial joint venture was 50% Xerox and 50% Rank Organisation, but this changed after a few years to a 60/40 split. Later, Xerox bought a further share making the split 80/20, and in the late 1990s, completed the purchase, so Rank Xerox formally became Xerox.

In 1956 the Rank Organisation was looking for a product to sit alongside a small business it had making camera lenses. Thomas Law, who was the head of the business, found his answer in a scientific magazine he picked up by chance. He read about an invention that could produce copies of documents as good as the original.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph, 7 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Law tracked down the backers, an obscure photographic-supply company in Rochester, New York, named Haloid.

Haloid and Rank subsequently formed an affiliate called Rank Xerox (Rank put up £600,000 for a 50% stake in Rank Xerox). This arrangement paved the way for Xerox factories in Great Britain and a sales and distribution system that brought Xerox machines to the European market. As photocopying took the world by storm, so did Rank’s profits. According to Graham Dowson,later Rank’s chief executive, it was "a stroke of luck that turned out to be a touch of genius … If Tom Law had not seen that magazine, we would not have known about xerography – or at least not before it was too late."&lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph, 13 January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Rank Xerox under Nigel Foulkes, initiated a marketing concept to sell rather than rent their copying machines behind the [[Iron Curtain]], by appointing Gordon S Planner as General Manager East Export Operations via a firm of head hunters.&lt;ref&gt;'Marketing' September 1970 page 50, item by Paul Zentner&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of machines increased rapidly to Eastern Europe and a unique marketing concept deployed in 1973 using a specially built and equipped train showcasing Rank Xerox copiers, it toured nine countries in Eastern Europe covering 30,000 miles and returned orders of over £3m.&lt;ref&gt;'Financial Times' 5 January 1976. 'Capitalist Tools in the Communist Office' item by Roy Levine.&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioning London based designer Cairnes Maltby, the latter came up firstly with a train unit comprising five cars. These contained staff accommodations, a kitchen, overnight staff sleeping cabins and a demonstration salon and bar. Pulled by engines of the various countries of the Soviet Bloc, the train reached Russia and a welcome market. The following year Cairnes Design Associates produced the first of the Rank Xerox Showliners. A large, articulated, semi-trailer truck with motorised pull-outs, this allowed the road legal trailer to extend to a, fully functional showroom, complete with large picture windows and small kitchen. Unlike the train it was capable of reaching the small to medium size cities of the Soviet Bloc. Both train and truck avoided the problems that affected western firms trying to establish a presence in the East.

Later, in the UK, the mobile exhibition concept was taken to its ultimate conclusion. Following several truck based Showliners, a train and a converted bus, a huge mobile exhibition was conceived. This moved from town to town, like a circus, using sports halls and exhibition centres to present a vast, virtual, [[office of the future]].
Ralph Land CBE, was General Manager of Rank Xerox Eastern Europe Operations (1976–91).

During the 1980s the managing director Roland E. Magnin helped the company to become the international arm of Xerox Corporation. He then moved to the corporation's headquarters in Connecticut where he was responsible for the decentralization program of the company as one of its top directors.

The remaining 20% stake owned by the Rank Organization in Rank Xerox was bought out by the parent Xerox Corporation for ₤940 million in 1997.&lt;ref name="1997-10k"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://getfilings.com/o0000108772-98-000006.html |title=Form 10K filing for Xerox Corporation, Fiscal Year 1997 |publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission]] |date=1998 |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rank Xerox name was discontinued following the buyout, and the Rank Xerox Research Centre was renamed to the Xerox Research Centre Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11980">'''Resource Consumption Accounting''' ('''RCA''') is a [[management fad|management theory]] describing a dynamic, integrated, and comprehensive [[management accounting]] approach that provides managers with [[decision support]] information for [[enterprise optimization]].  RCA is a relatively new management accounting approach based largely on the German management accounting approach [[Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK)]] and also allows for the use of activity-based drivers.

==Background==
RCA emerged as a [[management accounting]] approach beginning around 2000, and was subsequently developed at [http://www.CAM-I.org CAM-I (The Consortium of Advanced Management, International)] in a Cost Management Section RCA interest group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam-i.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=30|title=Cost Management Section - ''RCA Interest Group''|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; commencing in December 2001. Over the next seven years RCA was refined and validated through practical case studies, industry journal publications, and other research papers.

In 2008, a group of interested academics and practitioners established the RCA Institute&lt;ref&gt;http://www.RCAInstitute.org&lt;/ref&gt; to introduce Resource Consumption Accounting to the marketplace and raise the standard of [[management accounting]] knowledge by encouraging disciplined practices.

By July 2009, Professional Accountants in Business (PAIB)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifac.org/PAIB/&lt;/ref&gt; Committee of [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), recognized Resource Consumption Accounting in the International Good Practice Guidance (IGPG) publication called [http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-and-improving-costing-organizations-0 Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations] &lt;ref name=IGPG&gt;{{cite journal|author=Professional Accountants in Business|title=Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations|journal=International Good Practice Guidance|pages=42|publisher=Professional Accountants in Business Committee,International Federation of Accountants|date=July 2009|url=http://www.ifac.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/evaluating-and-improving-co_0.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its companion document, [http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-costing-journey-costing-levels-continuum-maturity-model Evaluating the Costing Journey: A Costing Levels Continuum Maturity Model.] The guide focuses on universal costing principles and with the Costing Levels Maturity Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Professional Accountants in Business|title=Evaluating the Costing Journey: A Costing Levels Continuum Maturity Model|journal=Information Paper|pages=19|publisher=Professional Accountants in Business Committee,International Federation of Accountants|date=July 2009|url=http://www.ifac.org/Members/DownLoads/evaluating-the-costing-jour.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledges RCA attains a higher level of accuracy and visibility compared to activity based costing for managerial accounting information when the incremental benefits of RCA's better information exceed the incremental administrative effort and cost to collect, calculate and report its information.

As stated in the International Good Practice Guidance,&lt;ref name=IGPG/&gt;
{{quotation|"''A sophisticated approach at the upper levels of the continuum of costing techniques provides the ability to derive costs directly from operational resource data, or to isolate and measure unused capacity costs. For example, in the resource consumption accounting approach, resources and their costs are considered as foundational to robust cost modeling and managerial decision support, because an organization’s costs and revenues are all a function of the resources and the individual capacities that produce them.''"|International Federation of Accountants, 2009}}

Resource Consumption Accounting was also recognized in a [[Sustainability]] Framework Report issued by the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), for having the capability of helping organizations "''improve their understanding of environmental (and social) costs through their costing systems and models''".&lt;ref name="web.ifac.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ifac.org/sustainability-framework/imp-improvement-of-information|title=Sustainability Framework - ''Internal Management''|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This Sustainability Framework&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ifac.org/sustainability-framework/splash&lt;/ref&gt; highlights RCA under the sub-heading ''Improving Information Flows to Support Decision'' and informs readers that proper cost allocation can be built ‘directly into the cost accounting system’, thereby enhancing an organization's performance for "''identifying, defining and classifying costs in a useful way''".&lt;ref name="web.ifac.org"/&gt;

==Concepts of Resource Consumption Accounting==
RCA concepts that distinguish it from other [[management accounting]] approaches include the following:
# Germany’s [[Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK)|GPK]] method of quantity-based operational modeling using fixed and proportional costs established at the resource level in a company (i.e., cost center/resource pools or value streams");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedl|first=Gunther|author2=Hans-Ulrich Kupper and Burkhard Pedell|title=Relevance Added: Combining ABC with German cost accounting|journal=Strategic Finance|issue=June|pages=56–61|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/connection/connect/mycu/1925.html Gordon Shillinglaw’s] concept of attributable cost;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shillinglaw |first=Gordon |title=The Concept of Attributable Costs|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|issue=Spring|year=1963 |pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Flexible use of activity-based drivers (only where needed) based on specific, and restrictive rules;
# Value chain integration&lt;ref&gt;Value chain integration ''(i.e., a quantitative model in the operational systems)'' eliminates dependency on the General Ledger for managerial decision-making. General Ledgers are primarily a tool for financial reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (GAAP reporting is specifically designed for external stakeholders – creditors and investors, not internal managers – and external comparisons associated with investing activities.){{cite web|url=http://www.rcainstitute.org|title=RCA Institute - ''FAQ's''|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of management accounting into operational systems;
# Use of fundamental operations transactions as the primary source for financial and quantitative data (rather than the general ledger);
# Replacing the ''principle of variability'' with the ''principle of responsiveness'' for operational modeling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van der Merwe|first=Anton|title=Management Accounting Philosophy Series II: Cornerstones of Restoration |journal=Journal of Cost Management|volume= 21|number=Number 5|date=Sep–Oct 2007 |pages=26–33|issn=1092-8057}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Support for a multi-level, contribution margin-based ''profit &amp; loss statement'' that supports managerial decision making without the cost distortions and complexity of inappropriate (not based on the ''principle of causality'') allocations of cost.

==The Core Elements of RCA==
There are three core elements that enable RCA to lay a very different foundation for its cost model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcainstitute.org|title=RCA Institute - ''About RCA''|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The view of resources – resources and their costs are considered foundational to proper cost modeling and decision support. An organization’s cost and revenues are all a function of the resources that produce them.
*Quantity-based modeling – the entire model is constructed using operational quantities. Operational data is the foundation of value creation and the leading indicator of economic outcomes.
*Cost behavior – value is added as a veneer to the quantity-based model and costs/dollars behavior is determined by the behavior of resource quantities as they are applied to value creating operations within an organization.

==Additional information==
The goals of the RCA Institute, in promoting the acquisition of knowledge and skills to apply RCA, include the following:
* Improve management accounting knowledge and practice by clarifying and embracing sound principles that will enhance enterprise decision making and the public welfare through optimum resource usage.
* Advance the knowledge and practice of Resource Consumption Accounting (RCA) through:
** A community of active, high quality practitioners and academics.
** Consistent and disciplined practice centered on a core body of RCA knowledge that is not diluted by wide variations in use or form.
** Education of adopters, practitioners and vendors and the certification of vendors’ products and services.
** Increased adoption of RCA, over the long-term, as the dominant [[management accounting]] approach in business, government, and non-profit organizations.

:The RCA Institute library contains an annotated bibliography that is currently divided into four sections:
# RCA theory,
# management accounting landscape and management accounting philosophy,
# RCA related research and
# other materials.
This annotated bibliography provides more information for recommended reading and some guidance on how to get the most out of the information that is there.

'''Sir Samuel Chapman''' (1859 &amp;ndash; 29 April 1947) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] businessman and [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]] politician from [[Perthshire]].

He unsuccessfully contested the [[Perth (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth]] constituency in [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906]] and [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January 1910]], and the [[Greenock (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenock]] constituency in [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] and in [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918]], but was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922 general election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32775|page=8712|date=8 December 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he was chosen as Unionist candidate for that seat over [[Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl]]&lt;ref&gt;Knox, William. ''The Lives of Scottish Women: Women and Scottish Society, 1800-1980'' Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006; p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;) and held the seat&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32897|page=368|date=11 January 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32996|page=8534|date=25 November 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33508|page=4117|date=21 June 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33769|page=7146|date=6 November 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34223|page=7506|date=26 November 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he stepped down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 1920 [[New Year Honours]], for "Valuable War work, especially in connection with the Perth and Perthshire Prisoners of War Fund; Public and Local services".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31712|supp=y|page=2|date=30 December 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scheme of arrangement''' (or a "scheme of reconstruction") is a court-approved agreement between a [[corporate law|company]] and its [[shareholder]]s or [[creditor]]s (e.g. lenders or [[debenture]] holders). It may affect mergers and amalgamations and may alter shareholder or creditor rights.

Schemes of arrangement are used to execute arbitrary changes in the structure of a business and thus are used when a reorganisation cannot be achieved by other means. They may be used for rescheduling debt, for takeovers, and for returns of capital, among other purposes.

In the United Kingdom, the relevant provisions for effecting a scheme of arrangement are found in the [[Companies Act 2006]], Part 26 (ss.895-901) and Part 27 (special rules for public companies).

In Australia, the relevant provisions for effecting a scheme of arrangement or reconstruction are located in Part 5.1 of the [[Corporations Act 2001]] (Cth).

In South Africa, the relevant provisions for effecting a scheme of arrangement are found in the Companies Act 2008, No. 71 Of 2008, Sections 114 and 115.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

Established in 1920, the Faculty of Economics initially offered the Bachelor of Economics degree which commenced in 1914. The postgraduate Master of Economics degree commenced in 1925.

In 1985 the faculty introduced its second undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs, the Bachelor of Economic and Social Sciences and the Master of Economic and Social Sciences, respectively.

In 1993 its third undergraduate degree program, the Bachelor of Commerce, was introduced. The Master of International Studies followed in 1994, the Master of Commerce in 1995 and the Master of International Business in 1999.

In 2005 the Business School ended its association with the jointly run [[Australian Graduate School of Management]] with [[The University of New South Wales]].

From 2006 to 2007, the University conducted a review of its social sciences faculties. As a result of that review, it was determined that parts of the School of Economics within the Faculty of Economics and Business were to be transferred to the Faculty of Arts (as it then was). In January 2008, the disciplines of Government &amp; International Relations and Political Economy were transferred to the Faculty of Arts. In January 2011, the Discipline of Economics, the Centre for International Security Studies and the Graduate School of Government were also transferred to the Faculty of Arts, which was renamed the [[University of Sydney Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences|Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences]]. Concurrently, the remaining disciplines of the Faculty of Economics and Business formed the University of Sydney Business School.

On 30 July 2009, the Business School announced the launch of the Global Executive MBA program, which was commenced in February 2010.

On 30 July 2012, the Business School announced the introduction of the Sydney Master of Business Administration (MBA) program,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/sydney_mba_seven_year_hitch_ends_UOD4HBh6ljCb9h1aW0iRUO&lt;/ref&gt; with the program starting February 2013. Particular emphasis has been put into making positioning it as an internationally recognised degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/university_of_sydney_makes_new_mba_GZe2AXeSKyOXCT7m4UyAsO&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the purpose-fitted CBD campus, providing a central location for participants in the part-time MBA program, was opened. 

In 2016, the Abercrombie Building was opened by The Hon. Gladys Berejiklian MP, Treasurer of NSW and Minister for Industrial Relations, and Deputy Liberal Leader. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbanews.com.au/inside-university-sydney-business-school-abercrombie/&lt;/ref&gt;
