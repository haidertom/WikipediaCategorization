The '''American Guild of Judaic Art''' (AGJA) is a national non-profit membership organization based in [[Owings Mills, Maryland]] that is dedicated to the promotion of [[Judaism|Jewish]] art and culture in society. Its membership includes Jewish [[artist]]s, [[art gallery|galleries]], museum [[curator]]s, [[Collecting|collectors]], and [[academia]]s in the field of Jewish studies and art history. The organization sponsors and promotes an annual calendar of events entitled "Jewish Arts Week" in which it encourages synagogues, community centers, and schools throughout North America to host activities and exhibitions relating to Jewish art. The American Guild of Judaic art is headed by its president, the artist [James Cohen].

==Jewish Arts Month==
The organization sponsors and promotes an annual calendar of events entitled "Jewish Arts Month" in which it encourages [[synagogue]]s, community centers, libraries, and schools throughout North America to host activities and exhibitions relating to and showcasing Jewish art. This special month corresponds with the [[Torah]] (Old Testament) reading of Parshat Vayakhel from [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]: 35:1-38:20 where the first Jewish artisan, [[Bezalel]], is introduced with descriptions of his designs to build the [[Mishkan]] (Tabernacle). Because the Jewish calendar is a lunar based one, Jewish Arts Month’s dates change from year to year.

==Exhibitions==

AGJA initiatives include expanding exhibition opportunities, community outreach programs, and collaborative educational connections to bring art, inspired by Jewish text, tradition, ritual, and personal experience to those who appreciate or want to learn more about the world of Jewish art. HIDDUR, a quarterly Email newsletter and expanding interactive social media were established in 2010.

In 2012, The AGJA launched their inaugural members online exhibition.  The 2013-2014 online exhibition includes works, available for purchase, by 29 of the guild's members.  Work include [[ketubbah]]s, [[chuppah]]s, paintings, works on paper, jewelry and sculpture.  The exhibition was curated by Karen Walanka from the Moriah Congregation in Deerfield, IL.

==Mentoring Program==
In 2013, the American Guild of Judaic Art launched their online mentoring program for students in grades 7-12.  AGJA artists volunteer to mentor student artists in a unique on-line venue. The mentor program is a direct approach to reaching young people who express a sincere interest in learning how to create Jewish art. Guild artists experience the rare opportunity to mentor, guide and inspire a young person in the complex world of Judaic art, all done on-line.  As a Judaic arts organization, the Guild will use its numerous resources to facilitate the development and growth of the mentoring program.

==History==
Founded in 1991, it was under the leadership of past president Mark Levin AIA,  that the Guild joined the internet virtual age in 1999 with creating its website featuring Guild members and their work, The Guild provides information and networking opportunities for its membership through member-only online resources as well as a members only Google online discussion group. The Guild’s calendar of Jewish Arts Week, other member events and activities, membership information, an AGJA member directory as well as an Artist’s Gallery is available for the public on the Guild’s website.

The curving of a [[phospholipid]] [[lipid bilayer|bilayer]], for example into a [[liposome]], causes disturbances to the packing of the lipids on the side of the bilayer that has the larger surface area (the outside of a liposome for example). The less "ordered"  or "looser" packing of the lipids is recognized by ALPS motifs.

ALPS motifs are 20 to 40 [[amino acid]] long portions of [[proteins]] that have important collections of types of amino acid residues. Bulky [[hydrophobic]] amino acid residues, such as [[Phenylalanine]], [[Leucine]], and [[Tryptophan]] are present every 3 or 4 positions, with many [[Chemical polarity|polar]] but uncharged amino acid residues such as [[Glycine]], [[Serine]] and [[Threonine]] between. The ALPS is unstructured in solution but folds as an [[alpha helix]] when associated with the membrane bilayer, such that the hydrophobic residues insert between loosely packed lipids and the polar residues point toward the [[aqueous]] [[cytoplasm]].

'''Business simulation''' is [[simulation]] used for [[business]] training, education or analysis. It can be [[scenario]]-based or [[Number|numeric]]-based.

Most business simulations are used for business acumen training and development. Learning objectives include: strategic thinking, decision making, problem solving, financial analysis, market analysis, operations, teamwork and leadership.&lt;ref name="bizsims"&gt;[http://www.bizsims.edu.au/ Online Business Simulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The business gaming community seems lately to have adopted the term '''business simulation game''' instead of just '''gaming''' or just '''simulation'''. The word '''simulation''' is sometimes considered too mechanistic for educational purposes. '''Simulation''' also refers to activities where an optimum for some problem is searched for, while this is not usually the aim of an educational game. On the other hand, the word '''game''' can imply time wasting, not taking things too seriously and engaging in an exercise designed purely for fun. The concept of '''simulation gaming''' seems to offer the right combination and balance between the two.&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"&gt;Lainema (2003). Enhancing Organizational Business Process Perception – Experiences from Constructing and Applying a Dynamic Business Simulation Game. Turku School of Economics, Series A-5:2003. {{ISBN|951-564-139-X}}. Online: http://info.tse.fi/julkaisut/vk/Ae5_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation gaming is also the term that the educational gaming community has adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblat, Cathy Stein (1988). Designing Games and Simulations: An Illustrated Handbook. Sage Publications, Newbury Park&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games and business simulation games ==
Partly, the terminology of [[business simulation game]]s is not well established. The most common term used is '''[[business game]]''' but several other terms are also in use. Here we will define the most common terms used in context of (computer-based) business learning environments.

Klabbers (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 16-33&lt;/ref&gt; notes that gaming is sometimes associated with something that is frivolous, just for the fun of it. This hampers its scientific endeavor and the more serious connotations of gaming in the scientific arena. The term game is used to describe activities in which some or all of these characteristics are prominent:&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). Using Management Games. 2nd edition, Gower Press, Aldershot, Hampshire, England&lt;/ref&gt;
* human, humanly controlled, opponents, whose actions have an effect upon each other and upon the environment,
* an emphasis on competitiveness and winning,
* an emphasis on pleasure, humour and enjoyment,
* a repetitive cycle of making decisions and encountering a result, allowing the hope of improvement and 'doing better next time'.

Games are played when one or more players compete or cooperate for payoffs, according to an agreed set of rules. Players behave as themselves though they may well display exceptional behavior.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"&gt;Jaques, David (1995). Games, Simulations and Case Studies – A Review. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 21-38&lt;/ref&gt; Games are social systems and they include actors (players), rules and resources, which are the basic building blocks of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2001). Bridging information &amp; knowledge society: potentials of gaming. In Rahnu, L. (ed.) Bridging the Information and Knowledge Societies. Tartu University Press, Tartu, Estonia&lt;/ref&gt; In each game, the players (actors) interact with one another, while applying different rules, and utilizing different resources.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2003). Interactive Learning of What? In Percival, Godfrey, Laybourn and Murray (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Vol. 11, pp. 257-266. Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya&lt;ref&gt;Tsuchiya, Tomoaki and Tsuchiya, Shigehisa (1999). The Unique Contribution of Gaming/Simulation: Towards Establishment of the Discipline. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 46-57&lt;/ref&gt; note that the simulation gaming community is still struggling to establish itself as a discipline, although 35 years have passed since the International Simulation and Gaming Association ('''ISAGA''') was established. To be a discipline, simulation gaming needs a theory, methodology, and application and validation. Of these, forming a theory is the most difficult challenge. Similar comments come from Wolfe and Crookall.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Joseph and Crookall, David (1998). Developing a Scientific Knowledge of Simulation/Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 29, No. 1, pp. 7-19&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to prior research they conclude that the educational simulation gaming field has been unable to create a generally accepted typology, let alone taxonomy, of the nature of simulation gaming. According to them this is unfortunate because the basis of any science is its ability to discriminate and classify phenomena within its purview, based on underlying theory and precepts. Without this, the field has been stuck, despite its age, at a relatively low level of development.

In most cases, the terms '''business (simulation) game''' and '''management (simulation) game''' can be used interchangeably and there is no well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"&gt;Greenlaw, Paul S., Herron, Lowell W. and Rawdon, Richard H. (1962). Business Simulation in Industrial and University Education. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; determine a business game (or business simulation) as ''a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation''. The descriptions given for a management game, for example, by Forrester&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay W. (1961). Industrial Dynamics. The M.I.T. Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, London&lt;/ref&gt; and Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, New York&lt;/ref&gt; do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"/&gt; determines that in a management game profit is not the dominant measure of success. Keys and Wolfe&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keys | first1 = Bernard | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = Joseph | year = 1990 | title = The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 307–336 | doi=10.1177/014920639001600205}}&lt;/ref&gt; define a management game as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude, or illusion of reality, to include real world-like responses by those participating in the exercise.

Gredler&lt;ref&gt;Gredler, Margaret E. (1996). Educational Games and Simulations: A Technology in Search of a (Research) Paradigm. In Jonassen, David H. (ed.) Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology. Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; divides experiential simulations into the following four categories:
# Data management simulations,
# Diagnostic simulations,
# Crisis management simulations, and
# Social-process simulations.
Business simulation games are most often of the first kind. A participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners. Each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal.

Business strategy games are intended to enhance students' decision-making skills, especially under conditions defined by limited time and information.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Marcia Lynn and Sigelman, Lee (1991). Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction. Sage Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; They vary in focus from how to undertake a corporate takeover to how to expand a company's share of the market. Typically, the player feeds information into a computer program and receives back a series of optional or additional data that are conditional upon the player's initial choices. The game proceeds through several series of these interactive, iterative steps. As can be noted, this definition does not consider continuous (real-time) processing an alternative.

In business simulation games players receive a description of an imaginary business and an imaginary environment and make decisions – on price, advertising, production targets, etc. – about how their company should be run. A business game may have an industrial, commercial or financial background (Elgood, 1996). Ju and Wagner&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"&gt;Ju, Edward and Wagner, Christian (1997). Personal Computer Games: Their Structure, Principles, and Applicability for Training. The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 78-92&lt;/ref&gt; mention that the nature of business games can include decision-making tasks, which pit the player against a hostile environment or hostile opponents. These simulations have a nature of strategy or war games, but usually are very terse in their user interface. Other types of managerial simulations are resource allocation games, in which the player or players have to allocate resources to areas such as plant, production, operations, marketing, and human resources, in order to produce and sell goods.

According to Senge and Lannon&lt;ref&gt;Senge, P. M. and Lannon, C. (1997). Managerial Microworlds. Technology Review, Vol. 93, Issue 5, pp. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt; in '''managerial microworlds''' – like business simulation games – unlike in the actual world, managers are free to experiment with policies and strategies without fear of jeopardizing the company. This process includes the kind of reflection and inquiry for which there is no time in the hectic everyday world. Thus, Senge and Lannon argue, managers learn about the long-term, systemic consequences of their actions. Such "virtual worlds" are particularly important in team learning. Managers can learn to think systemically if they can uncover the subtle interactions that thwart their efforts.

Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; in 1971 gives quite a detailed view of the contents, structure, and operating of management games. Today, this description by Naylor is still valid for most of the business simulation games. Business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms, whose decision-makers or managers are the participants of the game. Each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash, inventories, raw materials, plant and equipment, and so forth. Before each operating period the players make decisions. Naylor mentions that these decisions can concern, e.g., price, output, advertising, marketing, raw material acquisition, changes in plant capacity, and wage rate. This information is read into a computer that has been programmed on the basis of a set of mathematical models that provide a link between the operating results and operating decisions of the individual firms, as well as the external environment (the market). On the basis of '''(a)''' a set of behavioral equations, such as demand and cost functions, and a set of accounting formulas that have been programmed into the computer, and '''(b)''' the individual decisions of each firm, operating results are generated by the computer in the form of printed reports – for example, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, production reports, sales reports, and total industry reports – at the end of each operating period. Usually the environment can be changed by the administrator of the game by altering the parameters of the operating characteristics of the game. In each case, the firms find it necessary to react according to the magnitude and the nature of the change imposed by the external environment. Naylor mentions that some of the more complicated and more realistic games even permit multiple products, plants, and marketing areas, stochastic production periods, stochastic demand, labor negotiations, and the sale of common stock. For more information about this topic see Lainema (2003).&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"/&gt;

== History ==
The first use of games for education and development was the war game simulations in China in about 3,000 B.C. These games bore a vague similarity to the early 17th century chess.&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"/&gt; In the Western world, war games date back to at least the German Kriegspiel of the mid-nineteenth century (Faria and Dickinson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faria | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Dickinson | first2 = John R. | year = 1994 | title = Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training | url = | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1108/02621719410050183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faria and Dickinson note that different war games have also been conducted in Japan before the Second World War and war games have been long used by the British and the Americans to test battle strategies. Military officers trained with war games in the 1930s and 1940s started to use their military training to manage civilian businesses. Some of the business game evolution can be traced to a 1955 Rand Corporation game, which simulated the U.S. Air Force inventory management within its supply system.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. R. (1959). Learning from Experience in Business Decision Games. California Management Review, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 92-107&lt;/ref&gt; Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"/&gt; state that business simulation exercises may be considered an outgrowth of earlier developments in three fields: military war gaming, operations research, and educational role-playing.

According to Naylor,&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; the use of games in business and economics goes back to 1956 when the American Management Association developed the first so-called management decision-making game, called the Top Management Decision Game. Faria and Dickinson and Greenlaw et al. also find this the first widely known business decision-making simulation, although Greenlaw et al. date the origin of the game to 1957 and further specify that it was the first non-military competitive business game. Greenlaw et al. note that the Top Management Decision Simulation stimulated the design and use of dozens of other games. In this simulation five teams of players operated firms competing in a hypothetical, one-product industry. Teams made quarterly decisions covering price, production volume, budgets, research and development, advertising, and sales force and could request selected marketing research information. During the period 1955-1957 only one or two new games appeared each year (Faria, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Faria, Anthony J. (1990). Business Simulation Games after Thirty Years: Current Usage Levels in the United States. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 36-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid growth in the number of business games occurred over the years from 1958 to 1961. Greenlaw et al. had made a summary of some business games available by the beginning of the 1960s. The summary includes 89 different business games or different versions of a certain business game developed by industrial firms, business associations, educational institutes, or governmental units. Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; mentions already in 1971 that hundreds of management games have been developed by various universities, business firms, and research organizations. These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McRaith | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Goeldner | first2 = C. R. | year = 1962 | title = A Survey of Marketing Games | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 26 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. G., and Gray, C. F. (1969). Business Games Handbook. American Management Association, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; listed nearly 200 business games of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves&lt;ref&gt;Horn, R. E., and Cleaves, A. (1980). The Guide to Simulation/Games for Education and Training. Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  provided a description of 228 business games. Faria (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A.J. (1989). Business Gaming: Current Usage Levels. Management Development Review, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 58-66&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the United States in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner.&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"/&gt;

At the end of the 1980s Faria (1990) estimated that there were approximately 228 games available in the United States, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using business games. At that point Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games. Still, Faria estimated that only 12.5% of all US business firms with training and development managers used computerized business games.

The penetration of business gaming in academia is fuelled by the following factors:&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Thomas F. (1995). Strategy Support during a Business Game using an Expert System. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 87-101&lt;/ref&gt; the increase in student numbers, the increase in new courses, increased adoption of methods supporting diverse learning styles, and the increasing availability of technology. Dickinson and Faria&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, John R. and Faria, A. J. (1995). Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training and a Demonstration. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 99-109&lt;/ref&gt; state that in US over 200 business games are being used by nearly 9,000 teachers at over 1,700 colleges offering business programmes.

Larsen and Lomi&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik and Lomi, Alessandro (1999). System Dynamics and the 'New Technology' for Organizational Decisions: From Mapping and Simulation to Learning and Understanding. European Management Journal, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 117-119&lt;/ref&gt; describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming. They state that until the early 1980s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of sub-system level variables, ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company, to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy. They state further, that during the last 15 years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged. Instead of focusing on predicting, simulation progressively became a tool to help management teams understand their company and industry's problems and opportunities. Simulations could prepare for the future and reduce the sensitivity of possible strategies to changes in alternative frames of reference – or mental models. Larsen and Lomi further note, that the emphasis of computer-based simulation models has shifted:
# from predicting the future, to understanding how multiple possible futures might be linked to decisions and actions that must be taken today, and
# from designing the best strategy, to analyzing how robust our preferred strategy would be under different assumptions about how the future might unfold, or about how the past actually produced the events that we perceive.

In the late 1990s, training and consulting companies began designing and customizing business simulations for individual companies to augment their corporate leadership development programs. The business simulations often focused on strategy and business acumen. The business simulations allowed participants to test their decision-making skills, make mistakes, and safely learn from their experience. Some refer to this type of employee education as "[[experiential learning]]".  By 2000, business simulations were available that blended the traditional business acumen (financial) skills  with the softer – interpersonal – skills required for effective leadership development.

==Scenario simulations ==
In a [[business game]] or business simulation game, a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations. Often multiple choice alternatives are used and the scenario is played out following a branching tree based on which decisions the learner makes. Throughout or at certain intervals feedback is provided. These are similar to [[role-play]] simulations.

==Numeric simulations ==
A numeric simulation can mimic a whole company on a high level or it can be more detailed and mimic specific organizational units or processes. In a numeric simulation the learner or user makes decisions by pulling levers and dialers as well as through inputting numbers. The decisions are processed and the outcomes are calculated and shown in reports and graphs, e.g. price and volume as well as number of employees can be decisions and the outcome can be viewed in e.g. an [[income statement]], a [[balance sheet]] and a [[cash flow statement]]. [[Feedback]] is given throughout the simulation or at certain intervals, such as when a year has passed. Many numeric business simulations include elements of competition against other participants or against computer generated competitors.

== Types of business simulation games ==
Business simulation games can be classified according to several properties. The first taxonomies were introduced already in the beginning of the 1960s (see e.g. Greenlaw et al., 1962). Here we introduce the taxonomy from Biggs,&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990). Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 23-35&lt;/ref&gt; which is practically identical with the taxonomy from Greenlaw et al.

== The simulation gaming process ==
Business simulation game developers regard their artifacts to be learning environments. When arguing for this, they most often refer to [[David A. Kolb|David A. Kolb's]] influential work in the field of [[experiential learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, David (1984). Experiential Learning: Experience the Source of Learning and Development. Prentice-Hall, Inc, Englewood Cliffs&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decades ideas from [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] and authentic e-learning have also provided new perspectives for considering the role of business simulations in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lainema, T. (2009). Perspective Making – Constructivism as a Meaning Structure for Simulation Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Theory, Practice and Research, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 48-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="authenticlearning"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://authenticlearning.info/# |title=Authentic e-Learning |access-date=2015-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313190110/http://authenticlearning.info/# |archive-date=2015-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The activities carried out during a simulation game training session are:&lt;ref&gt;Villegas, Jaime (1997). Simulation Supported Industrial Training: A Method for Increasing the Competence of People in Companies. Saunders, Peter and Cox, Benita (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Volume 5: Research into Simulations in Education. Kogan Page, London, pp. 144-164&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoretical instruction: the teacher goes through certain relevant aspects of a theory and participants can intervene with questions and comments.
* Introduction to the game: the participants are told how to operate the computer and how to play the game.
* Playing the game: participants get the opportunity to practice their knowledge and skills by changing different parameters of the game and reflecting on the possible consequences of these changes. Permanent contact with the participants is advisable, as well as keeping the training going to maintain a positive atmosphere and to secure that the participants feel engaged.
* Group discussions: Each of the participants is given a possibility to present and compare their results from the game with the results of others. The participants are encouraged to present their results to others. The teacher should continually look for new ways of enriching the discussions and to help the participants to find the connection between the game results and the problems in real world. The quality of this group discussion plays a relevant role in the training as it will affect the participants' transfer of knowledge and skills into the real world.

The last phase in the list above is usually called debriefing. Debriefing is the most important part of the simulation/gaming experience.&lt;ref&gt;Crookall, David (1995). Preface: Debriefing the Profession and Professionalizing Debrifing. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 7-12&lt;/ref&gt; We all learn from experience, but without reflecting on this experience the learning potential may be lost. Simulation gaming needs to be seen as contrived experiences in the learning cycle, which require special attention at the stages of reflection and generalization.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"/&gt;

Thiagarajan&lt;ref&gt;Thiagarajan, Sivasailam (1995). Guidelines for Conducting a Debriefing Session and for Developing a Debriefing Guide. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 43-49&lt;/ref&gt; lists six phases of debriefing, presented as a flexible suggestion and not as rigid requirements:
# How do you feel? Gives the participants an opportunity to get some of their strong feelings about the simulation game off their chest.
# What happened? Makes it possible for the participants to compare and to contrast participant recollections and to draw some general conclusions during the next phase.
# What did you learn? Encourage the generation and testing of different hypotheses. Ask the participants to come up with general principles based on their experiences from the game and to offer evidence to support or to reject the principles.
# How does this relate to the real world? Encourage a discussion of the relevance of the game to the participants' real world workplace.
# What if…? Encourage the participants to apply their insights to new contexts.
# What next? Participants use their insights to come up with strategies for the simulation game and for the workplace.

Van Ments&lt;ref&gt;van Ments, Morry (1996). Role Playing: Playing a Part or a Mirror to Meaning. In Saunders, Percival and Vartiainen (eds.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 4: Games and Simulations to Enhance Quality Learning. Kogan Page, London&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the aim of debriefing is to: deal with factual errors and to tie up loose ends (including scoring); draw out general conclusions about the session; and deduce general lessons which can be extrapolated to the real world. Furthermore, the participants should not be allowed to conclude what was learned without receiving feedback (Gentry, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, James W. (1990). What is Expeiential Learning? In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 9-20&lt;/ref&gt; The participants need to articulate their perception of what was learned, and the instructor needs to put things into a broader perspective. Gentry also expresses that process feedback is much more valuable than outcome feedback. As games are less-than-perfect representations of the real world, it should be the decision process used that needs to be applauded or critiqued, not the gaming outcome.
The importance of reflection, debriefing and feedback highlight the need for business simulations to supported by carefully considered learning outcomes, pedagogy and assessment tasks. Student factors such as low motivation to engage and prior skill weaknesses can undermine the ability of authentic assessment regimes to achieve the purported learning benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vos|first1=Lynn|title=Simulation games in business and marketing education: How educators assess student learning from simulations|journal=The International Journal of Management Education|date=2015|volume=13|page=16|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811715000026|accessdate=23 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.ijme.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Online Business Simulations Project funded by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching has developed a range of resources to help educators embed simulations into their classes.&lt;ref name="bizsims" /&gt;

'''Cell polarity''' refers to spatial differences in shape, structure, and function within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Almost all cell types exhibit some form of polarity, which enables them to carry out specialized functions. Classical examples of polarized cells are described below, including epithelial cells with apical-basal polarity, [[neuron]]s in which signals propagate in one direction from [[dendrite]]s to [[axon]]s, and [[Cell migration|migrating cells]]. Furthermore, cell polarity is important during many types of [[asymmetric cell division]] to set up functional asymmetries between daughter cells.

Many of the key molecular players implicated in cell polarity are well conserved. For example, in metazoan cells, the PAR-3/PAR-6/aPKC complex plays a fundamental role in cell polarity. While the biochemical details may vary, some of the core principles such as negative and/or positive feedback between different molecules are common and essential to many known polarity systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altschuler|first=Steven J.|last2=Angenent|first2=Sigurd B.|last3=Wang|first3=Yanqin|last4=Wu|first4=Lani F.|date=August 2008|title=On the spontaneous emergence of cell polarity|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07119|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7206|pages=886|doi=10.1038/nature07119|issn=1476-4687|pmc=2562338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of polarized cells==

===Epithelial cells===
{{main|Epithelial polarity}}

Epithelial cells adhere to one another through [[tight junctions]], [[desmosome]]s and [[adherens junctions]], forming sheets of cells that line the surface of the animal body and internal cavities (e.g., digestive tract and circulatory system). These cells have an apical-basal polarity defined by the [[apical membrane]] facing the outside surface of the body, or the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of internal cavities, and the [[basolateral membrane]] oriented away from the lumen. The basolateral membrane refers to both the lateral membrane where cell-cell junctions connect neighboring cells and to the basal membrane where cells are attached to the [[basement membrane]], a thin sheet of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins that separates the epithelial sheet from underlying cells and [[connective tissue]]. Epithelial cells also exhibit [[planar cell polarity]], in which specialized structures are orientated within the plane of the epithelial sheet. Some examples of planar cell polarity include the scales of fish being oriented in the same direction and similarly the feathers of birds, the fur of mammals, and the cuticular projections (sensory hairs, etc.) on the bodies and appendages of flies and other insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jun|author2=Mlodzik, Marek A.|title=A quest for the mechanism regulating global planar cell polarity of tissues|journal=Trends in Cell Biology|date=29 June 2009|volume=19|issue=7|pages=295–305|doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2009.04.003|pmid=19560358|pmc=3501338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurons===
{{main|Neuron}}
{{Further|Synapse}}

A neuron receives signals from neighboring cells through branched, cellular extensions called [[dendrites]]. The neuron then propagates an electrical signal down a specialized [[axon]] extension to the synapse, where neurotransmitters are released to propagate the signal to another neuron or effector cell (e.g., muscle or gland). The polarity of the neuron thus facilitates the directional flow of information, which is required for communication between neurons and effector cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasband|first=Matthew N.|title=The axon initial segment and the maintenance of neuronal polarity|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=August 2010|pages=552–562|doi=10.1038/nrn2852|volume=11|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migratory cells===
{{main|Cell migration}}

Many cell types are capable of migration, such as [[leukocytes]] and [[fibroblasts]], and in order for these cells to move in one direction, they must have a defined front and rear. At the front of the cell is the leading edge, which is often defined by a flat ruffling of the cell membrane called the [[lamellipodium]] or thin protrusions called [[filopodia]]. Here, [[actin]] polymerization in the direction of migration allows cells to extend the leading edge of the cell and to attach to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ridley|first=Anne J.|author2=Schwartz, Martin A. |author3=Burridge, Keith |author4=Firtel, Richard A. |author5=Ginsberg, Mark H. |author6=Borisy, Gary |author7=Parsons, J. Thomas |author8= Horwitz, Alan Rick |title=Cell Migration: Integrating Signals from Front to back|journal=Science|date=5 December 2003|volume=302|issue=5651|pages=1704–1709|doi=10.1126/science.1092053|pmid=14657486}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the rear of the cell, adhesions are disassembled and bundles of actin [[microfilaments]], called [[stress fiber]]s, contract and pull the trailing edge forward to keep up with the rest of the cell. Without this front-rear polarity, cells would be unable to coordinate directed migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedl|first=Peter|author2=Wolf, Katarina|title=Tumour-cell invasion and migration: diversity and escape mechanisms|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|date=May 2003|volume=3|pages=362–374|doi=10.1038/nrc1075|issue=5|pmid=12724734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budding yeast ===
''Main article: Polarity establishment in yeast [http://jcs.biologists.org/content/117/11/2169]''

Generation of cellular polarity is critically important for the function of practically every cell type and underlies processes like [[cell division]], [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], cell migration, cell–cell signalling and fertilization. Cell polarity is an example of the self-organization property that all living organism share. All the cells within a multicellular organism, or any single cell species i.e. yeast, displays a polarized organization necessary for its proliferation, differentiation or physiological function. Budding yeast is a highly accessible experimental system, which serves as a paradigm for deciphering the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of polarity. Yeast cells share many features about cell polarity with other organism like: regulation by intrinsic and extrinsic cues, conserved regulatory molecules such as Cdc42GTPase, and asymmetry of the cytoskeleton. Cell polarization is associated with a type of symmetry breaking, that occurs in the cytoskeleton and guides the direction of growth of the future daughter cell. This symmetry breaking facilitates the polarized flux and localization of several protein in the polarized patch. When cells can perform [[symmetry breaking]] in absence of any spatial cue ([[landmark]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wedlich-Soldner|first=Roland|last2=Li|first2=Rong|date=2003-04-01|title=Spontaneous cell polarization: undermining determinism|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncb0403-267|journal=Nature Cell Biology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=267–270|doi=10.1038/ncb0403-267}}&lt;/ref&gt; is called spontaneous polarization or spontaneous symmetry breaking.

In short, polarity establishment or symmetry breaking, in this context, is the first step for cell polarity and consequently cell division. We are interested in the spontaneous symmetry breaking, as an example of self-organization phenomena in living cells. One of the way, and one of the most popular ones, to study spontaneous symmetry breaking is by correlating it with a type of [[Reaction Diffusion|reaction- diffusion]] phenomena.

The molecular identity of most important proteins involved in leading spontaneous symmetry breaking have been extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bi|first=Erfei|last2=Park|first2=Hay-Oak|date=June 2012|title=Cell polarization and cytokinesis in budding yeast|journal=Genetics|volume=191|issue=2|pages=347–387|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.132886|issn=1943-2631|pmc=3374305|pmid=22701052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those proteins have been categorized in general modules that represent the main functional cores for yeast life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irazoqui|first=Javier E.|last2=Lew|first2=Daniel J.|date=2004-05-01|title=Polarity establishment in yeast|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/117/11/2169|journal=Journal of Cell Science|volume=117|issue=11|pages=2169–2171|doi=10.1242/jcs.00953|issn=0021-9533|pmid=15126618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this regulatory network are still poorly understood. Extensive work done in many organisms ranging from prokaryotes to high complex ones has revealed a central role of small GTPases in the cell polarization process. Particularly in yeast, this protein is [[CDC42|Cdc42]], which is a member of the eukaryotic Ras-homologous [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho-family]] of GTPases, which is part of the wider super-family of small GTPases, including Rop GTPases in plants and small GTPases in prokaryotes.

A recent study to elucidate the connection between cell cycle timing and [[CDC42|Cdc42]] accumulation in the bud site uses [[Optogenetics|optogenetic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to control protein localization using light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witte|first=Kristen|last2=Strickland|first2=Devin|last3=Glotzer|first3=Michael|date=2017-07-06|title=Cell cycle entry triggers a switch between two modes of Cdc42 activation during yeast polarization|url=http://elifesciences.org/articles/26722|journal=eLife|volume=6|doi=10.7554/eLife.26722|issn=2050-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, using [[experimental evolution]], function and robustness of yeast polarity establishment have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laan|first=Liedewij|last2=Koschwanez|first2=John H|last3=Murray|first3=Andrew W|date=2015-10-01|title=Evolutionary adaptation after crippling cell polarization follows reproducible trajectories|url=http://elifesciences.org/articles/09638|journal=eLife|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.09638|issn=2050-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertebrate development==
{{see also|Embryogenesis|Embryonic development}}

The bodies of vertebrate animals are asymmetric along three axes: [[anterior and posterior|anterior-posterior]] (head to tail), [[dorsal-ventral]] (spine to belly), and left-right (for example, our heart is on the left side of our body). These polarities arise within the developing embryo through a combination of several processes: 1) [[asymmetric cell division]], in which two daughter cells receive different amounts of cellular material (e.g. mRNA, proteins), 2) asymmetric localization of specific proteins or RNAs within cells (which is often mediated by the cytoskeleton), 3) concentration gradients of secreted proteins across the embryo such as [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]], [[NODAL|Nodal]], and [[Bone Morphogenic Proteins]] (BMPs), and 4) differential expression of membrane receptors and ligands that cause lateral inhibition, in which the receptor-expressing cell adopts one fate and its neighbors another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashimoto|first=Masakazu|author2=Hamada, Hiroshi|title=Translation of anterior-posterior polarity into left-right polarity in the mouse embryo|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|date=August 2010|volume=20|issue=4|pages=433–437|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2010.04.002|pmid=20439159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Daniel St|author2=Ahringer, Julie|title=Cell Polarity in Eggs and Epithelia: Parallels and Diversity|journal=Cell|date=28 May 2010|volume=141|issue=5|pages=757–774|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.05.011|pmid=20510924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to defining asymmetric axes in the adult organism, cell polarity also regulates both individual and collective cell movements during embryonic development such as [[apical constriction]], [[invagination]], and [[epiboly]]. These movements are critical for shaping the embryo and creating the complex structures of the adult body.

==Molecular basis==
Cell polarity arises primarily through the localization of specific proteins to specific areas of the cell membrane. This localization often requires both the recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins to the cell membrane and polarized [[vesicle transport]] along [[cytoskeletal]] filaments to deliver transmembrane proteins from the [[golgi apparatus]]. Many of the molecules responsible for regulating cell polarity are conserved across cell types and throughout metazoan species. Examples include the PAR complex ([[Cdc42]], [[F2RL2|PAR3]]/ASIP, PAR6, atypical [[protein kinase C]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Izumi Y, Hirose T, Tamai Y, Hirai S, Nagashima Y, Fujimoto T, Tabuse Y, Kemphues KJ, Ohno S |title=An Atypical PKC Directly Associates and Colocalizes at the Epithelial Tight Junction with ASIP, a Mammalian Homologue of ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' Polarity Protein PAR-3|journal=J Cell Biol|volume=143|issue=1|pages=95–106|year=October 1998|id=|pmid=9763423|pmc=2132825|doi=10.1083/jcb.143.1.95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tabuse Y, Izumi Y, Piano F, Kemphues KJ, Miwa J, Ohno S |title=Atypical protein kinase C cooperates with PAR-3 to establish embryonic polarity in Caenorhabditis elegans|journal=Development|volume=125|issue=18|pages=3607–3614.|year=September 1998|id=|pmid=9716526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumbs complex (Crb, PALS, PATJ, Lin7), and Scribble complex (Scrib, Dlg, Lgl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryant|first=David M.|author2=Mostov, Keith E.|title=From cells to organs: building polarized tissue|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=November 2008|volume=9|pages=887–901|doi=10.1038/nrm2523|issue=11|pmc=2921794}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These polarity complexes are localized at the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, asymmetrically within cells. For example, in epithelial cells the PAR and Crumbs complexes are localized along the apical membrane and the Scribble complex along the lateral membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Daniel St|author2=Ahringer, Julie|title=Cell Polarity in Eggs and Epithelia: Parallels and Diversity|journal=Cell|date=28 May 2010|volume=141|issue=5|pages=757–774|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.05.011|pmid=20510924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with a group of signaling molecules called [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho GTPases]], these polarity complexes can regulate vesicle transport and also control the localization of cytoplasmic proteins primarily by regulating the phosphorylation of phospholipids called [[phosphoinositides]]. Phosphoinositides serve as docking sites for proteins at the cell membrane, and their state of phosphorylation determines which proteins can bind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orlando|first=Kelly|author2=Guo, Wei|title=Organization and Dynamics in Cell Polarity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|date=November 2009|volume=1|issue=5|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a001321|page=a001321|pmc=2773647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polarity establishment ==
While many of the key polarity proteins are well conserved, different mechanisms exist to establish cell polarity in different cell types. Here, two main classes can be distinguished: cells that are able to polarize spontaneously and cells that establish polarity based on intrinsic or environmental cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wedlich-Soldner|first=Roland|last2=Li|first2=Rong|date=2003-04-01|title=Spontaneous cell polarization: undermining determinism|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb0403-267|journal=Nature Cell Biology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=267–270|doi=10.1038/ncb0403-267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spontaneous symmetry breaking can be explained by amplification of stochastic fluctuations of molecules due to non-linear chemical kinetics. The mathematical basis for this biological phenomenon was established by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1953 paper '[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis|The chemical basis of morphogensis]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turing|first=A. M.|last2=S|first2=F. R.|date=1952-08-14|title=The chemical basis of morphogenesis|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/237/641/37|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B|volume=237|issue=641|pages=37–72|doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012|issn=0080-4622}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Turing initially attempted to explain pattern formation in a multicellular system, similar mechanisms can also be applied to intracellular pattern formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gierer|first=A.|last2=Meinhardt|first2=H.|date=1972-12-01|title=A theory of biological pattern formation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289234|journal=Kybernetik|volume=12|issue=1|pages=30–39|doi=10.1007/BF00289234|issn=0023-5946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, if a network of at least two interacting chemicals (in this case proteins) exhibits certain types of reaction kinetics, as well as differential diffusion, stochastic concentration fluctuations can give rise to the formation of large-scale stable patterns, thus, bridging from a molecular length scale to a cellular or even tissue scale.

A prime example for the second type of polarity establishment, which relies on extracellular or intracellular cues, is the ''C. elegans'' zygote. Here, mutual inhibition between two sets of proteins guides polarity establishment and maintenance. On the one hand PAR-3, PAR-6 and aPKC (called anterior PAR proteins) occupy both plasma membrane and the cytoplasm prior to symmetry breaking. PAR-1, the C. elegans specific ring-finger-containing protein PAR-2, and LGL-1 (called posterior PAR proteins) are present mostly in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_asymcelldiv/asymcelldiv.html|title=Asymmetric cell division and axis formation in the embryo|website=www.wormbook.org|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male centrosome provides a cue, which breaks an initially homogenous membrane distribution of anterior PARs by inducing cortical flows. These are thought to advect anterior PARs towards one side of the cell, allowing posterior PARs to bind to other pole (posterior).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munro|first=Edwin|last2=Nance|first2=Jeremy|last3=Priess|first3=James R.|date=2004-09-01|title=Cortical Flows Powered by Asymmetrical Contraction Transport PAR Proteins to Establish and Maintain Anterior-Posterior Polarity in the Early C. elegans Embryo|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S1534-5807(04)00276-X|journal=Developmental Cell|language=English|volume=7|issue=3|pages=413–424|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.001|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goehring|first=Nathan W.|last2=Trong|first2=Philipp Khuc|last3=Bois|first3=Justin S.|last4=Chowdhury|first4=Debanjan|last5=Nicola|first5=Ernesto M.|last6=Hyman|first6=Anthony A.|last7=Grill|first7=Stephan W.|date=2011-11-25|title=Polarization of PAR Proteins by Advective Triggering of a Pattern-Forming System|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6059/1137|journal=Science|volume=334|issue=6059|pages=1137–1141|doi=10.1126/science.1208619|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22021673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anterior and posterior PAR proteins then maintain polarity until cytokinesis by mutually excluding each other from their respective cell membrane areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3581">'''COBWEB''' is an incremental system for hierarchical [[conceptual clustering]]. COBWEB was invented by Professor [[Douglas H. Fisher (Computer Science)|Douglas H. Fisher]], currently at Vanderbilt University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Douglas|title=Knowledge acquisition via incremental conceptual clustering|journal=Machine Learning|year=1987|volume=2|issue=2|pages=139–172|doi=10.1007/BF00114265|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qj16212n7537n6p3/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author = Fisher, Douglas H.|title = Improving inference through conceptual clustering|booktitle = Proceedings of the 1987 AAAI Conferences|conference = AAAI Conference|location = Seattle Washington|pages = 461–465|date = July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBWEB incrementally organizes observations into a [[classification tree]]. Each node in a classification tree represents a class (concept) and is labeled by a probabilistic concept that summarizes the attribute-value distributions of objects classified under the node. This classification tree can be used to predict missing attributes or the class of a new object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Formal approaches in categorization|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521190480|pages=253–273|url=https://www.amazon.com/Formal-Approaches-Categorization-Emmanuel-Pothos/dp/0521140722|author=William Iba and Pat Langley|editor=Emmanuel M. Pothos and Andy J. Wills,|chapter=Cobweb models of categorization and probabilistic concept formation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four basic operations COBWEB employs in building the classification tree. Which operation is selected depends on the [[category utility]] of the classification achieved by applying it. The operations are:
* Merging Two Nodes &lt;br/&gt; Merging two nodes means replacing them by a node whose children is the union of the original nodes' sets of children and which summarizes the attribute-value distributions of all objects classified under them.
* Splitting a node&lt;br/&gt; A node is split by replacing it with its children.
* Inserting a new node&lt;br/&gt; A node is created corresponding to the object being inserted into the tree.
* Passing an object down the hierarchy&lt;br/&gt; Effectively calling the COBWEB algorithm on the object and the subtree rooted in the node.

==The COBWEB Algorithm==

   ''COBWEB''(''root'', ''record''):
   Input: A COBWEB node ''root'', an instance to insert ''record''
   ''if'' ''root'' has no children ''then''
     ''children'' := {''copy''(''root'')}
     ''newcategory''(''record'') \\ adds child with record’s feature values.
     ''insert''(''record'', ''root'') \\ update root’s statistics
   ''else''
     ''insert''(''record'', ''root'')
     ''for'' ''child'' ''in'' ''root''’s children ''do''
       calculate Category Utility for ''insert''(''record'', ''child''),
       set ''best1'', ''best2'' children w. best CU.
     ''end for''
     ''if'' ''newcategory''(''record'') yields best CU then
       ''newcategory''(''record'')
     ''else'' ''if'' ''merge''(''best1'', ''best2'') yields best CU then
       ''merge''(''best1'', ''best2'')
       ''COBWEB''(''root'', ''record'')
     ''else if'' ''split''(''best1'') yields best CU then
       ''split''(''best1'')
       ''COBWEB''(''root'', ''record'')
     ''else''
       ''COBWEB''(''best1'', ''record'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">Juvenile law pertains to those who are deemed to be below the [[age of majority]], which varies by country and culture. Usually, minors are treated differently under the law. However, even minors may be prosecuted as adults.

== Summary ==
In both [[France]] and the [[United States]], some actions are prohibited to minors, such as the underage consumption of alcohol or tobacco, truancy, running away from home, and ungovernability. A minor can thus become a [[status offender]].

===United States===
In the United States, the juvenile varies in definition from state to state. The system applies to anyone between the ages of 6 to 10, depending on the state, and 18;&lt;ref&gt;[[American juvenile justice system]]&lt;/ref&gt; except for 11 states (including Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas), where a juvenile is a person under 17 and New York and North Carolina, where it is under 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[juvenile law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, criminal majority begins at 16, 17, or 18.

The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act of 1974 set up four key requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html The federal ''Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130182242/http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html |date=2006-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for US minors:
* Firstly, the deinstitutionalization of status offenders, moving them from juvenile hall to community-based or family-based environments.
* Secondly, segregation (sight and sound separation) between juvenile and adult offenders
* Thirdly,  strong limitation for the juvenile justice system to put juveniles in adult jails.
*Fourthly, the protection of minority groups from being overrepresented in high-security facilities.

All states participate except South Dakota and Wyoming.

===France===
France has three stages of minors:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://fr.jurispedia.org/index.php/Minorité_pénale_%28fr%29 Jurispedia, Minorité pénale]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* The infant, still without a perception of acts yet, commits no offence and so cannot be convicted.
* A minor between 7/8 and 13 has his own discernment. No criminal punishment but only educative measures can be pronounced against him, according to a 2002 law.
* A minor between 13 and 18 who commits an offence can have punishment that is educational or, in special cases, criminal.

The criminal irresponsibility of children under 13 is defined by the Article 122-8 of the Criminal Code. Those between 13 and 18 are assumed to be irresponsible, but they can be involved in a criminal sentence if the circumstances and the juvenile's delinquent personality justify.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
According to Jean Pierre Rosenczveig, a children's judge in [[Bobigny]], near [[Paris]], the juvenile criminal law in France has six key requirements:&lt;ref&gt;Rosenczveig, Jean Pierre; ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011342/http://www.rosenczveig.com/Nanterre/Fac2%20-%202006-2007.pdf Droit pénal des mineurs, étude de]''&lt;/ref&gt;
# The specialization of the magistrate. Indeed, the juvenile criminal system has its own intervener: the children's judge, the court of assizes of minors, the court of appeal chamber of minors etc.
# Criminal relative responsibility begins at the age of 13.
# The priority is to educate, rather than punish. Article 2 of the order of February 2, 1945 imposes an educative-placing proposal to minors to whom a detention placing measure is considered.
# Parents have to be informed of their child's police custody. Moreover, Article 13 of the same order imposes an examination of the parents before the decision of the tribunal. Also, before the juvenile's police custody, the service for the legal protection of youth must be called.
# Requirement of an attorney for the juvenile. If he does not contact one, the jurisdiction has to do it for him.

In the US, the presence of an attorney is only recommended, not compulsory.

In most states, special courts try juveniles, but some like Colorado do not have them. Some crimes allow juvenile delinquents to be tried by the superior court (such as first-degree murderer or gang murder).

Juveniles also have special protections, in addition of juvenile courts, which are closed to the public in the US. In France, closing the court to the public (''huis clos'') is an option.  Just like in France, US parents or guardians have to be informed and to be present during the police questioning. At least, the names of juveniles are kept confidential when they are accused of a crime. Juvenile cases are heard by not a jury but a judge.

At least, the US criminal law system has a particular vocabulary for juveniles' cases. Indeed, juvenile offenders commit not a crime but a delinquent act. Also, courts use the term delinquent or not delinquent, instead of guilty or not guilty, just to show that a minor is different from a criminal.

Juveniles have the same rights as adults. They are assumed innocent, they are noticed of charges advance of any adjudication of delinquency, they have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and they have the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

After their arrest, in both countries, minors may be placed in provisory detention (until a [[European Convention on Human Rights]] case banned it in France) if the parents are prejudiced and informed. Provisory detention is done in a juvenile hall, separated from adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm US Info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713074258/http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

US parents may be liable for the acts of their child if they failed their parent’s authority, an example being if the minor is involved in a gang offense. Also, juveniles have no right to bail.

As can be noted, UD and French procedures are not that different as they have a common goal: to protect, as much as possible, the interest of the minor offender. Nevertheless, except for detention (the separation from adults as well as parents' awareness), the priorities are different. The US prefers the confidentiality of minors, but France stresses accommodating the juvenile within the criminal system.

Both systems protect but not in the same way. In France, an attorney is compulsory. In the US, there is no jury.

As notef, the goal of the juvenile justice in France and the US is clearly to educate child offenders, rather than punish them, even if some measures can be severe.

== Sanctions incurred by minors ==
The order of February 2, 1945 relative to the childhood delinquency contains three measures to punish French minor offenders:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* Firstly, the educational measure can be an admonition, a particular educational placing, under legal protection (up to five years) or a supervised freedom.
* Secondly, the mediation-retrieval measure in which the minor is involved in the reparation of the damage he caused. The victim must approve. A minor between 16 and 18 may be submitted to a general interest working.
* Thirdly, the imprisonment measure that may not exceed half of the adult imprisonment term. However, oldest minors (over 16) may have the same penalty as adults if the offence is serious.

The punishment depends of minor's age. As aforesaid, if he is under 7 or 8, he can have no punishment. If he is between 8 and 13, the sentence is nothing more than an educational punishment. If he is over 13, he can have both an educational and a criminal punishment, but the tribunal has to explain its decision according to the minor's personality and the circumstances.

The US is less divided. The penalry is equal for each juvenile offender over 10, and there is no stage differentiation between measures. However, the measures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoline.org/InformationLibrary/Documents/Juvenile%20Sanctions%20fj.asp Juvenile Sanctions, Info Online]&lt;/ref&gt; themsrlves are quite the same:
* Placing the delinquent in the care of an institution to take care of him
* Placing the delinquent in an alternative incarceration program
* Ordering the delinquent to participate in a treatment program
* Ordering the child to work in public buildings or private property
* Ordering the child to take part to the reparation of the damage he caused
* Committing the delinquent to the Department of Children and Families if his family is not adequate.

Since 1988, the death penalty for children who committed crimes has been outlawed. Also, in March 2005, the death penalty was outlawed for killers who committed their crimes before the age of 18. There were 72 peoples in [[death row]] concerned at the time.

As can be seen, the US and the French systems protect juvenile differently, but both protect effectively. There is also much stress on the prevention of delinquency in both countries.

'''Congruence bias''' is a type of [[cognitive bias]] similar to [[confirmation bias]]. Congruence bias occurs due to people's overreliance on directly testing a given [[hypothesis]] as well as neglecting indirect testing.

==Examples==
Suppose that, in an [[experiment]]al setting, a subject is presented with two buttons and told that pressing one of those buttons, but not the other, will open a door. The subject adopts the hypothesis that the button on the left opens the door in question. A direct test of this hypothesis would be pressing the button on the left; an indirect test would be pressing the button on the right. The latter is still a valid test because once the result of the door's remaining closed is found, the left button is proven to be the desired button. (This example is parallel to Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin's example in the psychology classic, ''[[#CITEREFBrunerGoodnowAustin1956|A Study of Thinking]]''.)

It is possible to take this idea of direct and indirect testing and apply it to more complicated experiments in order to explain the presence of a congruence bias in people. In an experiment, a subject will test his own usually naive hypothesis again and again instead of trying to disprove it.

The classic example of subjects' congruence bias was discovered by [[Peter Cathcart Wason|Peter Wason]] ([[#CITEREFWason1960|1960]], [[#CITEREFWason1968|1968]]).  Here, the experimenter gave subjects the number sequence "2, 4, 6", telling the subjects that this sequence followed a particular rule and instructing subjects to find the rule underlying the sequence logic. Subjects provided their own number sequences as tests to see if they could ascertain the rule dictating which numbers could be included in the sequence and which could not. Most subjects respond to the task by quickly deciding that the underlying rule is "numbers ascending by 2", and provide as tests only sequences concordant with this rule, such as "3, 5, 7," or even "pi plus 2, plus 4, plus 6". Each of these sequences follows the underlying rule the experimenter is thinking of, though "numbers ascending by 2" is not the actual criterion being used. However, because subjects succeed at repeatedly testing the same singular principle, they naively believe their chosen hypothesis is correct. When a subject offers up to the experimenter the hypothesis "numbers ascending by 2" only to be told he is wrong, much confusion usually ensues. At this point, many subjects attempt to change the wording of the rule without changing its meaning, and even those who switch to indirect testing have trouble letting go of the "+ 2" convention, producing potential rules as idiosyncratic as "the first two numbers in the sequence are random, and the third number is the second number plus two". Many subjects never realize that the actual rule the experimenter was using was simply just to list ascending numbers, because of the subjects' inability to consider indirect tests of their hypotheses.

==Cognitive basis==
Wason attributed this failure of subjects to an inability to consider alternative hypotheses, which is the root of the congruence bias. [[Jonathan Baron]] explains that subjects could be said to be using a "congruence heuristic", wherein a hypothesis is tested only by thinking of results that would be found if that hypothesis is true. This heuristic, which many people seem to use, ignores alternative hypotheses.

Baron suggests the following heuristics to avoid falling into the congruence bias trap:
# Ask "How likely is a yes answer, if I assume that my hypothesis is false?" Remember to choose a test that has a high probability of giving some answer if the hypothesis is true, and a low probability if it is false.
# "Try to think of alternative hypotheses; then choose a test most likely to distinguish them—a test that will probably give different results depending on which is true." An example of the need for the heuristic could be seen in a doctor's attempting to diagnose [[appendicitis]]. In that situation, assessing a [[white blood cell]] count would not assist in diagnosis because an elevated white blood cell count is associated with a number of maladies.

'''Depression glass''' is clear or colored translucent machine made glassware that was distributed free, or at low cost, in the United States and Canada around the time of the [[Great Depression]]. 

==History==
Much depression glass is [[uranium glass]]. The [[Quaker Oats Company]], and other food manufacturers and distributors, put a piece of glassware in boxes of food, as an incentive to purchase. Some movie theaters and businesses handed out pieces to patrons.

Most of this glassware was made in the Ohio River Valley of the United States, where access to raw materials and power made manufacturing inexpensive in the first half of the twentieth century. More than twenty manufacturers made more than 100 patterns, and entire dinner sets were made in some patterns. Common colors are clear (crystal), pink, pale blue, green, and amber. Less common colors include yellow (canary), ultramarine, [[Jadeite (kitchenware)|jadeite]] (opaque pale green), delphite (opaque pale blue), cobalt blue, red (ruby and royal ruby), black, amethyst, monax, and white (milk glass).

Although of marginal quality, Depression glass has been highly collectible since the 1960s. Due to its popularity as a [[collectible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/east-jefferson/index.ssf/2011/03/crescent_city_depression_glass.html|title=Crescent City Depression glass show to be held in Kenner|publisher=The Times-Picayune |date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is becoming more scarce on the open market. Rare pieces may sell for several hundred dollars. Some manufacturers continued to make popular patterns after World War II, or introduced similar patterns, which are also collectible. Popular and expensive patterns and pieces have been reproduced, and reproductions are still being made.

==Elegant glass==
Often confused with Depression glass is [[Elegant glass]], which is of much better quality. It was distributed through jewelry and department stores from the 1920s through the 1950s, and was an alternative to fine china. Most of the Elegant glassware manufacturers had closed by the end of the 1950s, when cheap glassware and imported china replaced Elegant glass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15053">'''Design for the Environment''' (DfE) is a design approach to reduce the overall human health and environmental impact of a product, process or service, where impacts are considered across its life cycle. Different software tools have been developed to assist designers in finding optimized products or processes/services. DfE is also the original name of a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) program, created in 1992, that works to prevent pollution, and the risk pollution presents to humans and the environment. The program provides information regarding safer [[Chemical substance|chemical formulations]] for cleaning and other products.&lt;ref name=DfE&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice |title=Safer Choice |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA renamed its program [[EPA Safer Choice|"Safer Choice"]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/history-safer-choice-and-design-environment |title=History of Safer Choice and Design for the Environment |date=2017-04-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Updated Fig.1 Pie.png|thumb|Each piece of the pie chart depicts the role that the individual processes play in the overall design and production of a product.  In recent years the environment has begun to play an important role in this diagram. If any piece is missing, production may not be able to occur. This figure was adopted from Conrad Luttropp and Jessica Lagerstedt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luttropp|first=Conrad|author2=Jessica Lagerstedt|title=EcoDesign and The Ten Golden Rules: generic advice for merging environmental aspects into product development|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Initial guidelines for a DfE approach were written in 1990 by [[East Meets West (non-governmental organization)|East Meets West]], a New York-based non-governmental organization. It became a global movement targeting design initiatives and incorporating environmental motives to improve product design in order to minimize health and environmental impacts by incorporating it from design stage all the way to the manufacturing process. The DfE strategy aims to improve technology and design tactics to expand the scope of products. By incorporating [[eco-efficiency]] into design tactics, DfE takes into consideration the entire life-cycle of the product, while still making products usable but minimizing resource use. The key focus of DfE is to minimize the [[Environmental economics|environmental-economic]] cost to consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luttropp|first=Conrad|author2=Jessica Lagerstedt|title=Design and The Ten Golden Rules: generic advice for merging environmental aspects into product development|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=11 November 2011|volume=14|pages=1396–1408|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2005.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still focusing on the life-cycle framework of the product. By balancing both customer needs as well as environmental and social impacts DfE aims to "improve the product use experience both for consumers and producers, while minimally impacting the environment".

==Design for Environment practices==
[[File:Designforenvironment fig1.png|thumb|Resource consumption and mitigation strategies for product production which minimizes environmental and health impacts.This figure has been adapted from Spangenberg et al.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spangenberg|first=Joachim H. |author2=Alastair Fuad- Luke |author3=Karen Blincoe|title=Design for Sustainability (DfS): the interface of sustainable production and consumption|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=16 June 2010|volume=18|pages=1485–1493|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.06.002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 10, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Four main concepts that fall under the DfE umbrella.&lt;ref name="DfE"/&gt;

* '''Design for environmental processing and manufacturing''': This ensures that raw material [[Resource extraction|extraction]] (mining, drilling, etc.), processing (processing reusable materials, metal melting, etc.) and [[manufacturing]] are done using materials and processes which are not dangerous to the environment or the employees working on said processes. This includes the minimization of waste and hazardous by-products, air pollution, energy expenditure and other factors.
* '''Design for environmental packaging''': This ensures that the materials used in [[packaging]] are environmentally friendly, which can be achieved through the reuse of shipping products, elimination of unnecessary paper and packaging products, efficient use of materials and space, use of [[Recycling|recycled]] and/or recyclable materials.
* '''Design for disposal or reuse''': The [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] of a product is very important, because some products emit dangerous chemicals into the air, ground and water after they are disposed of in a landfill. Planning for the [[reuse]] or [[Remanufacturing|refurbishing]] of a product will change the types of materials that would be used, how they could later be disassembled and reused, and the environmental impacts such materials have.
* '''Design for energy efficiency''': The design of products to reduce overall energy consumption throughout the product's life.

[[Life cycle assessment]] (LCA) is employed to forecast the impacts of different (production) alternatives of the product in question, thus being able to choose the most [[environmentally friendly]]. A life cycle analysis can serve as a tool when determining the environmental impact of a product or process. Proper LCAs can help a designer compare several different products according to several categories, such as [[energy]] use, [[toxicity]], acidification, [[Carbon dioxide|CO2 emissions]], [[ozone depletion]], [[resource depletion]] and many others. By comparing different products, designers can make decisions about which environmental hazard to focus on in order to make the product more environmentally friendly.

==Why do firms want to design for the environment?==
Modern day businesses all aim to produce goods at a low cost while maintaining quality, staying competitive in the global marketplace, and meeting consumer preferences for more environment friendly products. To help businesses meet these challenges, EPA encourages businesses to incorporate environmental considerations into the design process. The benefits of incorporating DfE include: cost savings, reduced business and environmental risks, expanded business and market opportunities, and to meet environmental regulations.&lt;ref name="EPA brochure 2001"&gt;{{cite report |date=March 2001 |title=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Design for the Environment Program |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000132E.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 744-F-00-020. Brochure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Companies and products==
[[File:Designfortheenvironment Fig3.png|thumb|Designfortheenvironment Fig3]]
*[[Starbucks]]: Starbucks is decreasing its carbon footprint by building more energy efficient stores and facilities, conserving energy and water, and purchasing renewable energy credits. Starbucks has achieved [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certificates in 116 stores in 12 countries. Starbucks has even created a portable, LEED certified store in Denver. It is Starbucks' goal to reduce energy consumption by 25% and to cover 100% of its electricity with renewable energy by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Mark|title=An Experimental New Starbucks Store: Tiny, Portable, and Hyper Local|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670889/an-experimental-new-starbucks-store-tiny-portable-and-hyper-local#1|publisher=Co.design}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hewlett Packard]]: HP is working towards reducing energy used in manufacturing, developing materials that have less environmental impact, and designing easily recyclable equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HP Design for Environment|url=http://www.destinationgreenit.com/hp-design-for-environment|publisher=Destination Green IT|accessdate=14 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331090652/http://www.destinationgreenit.com/hp-design-for-environment|archivedate=31 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[IBM]]: Their goal is to extend product life beyond just production, and to use reusable and recyclable products. This means that IBM is currently working on creating products that can be safely disposed of at the end of its product life. They are also reducing consumption of energy to minimize their carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product Stewardship|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/products/|publisher=IBM|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philips]]: For almost 20 years now, sustainable development has been a crucial part of Philips decision making and manufacturing process. Philips' goal is to produce products with their environmental responsibility in mind. Not only are they working on reducing energy during the manufacturing process, Phillips is also participating in a unique project, philanthropy through design. Since 2005, Philips has been working on and developing philanthropy through design. They collaborate with other organizations to use their expertise and innovation to help the more fragile parts of our society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards a Sustainable Future|url=http://www.design.philips.com/sites/philipsdesign/about/design/aboutus/sustainablefuture/index.page|publisher=Philips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these large brand names there are several other consumer product companies in the DfE program this including:

*Atlantic Chemical &amp; Equipment Co. 
*American Cleaning Solutions
*BCD Supply
*Beta Technology
*Brighton USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labeled Products and Our Partners|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/projects/formulat/formpart.htm|publisher=EPA|accessdate=14 April 2013}}{{Update inline|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How does a business design for the environment?==
A business can design for the environment by:
* Evaluating the human health and environmental impacts of its processes and products. 
* Identifying what information is needed to make human health and environment decisions
* Conducting an assessment of alternatives
* Considering cross-media impacts and the benefits of substituting chemicals
* Reducing the use and release of toxic chemicals through the innovation of cleaner technologies that use safer chemicals.
* Implementing pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and other resource conservation measures. 
* Making products that can be reused and recycled
* Monitoring the environmental impacts and costs associated with each product or process
* Recognizing that although change can be rapid, in many cases a cycle of evaluation and continuous improvement is needed.&lt;ref name=DfE /&gt;

==Safer Choice labeling program==
EPA's DfE labeling program was renamed [[EPA Safer Choice|"Safer Choice"]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"/&gt;

==Current U.S. laws and regulations encouraging DfE in the electronics industry==
===National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)===
EPA promulgated the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) to establish basic air pollution control requirements across the U.S. The NAAQS sets standards on six main sources of pollutants, which include emissions of: [[ozone]] (0.12 ppm per 1 hour), [[carbon monoxide]] (35 ppm per 1 hour; primary standard), [[particulate matter]] (50g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), [[sulfur dioxide]] (80g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (100g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), and [[lead]] emissions (1.5g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NAAQS Table |url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table |website=Criteria Air Pollutants |publisher=EPA |date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratospheric ozone protection===
[[Stratospheric ozone]] protection is required by section 602 of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1990. This regulation aims to decrease emission of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) and other chemicals that are destroying the stratospheric ozone layer. The protection initiative categorizes ozone-depleting substances into two classes: Class I, and Class II.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act Requirements"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ozone Protection under Title VI of the Clean Air Act |url=https://www.epa.gov/ozone-layer-protection/ozone-protection-under-title-vi-clean-air-act |publisher=EPA |date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7762">'''Development studies''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[social science]]. Development studies is offered as a specialized master's degree in a number of universities, and, less commonly, as an undergraduate degree. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in the [[third world]] and in countries with a colonial history, such as the [[UK]], where development studies originated.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, U. (ed), ''A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies'' – but see ''The Journal of Peasant Studies'' 34/1 (2007) for an alternative view.&lt;/ref&gt; Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs), private sector development consultancy firms, [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) bodies and research centers.

==Professional bodies==

Throughout the world, a number of professional bodies for development studies have been founded:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccda.net/about.html About ICCDA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Europe]]: European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI)
* [[Latin America]]: Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO)
* [[Asia]]: Asian Political and International Studies Association (APISA)
* [[Africa]]: Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) and  Organization for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA)
* [[Arabic world]]: Arab Institutes and Centers for Economic and Social Development Research (AICARDES)

The common umbrella organisation of these association is the Inter-regional Coordinating Committee of Development Associations (ICCDA). In the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]], the [[Development Studies Association]] is a major source of information for research on and studying in development studies. Its mission is to connect and promote those working on development research.

==History==
The emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the [[third world]] after [[decolonisation]]. In the immediate post-war period, [[development economics]], a branch of [[economics]], arose out of previous studies in colonial economics. By the 1960s, an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, U. (ed), ''A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies''&lt;/ref&gt; Development studies arose as a result of this, initially aiming to integrate ideas of [[politics]] and economics. Since then, it has become an increasingly inter- and multi-disciplinary subject, encompassing [[Development studies#Disciplines of development studies|a variety of social scientific fields]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. (2003) ''Theories of Industrial Modernization and Enterprise Development: A Review''. ISR/Google Books, Second revised edition {{ISBN|978-0-906321-26-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes. The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the [[Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address|inauguration speech]] of [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Rist, G., ''The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Point Four of his speech, with reference to Latin America and other poor nations, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/swearing-in/address/address-by-harry-s-truman-1949|title=Address by Harry S. Truman, 1949|last=|first=|date=|website=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries. More recently, the emergency of [[human security]] – a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing precognitions of a relationship between security and development. Humans security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.

'''Dictation''' is the transcription of spoken text: one person who is "dictating" speaks and another who is "taking dictation" writes down the words as they are spoken. Among speakers of several languages, dictation is used as a test of [[language skill]], similar to [[spelling bee]]s in the English-speaking world. Secondary to teaching language skills, the exercise of dictation has also been used to introduce students to literary works, and to instill morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrich|first1=Leon W.|last2=Jones|first2=Olivia Mary|title=School Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8EBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|year=1904|publisher=Editors of School Work|pages=62–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first known written use of the word was in 1581. It derives from Latin, ''dictare'' (to assert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictated?show=0&amp;t=1341690020|title=Dictaphone|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

The exercise requires at least two persons: a reciter and a recorder. The reciter reads a selected text, evenly and clearly and at audible volume, by snippets of multiple words (three to ten or as need be). The text is transcribed by the recorders, as the reciter proceeds. Each snippet is read by the reciter at first slowly, then repeated once or twice at a normal pace. Once the selection has been read to the end in this way, the reciter reads the text once again from start to finish at a normal pace.  The recorders then have time to re-read their work, and edit where necessary. The exercise in [[Bloom's taxonomy#Cognitive|knowledge, comprehension and application]] comes to a close.

The [[Bloom's taxonomy|analysis and evaluation]] step now proceeds as follows, upon the revelation of the selected text. The process requires a red pen, and can be varied according to the maturity of the recorders, or as to taste:
* the reciter gathers the written work of the recorders and evaluates it;
* the recorders are given the selection and expected to grade themselves.
The latter auto-evaluation process is quicker, but is sometimes trickier for two reasons: one, the handwriting of the recorder is indistinguishable from that of the evaluator; and two, the severity of the evaluator may be in question as the same person (or class of persons) is employed.

The selected texts are often taken from a sentence, a paragraph or a page of a published book, and may include an homily in morals, honesty or nobility.  Biblical passages or pages from the [[La Fontaine's Fables|''Fables'' of La Fontaine]] have been employed with success throughout the ages.

==Dictation in different languages==

===French===

For speakers of [[French language|French]], ''la dictée'' is a school exercise that aims at testing the mastery of [[orthography]] and [[grammar]]. Since many features of [[French grammar]] are distinguished in writing but not in speech, this can be a challenging task.

Some ''dictées'' became famous for their difficulty or their interest, like those of [[Prosper Mérimée]] and [[Bernard Pivot]]. In several countries of the world (including [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], and [[Canada]]), the dictations are the subject of structured championships, similar to English [[spelling bee]]s.

===Korean===

In [[South Korea]], ''badasseugi'' ([[Hangul]]: 받아쓰기) is a school exercise for children in the lower grades of [[Primary education|elementary school]]s. The [[Korean language]] is written using [[hangul]], which is basically a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] alphabet; however, Hangul writing is also [[morphophonemic]], so [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] knowledge (in addition to familiarity with hangul) is necessary for correct dictation. Also, [[Phonology|phonological]] rules such as [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], and deletion can cause pronunciation to be different from what the written form may suggest. ''Badasseugi'' may take form of a word, a phrase, or a sentence, and is similar to spelling tests.

===Chinese===

Dictation in Chinese ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 听写 [[Pinyin]]: ''tīng xiě'', literally means 'listen and write') is a vital part of Chinese primary school education curriculum.  [[Chinese characters]] are unique because a single syllable can have different corresponding characters.  Since Chinese dictation is usually done in phrases (i.e. words are made up of more than one characters), this can help the person taking dictation to determine the proper character through phrases. Dictation also increases students' ability to write characters properly.

In modern [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory, '''diffusion damping''', also called '''photon diffusion damping''',&lt;!--'''collisionless damping''',CAN'T FIND A SOURCE TO SUPPORT THIS--&gt; is a physical process which reduced density inequalities ([[anisotropies]]) in the early [[universe]], making the universe itself and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], during the epoch of ''[[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', [[Photon diffusion|diffusing photons]] travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], the [[Doppler effect]], and [[gravitational redshift|the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation]], for the eventual formation of [[galaxies]] and [[galaxy clusters]], these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a [[damping]] ''by'' diffusion, not ''of'' diffusion.&lt;ref name=hu_physics2&gt;Hu, Sugiyama &amp; Silk (1996-04-28), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--ANOTHER (newer) STORY? Photon diffusion is one of two effects which damp small scale ''temperature'' anisotropies. The other may be termed [[statistical damping]]; it occurs when the width of the fluctuation is less than the width of the [[last scattering surface]].&lt;ref name=longair450 /&gt; 
--&gt;

The strength of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the ''damping factor'', which figures into the [[Boltzmann equation]], an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB.&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt; The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The primary effects on the diffusion length are from the properties of the plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt; The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the '''Silk scale''' and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the '''Silk mass''' and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies.&lt;ref name=madsen99101 /&gt;

Diffusion damping took place about 13.8 billion years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; during the stage of the early universe called ''[[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'' or matter-radiation ''decoupling''. This period occurred about 320,000 years after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to a [[redshift]] of around ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1090.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ade |first1=P. A.

Prior to the recombination epoch, this ''soup'', a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], was largely [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to the [[electromagnetic radiation]] of photons. This meant that the permanently excited photons were scattered by the protons and electrons too often to travel very far in straight lines.&lt;ref name=hu6&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  During the recombination epoch, the universe cooled rapidly as free electrons were captured by atomic nuclei; atoms formed from their constituent parts and the universe became transparent: the amount of photon scattering decreased dramatically. Scattering less, photons could diffuse (travel) much greater distances.&lt;ref name=hu_physics2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=liddle63120&gt;Liddle &amp; Lyth (2000-04-13), p. 63, 120&lt;/ref&gt; There was no significant diffusion damping for electrons, which could not diffuse nearly as far as photons could in similar circumstances. Thus all damping by electron diffusion is negligible when compared to photon diffusion damping.&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172&gt;Padmanabhan (1993-06-25), p. 171&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt;

Acoustic perturbations of initial density fluctuations in the universe made some regions of space hotter and denser than others.&lt;ref name=harrison1&gt;Harrison (1970-05-15)&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in [[temperature]] and [[density]] are called ''[[anisotropies]]''. Photons diffused from the hot, overdense regions of plasma to the cold, underdense ones: they dragged along the protons and electrons: the photons pushed electrons along, and these, in turn, pulled on protons by the [[Coulomb force]]. This caused the temperatures and densities of the hot and cold regions to be averaged and the universe became less [[anisotropies|anisotropic]] (characteristically various)  and more ''isotropic'' (characteristically uniform). This reduction in anisotropy is the ''damping'' of diffusion damping. Diffusion damping thus damps temperature and density anisotropies in the early universe. With baryonic matter (protons and electrons) escaping the dense areas along with the photons; the temperature and density inequalities were ''[[adiabatically]]'' damped. That is to say the ratios of photons to baryons remained constant during the damping process.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt;&lt;ref name=madsen99100&gt;Madsen (1996-05-15), p. 99&amp;ndash;100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longair355&gt;Longair (2008-01-08), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jetzer6&gt;Jetzer &amp; Pretzl (2002-07-31), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rich256&gt;Rich (2001-06-15), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Photon diffusion was first described in [[Joseph Silk]]'s 1968 paper entitled "Cosmic Black-Body Radiation and Galaxy Formation",&lt;ref name=silk&gt;Silk (1968-02-01)&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in ''[[Astrophysical Journal|The Astrophysical Journal]]''. As such, diffusion damping is sometimes also called '''Silk damping''',&lt;ref name=bonometto227228 /&gt; though this term may apply only to one possible damping scenario.&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt;&lt;ref name=partridge302&gt;Partridge (1995-09-29), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bonometto55&gt;Bonometto, Gorini &amp; Moschella (2001-12-15), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Silk damping was thus named after its discoverer.&lt;ref name=madsen99101&gt;Madsen (1996-05-15), p. 99&amp;ndash;101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonometto55"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hu_nature15&gt;Hu (1994-06-28), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Silk damping vs. diffusion damping: need in-depth section--&gt;

==Magnitude==
The magnitude of diffusion damping is calculated as a ''damping factor'' or ''suppression factor'', represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D} &lt;/math&gt;, which figures into the [[Boltzmann equation]], an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB.&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt; The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). What affect the diffusion length are primarily the properties of the plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D}(\mathit{k}) = \int_{0}^{\eta_0} \dot{\tau}e^{-[\mathit{k}/{\mathit{k}_\mathit{D}(\eta)}]^2}\; d\eta. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[conformal time]].
*&lt;math&gt; \dot{\tau} &lt;/math&gt; is the "differential optical depth for Thomson scattering". [[Thomson scattering]] is the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (light) by charged particles such as electrons.&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \mathit{k} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[wave number]] of the wave being suppressed.&lt;ref name=longair450&gt;Longair (2008-01-08), p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; (\dot{\tau}e^{-[\mathit{k}/{\mathit{k}_\mathit{D}(\eta)}]^2})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[visibility function]].&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; {\mathit{k}_\mathit{D}}(\eta) = {2\pi}/\lambda_\mathit{D}&lt;/math&gt;

The damping factor &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D} &lt;/math&gt;, when factored into the [[Boltzmann equation]] for the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), reduces the amplitude of perturbations:

:&lt;math&gt; [\Theta_0+\Psi](\eta_\ast) = [\hat{\Theta}_0+\Psi](\eta_\ast)\mathcal{D}(\mathit{k}). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt;

Where:&lt;ref name=jungman24&gt;Jungman, Kamionkowski, Kosowsky &amp; Spergel (1995-12-20), p. 2&amp;ndash;4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hu146&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\eta}_\ast&lt;/math&gt; is the conformal time at decoupling.

[[File:Walk3d 0.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Three random walks in three dimensions. In diffusion damping, photons from hot regions diffuse to cold regions by random walk, so after &lt;math&gt;\mathit{N}&lt;/math&gt; steps, the photons have travelled a distance &lt;math&gt;\lambda_D=\sqrt{\mathit{N}}\lambda_C&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Mathematical calculations of the damping factor depend on &lt;math&gt; \mathit{k}_\mathit{D} &lt;/math&gt;, or the ''effective diffusion scale'', which in turn depends on a crucial value, ''the diffusion length'', &lt;math&gt; \lambda_\mathit{D} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=hu_physics_5&gt;Hu, Sugiyama &amp; Silk (1996-04-28), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The diffusion length relates how far photons travel during diffusion, and comprises a finite number of short steps in random directions. The average of these steps is the ''Compton [[mean free path]]'', and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\mathit{C}&lt;/math&gt;. As the direction of these steps are randomly taken, &lt;math&gt; \lambda_\mathit{D} &lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\mathit{N}} \lambda_\mathit{C} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathit{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of steps the photon takes before the [[conformal time]] at decoupling (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\eta}_\ast&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=hu1213&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), p. 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

The diffusion length increases at recombination because the mean free path does, with less photon scattering occurring; this increases the amount of diffusion and damping. The mean free path increases because the ''electron ionisation fraction'', &lt;math&gt; \mathit{x}_\mathit{e} &lt;/math&gt;, decreases as ionised [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] bind with the free, charged electrons. As this occurs, the mean free path increases proportionally: &lt;math&gt; \lambda_\mathit{C} \varpropto {(\mathit{x}_\mathit{e} \mathit{n}_\mathit{b})}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. That is, the mean free path of the photons is [[inversely proportional]] to the electron ionisation fraction and the baryon number density (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{n}_\mathit{b}&lt;/math&gt;). That means that the more baryons there were, and the more they were ionised, the shorter the average photon could travel before encountering one and being scattered.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt; Small changes to these values before or during recombination can augment the damping effect considerably.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt; This dependence on the baryon density by photon diffusion allows scientists to use analysis of the latter to investigate the former, in addition to the &lt;!--enigmatic?--&gt; history of ionisation.&lt;ref name=hu_physics_5 /&gt;

The effect of diffusion damping is greatly augmented by the finite width of the [[surface of last scattering]] (SLS).&lt;!--need great graph in Hu's thesis--&gt;&lt;ref name=hu137&gt;(1995-08-26), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase.&lt;ref name=durrer5&gt;Durrer (2001-09-17), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.&lt;ref name=hu156&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), pp. 156–7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model dependence ===
In general, diffusion damping produces its effects independent of the cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-''dependent'' phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge the relative merits of cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.&lt;ref name=hu136138&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), p. 136&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hu_tail568&gt;Hu &amp; White (1997-04-20), p. 568&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though general diffusion damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term ''Silk damping'' applies only to damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not [[dark matter]],&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt; and diffuses with them.&lt;ref name=partridge302 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bonometto55 /&gt; Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping.&lt;ref name=rich256 /&gt; Photon diffusion is not dependent on the causes of the initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.&lt;ref name=hu_physics_5 /&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Speed ===
Damping occurs at two different scales, with the process working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length is one that is lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of [[Hubble time]].&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt;

=== The Silk scale and the Silk mass ===
Diffusion damping exponentially decreases anisotropies in the CMB on a scale (the '''Silk scale''')&lt;ref name=madsen99101 /&gt; much smaller than a [[degree (angle)|degree]], or smaller than approximately 3 [[parsec|megaparsecs]].&lt;ref name=bonometto227228&gt;Bonometto, Gorini &amp; Moschella (2001-12-15), p. 227&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; This angular scale corresponds to a [[multipole moment]] &lt;math&gt;\mathit{l} \gtrsim 800&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=jetzer6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=papantonopoulos63&gt;Papantonopoulos (2005-03-24), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The mass contained within the Silk scale is the ''silk mass''.  Numerical evaluations of the Silk mass yield results on the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{13} &lt;/math&gt; solar masses at recombination&lt;ref name=jedamzik12&gt;Jedamzik, Katalinić &amp; Olinto (1996-06-13), p. 1&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt;  and on the order of the mass of a present-day [[galaxy]] or [[galaxy cluster]] in the current era.&lt;ref name=madsen99101 /&gt;&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{M}_\mathit{s} \approx \frac{\mathit{m}_\mathit{p} {\mathit{t}_\mathit{rec}}^{3/2}}{\sqrt{\mathit{n}_\mathit{rec} \sigma^3}}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--for alternate calculation, see Longair (2008-01-08), p. 356--&gt;

Scientists say diffusion damping affects ''small'' angles and corresponding anisotropies. Other effects operate on a scale called ''intermediate'' &lt;math&gt;10 \lesssim \mathit{l} \lesssim 100&lt;/math&gt; or ''large'' &lt;math&gt;\mathit{l} \lessapprox 10 &lt;/math&gt;. Searches for anisotropies on a small scale are not as difficult as those on larger scales, partly because they may employ ground-based telescopes and their results can be more easily predicted by current theoretical models.&lt;ref name=kaiser533&gt;Kaiser &amp; Silk (1986-12-11), p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galaxy formation ===
Scientists study photon diffusion damping (and CMB anisotropies in general) because of the insight the subject provides into the question, "How did the universe come to be?". Specifically, primordial anisotropies in the temperature and density of the universe are supposed to be the causes of later large-scale structure formation. Thus it was the amplification of small perturbations in the pre-recombination universe that grew into the galaxies and galaxy clusters of the present era. Diffusion damping made the universe isotropic within distances on the order of the Silk Scale. That this scale corresponds to the size of observed galaxies (when the passage of time is taken into account) implies that diffusion damping is responsible for limiting the size of these galaxies. The theory is that clumps of matter in the early universe became the galaxies that we see today, and the size of these galaxies is related to the temperature and density of the clumps.&lt;ref name=hu_analytic2&gt;Hu &amp; Sugiyama (1994-07-28), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sunyaev1&gt;Sunyaev &amp; Zel'dovich (Sept. 1980), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffusion may also have had a significant effect on the evolution of primordial [[cosmic magnetic field]]s, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were [[magnetosonic wave]]s (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of [[neutrino decoupling]] and ended at the time of recombination.&lt;ref name=jedamzik12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brandenburg2&gt;Brandenburg, Enqvist &amp; Olesen (January 1997), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">Monsignor '''Felix Newton Pitt''' was born in 1894. He was born in [[Fairfield, Kentucky]]. He attended the [[St. Meinrad]] Seminary in Indiana from 1911 to 1915. He held a Swiss academic doctorate. One of his achievements was founding and organizing the Catholic school office in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. In 1928 and 1929 while Secretary of the Catholic School Board he formed the Catholic Recreation Commission.  He was a pioneer on WHAS radio in ecumenical broadcast. He has also served on the post-World War II international committee. In 1949 when he was 55 years old he founded Pitt Academy a school for special kids. It was the first facility in Louisville for developmentally disabled students. Msgr. Pitt is also an [[author]] who in 1951 wrote the book "Catholic Education Today and Tomorrow". He died in 1971 at the age of 77. 

A biography was published in 2016 by his nephew on his sister's side, Pitt G. Thome:  Journey of a Country Soul:  The Life and Ministry of Monsignor Felix N. Pitt, Kentucky's Preeminent Catholic Educator of the 20th Century.  While it contains personal anecdotes, much of the book focuses on researched historical information placed in the context of events as they occurred.

{{French art history}}
&lt;!-- For practical purposes, the history of French art has been divided into a series of separate articles accessible through the template to the right. The template also gives direct access to French art category indexes, such as alphabetical lists of painters or sculptors. To locate artists from a particular period or art movement, the relatively comprehensive manual list of painters and artistic movements in chronological order is recommended. In addition to a brief historic overview, some supplementary or general material is included on this page, including art vocabulary and general French art references.--&gt;

'''French art''' consists of the [[visual arts|visual]] and [[plastic arts]] (including architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from the geographical area of [[France]]. Modern France was the main centre for the European [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], then left many [[megalith]]ic monuments, and in the [[Iron Age]] many of the most impressive finds of early [[Celtic art]]. The [[Gallo-Roman]] period left a distinctive provincial style of sculpture, and the region around the modern Franco-German border led the empire in the mass production of finely decorated [[Ancient Roman pottery]], which was exported to Italy and elsewhere on a large scale.  With [[Merovingian art]] the story of French styles as a distinct and influential element in the wider development of the art of Christian Europe begins.  

France can fairly be said to have been a leader in the development of [[Romanesque art]] and [[Gothic art]], before the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] led to Italy becoming the main source of stylistic developments until France matched Italy's influence during the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] periods and then regained the leading role in the Arts from the 19th to the mid-20th century.

==Historic overview==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Venus of Brassempouy.jpg|thumb|left|Front and side view of the [[Venus of Brassempouy]].]]
Currently, the earliest known European art is from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of extant [[pre-historic art]] from the [[Châtelperronian]], [[Aurignacian]], [[Solutrean]], [[Gravettian]], and [[Magdalenian]] cultures. This art includes [[cave painting]]s, such as the famous paintings at [[Pech Merle]] in the [[Lot (département)|Lot]] in [[Languedoc]] which date back to 16,000 BC, [[Lascaux]], located near the village of [[Montignac, Dordogne|Montignac]], in the [[Dordogne]], dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, or perhaps, as far back as 25,000 BC, the [[Cosquer Cave]], the [[Chauvet Cave]] dating back to 29,000 BC, and the [[Trois-Frères|Trois-Frères cave]]; and [[portable art]], such as animal carvings and great goddess statuettes called [[Venus figurines]], such as the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060904222320/http://www.musee-antiquitesnationales.fr/pages/page_id18159_u1l2.htm Venus of Brassempouy]" of 21,000 BC, discovered in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]], now in the museum at the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] or the [[Venus of Lespugue]] at the [[Musée de l'Homme]]. Ornamental beads, bone pins, carvings, as well as flint and stone [[arrowhead]]s also are among the prehistoric objects from the area of France.

Speculations exist that only [[Homo sapiens]] are capable of artistic expression, however, a recent find, [[the Mask of La Roche-Cotard]]—a [[Mousterian]] or [[Neanderthal]] artifact, found in 2002 in a cave near the banks of the [[Loire River]], dating back to about [[Paleolithic|33,000 B.C.]]—now suggests that Neanderthal humans may have developed a sophisticated and complex artistic tradition.

[[File:Carnac megalith alignment 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''The Menec alignments'', the most well-known megalithic site among the Carnac stones]]

In the [[Neolithic]] period (''see'' [[Neolithic Europe]]), [[megalith]]ic (large stone) monuments, such as the [[dolmen]]s and [[menhir]]s at [[Carnac stones|Carnac]], [[Saint-Sulpice-de-Faleyrens]] and elsewhere in France begin to appear; this appearance is thought to start in the fifth millennium BC, although some authors speculate about [[Mesolithic]] roots. In France there are some 5,000 megalithics monuments, mainly in Brittany, where there is the largest concentration of these monuments. In this area there is wide variety of these monuments that have been well preserved, like menhirs, dolmen, cromlechs and cairns. The [[Gavrinis|Cairn of Gavrinis]] in southern Brittany is an outstanding example of megalithic art : its 14 meters inner corridor is nearly completely adorned with ornamental carvings. The [[Broken Menhir of Er Grah|great broken menhir of Er-Grah]], now in four pieces was more than 20 meters high originally, making it the largest menhir ever erected. France has also numerous painted stones, polished stone axes, and inscribed menhirs from this period. The Grand-Pressigny area was known for its precious silex blades and they were extensively exported during the Neolithic.

In France from the Neolithic to the [[Bronze Age]], one finds a variety of archaeological cultures, including the [[Rössen culture]] of c. 4500–4000 BC, [[Beaker culture]] of c. 2800–1900 BC, [[Tumulus culture]] of c. 1600–1200 BC, [[Urnfield culture]] of c. 1300–800 BC, and, in a transition to the [[Iron Age]], [[Hallstatt culture]] of c. 1200–500 BC.

===Celtic and Roman periods===
[[File:Parade helmet.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Agris Helmet]]]]
From the [[Proto-Celtic]] Urnfield and Hallstat cultures, a continental [[Iron age]] [[Celtic art]] developed; mainly associated with [[La Tène culture]], which flourished during the late Iron Age from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the first century BC. This art drew on native, classical and perhaps, the [[Mediterranean]], oriental sources. The Celts of [[Gaul]] are known through numerous tombs and burial mounds found throughout France.

Celtic art is very ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature nor ideal of beauty central to the [[Classicism|classical]] tradition, but apparently, often involves complex symbolism. This artwork includes a variety of styles and often incorporates subtly modified elements from other cultures, an example being the characteristic over-and-under interlacing which arrived in France only in the sixth century, although it was already used by [[Germany|Germanic]] artists. The Celtic [[Vix Grave|Vix grave]] in present-day Burgundy revealed the largest bronze crater of the Antiquity, that was probably imported by Celtic aristocrats from Greece.

[[File:Orange roman theatre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Théâtre antique d'Orange]]]]
The region of Gaul ({{lang-la|Gallia}}) came under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]] from the first century BC to the fifth century AD. Southern France, and especially Provence and Languedoc, is known for its many intact Gallo-Roman monuments. [[Lugdunum]], modern Lyon, was at the time of the Roman Empire the largest city outside Italy and gave birth to two Roman Emperors. The city still boasts some Roman remains including a Theater. Monumental works from this period include the [[Théâtre antique d'Orange|amphitheater]] in [[Orange, Vaucluse]], the "[[Maison Carrée]]" at [[Nîmes]] which is one of the best preserved Roman temples in Europe, the city of [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] near Lyon, which features an exceptionally well preserved temple (the temple of Augustus and Livia), a circus as well as other remains, the [[Pont du Gard]] [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] which is also in an exceptional state of preservation, the Roman cities of [[Glanum]] and [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], two intact Gallo-Roman arenas in [[Arena of Nîmes|Nîmes]] and [[Arles Amphitheatre|Arles]], and the [[Thermes de Cluny|Roman baths]], and the [[Arènes de Lutèce|arena]] of [[Paris]].

===Medieval period===

====Merovingian art====
{{Main|Merovingian art}}
Merovingian art is the art and architecture of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty of the [[Franks]], which lasted from the fifth century to the eighth century in present-day France and [[Germany]]. The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in [[Gaul]] during the fifth century led to important changes in the arts. In architecture, there was no longer the desire to build robust and harmonious buildings. Sculpture regressed to being little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], [[altars]], and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, the rise of [[goldsmith|gold work]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] brought about a resurgence of [[Celt]]ic decoration, which, with [[Christian]] and other contributions, constitutes the basis of Merovingian art. The unification of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need to build churches. The plans for them probably were copied from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[basilica]]s. Unfortunately, these timber structures have not survived because of destruction by fire, whether accidental or caused by the [[Normans]] at the time of their incursions.

====Carolingian art====
{{Main|Carolingian art}}
[[File:Karolingischer Buchmaler um 820 001.jpg|thumb|Aachen Gospels, c. 820, an example of Carolingian [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]]]]
Carolingian art is the approximate 120-year period from 750 to 900—during the reign of [[Charles Martel]], [[Pippin the Younger]], [[Charlemagne]], and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The Carolingian era is the first period of the Medieval art movement known as '''[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]'''. For the first time, Northern European kings patronized classical Mediterranean Roman art forms, blending classical forms with Germanic ones, creating entirely new innovations in figurine line drawing, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and, eventually, [[Gothic art]] in the West.

Illuminated manuscripts, metalwork, small-scale sculpture, mosaics, and frescos survive from the period. The Carolingians also undertook major architectural building campaigns at numerous churches in France. These include, those of [[Metz]], [[Lyon]], [[Vienne]], [[Le Mans]], [[Reims]], [[Beauvais]], [[Verdun]], [[Saint-Germain in Auxerre]], Saint-Pierre in [[Flavigny Abbey|Flavigny]], and [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], as well as the town center of [[Chartres]]. The [[Centula Abbey]] of [[Saint-Riquier]] ([[Somme (department)|Somme]]), completed in 788, was a major achievement in monastic architecture. Another important building (mostly lost today) was "Theodulf's Villa" in [[Germigny-des-Prés]].

With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, artistic production halted for almost three generations. After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, lacking any organized patronage. French art of the tenth and eleventh centuries was produced by local monasteries to promote literacy and piety, however, the primitive styles produced were not so highly skilled as the techniques of the earlier Carolingian period.

Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts as models to copy, and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its abbot Odbert (986–1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby [[St. Vaast's Abbey|abbey of St. Vaast]] (Pas-de-Calais) also created a number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were produced c. 1000, at the monastery of [[Saint Martial]] in [[Limoges]], as well as at [[Albi]], [[Figeac]], and [[Saint-Sever-de-Rustan]] in [[Gascony]]. In Paris a unique style developed at the [[abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]. In [[Normandy]] a new style arose in 975. By the later tenth century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement and a revived spirit for the concept of Empire, art production resumed.

[[File:Basilique de Vézelay Narthex Tympan central 220608.jpg|thumb|right|Central tympanum of the narthex of the [[Vézelay Abbey]] in [[Vézelay]], 1140–1150]]

====Romanesque art====
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[Romanesque art]] refers to the art of Western Europe during a period of one hundred and fifty years, from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the [[Gothic Art|Gothic style]], which arose in the middle of the twelfth century in France. "Romanesque Art" was marked by a renewed interest in Roman construction techniques. For example, the twelfth-century capitals on the cloister of [[Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert]], adopt an [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]-leaf [[Motif (art)|motif]] and the decorative use of drill holes, which were commonly found on Roman monuments. Other important Romanesque buildings in France include the abbey of [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]] in [[Loiret]], the churches of [[Abbey Church of Saint Foy|Saint-Foy]] in [[Conques]] of [[Aveyron]], Saint-Martin in [[Tours]], Saint-Philibert in [[Tournus]] of [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Abbey of Saint-Remi|Saint-Remi]] in [[Reims]], and [[Saint-Sernin Basilica|Saint-Sernin]] in [[Toulouse]]. In particular, [[Normandy]] experienced a large building campaign in the churches of [[Bernay, Eure|Bernay]], [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[Coutances Cathedral]], and [[Bayeux]].

[[File:Sainte Chapelle - Upper level 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of the Chapelle Haute, [[Sainte Chapelle]], Paris]]
Most Romanesque sculpture was integrated into church architecture, not only for aesthetic, but also for structural purposes. Small-scale sculpture during the pre-Romanesque period was influenced by [[Byzantine]] and [[Early Christian]] sculpture. Other elements were adopted from various local styles of Middle Eastern countries. Motifs were derived from the arts of the "barbarian," such as grotesque figures, beasts, and geometric patterns, which were all important additions, particularly in the regions north of the Alps. Among the important sculptural works of the period are the ivory carvings at the monastery of [[Abbey of St. Gall|Saint Gall]]. Monumental sculpture was rarely practised separately from architecture in the Pre-Romanesque period. For the first time after the fall of the Roman empire, monumental sculpture emerged as a significant art form. Covered church [[façades]], doorways, and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] all increased and expanded in size and importance, as in the [[Last Judgment]] [[tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]], [[Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne]], and the Standing Prophet at [[Moissac]]. Monumental doors, baptismal fonts, and candle holders, frequently decorated with scenes from biblical history, were cast in bronze, attesting to the skills of the contemporary metalworkers. Frescoes were applied to the vaults and walls of churches. Rich textiles and precious objects in gold and silver, such as chalices and reliquaries, were produced in increasing numbers to meet the needs of the liturgy, and to serve the cult of the saints. In the twelfth century, large-scale stone sculpture spread throughout Europe. In the French Romanesque churches of [[Provence]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], and [[Aquitaine]], sculptures adorned the façades and statues were incorporated into the capitals.

====Gothic====
{{Main|Gothic art|Gothic architecture}}
Gothic art and architecture were products of a Medieval art movement that lasted about three hundred years. It began in France, developing from the Romanesque period in the mid-twelfth century. By the late fourteenth century, it had evolved toward a more secular and natural style known as, [[International Gothic]], which continued until the late fifteenth century, when it evolved further, into [[Renaissance art]]. The primary Gothic art media were [[sculpture]], [[panel painting]], [[stained glass]], [[fresco]], and [[illuminated manuscript]].

[[File:Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg|thumb|right|The Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral, ''c.'' 1145, these architectural statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures, a revolution in style and the models for a generation of sculptors]]
Gothic architecture was born in the middle of the twelfth century in [[Île-de-France]], when [[Abbot Suger]] built the abbey at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St. Denis]], ''c.'' 1140, considered the first Gothic building, and soon afterward, the [[Chartres Cathedral]], ''c.'' 1145. Prior to this, there had been no sculpture tradition in Île-de-France—so sculptors were brought in from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], who created the revolutionary figures acting as columns in the Western (Royal) Portal of Chartres Cathedral (''see image'') —it was an entirely new invention in French art, and would provide the model for a generation of sculptors. Other notable Gothic churches in France include [[Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Bourges|Bourges Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]], [[Notre-Dame of Laon|Notre-Dame de Laon]], [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in [[Paris]], [[Reims Cathedral]], the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]], [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].

The designations of styles in French Gothic architecture are as follows: Early Gothic, High Gothic, Rayonnant, and Late Gothic or "Flamboyant". Division into these divisions is effective, but debatable. Because Gothic cathedrals were built over several successive periods, and the artisans of each period not necessarily following the wishes of previous periods, the dominant architectural style often changed during the building of a particular building. Consequently, it is difficult to declare one building as belonging to certain era of Gothic architecture. It is more useful to use the terms as descriptors for specific elements within a structure, rather than applying it to the building as a whole.

The French ideas spread. Gothic sculpture evolved from the early stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a spatial and naturalistic treatment in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century. Influences from surviving ancient Greek and Roman sculptures were incorporated into the treatment of drapery, facial expression, and pose of the Dutch-Burgundian sculptor, [[Claus Sluter]], and the taste for naturalism first signaled the end of Gothic sculpture, evolving into the classicistic Renaissance style by the end of the fifteenth century.

[[File:Enguerrand Quarton, Le Couronnement de la Vierge (1454).jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Enguerrand Quarton]], ''The Coronation of the Virgin'', 1452–53]]
Painting in a style that may be called, "Gothic," did not appear until about 1200, nearly fifty years after the start of Gothic architecture and sculpture. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and by no means clearly delineated, but one may see the beginning of a style that is more somber, dark, and emotional than the previous period. This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220, and in Italy around 1300. Painting, the representation of images on a surface, was practiced during the Gothic period in four primary crafts, [[fresco]]s, [[panel painting]]s, [[manuscript illumination]], and [[stained glass]]. Frescoes continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. In the north, stained glass remained the dominant art form until the fifteenth century. At the end of the 14th century and during the 15th century French princely courts like those of the dukes of Burgundy, the duke of Anjou or the duke of Berry as well as the pope and the cardinals in Avignon employed renowned painters, like the [[Limbourg Brothers]], [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]], [[Enguerrand Quarton]] or [[Jean Fouquet]], who developed the so-called [[International Gothic]] style that spread through Europe and incorporated the new Flemish influence as well as the innovations of the Italian early Renaissance artists.

===Early Modern period===
[[File:Meister der Schule von Fontainebleau 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Diana the Huntress'' - School of Fontainebleau, 1550–60]]
{{Main|French Renaissance}}
In the late fifteenth century, the French [[Italian Wars|invasion of Italy]] and the proximity of the vibrant [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] court, with its Flemish connections, brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern]] and [[Italian Renaissance]]. Initial artistic changes at that time in France were executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as [[Jean Clouet]] and his son [[François Clouet]], along with the Italians, [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]], and [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] of what is often called the first [[School of Fontainebleau]] from 1531. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also was invited to France by François I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced little for the French king.

The art of the period from François I through Henri IV often is heavily inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as [[Mannerism]], which is associated with the later works of [[Michelangelo]] as well as [[Parmigianino]], among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual [[rhetoric]], including the elaborate use of [[allegory]] and [[mythology]]. Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.

====Baroque and Classicism====
{{main|French Baroque and Classicism}}
[[File:Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version).jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Les Bergers d’Arcadie]]'' by Nicolas Poussin]]

The seventeenth century marked a golden age for French art in all fields.
In the early part of the seventeenth century, late [[Mannerism|mannerist]] and early [[Baroque]] tendencies continued to flourish in the court of [[Marie de Medici]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].
Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] with his Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to [[Nicolas Poussin]] with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicist baroque style. Another proponent of classicism working in Rome was [[Claude Gellée]], known as Le Lorrain, who defined the form of classical landscape.

Many young French painters of the beginning of the century went to Rome to train themselves and soon assimilated [[Caravaggio]]'s influence like [[Valentin de Boulogne]] and [[Simon Vouet]]. The later is credited with bringing the baroque in France and at his return in Paris in 1627 he was named first painter of the king. But French painting soon departed from the extravagance and naturalism of the Italian baroque and painters like [[Eustache Le Sueur]] and [[Laurent de La Hyre]], following Poussin example developed a classicist way known as "Parisian atticism", inspired by Antiquity, and focusing on proportion, harmony and the importance of drawing. Even Vouet, after his return from Italy, changed his manner to a more measured but still highly decorative and elegant style.
 
[[File:Georges de La Tour 009.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Georges de La Tour]], ''The Penitent Magdalene'', c. 1640.]]

But at the same time there was still a strong ''[[Caravaggisti]]'' Baroque school represented in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of [[Georges de La Tour]]. The wretched and the poor were featured in a [[Utrecht Caravaggisti|quasi-Dutch manner]] in the paintings by the three [[Le Nain]] brothers. In the paintings of [[Philippe de Champaigne]] there are both propagandistic portraits of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]' s minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic [[Jansenist]] sect.

In architecture, architects like [[Salomon de Brosse]], [[François Mansart]] and [[Jacques Lemercier]] helped define the French form of the baroque, developing the formula of the urban [[hôtel particulier]] that was to influence all of Europe and strongly departed from the Italian equivalent, the [[palazzo]]. Many aristocratic castles were rebuilt in the new classic-baroque style, some of the most famous being [[château de Maisons|Maisons]] and [[château de Cheverny|Cheverny]], characterized by high roofs ''"à la française"'' and a form that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers.

From the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to by the term "Classicism" which implies an adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in most of the rest of Europe during the same period. Under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as [[Bernini]]'s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.[[File:Le chateau de Vaux le Vicomte.jpg|left|thumb|260px|[[Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte]] by [[Louis Le Vau]].]] Through [[propaganda]], wars, and great architectural works, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The [[Palace of Versailles]], initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties, under the direction of architects [[Louis Le Vau]] (who had also built the [[château de Vaux-le-Vicomte]]) and [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] (who built the [[Les Invalides|church of the Invalides]] in Paris), painter and designer [[Charles Le Brun]], and the landscape architect [[André Le Nôtre]] who perfected the rational form of the [[French garden]] that from Versailles spread in all of Europe.

For sculpture Louis XIV's reign also proved an important moment thanks to the King's protection of artists like [[Pierre Puget]], [[François Girardon]] and [[Charles-Antoine Coysevox]]. In Rome, [[Pierre Legros]], working in a more baroque manner, was one of the most influential sculptors of the end of the century.

====Rococo and Neoclassicism====
[[File:Salon de la princesse hotel de soubise.jpg|thumb|Boiseries of the ''Salon de la princesse'' by [[Germain Boffrand]], [[hôtel de Soubise]], Paris]]

{{Main|French Rococo and Neoclassicism}}

[[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the early eighteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. In France, the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1715 lead to a period of freedom commonly called the [[Régence]]. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the young king Louis XV and the government led by the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|duke of Orléans]] residing in Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as ''rocaille'' : the asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters subjects, like the "fêtes galantes", theater settings, pleasant mythological narratives and the female nude. Most of the times the moralising sides of myths or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very colorful scenes. Important French painters from this period include [[Antoine Watteau]], considered the inventor of the ''fête galante'', [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[François Boucher]]. 
[[File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard - Inspiration.jpg|thumb|left|''Inspiration'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]

The [[Louis XV style]] of decoration, although already apparent at the end of the last reign, was lighter with pastel colors, wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding, and fewer brocades; shells, garlands, and occasional Chinese subjects predominated. The [[Chantilly porcelain|Chantilly]], [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes]] and then [[Sèvres porcelain|Sèvres manufactures]] produced some of the finest porcelain of the time. The highly skilled ''[[ébéniste]]s'', cabinet-makers mostly based in Paris, created elaborate pieces of furniture with precious wood and bronze ornaments that were to be highly praised and imitated in all of Europe. The most famous are [[Jean-François Oeben]], who created the work desk of king Louis XV in Versailles, and [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]]. Rooms in ''châteaux'' and ''hôtels particuliers'' were more intimate than during the reign of Louis XIV and were decorated with rocaille style [[boiseries]] (carved wood pannels covering the walls of a room) conceived by architects like [[Germain Boffrand]] or ''ornemanistes'' (designers of decorative objects) like [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]]. [[File:Place de la bourse.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Place de la Bourse]] in Bordeaux by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]]]
The most prominent architects of the first half of the century were, apart Boffrand, [[Robert de Cotte]] and [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], who designed public squares like the [[place de la Concorde]] in Paris and the [[place de la Bourse]] in [[Bordeaux]] in a style consciously inspired by that of the era of Louis XIV. During the first half of the century, France replaced Italy as the artistic centre and main artistic influence in Europe and many French artists worked in other courts across the continent.

The latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the [[French language]] was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, [[Genre works|genre painting]], [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[portrait]], and [[still life]] were extremely fashionable. Chardin and [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] were hailed for their still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in the hierarchy of painting subjects.
[[File:Prometheus Adam Louvre MR1745.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Prometheus'' by [[Nicolas-Sébastien Adam]]]]

One also finds in this period a ''Pre-romanticist'' aspect. [[Hubert Robert]]'s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect as well as the image of storms and moonlight marines by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]. So too the change from the rational and geometrical ''French garden'' of [[André Le Nôtre]] to the ''English garden'', which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature. One also finds in some of these gardens—curious ruins of temples—called "follies".

The last half of the eighteenth century saw a turn to [[Neoclassicism]] in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and [[iconography]]. This movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the artificiality and the decorative essence of the ''rocaille'' style. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is [[Jacques-Louis David]], who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by the works of [[Nicolas Poussin]] from the seventeenth century. Poussin and David were in turn major influences on [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]. Other important neoclassical painters of the period are [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] and [[Joseph-Marie Vien]]. Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture.
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1786)]]
Architects like [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux|Ledoux]] and [[Étienne-Louis Boullée|Boullée]] developed a radical style of neoclassical architecture based on simple and pure geometrical forms with a research of simetry and harmony, elaborating visionary projects like the complex of the [[Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans|Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans]] by Ledoux, a model of an ideal factory developed from the rational concepts of the [[Enlightment philosophers|Enlightment]] thinkers.

===Modern period===

====19th century====
{{main|French art of the 19th century}}
The [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic wars]] brought great changes to the arts in France. The program of exaltation and myth making attendant to the Emperor [[Napoleon I of France]] was closely coordinated in the paintings of David, Gros and Guérin. [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] was the main figure of neoclassicism until the 1850s and a prominent teacher, giving priority to drawing over color. Meanwhile, [[Orientalism]], Egyptian motifs, the tragic [[anti-hero]], the wild landscape, the [[historical novel]], and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance—all these elements of [[Romanticism]]—created a vibrant period that defies easy classification. The most important romantic painter of the period was Eugène Delacroix, who had a successful public career and was the main opponent of Ingres. Before him, [[Théodore Géricault]] opened the path to romanticism with his monumental ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'' exposed at the 1819 Salon. [[Camille Corot]] tried to escape the conventional and idealized form of landscape painting influenced by classicism to be more realist and sensible to atmospheric variations at the same time.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' - Eugène Delacroix]]

Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century, both idealized landscape painting and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] have their seeds in Romanticism. The work of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]] are logical developments from it, as is the late nineteenth century [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of such painters as [[Gustave Moreau]], the professor of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Georges Rouault]], as well as [[Odilon Redon]].

[[Academic painting]] developed at the [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] was the most successful with the public and the State : highly trained painters like [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], [[William Bouguereau]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]] painted historical scenes inspired by the antique, following the footsteps of Ingres and the neoclassics. Though criticized for their conventionalism by the young avant-garde painters and critics, the most talented of the Academic painters renewed the historical genre, drawing inspiration from multiple cultures and techniques, like the Orient and the new framings made possible by the invention of photography

For many critics [[Édouard Manet]] wrote of the nineteenth century and the modern period (much as [[Charles Baudelaire]] does in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical brush strokes are the first steps toward Impressionism. [[Impressionism]] would take the [[Barbizon school]] one step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[Eugène Boudin]]). It led to [[Claude Monet]] with his cathedrals and haystacks, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, [[Edgar Degas]] with his dancers and bathers. Other important impressionists were [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Gustave Caillebotte]].

After that threshold was crossed, the next thirty years became a litany of amazing experiments. [[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch born, but living in France, opened the road to [[expressionism]]. [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]], influenced by color theory, devised a [[pointillism|pointillist]] technique that governed the Impressionist experiment and was followed by [[Paul Signac]]. [[Paul Cézanne]], a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent. [[Paul Gauguin]], a banker, found symbolism in [[Brittany]]  along [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Emile Bernard]] and then exoticism and primitivism in [[French Polynesia]]. These painters were referred to as [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]].  [[Les Nabis]], a movement of the 1890s, regrouping painters such as [[Paul Sérusier]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]] and [[Maurice Denis]], was influenced by Gauguin's example in Brittany: they explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a Japanese print. They preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and symbols. 
[[Henri Rousseau]], the self-taught dabbling postmaster, became the model for the naïve revolution.

====20th century====

The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by experiments in colour and content that [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences.  At roughly the same time, [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] ([[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Henri Manguin]]) exploded into color, much like German [[Expressionism]].

The discovery of African tribal masks by [[Pablo Picasso]], a Spaniard living in Paris, lead him to create his ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' of 1907. Working independently, Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] returned to and refined Cézanne's way of rationally comprehension of objects in a flat medium, their experiments in [[cubism]] also would lead them to integrate all aspects and objects of day-to-day life, [[collage]] of newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine, and other objects into their works. [[Cubism]] in all its phases would dominate paintings of Europe and America for the next ten years. (See the article on [[Cubism]] for a complete discussion.)

[[World War I]] did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich, the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and created the most radical gesture possible, the anti-art of [[Dada]]. At the same time, [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were exploring similar notions. At a 1917 art show in [[New York City|New York]], Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal (''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') signed ''R. Mutt'' as work of art, becoming the father of the ''[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]''.

When [[Dada]] reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], particularly by his notion of the [[unconscious mind]]. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of [[automatic writing]], chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The [[surrealism|surrealists]] quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of [[Frottage (surrealist technique)|Frottage]], [[collage]], and [[decalcomania]], the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.
[[File:Violin and Candlestick.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Georges Braque]], ''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910]]

Immediately after this war the French art scene diverged roughly in two directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments from before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the new [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[action painting]] from New York, executing them in a French manner using [[Tachism]] or [[L'art informel]]. Parallel to both of these tendencies, [[Jean Dubuffet]] dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, graffiti, and cartoons in a variety of media.

The late 1950s and early 1960s in France saw art forms that might be considered ''[[Pop Art]]''. [[Yves Klein]] had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. [[Victor Vasarely]] invented [[Op-Art]] by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the [[Fluxus]] movement such as [[Ben Vautier]] incorporated [[graffiti]] and found objects into their work. [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. [[Arman]] gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and [[César Baldaccini]] produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their ''atelier populaire'', produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president [[Charles de Gaulle]].

Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the Second World War and the specter of the Holocaust. [[Christian Boltanski]]'s harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.

[[Image:Hamilton Air Force aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|380px|The Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project at [[Whiteside marsh|Whiteside Marsh]], on the former [[Hamilton Air Force Base]].]]
The '''Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project''', now known as the '''Hamilton/Bel Marin Keys Wetlands Restoration''' is a [[wetland]]s [[habitat restoration]] project at the former [[Hamilton Army Airfield|Hamilton Air Force Base—Hamilton Army Airfield]] (1930−1988) site and adjacent [[Bel Marin Keys, California|Bel Marin Keys]] shoreline, in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]].  

It is located at [[Whiteside marsh|Whiteside Marsh]] on the northwestern shore of [[San Pablo Bay]], in and adjacent to the city of [[Novato, California|Novato]] in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

==Project==
The restoration project is a joint venture between two public agencies; the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] is the lead federal agency; with the [[California Coastal Conservancy]] as the local sponsoring agency. In addition, the [[San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission]] serves as a collaborating partner. 

The U.S. Congress authorized the Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project in 1999, and the addition of the Bel Marin Keys property to the project in 2007. The combined project site comprises approximately {{convert|2600|acres}}.

Together, these three agencies are working to restore the Whiteside Marsh section of the closed Hamilton Air Force Base—Hamilton Army Airfield site to its former natural [[estuary]] and wetlands condition, and to create valuable [[endangered species]] habitat in the urbanized [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. 

The Hamilton Wetlands Restoration Project ''“represents an unprecedented opportunity to contribute to the restoration of the [[San Francisco Bay]], which has lost over 85% of its natural wetlands since the 1880s.”''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5902">[[Image:Helmholtz pitch notation c.svg|thumb|right|300px|The naming of individual 'C's using the Helmholtz system]]
'''Helmholtz pitch notation''' is a system for naming [[musical note]]s of the [[Classical music|Western]] [[chromatic scale]]. Developed by the German scientist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], it uses a combination of [[upper case|upper]] and [[lower case]] letters (A to G),&lt;ref&gt;The letter B is used in Germany to designate a standard B flat, H is used for B natural.&lt;/ref&gt; and the sub- and super-[[prime (symbol)|prime]] symbols ( ͵  ′ ) to describe each individual note of the scale. It is one of two formal systems for naming notes in a particular octave, the other being [[scientific pitch notation]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Jones"&gt;Schmidt-Jones, Catherine [http://cnx.org/content/m10862/latest/ Octaves and the Major-Minor Tonal System]. Retrieved on 3 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Helmholtz developed this system in order to accurately define pitches in his classical work on acoustics ''Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische Grundlage für die Theorie der Musik'' (1863) translated into English by [[Alexander John Ellis|A. J. Ellis]] as ''On the Sensations of Tone'' (1875).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concise Grove Dictionary of Music: |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/hermann-von-helmholtz |chapter=Hermann von Helmholtz |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |access-date=3 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Helmholtz |first1=Herman |title=On the Sensations of Tone (English Translation) |language=en |date=1885 |page=15 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CiqYQXZjIYC&amp;pg=PA15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He based his notation on the practice of German organ builders for labelling their pipes, itself derived from the old German [[organ tablature]] in use from late medieval times until the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century. Helmholz's system is widely used by musicians across Europe and is the one used in the ''New Grove Dictionary''. Once also widely used by scientists and doctors when discussing the scientific and medical aspects of sound in relation to the [[auditory system]], it has now largely been replaced in American and French scientific and medical contexts by [[scientific pitch notation]].&lt;ref name="Dolmetsch"&gt;{{cite web |author=Blood, Brian |url=http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory1.htm#helmholtz |title=Helmholtz |website=Music Theory Online |series=Staffs, clefs &amp; pitch Notation |access-date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The Helmholtz scale always starts on the note ''C'' and ends at ''B'' (''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F'', ''G'', ''A'', ''B''). The note ''C'' is shown in different octaves by using upper-case letters for low notes, and lower-case letters for high notes, and adding sub-primes and primes in the following sequence: '''C͵͵''' '''C͵''' '''C''' '''c''' '''c′''' '''c″''' '''c‴''' (or '''͵͵C''' '''͵C''' '''C''' '''c''' '''c′''' '''c″''' '''c‴''') and so on.

[[Middle C]] is designated '''c′''', therefore the [[octave]] upwards from [[Middle C|middle&amp;nbsp;C]] is c′–b′.

Each octave may also be given a name based on the "German method" (see below). For example, the octave from '''c′'''&amp;ndash;'''b′''' is called the ''one-line octave''&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Jones"/&gt; or (less common) ''once-accented octave''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/once%E2%80%93accented%20octave|title=Definition of ONCE–ACCENTED OCTAVE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, the notes in the octave may be called ''one-lined C'', etc.

===Variations===
*The ''English multiple C notation'' uses repeated ''C''s in place of the sub-prime symbol. Therefore '''C͵''' is rendered as '''CC'''.&lt;ref name="Dolmetsch"/&gt; 
*The ''German method'' replaces the "prime" with a horizontal bar above the letter.&lt;ref name="Dolmetsch"/&gt;
*Primes in subscript (resp. superscript) may be replaced with digits in subscript (resp. superscript) indicating the number of primes (see [[:de:Tonsymbol|Article and references on German Wikipedia]]): for example '''͵͵C''' or '''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' or '''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C''', '''c″''' or '''c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' (but &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; '''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c''').
*A system of pitch designation using uppercase and lowercase letters, commas and apostrophes in a way similar to the Helmholtz pitch notation is used in the [[ABC notation|ABC music notation system]], currently used mainly for Western folk music.
*[[LilyPond]] music engraving software uses an all-lowercase variant where pitches that would be uppercase in Helmholtz notation are written with an additional sub-prime: &lt;code&gt;c,,,&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c,,&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c,&lt;/code&gt; represent Helmholtz '''C͵͵''' and '''C͵''' and '''C''' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/writing-pitches LilyPond Notation Reference 2.18.2: 1.1.1 Writing Pitches]. Accessed 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Scientific pitch notation]] is a similar system that replaces primes and sub-primes with integers. Hence '''C4''' in scientific notation is '''c′''' (middle&amp;nbsp;C).

==Staff representation==
This diagram gives examples of the lowest and highest note in each octave, giving their name in the Helmholtz system, and the "German method" of octave nomenclature. (The octave below the contra octave is known as the sub-contra octave).

The Indian Institute of Ecology and Environment, Paryavaran Complex, South of Saket, New Delhi owes its origin to the deliberations at Founes (1971), [[Stockholm]] (1972) and [[Belgrade]] (1975) and subsequent resolutions and recommendations of the Intergovernmental Conference on Environment at [[Tbilisi]] in 1977 organised by [[UNEP]] and [[UNESCO]]. The Institute 
was established as a public charitable trust on 5 June 1980 for organising programs and providing learning platform in the areas of ecology, environment, pollution control, disaster management, sustainable development, ecological tourism and environmental education. The Institute also collaborates with the Government of Delhi in conducting ecological education in more than 1000 schools in New Delhi. The Institute arranges for technology transfer on [[environmental engineering]], [[impact assessment]], [[Pollution control|pollution monitoring and control]], [[systems analysis]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[environmental communication]], ecological education and [[environmental laws]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

'''International education''' refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran Hansen|first=Holly|date=2002|title=Defining international education|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/he.41|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/he.41|issn=0271-0560}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is facilitated by the [[globalization]] phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Globalization and Higher Education|last=King|first=Roger|last2=Marginson|first2=Simon|last3=Naidoo|first3=Rajani|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781848445857|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, [[Formal learning|formal education]] and [[informal learning]] (e.g. training, [[Student exchange program|exchange programs]], [[cross-cultural communication]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Review of Comparative and International Education 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Alexander|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781787437661|location=Bingley, WA|pages=211-212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of “worldmindedness” as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered [[International school|international]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] prescribes the adoption of "proper education" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management (ETEEEM 2014), Hong Kong, 15-16 November 201|last=Tan|first=Deyao|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=9781138027800|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development|last=McGrath|first=Simon|last2=Gu|first2=Qing|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415747547|location=Oxon|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Asia-Europe Co-operation Through Educational Exchange|last=Wessala|first=Georg|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415481946|location=Oxon|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are scholars who associate the development of international education with [[comparative education]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|last=Arnove|first=Robert|last2=Torres|first2=Carlos Alberto|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=0742559858|location=Lanham, MD|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in [[classical Greece]], while the actual term was first used by [[William Russell (educator)|William Russell]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Comparative Education|last=Cowen|first=Robert|last2=Kazamias|first2=Andreas|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781402064029|location=Dordrecht|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
International education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cambridge *|first=James|last2=Thompson|first2=Jeff|date=2004|title=Internationalism and globalization as contexts for international education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0305792042000213994|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1080/0305792042000213994|issn=0305-7925|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of “positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

From a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. Furthermore, there is a “spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Overall, international education can be viewed as the following:  

* Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Nicholas|date=2013|title=International education in a post-Enlightenment world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|journal=Educational Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=253–266|doi=10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|issn=0013-1911|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Direct examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Mary|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shona|date=2018-02-06|title=International education: the transformative potential of experiential learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=403–413|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|issn=0305-4985|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Based on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an [[international branch campus]], as part of a [[study abroad]] program or as part of a [[student exchange program]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}

The [[International Baccalaureate]] however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

While definitions vary, '''international education''' is generally taken{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to include:
* Knowledge of other world regions &amp; cultures;
* Familiarity with international and [[global studies|global issues]];
* Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
* Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
* Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

==Millennium Development Goals==
One of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|millennium development goals]] ratified in the [[United Nations]] in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysokińska|first=Zofia|date=March 2017|title=Millennium Development Goals/UN and Sustainable Development Goals/UN as Instruments for Realizing Sustainable Development Concept in the Global Economy|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d121741476%26site%3deds-live|journal=Comparative Economic Research|volume=20|pages=101-118|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{non sequitur|date=June 2018}}
 International education is also a major part of international development. Professionals and students wishing to be a part of international education development are able to learn through organizations and university and college programs.{{how|date=June 2018}} Organizations around the world use education as a means to development.{{Relevance inline|date=June 2018}} Previous research demonstrates a positive correlation between the educational level and economic growth, especially in the poorest regions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00449|title=Economic and labour market outcomes of education [Social Impact].

* greatly increase learning opportunities for youth and adults
* improve adult literacy rates by 50%
* eliminate gender disparities in schooling
* improve all aspects of education quality. 

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
At the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. [[Sustainable Development Goals|The Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private “non-state” actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ei-ie.org/en/detail_page/4918/sustainable-development-goals|title=Sustainable Development Goals : Education International|last=International|first=Education|work=Education International|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (Target 4.7)

* “By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrollment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering, and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries” (Target 4.B)

There are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.

== Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) ==
Although very successful programs such as [[Engineers Without Borders]]{{Example needed |s|date=June 2018}} enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on [[open source appropriate technology]] projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta Abrahamse, Mathew Johnson, Nanette Levinson, Larry Medsker, Joshua M.

==International Education Week==
International Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education.  The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]]: {{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}.&lt;ref name="DOS-week"&gt;[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/international-education-week United States Department of State: International Education Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange.This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iew.state.gov International Education Week 2010].

==Challenges Facing International education==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2017}}
International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, William.ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education Washington DC. Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest.Publication Date: 2001-12-00&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, trans nationalization, or globalization?&lt;ref&gt;(Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
# International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
# There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments.
# Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000). However, programs through various institutions, such as the [[Fulbright Program]] offer research opportunities for those wishing to study abroad.

Additionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows {{buzzword inline|date=June 2018}} for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/03/05/higher-education-must-go-beyond-recruitment-and-immigration-compliance-of-international-students/|title=International Students are Paying More for Education; are Universities Doing Enough?|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-03-05|website=interEDGE.org}}&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">The '''LogP machine''' is a model for [[parallel computation]].&lt;ref&gt;Culler et al. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
It aims at being more practical than the [[Parallel random-access machine |PRAM]] model while still allowing for easy analysis of computation.
The name is not related to the [[Logarithm|mathematical logarithmic function]]:  Instead, the machine is described by the four parameters &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

The LogP machine consists of arbitrarily many processing units with [[distributed memory]].
The processing units are connected through an abstract communication medium which allows point-to-point communication. This model is pair-wise synchronous and overall asynchronous.

The machine is described by the four parameters:

* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the communication medium.
* &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]] of sending and receiving a message.
* &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, the gap required between two send/receive operations. A more common interpretation of this quantity is as the inverse of the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of a processor-processor communication channel.
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the number of processing units.  Each local operation on each machine takes the same time ('unit time').  This time is called a processor cycle.

The units of the parameters &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are measured in multiples of processor cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17187">[[File:Long Duration Exposure Facility after deployment.jpg|thumb|The [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] was used to test various materials in vacuum.]]
'''Materials for use in vacuum''' are materials showing very low rate of [[outgassing]] in [[vacuum]], and, where applicable, tolerant to the [[bake-out]] temperatures. The requirements grow increasingly stringent with the desired degree of vacuum achievable in the [[vacuum chamber]].
The materials can produce gas by several mechanisms. Molecules of gases and water can be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on the material surface (therefore materials with low affinity to water have to be chosen, which eliminates many plastics). Materials may [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] in vacuum (this includes some metals and their alloys, most notably cadmium and zinc). Or the gases can be released from [[porosity|porous]] materials or from cracks and crevices. Traces of lubricants, residues from machining, can be present on the surfaces. A specific risk is outgassing of solvents absorbed in plastics after cleaning.

The gases liberated from the materials not only lower the vacuum quality, but also can be reabsorbed on other surfaces, creating deposits and contaminating the chamber.

Yet another problem is diffusion of gases through the materials themselves. Atmospheric [[helium]] can diffuse even through [[Pyrex]] glass, even if slowly; this however is usually not an issue. Some materials might also expand or increase in size causing problems in delicate equipment.

In addition to the gas-related issues, the materials have to maintain adequate strength through the entire required temperature range (sometimes reaching [[cryogenic]] temperatures), maintain their properties (elasticity, plasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity or lack of it, etc.), be machinable, and if possible not be overly expensive. Yet another concern is the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] match of adjacent parts.

==Materials to avoid==
Materials outgas by three mechanisms: release of [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;gases (de[[Sorption|sorption]] from the bulk of the material), release of [[Adsorption|adsorbed]] gases ([[Desorption|desorption]] from the surface only), and evaporation of the material itself. The former can be reduced by a bakeout, the latter is an intrinsic property of the material.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vacuum Physics and Technology|author=Meurant, G.|date=1980|publisher=[[Elsevier Science]]|isbn=9780080859958|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tfLWfAx1ZWQC&amp;pg=PA346|page=346|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some outgassed materials can deposit on other surfaces, contaminate the vacuum system and be difficult to get rid of.

The most common sources of trouble (out-gassing) in vacuum systems are:
* [[Cadmium]], often present in the form of [[cadmium plating]], or in some [[soldering]] and [[brazing]] alloys
* [[Zinc]], problematic for high vacuum and higher temperatures, present in some construction alloys, e.g. [[brass]] and some brazing alloys. Tends to poison [[hot cathode]]s and form conductive deposits on surfaces.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;  Any materials that have been zinc-coated by [[galvanization]] should be avoided, or they have the coating removed first.
* [[Magnesium]]
* [[PVC]], usually in the form of [[wire]] insulation (source of virtual leaks too)
* [[Paint]]s
* [[Lead]] and [[antimony]] used in some soft [[solder]]s and outgassing at higher temperatures&lt;ref name="fermi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/tm/TM-1615.pdf|publisher=[[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]|title= TM-1615: Materials for Ultra-High Vacuum|author= G. Lee | date=August 15, 1989 |accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many [[plastics]], namely many plastic tapes (special attention should be paid to adhesives). Fiberglass composites, e.g. [[Micarta]] (G-10) and G-30, should be avoided. Even [[Kapton]] and [[Teflon]] are sometimes advised against.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* Various residues, e.g. [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] from soldering and brazing, and lubricants from machining making thorough cleaning imperative. Getting the outgassable residues from tight crevices can be challenging; a good mechanical design that avoids such features can help.

==Materials for vacuum use==

===Metals===
* [[Austenitic stainless steel]]s are the most common choice for [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] and [[ultra-high vacuum]] systems. Not all alloys are suitable; e.g. the free-machining 303 steel contains [[sulfur]], which tends to outgas. Alloys with good weldability under argon [[arc welding]] are usually chosen.
** '''304 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' is a common choice of a stainless steel.
** '''304L [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''', a low-carbon variant of 304 steel, is used for ultra-high vacuum systems.
** '''316L [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' a low-carbon and low-magnetic stainless steel, used in accelerator technologies.
** '''347 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' does not accept high polish.
** '''321 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' is chosen when low [[magnetic permeability]] is needed.
* [[Mild steel]] can be used for moderate vacuums above 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; torr. Outgassing can be lowered with suitable (e.g. nickel) [[plating]]. It has high permeability to hydrogen and tendency to rust. For use it should be thoroughly outgassed in vacuum.
* [[Aluminium]] and [[aluminium alloys]] are another class of frequently used materials. They are well-machinable and have low outgassing, unless the alloys contain higher proportions of [[zinc]]. The parts must not be [[anodized]], as the oxide layer traps (and outgases) water vapor. Anodizing also makes the surface non-conducting, so that its surface will charge up in [[electrostatic system]]s. The best treatment is Alochroming, which seals the surface, makes it hard and conductive. Its outgassing rate is considerably less than non-treated aluminium. Aluminium and its alloys have low strength at high temperatures, distort when being welded, and the copper-containing ones are poorly weldable. Aluminium wire rings can be used as cheap gaskets in demountable seals. Aluminium has high thermal conductivity, good corrosion resistance, and low solubility of hydrogen. Loss of strength at high temperatures limits its use in bakeable applications, but aluminium is advantageous for large-size systems due to its lower weight and lower cost than stainless steel. Use of aluminium is limited by difficulties in its welding and brazing. It can be used for x-ray windows.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* [[Aluminium bronze]] is a material that looks and machines similar to [[brass]]. It is not susceptible to [[galling]], which makes it suitable for sliding fits against stainless steel.
* [[Nickel]] is widely used in vacuum technology, e.g. as mechanical parts in [[vacuum tube]]s. It is relatively low-cost, can be spot welded, can be easily machined, has high melting point and is resistant to many corrosive fluids and atmospheres. Its potential drawback is its [[ferromagnetism]], which restricts applications that would be influenced by magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* Nickel alloys, e.g. [[cupronickel]]&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Beryllium]] is used primarily for x-ray windows.
* [[Oxygen-free copper]] is widely used. It is easily machined and has good corrosion resistance. It is unsuitable for bakeable vacuum envelopes due to its tendency to oxidize and create scales. Copper rings are used in demountable seals. Normal [[copper]] is unsuitable for high vacuum as it is difficult to outgas completely. Copper is insensitive to hydrogen and impermeable to hydrogen and helium, has low sensitivity to water vapor, but is attacked by mercury. Its strength falls sharply above 200&amp;nbsp;°C. Its vapor pressure becomes significant at above 500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* [[Brass]] is suitable for some applications. It has good corrosion resistance. Its zinc content may cause problems; zinc outgassing can be reduced by nickel-plating.
* [[Indium]] wire is used as a gasket in demountable seals.
* [[Gold]] wire is used as a gasket in demountable seals for ultra-high vacuum, as well as an alternative to lead-tin solder for making electrical connections.
* [[Platinum]] is a highly chemically inert material with high cost and low outgassing.
* [[Zirconium]] is corrosion-resistant. It has low production of [[secondary electrons]], so it is used as a coating of areas where reducing their production is important. It is used for [[neutron]] windows. It is costly and scarce, its uses are therefore limited. Zirconium and zirconium hydride are used for [[gettering]].
* [[Tungsten]] is often used in high temperature applications as well as for filaments in electron/ion optics. It becomes brittle from [[work hardening]] when mechanically deformed, or subjected to very high temperatures.
* [[Molybdenum]] and [[tantalum]] are useful for high temperature applications.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Titanium]] and [[niobium]] are good materials.
* [[Solder]]s are sometimes unavoidable for soft-soldered joints. Tin-lead solders (Sn50Pb50, Sn60Pb40, Sn63Pb37) can be conditionally used when the apparatus is not to be baked and operating temperatures aren't elevated (lead tends to outgas). A better choice for vacuum systems is the tin-silver eutectic, Sn95Ag5; its melting point of 230&amp;nbsp;°C allows bakeout up to 200&amp;nbsp;°C. A similar 95-5 alloy, Sn95Sb5, is unsuitable as antimony has similar vapor pressure as lead. Take care to remove [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] residues.
* [[List of brazing alloys|Brazing alloys]] are used for joining materials by [[brazing]]. Care has to be taken while choosing the alloys, as some elements tend to outgas. Cadmium and zinc are the worst common offenders. Silver, a common component of brazing alloys, can be problematic at higher temperatures and lower pressures. A silver-copper eutectic, named e.g. Cusil, is recommended. A superior alternative is a copper-silver-tin alloy called Cusiltin. Copper-silver-phosphorus alloys, e.g. Sil-Fos, are also suitable.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;

===Plastics===
* Some [[fluoropolymer]]s, e.g. [[polyvinylidene fluoride]], are suitable for use in vacuum. They have low outgassing and are tolerant to higher temperatures.
** [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] ([[PTFE]] or Teflon) is commonly used inside of vacuum systems. It is self-lubricating, a good electrical insulator, tolerant to fairly high temperatures, and has low out-gassing. It is not suitable for barrier between vacuum and atmosphere, as it is somewhat permeable for gases. Ceramics is a superior choice, however.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Polyethylene]] is usable but requires thorough out-gassing. [[Nalgene]] can be used as a cheaper alternative for [[Bell jar]]s.
* [[Vespel]] [[polyimide]] is very expensive, but machines well, has good electrical insulator properties and is compatible with ultra-high vacuum.
* [[PVC]], despite its high outgassing rate, can be used in limited applications for rough vacuum lines.
* [[Nylon]] is self-lubricating but has high outgassing rate and high affinity to water.
* [[Acrylate polymer|Acrylics]] have high outgassing rate and high affinity to water.
* [[Polycarbonate]]s and [[polystyrene]] are good electrical insulators with moderate outgassing.
* [[PEEK]] (PolyEtherEtherKetone) has relatively low out-gassing values (0.31% TML, 0.00% CVCM, 0.06% WVR).
* [[Kapton]] is a type of polyimide film, has very low outgassing. Kapton is discouraged if a ceramic alternative can be used.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* Some [[elastomer]]s have sufficient vacuum properties to be employed in vacuum o-rings:
** [[Nitrile rubber|NBRs]], ([[Nitrile rubber]]), commonly used for demountable vacuum seals (bakeable only up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C).
** [[FKM|FKMs (FPMs)]], ([[Viton]]) is used for demountable vacuum seals. It is better for lower pressures than [[nitrile rubber]] and chemically much more [[Chemically inert|inert]]. It is bakeable to 200&amp;nbsp;°C.
** [[FFKM]]s ([[FFPM]]s) very low out-gassing similar to Teflon and withstands baking temperatures up to 300&amp;nbsp;°C, while chemically one of the most [[Chemically inert|inert]] sealing elastomers.

===Glasses and ceramics===
* [[Borosilicate glass]] is often used for smaller assemblies and for viewports. It can be machined and joined well. Glasses can be [[glass-to-metal seal|joined with metals]].
* [[Porcelain]] and [[alumina]] ceramics, when fully [[vitrified]] and therefore non-porous, are excellent insulators usable up to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. Some ceramics can be machined. Ceramics can be [[ceramics-to-metal seal|joined with metals]].
* [[Macor]] is a machinable ceramic that is an excellent alternative to alumina, as the firing process of alumina can change the dimensions and tolerances.

===Lubricants===
Lubrication of moving parts is a problem for vacuum. Many [[lubricant]]s have unacceptable outgassing rates,&lt;ref name="Carre, Bertrand, 1999" &gt;{{Cite journal
  |title=Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope Reaction Wheel Lubricant

|bibcode=1999JSpRo..36..109C}}&lt;/ref&gt; others (e.g. [[graphite]]) lose lubricating properties.
* [[Vacuum grease]]s are [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]s with low outgassing.
** [[Ramsay grease]] is an old composition of paraffin wax, vaseline and natural rubber, usable up to about 25&amp;nbsp;°C, for low vacuums to about 1 Pa.
** [[Krytox]] is a fluorether-based vacuum grease, useful from -75 to over 350&amp;nbsp;°C, not flammable even in [[liquid oxygen]], and highly resistant to [[ionizing radiation]].
** [[Polyphenyl ether]] greases
** [[Torrlube]], a brand encompassing a range of lubricating oils based on [[perfluoropolyether]]s.&lt;ref name="torrlube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torrlube.com/|title=TorrLube.com &amp;#124; The Unrivaled Leader in High Vacuum Lubrication|publisher=torrlube.com|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dry lubricant]]s, can be incorporated in plastics as fillers, as a component of sintered metals, or deposited on metal, ceramic and plastic surfaces.
** [[Molybdenum disulfide]] is a dry lubricant usable in vacuum.
** [[Tungsten disulfide]] is another dry lubricant usable in vacuum. It can be used at higher temperatures than MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Tungsten disulfide used to be significantly more expensive, but rise of prices of molybdenum disulfide brought them to a comparable range.&lt;ref name="lowerfriction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowerfriction.com/pdf/8.pdf|date=2 December 2008|title=Comparison between Molybdenum Disulfide &amp; Tungsten Disulfide|author=Ketan|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usable from -188 to +1316&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum, from -273 to +650&amp;nbsp;°C in normal atmosphere.&lt;ref name="appliedtungstenite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedtungstenite.com/html/aerospace.html|title=Applied Tungstenite: Aerospace: Tungsten Disulfide WS2 dry film Lubricant and Citric Acid Passivation|publisher=appliedtungstenite.com|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Boron nitride#Hexagonal BN|Hexagonal boron nitride]] is a graphite-like dry lubricant used in space vehicles.

===Adhesives===
* Torr-Seal, or its generic equivalent Hysol-1C (USA brand name) or Loctite 9492 (EU brand name), is an epoxy with resin and hardener for use in vacuum environments. It will begin to degrade at high temperatures but otherwise is very stable with very little outgassing. Other vacuum-rated epoxies are also available. For mounting or joining thin metal foils, grids, or other small pieces that are not expected to undergo stress, silver or gold paste may be used as an adhesive. After fixing the material(s) with silver paste, the piece must be   baked (to &gt; 200 C) in air for &gt; 24 hours to remove volatiles prior to insertion into vacuum. 

==Materials for use in space==
In addition to the concerns above, materials for use in [[spacecraft]] applications have to cope with [[radiation damage]] and high-intensity [[ultraviolet radiation]], thermal loads from solar radiation, radiation cooling of the vehicle in other directions, and heat produced within the spacecraft's systems. Another concern, for orbits closer to Earth, is the presence of [[atomic oxygen]], leading to [[corrosion in space|corrosion]] of exposed surfaces; aluminium is an especially sensitive material{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Silver, often used for surface-deposited interconnects, forms layer of silver oxide that flakes off and may erode up to a total failure.

Corrosion-sensitive surfaces can be protected by a suitable [[plating]], most often with [[gold]]; a [[silica]] layer is also possible. However the coating layer is subject to erosion by [[micrometeoroids]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">The '''Medientage München''' (Munich Media Days) are held annually in [[Munich]] as a congress of the communications industry. An exhibition is organized and occurs at the same time. Every year in October, media entrepreneurs, media makers, and media politicians meet for three days. In 2015 more than 6,200 participants attended the congress, exhibition and events around the Medientage München.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/61644/3155621 | title=MEDIENTAGE MÜNCHEN 2015 mit mehr als 6.200 Besuchern | author= | date=23 October 2015 | website=presseportal.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medientage München 2015 took place from 21 to 23 October, at the [[Internationales Congress Center München|International Congress Center (ICM)]] of [[Messe München]] with the support from the [[Bavaria|Bavarian State]] and the ''Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting'' (Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien – BLM).

== History ==
Medientage München were founded in 1987 by Wolf-Dieter Ring and [[Edmund Stoiber]] (both members of the [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|State Chancellery]] at the time), on behalf of the Bavarian government. The event is intended to bring private radio and television broadcasters, newspaper and magazine publishers, together with public broadcasters in joint discussions. The discussion topics range from current media policies relating to [[advertising]], to [[marketing]] and program quality issues in regards to the protection of minors. The Medientage München GmbH is the organizer of the congress since 1999. Managing directors are Reiner Müller, Johannes Kors and Christopher Tusch. The GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting (BLM).

== Congress ==
The Medientage München are considered one of the most important events of the [[Germany|German]] media industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wuv.de/medien/medientage_2012_die_neuen_gesetze_der_medienwelt | title= Medientage 2012: Die neuen Gesetze der Medienwelt | author=Katharina Hannen | date=27 July 2012 | website= | publisher=Werben &amp;Verkaufen | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speakers are from the television, radio, print and mobile, and digital business industries, along with advertisers, media politicians and filmmakers. To kick-off the Medientage München, the [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|Minister-President of Bavaria]] opens the event with the ''Mediengipfel'' (Media Summit).

== Media exhibition ==
At the exhibition, which is held at the same time, presentations from companies, institutions, and initiatives from media and communication industries can be found. On the grounds of the ''MedienCampus Bayern'', media training centers, journalism schools and employers in the media industry present themselves. Young professionals can find out about education and training for the media industry.

== Other events ==
Alongside the event is the “Nacht der Medien” ("Night of the media").

In addition to the central meeting point of the Medientage München, the Medientage München GmbH organizes further events to assist the communication industry – including the Audiovisual Media Days (AVMD): A congress for motion pictures media, marketing and corporate communication, that is held annually in Munich. Where some 400 representatives of the motion picture industry meet to report on trends surrounding online video, smart and web TV.

Additionally are the Munich Gaming and the Medientage Special (Media Days Special).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3837">'''Musical [[anhedonia]]''', also known formally as '''specific musical anhedonia''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10687919/Dont-like-music-Scientists-explain-why.html|title=Musical anhedonia: why some people just don't like music|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; signifies an individual's incapacity to enjoy listening to [[music]]. Recent empirical research suggests that 3 to 5% of the population are affected by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10687919/Dont-like-music-Scientists-explain-why.html|title=Musical anhedonia: why some people just don't like music|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable finding relevant to this phenomenon was borne out of a scientific study conducted in 2014, which revealed that while those exhibiting musical anhedonia do not have a problem comprehending music, they simply fail to experience or exhibit any material form of positive emotional response from listening to it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/musical-anhedonia_us_586e717ce4b02b5f85875c21|title=Not Liking Music Is An Actual Neurological Condition|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2017-01-06|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have utilized [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans to study patients via scanning their brains while the patients are being presented with the auditory stimulus of musical sounds. Patients were given other psychological and emotional perception-oriented tests that were related to the notion of money during the MRI procedure to effectively control the experiment for music or to isolate the effect or effects of the independent variable of music (i.e., in other words, to make sure they only showed no emotion while listening to music). The studies revealed that, relative to the average person, individuals whom are shown to exhibit this condition tend to have a significantly lesser degree of a connection in their brain between their [[auditory processing]] and [[reward center]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mas-Herrero|first=Ernest|last2=Zatorre|first2=Robert J.|last3=Rodriguez-Fornells|first3=Antoni|last4=Marco-Pallarés|first4=Josep|date=2014-03-17|title=Dissociation between Musical and Monetary Reward Responses in Specific Musical Anhedonia|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)00133-X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=24|issue=6|pages=699–704|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.01.068|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRI scans also showed that people with this condition have relatively little connection between the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[auditory processing]] compared to the average person. In fact, it was also empirically deduced that individuals who are shown to enjoy listening to music have a higher connection in this area of the brain than those who are found to have the condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Social stigma==
The majority of the world's population enjoys listening to music.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} According to some, for this reason, music can be considered to be a universal language. Individuals who suffer from musical anhedonia tend to find it challenging for themselves to understand why it is that they do not gain pleasure from listening to music. The core societal benefits that have emerged out of the new empirical research on the phenomenon are two-fold: it has helped people with this condition to better understand why they have it and it has served to educate the rest of the population that it is a real and legitimate condition that significantly impacts the lives of many around the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Map OC-Oceania.PNG|thumb|500px|Map of islands of [[Oceania]]]]

The '''Oceanian realm''' is one of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) [[biogeographic realm]]s, and is unique in not including any [[continent]]al land mass. It is the smallest in land of an area of the WWF realms.

This realm includes the  islands of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in: [[Micronesia]], the [[Fiji|Fijian Islands]], the [[Hawaiian islands]], and [[Polynesia]] (with the exception of New Zealand). 

[[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and most of [[Melanesia]] including [[New Guinea]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[New Caledonia]] are included within the [[Australasian realm]]. 

==Geology==
Oceania is geologically the youngest realm. While other realms include old continental land masses or fragments of continents, Oceania is composed mostly of volcanic [[high islands]] and [[coral atoll]]s that arose from the sea in geologically recent times, many of them in the [[Pleistocene]]. They were created either by [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanism, or as [[island arc]]s pushed upward by the collision and [[subduction]] of [[tectonic plate]]s. The islands range from tiny islets, sea stacks and coral [[atoll]]s to large mountainous islands, like [[Hawaii]] and [[Fiji]].

==Climate==

The climate of Oceania's islands is tropical or subtropical, and range from humid to seasonally dry. Wetter parts of the islands are covered by [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]], while the drier parts of the islands, including the leeward sides of the islands and many of the low coral islands, are covered by [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] and [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]]. [[Hawaii]]'s high volcanoes, [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]], are home to some rare tropical [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]].

==Flora and fauna==

Since the islands of Oceania were never connected by land to a continent, the flora and fauna of the islands originally reached them from across the ocean (though at the height of the last ice age sea levels were much lower than today and many current [[seamount]]s were islands, so some now isolated islands were once less isolated). Once they reached the islands, the ancestors of Oceania's present flora and fauna adapted to life on the islands. 

Larger islands with diverse ecological niches encouraged floral and faunal [[adaptive radiation]], whereby multiple species evolved from a common ancestor, each species adapted to a different ecological niche; the various species of [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s (Family ''Drepanididae'') are a classic example. Other adaptations to island ecologies include gigantism, dwarfism, and among birds, loss of flight. Oceania has a number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species; Hawaii in particular is considered a global 'center of endemism', with its forest [[ecoregion]]s having one of the highest percentages of endemic plants in the world. 

===Flora===

Land [[plant]]s disperse by several different means. Many plants, mostly ferns and mosses but also some flowering plants, disperse on the wind, relying on tiny spores or feathery seeds that can remain airborne over long distances notably ''[[Metrosideros]]'' trees from New Zealand spread on the wind across Oceania. Other plants, notably [[coconut palm]]s and [[mangroves]], produce seeds that can float in salt water over long distances, eventually washing up on distant beaches, and thus ''[[Coconut|Cocos]]'' trees are ubiquitous across Oceania. [[Bird]]s are also an important means of dispersal; some plants produce sticky seeds that are carried on the feet or feathers of birds, and many plants produce fruits with seeds that can pass through the digestive tracts of birds. ''[[Pandanus]]'' trees are fairly ubiquitous across Oceania.  

Botanists generally agree that much of the flora of Oceania is derived from the [[Malesia]]n Flora of the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[New Guinea]], with some plants from Australasia and a few from the [[Americas]], particularly in Hawaii. [[Easter Island]] has some plants from [[South America]] such as the [[totora (plant)|totora reed]].

===Fauna===

[[File:Kagu Rhynchetos jubatus detail.JPG|thumb|[[Kagu]] (''Rhynochetos jubatus''), a flightless bird from [[New Caledonia]]]]

Dispersal across the ocean is difficult for most land [[animal]]s, and Oceania has relatively few indigenous land animals compared to other realms. Certain types of animals that are ecologically important on the continental realms, like large land [[predator]]s and grazing mammals, were entirely absent from the islands of Oceania until humans brought them. [[Bird]]s are relatively common, including many [[seabird]]s and some species of land birds whose ancestors may have been blown out to sea by storms. Some birds evolved into flightless species after their ancestors arrived, including several species of [[rallidae|rails]].  A number of islands have indigenous [[lizard]]s, including [[gecko]]es and [[skink]]s, whose ancestors probably arrived on floating rafts of vegetation washed out to sea by storms. With the exception of [[bat]]s, which live on most of the island groups, there are few if any indigenous [[mammal]] species in Oceania.

==Impact of settlement==

Many animal and plant species have been introduced by humans in two main waves.

[[Malayo-Polynesian]] settlers brought [[pig]]s, [[dog]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[polynesian rat]]s to many islands; and had spread across the whole of Oceania by 1200 [[Common Era|CE]]. From the seventeenth century onwards European settlers brought other animals, including [[cat]]s, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, [[small Asian mongoose]] (''Herpestes javanicus''), [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, and the [[brown rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus''). These and other introduced species, in addition to overhunting and deforestation, have dramatically altered the ecology of many of Oceania's islands, pushing many species to extinction or near-extinction, or confining them to small islets uninhabited by humans.

The absence of predator species caused many bird species to become 'naive', losing the instinct to flee from predators, and to lay their eggs on the ground, which makes them vulnerable to introduced predators like cats, dogs, mongooses, and rats. The arrival of humans on these island groups often resulted in disruption of the indigenous ecosystems and waves of species extinctions (see [[Holocene extinction event]]). [[Easter Island]], the easternmost island in Polynesia, shows evidence of a human-caused ecosystem collapse several hundred years ago, which contributed (along with slave raiding and European diseases) to a 99% decline in the human population of the island. The island, once lushly forested, is now mostly windswept grasslands. More recently, [[Guam]]'s native bird and lizard species were decimated by the introduction of the [[brown tree snake]] (''Boiga irregularis'') in the 1940s.

'''Problem property''' is [[terminology]] used by [[city government]]s seeking to apply pressure to the owners and managers of buildings where [[crime]] has occurred. "Problem property" is also used to describe any land or building that has negative issues associated with it, such as difficult to sell, uncertain ownership, flooding, etc.

In the rental-property industry, the theory is that [[landlord]]s have a duty to ensure [[leasehold estate|tenants]] will not engage in criminal behavior that affects the quality of life of neighbors.  And that the failure of some landlords to screen applicants appropriately for their units can lead to greater criminality and lower quality of life in some [[neighborhood]]s.

Critics claim that it is in the political interest of local-government officials and [[police]] to shift the blame for crime from the criminals and the responsibility for fighting crime themselves to nearby property owners.  This is a common strategy in [[community policing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4769">A '''project anatomy''' (also '''integration anatomy or organic integration plan''') is a tool for integration planning that visualizes dependencies between work items in development projects. It is mainly used in [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental development]] and [[Integration Driven Development]] projects.

The project anatomy has evolved from the [[system anatomy]] and in its purest form the work items (called ''work packages'') reflect the development of system capabilities. Often a more pragmatic approach is taken, though, where work packages may contain other items with important dependencies as well, e.g. HW deliveries for embedded systems.

&lt;big&gt;'''Benefits:'''&lt;/big&gt; 
* Simple
* Easy to grasp view of what to do, what is done and the dependencies between work packages
* Collaborative
* Common view for developers, project managers and sponsors
* Helps in finding and managing risks and delays
* Can be used to manage dependencies between teams and sprints in large [[Agile software development|agile development]] projects

&lt;big&gt;'''Limitations:'''&lt;/big&gt;
* Can include, but not manage, lead time aspects
* Can include, but not manage, resource aspects

== History ==
History of [[system anatomy|system anatomies]]
Project anatomies have evolved from system anatomies, mainly at Ericsson, since the late 1990s. Both the terminology and the methodology have differed between organizations and the difference between "system anatomy", "project anatomy", "delta anatomy" and "integration anatomy" is sometimes diffuse or non-existent. In 2004 FindOut Technologies presented a SW tool (Paipe) for managing anatomies with more properties. The company has, since then, worked to establish the term Project Anatomy.

== Example ==
The project anatomy below is an example showing the work packages needed to develop a simple issue management system. 

Work packages with many dependencies are called spiders and indicate a risk. The risk may be managed by splitting the work package or by moving dependants of it to later shipments (increments).

The colors indicate the current status of work packages, where green means “on track”, yellow means “at risk” and red means “off track”. Blue work packages are done.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9861">[[File:Pg713d.jpg|thumb|right|Hillary Clinton in front of the Star Spangled Banner, one of the first Save America's Treasures Projects, 1998]]'''Save America's Treasures''' is a [[United States federal government]] initiative to preserve and protect historic buildings, arts, and published works.  It is a public-private partnership between the U.S. [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].  The [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[Heritage Preservation]], and the [[National Park Foundation]] also are allied.

==History==
Save America's Treasures (SAT) was established by [[Executive Order 13072]] in February 1998 by President [[Bill Clinton]], in conjunction with the [[White House Millennium Council]]'s activities.  Instrumental in its founding was then [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New York Times|title=Hillary Clinton Inaugurates Preservation Campaign|author=Patricia Leigh Brown|accessdate=2017-05-20|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/14/us/hillary-clinton-inaugurates-preservation-campaign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CSPAN|title='Saving America's Treasures'|access-date=2017-05-20|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?108823-1/saving-americas-treasures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Honorary Chair is traditionally the First Lady as designated by the [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[NEH]]|title=''IMLS ANNOUNCES SAVE AMERICA’S TREASURES GRANT AWARDS''|accessdate=2017-05-20|url=https://www.neh.gov/files/press-release/2009_sat_awards.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2009, First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] said “Save America’s Treasures invests in our nation’s irreplaceable legacy of buildings, documents, collections and artistic works. These awards empower communities all over the country to rescue and restore this priceless heritage, and ensure that future generations continue to learn from the voices, ideas, events and people represented by these projects.”  Despite this initial endorsement, both the Save America's Treasures and the [[Preserve America]] grant programs were later eliminated by the Obama Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/treasures/ |title=Save America's Treasures Grants |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 2010, President Barack Obama in his "Tough Choices" FY 2011 Budget proposed eliminating the Save America's Treasures and Preserve America grant programs, stating that "both programs lack rigorous performance metrics and evaluation efforts so the benefits are unclear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/01/30/tough-choices |title=Tough Choices &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Trust for Historic Preservation eliminated its Save America's Treasures office in 2011 during a reorganization.

The '''Scholars Strategy Network''' ('''SSN''') is an association of academics and researchers who coordinate to address public challenges while increasing the accessibility of their findings to those outside of [[academia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/paul-ryan-budget-plan-targeted-progressive-academics_n_1752507.html Siddiqui, Sabrina.

''Harvard Magazine.'' 15 February 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the work of individual SSN members is typically published in [[academic journals]], the organization encourages its members to write "briefs" about current issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/content/social-scientists-seek-new-ways-influence-public-policy McMurtrie, Beth.

''The Washington Post: The Monkey Cage.'' 24 September 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; These shorter pieces, written in consideration of a lay audience, are published on the organization's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/24/how-legislators-view-their-constituents.html Tomasky, Michael. "How Legislators View Their Constituents." ''The Daily Beast.'' 24 September 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the Scholars Strategy Network with an associated website was originally conceived of in 2009 by [[sociologist]] and [[political scientist]] [[Theda Skocpol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/paul-ryan-budget-plan-targeted-progressive-academics_n_1752507.html Siddiqui, Sabrina. "Paul Ryan Budget Plan Targeted By Progressive Academics Via Scholars Strategy Network." ''The Huffington Post.'' 7 August 2012. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The association is backed by donors Robert Bowditch, Jr. and David desJardins, both of whom are affiliated with the progressive [[Democracy Alliance]], but the Scholars Strategy Network does not take formal positions on policy questions or support or oppose particular political candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news2.sanford.duke.edu/newsletters/Insights11_12.pdf Stanford Insights Staff.

== Regional Networks ==

An SSN Regional Network includes scholars who live or work in that region, and each is coordinated by a leader or co-leaders who set the regional agenda and organize discussions and public events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2013/03/21/experts-explore-who-controls-government Shan, Tony.

'''The Sibelius Museum''' ([[Finnish language|'''Finnish''']]: ''&lt;span lang="fi" dir="ltr"&gt;Sibelius-museo&lt;/span&gt;'', '''[[Swedish language|Swedish]]''': ''&lt;span lang="sv" dir="ltr"&gt;Sibeliusmuseum&lt;/span&gt;'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/|title=Home - Sibeliusmuseum|website=Sibeliusmuseum|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[museum]] of [[music]], named after the [[Finland|Finnish]] composer [[Jean Sibelius]]. The museum is located close to [[Turku Cathedral]] in the historical city centre of [[Turku]] on the [[Southwest Finland|southwest coast of Finland]]. It is the only museum devoted to [[Music of Finland|music in Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kansanmusiikkikansantanssi.fi/yhteiso/sibeliusmuseum-sibelius-museo|title=Sibeliusmuseum / Sibelius-museo|date=2012-01-04|work=Kansanmusiikki.fi|access-date=2018-07-25|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum houses a wide collection of historical music instruments from around the world. The archives of the museum include documents (sheet music, manuscripts, recordings, photographs, concert programmes, etc.) The museum was first founded during the 1920s as a seminar for the Department of [[Musicology]] at [[Åbo Akademi University]], and has later developed into its own department. The Museum is currently organised and funded by the Åbo Akademi Foundation. The current building was built and opened in 1968 and it was designed by architect Woldemar Baeckman.

== General information about the Museum ==
The museum consists of two primary exhibitions: the instrument collection and the Sibelius exhibition. The instrument collections circles around the concert hall of the museum, The Sibelius Hall, and continues to the second floor downstairs. The Sibelius exhibition is located at the furthest left corner seen from the ticket counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/exhibitions/|title=Exhibitions - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also organises thematic exhibitions. In 2018, these exhibitions are “''Sibbe50”'' and ''“A cantata for the doctors – Music at academic ceremonies”. “´Sibbe50”'' celebrates the architecture of Woldemar Baeckman and the 50th anniversary of the current museum building. The exhibition “''A cantata for the doctors – Music at academic” ceremonies'' covers music performed at conferment ceremonies in [[Education in Finland|Finnish]] [[University|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/exhibitions/news/|title=Thematic exhibitions - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sibelius Museum also organises concerts at the museum, of which the most notable is the museum’s own concert series, the Wednesday series that has been organised since 1968. In addition to these concerts, there are also other concerts organised at the museum. The programme of the concert varies depending on the performer, but mostly the music played at The Sibelius Museum is focused on [[jazz]], [[folk music]] and [[Classical music|classical]] [[chamber music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/concerts/|title=Concerts - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sibbe_yksityiskohta.jpg|alt=|thumb|381x381px|Details of the facade]]

The archives of The Sibelius Museum dates back to the collections of professor [[Otto Andersson (musicologist)|Otto Andersson]] of the Musicological Department at Åbo Akademi University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/archive/|title=Archive - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives contain material from several different aspects of musical life in Finland, such as manuscripts, photographs and recordings. There are additionally several special collections in the archives. These collections include an extensive collection about Jean Sibelius, the Otto Andersson archival collection and the archive of the Musical Society of [[Turku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/archive/collections/|title=Collections - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the exhibitions and the archives, there are also a couple of auditoriums and classrooms in the premises of the museum. For instance, the auditoriums [[Per Brahe the Younger|Brahe]] and Flora that have been named after the student choirs of Åbo Akademi University, [[Brahe Djäknar]] and [[Florakören]].&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 256"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Flyygeli_Sibelius-salissa.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|347x347px|A grand piano in The Sibelius Hall]]

=== Time before the museum: Pehr Kalm and the botanical garden ===
At the site of The Sibelius Museum, the botanical garden of the [[Royal Academy of Turku]] ('''[[Swedish language|Swedish]]''': ''&lt;span lang="sv" dir="ltr"&gt;Kungliga Akademien I Åbo&lt;/span&gt;'', '''[[Finnish language|Finnish:]]''' &lt;span lang="fi" dir="ltr"&gt;Kuninkaallinen Turun Akatemia&lt;/span&gt;) was located. [[Pehr Kalm]], a pupil of [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]], founded the garden in 1757.&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 254"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the garden, he planted plants from his trips to [[North America]] and [[Russia]]. After the [[Great Fire of Turku|great fire of Turku]] in 1827, the only plant that survived was an [[Oak|oak tree]] that stands between the bank of the [[Aura (Archipelago Sea)|river Aura]] and the current museum building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turun seudun arkkitehtuuriopas|last=Laaksonen &amp; Nummelin|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fire, printer Christian Ludvig Hjelt bought the site of the garden in 1831 and built a couple of wooden houses on the plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Åbo Akademi University ===
In 1923, Ellen and [[Magnus Dahlström]] donated the site of the garden to the Åbo Akademi Foundation in a will.&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 254"/&gt; Attempts to restore the garden to its original state were made during the 1930s, during which Justus Montell aimed at planting his collections next to the oak from Kalm’s era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After he died in [[1954]] the attempts were ended, which lead to the decaying of the garden and demolitions of the houses built by Hjelt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Otto Andersson as the founder of the Musicological Department and Archives ===
[[File:Sibelius-museo,_yksityiskohta.jpg|alt=|thumb|376x376px|Further details on the wall]]
The foundations of the proper historical music museum were already made in 1926, when [[Otto Andersson (musicologist)|Otto Andersson]] was granted the professorship of the recently established Department of [[Musicology]] and [[Folklore]] at [[Åbo Akademi University]].&lt;ref name="History - Sibeliusmuseum"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/museum/history/|title=History - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship-owner [[Robert Mattson (businessman)|Robert Mattson]] donated the necessary funds to fund the professorship and to purchase materials for the collection and the seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mattson’s son, Curt, had donated a notable collection of instruments from all around the world for the collections of professor Andersson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea behind the collections was, however, to form a seminar for the Department of Musicology that would have as large of a [[library]] as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Museum receives its current name ===
Before the year 1949, The Sibelius Museum did not yet have a proper name, and it was simply known as ''“The historical music collections of Åbo Akademi University”.''&lt;ref name="Andersson 2018 182"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History - Sibeliusmuseum"/&gt; In the late 1940s, an exhibition about the composer [[Jean Sibelius]] was organised. There were several items placed in the exhibition varying from sheet music to letters and manuscripts. Some journalist miscalled the exhibition “The Sibelius Museum”, which aroused controversy between professor Andersson and the rector of Åbo Akademi University G.O. Rosenqvist. To avoid any further confusion about the exhibition, professor Andersson sent a letter to the composer, in which he asked a formal permission to use the name of Sibelius in official contexts. The composed replied in 16 January 1949 with the following words:&lt;ref name="Andersson 2018 182"/&gt;{{Quote|text=“It is with great pleasure I agree on that the historical music collections of the school of Åbo Akademi shall bear the name “Sibelius Museum”. To you, I am deeply grateful for the friendly interest you have always shown towards my life and my art. It has followed something unique from this; from that, Åbo Akademi University has the greatest collection in existence. It gives me pride and joy to accept this.”|sign=Jean Sibelius|source=}}After the name change, the museum received its first permanent premises in the house that currently works as the restaurant Hus Lindman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://huli.fi/historia|title=Historia - Hus Lindman - Ravintola Turku|work=Hus Lindman - Ravintola Turku|access-date=2018-07-25|language=fi-FI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manor at Piispankatu 15, “''The Sibelius Museum”'' had seven rooms in use, to which the collections and the administrative areas were placed. At the same time, new acquisitions were increased. For example, Andersson travelled with these purposes in America during the 1950s. The years in this building turned out to be long and hard, and hopes for an exclusive building for the museum were arisen.&lt;ref name="Andersson 2018 182"/&gt;

=== The planning of the current building ===
Towards the end of the 1950s, several discussions were made between the city of [[Turku]] and [[Åbo Akademi University]] to build a joint museum about [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Wäinö Aaltonen]]. The idea was put forward with the thought of using the site of the garden from Kalm’s era as the base for the museum. This joint venture, however, dissolved and only the plans to build The Sibelius Museum advanced. Regardless of this, the city of Turku still funded the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pilareita_Sibelius-salissa.jpg|alt=|thumb|Pilars in The Sibelius Hall]]
Architect Woldemar Baeckman was during the 1960s assigned to design the building for the museum for Åbo Akademi University. In his original plans, he had planned a separate wing for the choir activities of the university. Before the final plans, a couple of investigations were made in 1963 and 1966. The conclusion of these investigations was to give up this thought of building a separate wing and the focus was put on the main building. During the autumn of 1966, the final plans were finished and during the next year, the construction work started. The construction of the building was completed in February 1968, during which the building was put in use.&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 256"/&gt;

The building is a notable example of the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete architecture of its time, though Baeckman's earlier architecture was more classically modernist in style, most notably the extension to the Åbo Akademi University Library. The exterior architecture is notable for the grains of the timber [[formwork]] being visible in the prefabricated concrete facades. The interior is particularly notable for the large hyperbolic paraboloid-shaped concrete shell structure, said to have been influenced by the then contemporaneous architecture of the Mexican architect [[Félix Candela]]. In the centre of the building is a hidden courtyard which originally had a garden (since demolished) designed by noted Finnish garden designer Maj-Lis Rosenbröijer.

'''''Sophia''''' is an academic journal devoted to professional pursuits in [[philosophy, metaphysics]], [[religion]] and moral thinking, founded in 1962 by Max Charlesworth and Graeme de Graaf. From 2001 Sophia was published by [[Ashgate Publishing]] in collaboration with the Australasian Society for Philosophy of Religion and Theology, and Australasian Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy (University of Melbourne and Deakin University respectively). The journal has since moved to [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] in Dordrecht, with its editorial office split between Melbourne, Australia and both coasts of the United States. The Editors-in-Chief are [[Purushottama Bilimoria]], [[Patrick Hutchings]], and [[Jay Garfield]].

Together with the [[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]], it is one of the most prominent Australasian (meaning, Australia, New Zealand, The Pacific, Singapore, &amp; H K) journals in the areas of philosophy, ethics and religion It prides itself in its rigorously scholarly profile, which is reflected in the international composition of its editorial board and the diverse philosophical traditions in which its contributors work, ranging from analytic, continental, to Asian/cross-cultural, feminist and indigenous concerns.

They also solve problems of [[automation]].&lt;ref name=howtoworkwith/&gt; Systems integrators may work in many fields but the term is generally used in the [[information technology]] (IT) field such as [[computer network]]ing, the [[defense industry]], the [[mass media]], [[enterprise application integration]], [[business process management]] or manual [[computer programming]].&lt;ref name="Info"&gt;{{Citation| last=Moore | first=June | date =13 December 1982| contribution= Software Reviews, BusinessMaster II+, ledger for CP/M systems| title=InfoWorld | publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc| page = 31 | issn=0199-6649}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data quality]] issues are an important part of the work of systems integrators.&lt;ref name=fixdata/&gt;

== Required skills ==
A system integration engineer needs a broad range of skills and is likely to be defined by a breadth of knowledge rather than a depth of knowledge.  These skills are likely to include [[software architecture|software]], [[systems architecture|systems]] and [[enterprise architecture|enterprise]] architecture, [[software engineering|software]] and [[hardware engineering|hardware]] engineering, [[Protocol (computing)|interface protocols]], and general problem solving skills. It is likely that the problems to be solved have not been solved before except in the broadest sense. They are likely to include new and challenging problems with an input from a broad range of engineers where the system integration engineer "pulls it all together."&lt;ref name="BUPT"&gt;{{Citation |title=An Introduction to School of Information Engineering, Information Engineering Program|publisher=Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications|location=Beijing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance technology Integration==

Systems integrators generally have to be good at matching clients needs with existing products. An [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] is useful for quickly understanding how to operate a system or a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. A systems integrator will tend to benefit from being a generalist, knowing a lot about a large number of products. Systems integration includes a substantial amount of diagnostic and troubleshooting work. The ability to research existing products and software components is also helpful. Creation of these information systems may include designing or building customized vehicle prototypes or concepts for future investors and sponsors for a good model or example of the revamped  integrations to come - [[Hybrid Technology]], [[Electric]]{{dn|date=September 2017}}, [[Turbocharged]], [[Svt]]{{dn|date=September 2017}}, [[McLaren]], Greenwood, [[Ac shnitzer]],[are some of the specialized teams of Factory/Performance integration that drives auto designers to stay competitive and keep the cutting edge feel in any Brand from Dodge to Pagani there are areas for improvement that can only be tweaked and twisted to stay a cut above the rest and maintain the physical appearance of the specialty teams trademark modifications.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

==In the defense industry==

In the defense industry, the job of 'Systems Integration' engineer is growing in importance as defense systems become more 'connected'.  As well as integrating new systems, the task of integrating current systems is attracting a lot of research and effort.  It is only in recent years that systems have started to be deployed that can interconnect with each other; most systems were designed as 'stovepipe' designs with no thought to future connectivity.

The current problem is how to harness all the information available, from the various information generators (or sensors) into one complete picture.

As well as the design of the actual interfaces much effort is being put into presenting the information in a useful manner.  The level of information, needed by the different levels in the military structure, and the relevance of the information (information can become outdated in seconds) is so variable that it may be necessary to have more than one system connected.

Another problem is how information is networked.  The Internet may seem to be an obvious solution, but it is vulnerable to [[denial of service]] and physical destruction of the key 'hubs'.  One answer is to use a dedicated military communication system, but the [[Throughput|bandwidth]] needed would be astronomical in such a system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Army [[Warrant Officer (United States)]] military occupational specialty (MOS) 140A - Command and Control Systems Technician is an example of a systems integrator in the defense industry.
140A Warrant Officers assigned to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) integrate systems with multiple [[operating systems]] (OS) and hardware configurations – that include: 
[[UNIX]], [[Linux]] &amp; [[Microsoft Windows]]
Others can fill a similar role at the Division level and higher.

==In Entertainment and architectural controls==

In entertainment and architectural installations, systems integrators function as a designer/engineer, bringing together a wide array of components from various manufacturers to accomplish the goal of creating a unified, functioning system that meets the needs of the client.  Systems Integrators are usually involved in the selection of instruments and control components from among various [[OEMs]] to determine the specific mix of output, function, interconnection, program storage, controls, and user interfaces required for specific projects.  The integrator is generally responsible for generating the control riser, collaborating with the lighting consultant/ AV consultant on the function programming, and will commission the system once installed.  Often (but not always) the system integrator will also be the vendor for projects they are commissioning, and will collaborate with the lighting designer on the artistic design.  As lighting and A/V systems increase in their level of sophistication, and the number of manufacturers for components of these systems increases, so does the demand for systems integrators.
 
Common data protocols involved in entertainment and architectural systems are [[DMX512-A|Digital Multiplexing (or DMX512-A)]], [[RDM (lighting)|Remote Device Management (or RDM)]], [[Art-Net]], [[Architecture for Control Networks|ACN]] or sACN (Streaming Architecture for Control Networks), Analog, and various proprietary control software from a variety of manufacturers.  Systems Integrators design many distributed nodes in traditional star or ring topologies, or customize system layout for specific installations.  The network will have a hierarchy of main and sub-control stations with varying degrees of access.  The network can be designed such that the controls for this system can be on an established timeline, or controlled in real time by astronomical clocks, audio/motion/IR sensors, or various means of user interface (buttons, touch-pads, consoles).  This system might utilize a primary controller that can access the entire system, and satellite control interfaces linked via a network backbone that would determine functionality based on access codes.  For example, a casino might use a networked system that interfaces with architectural lighting, stage lighting, special effects (such as fog machines or fountains), and media content routed to a media server.  The primary controller would have access to all devices on the network, while individual control stations could have varying levels of functionality.  A ballroom might have a multi-button panel that would adjust lighting only in that ballroom, while a cabaret space with a stage would require an access code that would give employees access to the stage lighting, while the IT manager could use the same panel to access the main controls for the networks.

== In the automation industry ==
{{main article|Automation integrator}}
System Integrators in the automation industry typically provide the product and application experience in implementing complex automation solutions.  Often, System Integrators are aligned with automation vendors, joining their various System Integrator programs for access to development products, resources and technical support.  System integrators are tightly linked to their accounts and often are viewed as the engineering departments for small manufacturers, handling their automation system installation, commissioning and long term maintenance.

{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In [[Romania]] transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if [[Romania]] is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should be said that the focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the [[National Audiovisual Council]] (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the [[Trade Register Company]]. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

===Media-specific law: disclosure to a public authority===

Romanian law on media ownership transparency only covers the broadcast sector and has no similar provision for print media, but, in practice, many Romanian newspapers make public their publishers and owners. The situation is more complicated for online media and blogs where anonymity is very common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2016-romania.pdf.pdf IREX 2016, Europe &amp; Eurasia Media Sustainability Index 2016: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant law, named [[Audiovisual Law no. 504]], requires the disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organisation; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the disclosure requirement does not apply to [[beneficial ownership]], which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the [[National Audiovisual Council]], a public regulatory authority under the control of the Parliament. The CNA is the guarantor of the public interest in the audiovisual field.

One of the main problem of the law concerns indirect interest: threshold for disclosing indirect interest, which is 20%, looks too high to provide proper information for assessing media ownership and guaranteeing transparency. Furthermore, getting information on individuals or companies with indirect control or significant interests in a given media company is quite time-consuming and complex as it requires in practice a step-by-step process of checking and cross-referencing of a large number of different records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to constraints or costs for public access to the information held by the [[National Audiovisual Council]] there are not particularly high costs or time-consuming procedures, even if, in general terms, accessing information held by public institutions often entails several barriers, such as the reluctance of public officials to reveal sensitive information and their resort to broad interpretations of the exceptions to public disclosure of information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the legal framework provides the disclosure of nearly all the information needed to identify ownership of the broadcast media in Romania. However, the threshold for reporting indirect interest (20%), the difficulties in obtaining information on entities or persons with indirect control and significant interest, abuses and poor implementation, the lack of co-operation between the CNA and other authorities leave room to abuses and insufficient disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media-specific law: disclosure directly to the public===

According to Article. 48 of Law 504 of 2002, media companies from the audiovisual field must also disclose the information on media ownership directly to the public through their websites. The requirement applies to all kind of information to be disclosed in accordance with the law. In particular, financial information must be updated and disclosed on an annual basis, while the other information must be always available to the public (requirement of the “permanent access” by the public, according to Article 48).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-media specific transparency requirements: company law ===

In addition to the Audiovisual Law, another source of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Romania is [[Corporate law|company law]] which contains non-media specific transparency requirements. The relevant law, which is the Law 31 / 1990 on Trading Companies is applicable to all registered media company owing a licence and forbids owners' anonymity: companies are therefore obliged to publish all the main information on ownership in the [[Trade Register Office]] (TRO) and to communicate changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; All the constitutive deeds and the modifications are registered in the Trade Registry and published in the Official Journal. The specific information to be disclosed depends on the legal type of the company and might be different for each type of business organisations. However, the mandatory information for all companies are: names, the date and the place of birth, the address and the citizenship of the partners / shareholders (in case of natural persons); the name, the headquarter address and the nationality of the associates (in case of legal persons); the type, name, headquarters address and the company logo; the company’s field of activity; the registered capital, including the contribution of each partner in cash or in kind; the number and the face value of the shares and the number of shares given to each partners; the managers of the company and their rights; the share given to each associate in case of profit and loss; secondary headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The public can directly access this data by requesting information from the Trade Registry. Also, since the constitutive documents are also published in the Official Journal, the public can consult this information through the institutional website of the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the law requires the disclosure of all necessary information on ownership, in fact this data have to be reported to various agencies. This might imply, for instance, a complicated step-by-step check process involving request for information from different agencies for each company in the cases of chains of ownership, such as companies owning other companies and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as there are minimal financial sanctions for failure to report in time, in practice few companies comply with the obligation to update ownership information.

According to some critics, the Trade Register Office only shows the tip of the iceberg since the real owner of the media and who effectively controls them remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;. Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, although public, the access to information collected in the Register is not free of charge and can even be prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limits, the TRO remains the main source of data on media ownership in Romania&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;. Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the learning process might be time-consuming, especially in the most complex cases of unclear ownership, all in all it is feasible given sufficient time and resources to collect all the needed information, including [[beneficial ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership in practice==

Despite the fact that Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the [[European Commission]] and the [[Council of Europe]] standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems. Among the main shortcomings there is the absence of the requirement to disclose all the necessary data to establish which are the owners in case of indirect control or having significant interests in the media company. Moreover, at the practical level, the implementation of the law leaves room for abuses and inadequate disclosure. In sum, a set of factors, including the difficulty in ascertain indirect control and significant interest, implementation problems as well as the challenges in accessing public information result in a significant difficulty for the general public in accessing all the key information to establish who effectively owns and ultimately controls a media outlet.

[[File:Troldhaugen 1022.jpg|thumb|Troldhaugen]]
[[File:Troldsalen-inne03.jpg|thumb|The podium in Troldsalen]]
'''Troldhaugen''' is the former home of [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[composer]] [[Edvard Grieg]] and his wife [[Nina Grieg]]. Troldhaugen is located in [[Bergen, Norway]] and consists of the Edvard Grieg [[Museum]], Grieg’s villa, the hut where he composed music, and his and his wife's [[gravesite]].

==Background==
The building was designed by Grieg's cousin, the architect [[Schak Bull]]. The name comes from ''trold'' meaning [[troll]] and ''haug'' from the [[Old Norse]] word ''haugr'' meaning hill or knoll. Grieg is reputed to have said that children called the nearby small valley  "The Valley of Trolls" and thus gave the name for his building as well. Edvard Grieg himself called the building "my best composition hitherto".

Edvard and Nina Grieg finished building Troldhaugen in 1885. Edvard and Nina Grieg lived in Troldhaugen when he was home in Norway, mostly in the summer.  Troldhaugen was the home of Edvard Grieg from April 1885 to his death. After the death of her husband in 1907, Nina Grieg moved to Denmark where she spent the remainder of her life.  Grieg's and his wife's ashes rest inside a mountain [[tomb]] near the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://griegmuseum.no/en/about-troldhaugen About Troldhaugen - Grieg museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Troldhaugen is a typical 19th-century residence with panoramic tower and a large veranda.  Grieg's small composer's hut overlooks Nordås Lake. Grieg immortalized the name of his home in one of his piano pieces, ''[[Wedding Day at Troldhaugen]]'', Opus 65, No. 6.

==Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen==
Troldhaugen and its surroundings are now operated as the Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen which is dedicated to the memory of Edvard Grieg. In 1995, a museum building was added, with a permanent exhibition of Edvard Grieg's life and music, as well as shop and restaurant. In the villa’s living room stands Grieg’s own [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] [[grand piano]], which he was given as a [[silver wedding anniversary]] present in 1892. Today the instrument is used for private concerts, special occasions and intimate concerts held in connection with [[Bergen International Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergenbyarkiv.no/bergenbyleksikon/arkiv/1424370 ''Troldhaugen'' (Bergen byleksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the noted Norwegian pianist [[Leif Ove Andsnes]] has recorded an album of selections from Grieg's ten volumes of ''[[Lyric Pieces]]''.

Troldsalen, a concert hall,  offers concert series in the summer and autumn months, as well as many other concerts and events. Troldsalen, which was completed in 1985, is an elegant and beautiful concert hall, with excellent acoustics. The floor-to-ceiling windows behind the stage provide the audience with a lovely view of the composer's hut and Lake Nordås.

==Trivia==
*Australian experimental folk metal band Troldhaugen take their name from the home, as well as incorporate excerpts of Grieg's music into their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Troldhaugen/3540317025 ''Troldhaugen'' (metal-archives)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UC Berkeley School of Information''' or the '''I School''' is a graduate school offering three degree programs: a professional master's degree in information management (MIMS), a professional master's degree in data science (MIDS), and an academic doctoral degree. Created in 1994, the I School is UC Berkeley's newest school. It was previously known as the School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS) until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/about&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots trace back to UC Berkeley's School of Librarianship founded in the 1920s. The program is located in UC Berkeley's [[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]], near [[Sather Tower]] in the center of the [[UC Berkeley]] campus.

==Curriculum==

===MIMS program===
The Master of Information Management &amp; Systems (MIMS) program is a 48 unit, two-year program designed to train students for careers as information professionals. Students who complete the program are awarded the Masters of Information Management and Systems (MIMS) degree. During the first year MIMS students take required courses in Information Organization and Retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/202&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed Computing Applications and Infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/206&lt;/ref&gt; Social and Organizational Issues of Information,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/203&lt;/ref&gt; and Information Law and Policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/205&lt;/ref&gt; During the second year students may choose from elective courses both at the I School and in other departments. The final prerequisite for the MIMS degree is the completing of a group or individual thesis project.

===MIDS program===
The Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program is an innovative part-time fully online program that trains data-savvy professionals and managers. Working with data at scale requires distinctive new skills and tools. The MIDS program is distinguished by its disciplinary breadth; unlike other programs that focus on advanced mathematics and modeling alone, the MIDS degree provides students insights from social science and policy research, as well as statistics, computer science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://datascience.berkeley.edu/|title=Earn Your Master’s in Data Science Online|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ph.D. program===
The doctoral program is a research-oriented program in which the student chooses specific fields of specialization, prepares sufficiently in the literature and the research of those fields to pass written and oral examinations, and completes original research culminating in the written dissertation. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is conferred in recognition of a candidate's grasp of a broad field of learning and distinguished accomplishment in that field through contribution of an original piece of research revealing high critical ability and powers of imagination and synthesis.

=== MICS program ===
The Master of Information and Cybersecurity degree program addresses multiple aspects of cybersecurity, including cryptography, secure programming, web security, operating system security, and network security. The Master's in Cybersecurity is now offered online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cybersecurity.berkeley.edu|title=Online Cybersecurity Degree|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|South Hall (UC Berkeley)}}

The School of Information is located in historic [[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]]. Built in 1873, it is the oldest building in the University of California system. South Hall is located in the heart of campus, near the Doe Library and the Campanile (also known as [[Sather Tower]]).  It is known to have the smallest bear statue on the Berkeley campus{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The small bear was added by Michael H. Casey, who did the ornamental castings for the restored facade in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Campus Guides: University of California Berkeley |last= Helfland |first=Harvey | year=2001 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn= 1-56898-293-3 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual arts education''' is the area of learning that is based upon only the kind of art that one can see, [[visual arts]]—[[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], and design in [[jewelry]], [[pottery]], [[weaving]], [[fabrics]], etc. and design applied to more practical fields such as commercial graphics and home furnishings. Contemporary topics include [[photography]], [[video]], [[film]], [[design]], and [[computer art]].  Art education may focus on students creating art, on learning to criticize or appreciate art, or some combination of the two.

Art is often taught through [[drawing]], an empirical activity which involves seeing, interpreting and discovering appropriate marks to reproduce an observed phenomenon. Drawing instruction has been a component of formal education in the West since the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Art Education|page= 177

Prominent curricular models for art education include:

*Discipline Based Art Education (DBAE) came to favor in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, and it focused on specific skills including techniques, art criticism and art history.

*Teaching for Artistic Behavior (TAB) is a choice-based model that began in the 1970s in Massachusetts in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teachingforartisticbehavior.org/|title=Teaching for Artistic Behavior|accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAB suggests that students should be the artists and be guided on their own individual artistic interests.

In addition, especially in higher education in the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]] tradition, art is often taught as "art appreciation", a subject for [[aesthetic]] criticism rather than direct engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Issues in Competency Based Education|page= 10

|first1=Susan V. |last1=Monjan|first2=Suzanne M. |last2=Gassner |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies show that strong art education programs have demonstrated increased student performance in other academic areas, due to art activities' exercising their brains' right hemispheres and delateralizing their thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jensen |first= Eric|title= Arts with the Brain in Mind |year= 2001 |publisher= [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |location= Alexandria, Virginia |isbn= 0-87120-514-9 |pages= 57–58, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also see [[Betty Edwards]]' ''[[Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain]]''.

Art education is not limited to formal educational institutions. Some professional artists provide private or semi-private instruction in their own studios. This may take the form of an [[apprenticeship]] in which the student learns from a professional artist while assisting the artist with their work.  One form of this teaching style is the [[Atelier Method]] as exemplified by [[Gustave Moreau]] who taught Picasso, Braque and many other artists.{{sfn|Efland|1990|pp=52-53}}

===Apprenticeship===
[[File:Sweerts, Michael - The Drawing Class - 1656-58.jpg|thumb|''The Drawing Class'', by [[Michiel Sweerts]], c. 1656]]
Historically art was taught in Europe via the [[atelier method]] system&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatelier.org/ Atelier instruction]&lt;/ref&gt; where artists took on apprentices who learned their trade in much the same way as that of [[trade guild|guilds]] such as the [[stonemason]]s or [[goldsmith]]s. During their free time formal training took place in art workshops or, more often, in homes or alone outside. It was in these ateliers that artists learned the craft through apprenticeship to masters, a relationship that was controlled by guild statutes. Florentine contracts dating from the late 13th century state that the master was expected to clothe and feed the apprentice, who was called upon to be a faithful servant in return. An apprentice often paid the master during the early years of his education; assuming the apprenticeship was productive, the student would be compensated later in his training. Northern European workshops featured similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, Jill, et al. ''Giotto to Durer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery'', 136. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1991. {{ISBN|0-300-05070-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, learning to draw was a priority in this system. [[Michelangelo]] recommended that a young painter spend a year on drawing alone, then six years grinding colors, preparing panels and using gold leaf, during which time the study of drawing would continue. Another six years would be required to master fresco and tempera painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, Jill, et al. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, design has had some precedence over the [[fine arts]] with [[design school|schools of design]] being established all over Europe in the 18th century. These examples of skill and values from the early European art inspired later generations, including the Colonists of early America.

===Cultural appropriation within the classroom===

Individuals who employ cultural appropriation have the ability to produce works of considerable aesthetic merit.&lt;ref&gt;James O. Young, “Art, Authenticity and Appropriation” Front. Philos. China (2006) 3:455–476 (2006): 456, accessed October 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11466-006-0019-2&lt;/ref&gt; Using properties of art from different cultures such as decoration or emulation of creative process can foster a greater understanding and appreciation of crafts from different cultures. This technique can be appreciated in the production of African or Native-American mask making projects, where students emulate technique and explore new material use and construction methods which esteem those practices of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Manley Delacruz, “Approaches to Multiculturalism in Art Education Curriculum Products: Business as Usual” Journal of Aesthetic Education(1996): 85 Accessed November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Argentina===
Leading country in the development of the arts in [[Latin America]], in 1875 created the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts, founded by painters [[Eduardo Schiaffino]], [[Eduardo Sívori]], and other artists. Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and, in 1923, on the initiative of painter and academic [[Ernesto de la Cárcova]], as a department in the [[University of Buenos Aires]], the Superior Art School of the Nation. Currently, the leading educational organization for the arts in the country is the [[Universidad Nacional de las Artes|UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes]]&lt;ref&gt;Institutional Transformation IUNA - Law 24.521, Ministry of Justice &amp; Education, Argentina (text in Spanish) / http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/40000-44999/40779/norma.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Australia===

Australian Universities which have Visual / Fine Art departments or courses within their institutions have moved from Studio Based teaching models, associated with Art Schools, to more integrated theoretical / practical emphasis.  University of Western Australia has moved from a master's degree with theoretical emphasis to a theoretical BA Art degree.

Studio based teaching initiatives integrating contextual and media elements have been implemented as part of a national Studio Teaching Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studioteaching.org/ Studio Teaching Project]&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) since 2007.

===Egypt===

The first modern art school in Egypt was opened in 1908 as the Cairo College of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|title=Creative Reckonings: The Politics of Art and Culture in Contemporary Egypt|page=315
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0804754772|isbn=0804754772
|first=Jessica |last=Winegar |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early art schools largely taught the Western aesthetic traditions.  As a result, after independence there was an effort to incorporate Egyptian and Middle Eastern traditions into art and art appreciation courses.{{sfn|Winegar|2006|p=59}} However, the process was slow; students at Cairo College of Fine Arts were not able to major in non-European art history until 1999.{{sfn|Winegar|2006|p=59}}

===Italy===
[[Art school]]s were established in Italy as early as the 13th century, starting with a painting school in Venice founded by a Greek painter named Theophanes around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Byzantine Art and Culture in Rome and Italy|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|year=1895|volume=10|first=A.L.|last=Frothingham|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kD0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
The Dutch Art Teachers Association (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs) was founded in 1880 and began to publish a monthly magazine in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gahetna.nl/collectie/archief/pdf/NL-HaNA_2.19.072.01.ead.pdf |publisher=Nationaal Archief|title=Inventaris van het archief van de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs, 1880-1994|accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late 20th century, the growing diversity of Dutch society has made Dutch art and art education increasingly [[multicultural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Amsterdam: Immigrants and Urban Change in the Twentieth Century|page=112

|first1=Liza |last1=Nell|first2=Jan|last2=Rath |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Formal art education emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century, motivated in part by a desire to match the quality of design work being done in France.{{sfn|Macdonald|2004|p=68}}  The model initially adopted was that of the German commercial schools.{{sfn|Macdonald|2004|p=68}} [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] was particularly influential in the creation of schools of Art in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History and Philosophy of Art Education

|first=Stuart |last=Macdonald|year=2004|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in the UK, the art curriculum is prescribed by the government's [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] except in [[public school (United Kingdom)|public]] or fee paying schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-art-and-design-programmes-of-study|title=National curriculum in England: art and design programmes of study|date=2013-09-11|accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Prince Charles]] has created [[The Prince's Drawing School]] in [[Hoxton]] to preserve the teaching of academic drawing.

===United States===

[[File:Archives of American Art - A life class for adults at the Brooklyn Museum, under the auspice of the New York City WPA Art Project - 11039.jpg|thumb|right|Adult art education class at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1935.]]
The study of art appreciation in America began with the Artists of Today Movement in the late 19th century and began to fade at the end of the 1920s. Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter (1986,Sept.) The Ecology of Picture Study, ''Art Education''[48–54].&lt;/ref&gt; The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

American [[Philosophy of education|educational philosopher]] and [[school reform]]er [[John Dewey]] was influential in broadening access to art education in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Since [[World War II]], artist training has moved to elementary schools, and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not usually need a college degree. Since that time the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and then the [[Master of Fine Arts]] became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, facilitated by the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], [[Black Mountain College]], or the [[Hans Hofmann]] School of Art in [[Greenwich Village]]; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The [[School of Visual Arts]], [[Pratt Institute]], and [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and other art schools across the country like the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale]] had become one of the first art academies.&lt;ref&gt;"How to Succeed in Art" by Deborah Solomon, New York Times Magazine. June 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This trend spread from the United States around the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Enrollment in art classes at the high school level peaked in the late 1960s—early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  With [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB){{when|date=April 2012}} (which retains the arts as part of the "daily life", but does not require reporting or assessment data on this area) there has been additional decline of arts education in American public schools.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The [[United States Department of Education]] now awards Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula. After 2010, an estimate of 25% of the nation's public high schools will end all art programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Various "ed-tech" companies like [[Kadenze]] and [[edX]] have attempted to mitigate this loss through online arts education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/art-schools-go-mooc-new-online-platform-works-with-art-programs-at-18-colleges/56947 Art Schools Go MOOC, With A New Online Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

National organizations promoting arts education include Americans for the Arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/artseducation Americans for the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; including ''Art. Ask For More.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/Public_awareness ''Art. Ask For More.'']&lt;/ref&gt; its national arts education public awareness campaign; Association for the Advancement of Arts Education; Arts Education Partnership.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org Arts Education Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional organizations for art educators include the [[National Art Education Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naea-reston.org the National Art Education Association]&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes the practitioner-friendly journal ''Art Education'' and the research journal ''Studies in Art Education''; USSEA (the [[United States Society for Education through Art]]) and InSEA (the International Society for Education through Art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insea.org/ |title=International Society for Education through Art |work=InSEA.org |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Education through the visual arts is an important and effective influence in allowing students, from an early age, to comprehend and implement the foundational democratic process emphasized within the United States societal structure.&lt;ref name="2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude"&gt;Gude, Olivia. [http://www.arteducators.org/research/2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude.pdf "Art Education for Democratic Life"]. Lowenfeld Lecture 2009. National Art Education Association. Minnesota, Minneapolis. 20 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivia Gude]], the 2009 recipient of the National Art Education Association’s Lowenfeld Lecture Scholarship, spoke about the numerous ways in which art education is instrumental in forming an informed self- and world-aware citizen. She asserts that:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Through art education, students develop enhanced skills for understanding the meaning making of others. Through quality art education, youth develop the capacity to learn several jobs much easier than others. Most significantly, engagement with the arts teaches youth to perceive complexity as pleasure and possibility, not as irritating uncertainty. Heightened self-awareness is extended to heightened awareness of others . . .&lt;ref name="2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Special education==

Art education was combined with special education even before there were reforms to create special accommodations for children with special needs in typical classrooms.  When it comes to art, [[art therapist]]s are often used to connect with students with special needs. However, some art therapists pull students out of the classroom, causing them to fall behind in their other schoolwork such as math, English, and science. Because of this, art therapy is reserved for students who do not have much chance for long-term improvements, but rather short-term developmental skills, or for those who seek to increase their all-round capabilities.&lt;ref name="vanmeter"&gt;Van Meter, M. L. (2010.). "[http://www.arttherapy.org/upload/toolkitspecialeducation.pdf Art therapy and special education]" (PDF). Retrieved  November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Special educator Jean Lokerson and art educator [[Amelia Jones]] wrote that “the art room is a place where learning disabilities can turn into learning assets.” Special needs students often come out of their shells and get enthusiastic about creating. Art is also a way that special educators teach their students fundamentals that they may not even realize.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, B. (2011). "[http://www.arteducators.org/research/resource-library/2011_NAEA_Lowenfeld_Lecture.pdf Art education and special education: A promising partnership]" (PDF). Paper presented at 2011 National Art Education Association national convention, Seattle, WA. Retrieved November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ongoing studies that continue to prove that art and special education go hand in hand. Testing continues to prove that art in any classroom, but especially special education classrooms causes students to be motivated, enthusiastic, and in some cases, even promote learning in other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;Iwai, K. (2002). "The contribution of arts education to children's lives". ''Prospects'', 32(4), 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current trends in theory and scholarship ==

Current trends in scholarship employ postmodern and visual culture approaches to art education,&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, K. (2003). Teaching visual culture.

A '''waverider''' is a [[hypersonic]] [[aircraft]] design that improves its supersonic [[lift-to-drag ratio]] by using the [[shock wave]]s being generated by its own flight as a lifting surface, a phenomenon known as [[compression lift]]. To date the only manned aircraft to use the technique was the [[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;3 [[supersonic]] [[XB-70 Valkyrie]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The waverider remains a well-studied design for high-speed aircraft in the Mach 5 and higher hypersonic regime, although no such design has yet entered production. The [[Boeing X-51]]A [[scramjet]] demonstration aircraft was tested from 2010 to 2013.  In its final test flight, it reached a speed of to {{convert|5.1|Mach|sigfig=2|60,000}}.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Graham.

==History==

===Early work===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The waverider design concept was first developed by [[Terence Nonweiler]] of the [[Queen's University of Belfast]], and first described in print in 1951 as a re-entry vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nonweiler Waverider|url=http://www.astronautix.com/n/nonweilerwaverider.html|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consisted of a [[delta-wing]] platform with a low [[wing loading]] to provide considerable surface area to dump the heat of re-entry. At the time, Nonweiler was forced to use a greatly simplified 2D model of airflow around the aircraft, which he realized would not be accurate due to [[wikt:spanwise|spanwise]] flow across the wing. However, he also noticed that the spanwise flow would be stopped by the shockwave being generated by the aircraft, and that if the wing was positioned to deliberately approach the shock, the spanwise flow would be trapped under wing, increasing pressure, and thus increasing lift.

In the 1950s, the British started a space program based around the [[Blue Streak missile]], which was, at some point, to include a manned vehicle. [[Armstrong-Whitworth]] were contracted to develop the re-entry vehicle, and unlike the U.S. space program they decided to stick with a winged vehicle instead of a ballistic [[space capsule|capsule]]. Between 1957 and 1959, they contracted Nonweiler to develop his concepts further. This work produced a [[pyramid]]-shaped design with a flat underside and short wings. Heat was conducted through the wings to the upper cool surfaces, where it was dumped into the turbulent air on the top of the wing. In 1960, work on the Blue Streak was canceled as the missile was seen as being obsolete before it could have entered service. Work then moved to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), where it continued as a research program into high-speed (Mach 4 to 7) civilian [[airliner]]s.&lt;ref name=iwm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/record.php?id=1060021486&amp;media_id=78 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224154513/http://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/record.php?id=1060021486&amp;media_id=78 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-24 |title=Supersonic Hypersonic Flight |author1=Dr J Seddon |author2=Dr J E Gordon |author3=Dr R R Jamison |work=UK Government (via Imperial War Museum) |year=1962 |accessdate=2012-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work was discovered by engineers at [[North American Aviation]] during the early design studies of what would lead to the [[XB-70]] bomber. They re-designed the original "classic" delta wing to incorporate drooping wing tips in order to trap the shock waves mechanically, rather than using a shock cone generated from the front of the aircraft. This mechanism also had two other beneficial effects; it reduced the amount of horizontal lifting surface at the rear of the aircraft, which helped offset a nose-down trim that occurs at high speeds, and it added more vertical surface which helped improve the lateral stability, which decreased at high speed.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Caret wing===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Nonweiler's original design used the shock wave generated by the aircraft as a way to control spanwise flow, and thereby increase the amount of air trapped under the wing in the same way as a [[wing fence]]. While working on these concepts, he noticed that it was possible to shape the wing in such a way that the shock wave generated off its leading edge would form a horizontal sheet under the craft. In this case, the airflow would not only be trapped horizontally, spanwise, but vertically as well. The only area the air above the shock wave could escape would be out the back of the sheet where the fuselage ended. Since the air was trapped between this sheet and the fuselage, a large volume of air would be trapped, much more than the more basic approach he first developed. Furthermore, since the shock surface was held at a distance from the craft, shock heating was limited to the leading edges of the wings, lowering the thermal loads on the fuselage.

In 1962 Nonweiler moved to [[Glasgow University]] to become Professor of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. That year his "Delta Wings of Shapes Amenable to Exact Shock-Wave Theory" was published by the ''Journal of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]'', and earned him that society's [[Gold Medal]].  A craft generated using this model looks like a delta wing that has been broken down the center and the two sides folded downward. From the rear it looks like an upside-down V, or alternately, the "[[caret]]", ^, and such designs are known as "caret wings". Two to three years later the concept briefly came into the public eye, due to the airliner work at the RAE that led to the prospect of reaching [[Australia]] in 90 minutes. Newspaper articles led to an appearance on [[Scottish Television]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Hawker Siddeley]] examined the caret wing waverider in the later 1960s as a part of a three-stage lunar rocket design. The first stage was built on an expanded Blue Steel, the second a waverider, and the third a nuclear-powered manned stage. This work was generalized in 1971 to produce a two-staged reusable spacecraft. The {{convert|121|ft|adj=on}} long first stage was designed as a classical waverider, with [[air-breathing engine|air-breathing propulsion]] for return to the launch site. The upper stage was designed as a lifting body, and would have carried an 8000-pound (3.6&amp;nbsp;t) payload to [[low Earth orbit]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Cone flow waveriders===
Nonweiler's work was based on studies of planar 2D shocks due to the difficulty understanding and predicting real-world shock patterns around 3D bodies. As the study of hypersonic flows improved, researchers were able to study waverider designs that used different shockwave shapes, the simplest being the conical shock generated by a cone. In these cases, a waverider is designed to keep the rounded shockwave attached to its wings, not a flat sheet, which increases the volume of air trapped under the surface, and thereby increases lift.&lt;ref name= "Jones_Lifting_Configs"&gt;Jones, J.G., K.C. Moore, J. Pike and P.L. Roe. [http://www.jackpike.co.uk/JonesEtAl.html "A Method of Designing Lifting Configurations For High Supersonic Speeds, Using Axisymmetric Flow Fields"]. Ingenieur-Archiv, 37, Band, 1, Heft, pp. 56-72, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the caret wing, the cone flow designs smoothly curve their wings, from near horizontal in the center, to highly drooped where they meet the shock. Like the caret wing, they have to be designed to operate at a specific speed to properly attach the shock wave to the wing's leading edge, but unlike them the entire body shape can be varied dramatically at the different design speeds, and sometimes have wingtips that curve upward to attach to the shockwave.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Further development of the conical sections, adding canopies and fuselage areas, led to the "osculating cones waverider", which develops several conical shock waves at different points on the body, blending them to produce a single shaped shock. The expansion to a wider range of compression surface flows allowed the  design of waveriders with control of volume,&lt;ref name="Jones_Lifting_Configs"/&gt; upper surface shape, engine integration and centre of pressure position. Performance improvements and off-design analysis continued until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, J. [http://www.jackpike.co.uk/ConeWing340.html "Experimental Results from Three Cone-Flow Waveriders"]. Agard Conference Proceedings 30, Hypersonic Boundary Layers and Flow Fields, [[Royal Aeronautical Society]], London, Ref. 12, p. 20, 1–3 May 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pike, J. [http://www.jackpike.co.uk/OffCaret.html "The Pressure on Flat and Anhedral Delta Wings with Attached Shock Waves"]. The Aeronautical Quarterly, Vol XXIII, Part 4, Nov. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period at least one waverider was tested at the [[Woomera Test Facility|Woomera Rocket Range]], mounted on the nose of an air-launched [[Blue Steel missile]], and a number of airframes were tested in the wind tunnel at NASA's [[Ames Research Center]]. However, during the 1970s most work in hypersonics disappeared, and the waverider along with it.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Viscous optimized waveriders===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
One of the many differences between supersonic and hypersonic flight concerns the interaction of the [[boundary layer]] and the shock waves generated from the nose of the aircraft. Normally the boundary layer is quite thin compared to the streamline of airflow over the wing, and can be considered separately from other aerodynamic effects. However, as the speed increases and the shock wave increasingly approaches the sides of the craft, there comes a point where the two start to interact and the flowfield becomes very complex. Long before that point, the boundary layer starts to interact with the air trapped between the shock wave and the fuselage, the air that is being used for lift on a waverider.

Calculating the effects of these interactions was beyond the abilities of aerodynamics until the introduction of useful [[computational fluid dynamics]] starting in the 1980s. In 1981, Maurice Rasmussen at the [[University of Oklahoma]] started a waverider renaissance by publishing a paper on a new 3D underside shape using these techniques. These shapes have superior lifting performance and less drag. Since then, whole families of [[Projective cone|cone]]-derived waveriders have been designed using more and more complex conic shocks, based on more complex software. This work eventually led to a conference in 1989, the ''First International Hypersonic Waverider Conference'', held at the University of Maryland.

These newest shapes, the "viscous optimized waveriders", look similar to conical designs as long as the angle of the shock wave on the nose is beyond some critical angle, about 14 degrees for a Mach 6 design for instance. The angle of the shock can be controlled by widening out the nose into a curved plate of specific radius, and reducing the radius produces a smaller shock cone angle. Vehicle design starts by selecting a given angle and then developing the body shape that traps that angle, then repeating this process for different angles. For any given speed, a single shape will generate the best results.

==Design==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
During [[re-entry]], hypersonic vehicles generate lift only from the underside of the [[fuselage]]. The underside, which is inclined to the flow at a high [[angle of attack]], creates lift in reaction to the vehicle wedging the airflow downwards. The amount of lift is not particularly high, compared to a traditional [[wing]], but more than enough to maneuver given the amount of distance the vehicle covers.

Most re-entry vehicles have been based on the [[Riabouchinsky solid|blunt-nose]] reentry design pioneered by [[Theodore von Kármán]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He demonstrated that a [[shock wave]] is forced to "detach" from a curved surface, forced out into a larger configuration that requires considerable energy to form. Energy expended in forming this shock wave is no longer available as heat, so this shaping can dramatically reduce the heat load on the spacecraft. Such a design has been the basis for almost every re-entry vehicle since,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} found on the blunt noses of the early [[ICBM]] warheads, the bottoms of the various [[NASA]] capsules, and the large nose of the [[Space Shuttle]].

The problem with the blunt-nose system is that the resulting design creates very little lift, meaning the vehicle has problems maneuvering during re-entry. If the spacecraft is meant to be able to return to its point of launch "on command", then some sort of maneuvering will be required to counteract the fact that the Earth is turning under the [[spacecraft]] as it flies. After a single [[low Earth orbit]], the launching point will be over {{convert|1000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} to the east of the spacecraft by the time it flies over again after one full orbit{{clarify|reason=are we talking about a polar orbit? Otherwise this doesn't make sense|date=October 2018}}. A considerable amount of research was dedicated to combining the blunt-nose system with wings, leading to the development of the [[lifting body]] designs in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

It was while working on one such design that Nonweiler developed the waverider. He noticed that the detachment of the shock wave over the blunt [[leading edge]]s of the wings of the Armstrong-Whitworth design would allow the air on the bottom of the craft to flow spanwise and escape to the upper part of the wing through the gap between the leading edge and the detached shock wave. This loss of airflow reduced (by up to a quarter) the lift being generated by the waverider, which led to studies on how to avoid this problem and keep the flow trapped under the wing.

Nonweiler's resulting design is a [[delta-wing]] with some amount of negative [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] — the wings are bent down from the [[fuselage]] towards the tips. When viewed from the front, the wing resembles a [[caret]] symbol ([[File:Arial caret.svg|25px]]) in [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]], and these designs are often referred to as carets. The more modern 3D version typically looks like a rounded letter 'M'. Theoretically, a star-shaped{{clarify|reason=what kind of star? 5 sided? 12 sided? What?|date=October 2018}} waverider with a frontal cross-section of a "+" or "×" could reduce drag by another 20%. The disadvantage of this design is that it has more area in contact with the shock wave and therefore has more pronounced [[heat|heat dissipation]] problems.

Waveriders generally have sharp noses and sharp leading edges on their wings. The underside shock-surface remains attached to this. Air flowing in through the shock surface is trapped between the shock and the fuselage, and can only escape at the rear of the fuselage. With sharp edges, all the lift is retained.

Even though sharp edges get much hotter than rounded ones at the same air density, the improved lift means that waveriders can glide on re-entry at much higher altitudes where the air density is lower. A list ranking various space vehicles in order of heating applied to the [[airframe]] would have [[space capsule|capsules]] at the top (re-entering quickly with very high heating loads), waveriders at the bottom (extremely long gliding profiles at high altitude), and the [[Space Shuttle]] somewhere in the middle.

Simple waveriders have substantial design problems. First, the obvious designs only work at a particular [[Mach number]], and the amount of lift captured will change dramatically as the vehicle changes speed. Another problem is that the waverider depends on [[radiative cooling]], possible as long as the vehicle spends most of its time at very high altitudes. However these altitudes also demand a very large wing to generate the needed lift in the thin air, and that same wing can become rather unwieldy at lower altitudes and speeds.

Because of these problems, waveriders have not found favor with practical aerodynamic designers, despite the fact that they might make long-distance hypersonic vehicles efficient enough to carry [[air freight]].

Some researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} controversially{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} claim that there are designs that overcome these problems. One candidate for a multi-speed waverider is a "[[caret wing]]", operated at different angles of attack. A caret wing is a [[delta wing]] with longitudinal conical or triangular [[leading edge slot|slots]] or [[strake (aviation)|strakes]]. It strongly resembles a [[paper airplane]] or [[rogallo wing]].  The correct angle of attack would become increasingly precise at higher mach numbers, but this is a control problem that is theoretically solvable. The wing is said to perform even better if it can be constructed of tight mesh, because that reduces its drag, while maintaining lift. Such wings are said to have the unusual attribute of operating at a wide range of mach numbers in different [[fluid]]s with a wide range of [[Reynolds number]]s.

The temperature problem can be solved with some combination of a [[transpiring]] surface, exotic materials, and possibly [[heatpipe|heat-pipes]]. In a transpiring surface, small amounts of a [[coolant]] such as water are pumped through small holes in the aircraft's skin (see [[transpiration]] and [[perspiration]]). This design works for Mach&amp;nbsp;25 spacecraft [[Atmospheric_entry#Ablative|re-entry shield]]s, and therefore should work for any aircraft that can carry the weight of the coolant. Exotic materials such as [[Reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon composite]] do not conduct heat but endure it, but they tend to be [[brittle]]. [[Heatpipe]]s are not widely used at present. Like a conventional [[heat exchanger]], they conduct heat better than most solid materials, but like a [[thermosiphon]] are passively pumped. The Boeing X-51A deals with external heating through the use of a tungsten nosecone and space shuttle-style heat shield tiles on its belly. Internal (engine) heating is absorbed by using the JP-7 fuel as a coolant prior to combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/8428-hypersonic-51-scramjet-launch-test-flight.html |title=Hypersonic X-51 Scramjet to Launch Test Flight in May |publisher= Spaceflight Now |year = 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other high temperature materials, referred to as SHARP materials (typically [[zirconium diboride]] and [[hafnium diboride]]) have been used on steering vanes for ICBM reentry vehicles since the 1970s, and are proposed for use on hypersonic vehicles. They are said to permit Mach 11 flight at {{convert|100000|ft|abbr=on}} altitudes and Mach 7 flight at sea level. These materials are more structurally rugged than the [[Reinforced Carbon Composite]] (RCC) used on the space shuttle nose and leading edges, have higher radiative and temperature tolerance properties, and do not suffer from oxidation issues that RCC needs to be protected against with coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02364.x/abstract |title=Thermal Conductivity Characterization of Hafnium Diboride-Based Ultra-High-Temperature Ceramics - Gasch - |work=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |publisher= Wiley Online  |year = 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-14 |doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02364.x |volume=91 |pages=1423–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=dti&amp;id=news/DTIHSV.xml&amp;headline=Sandia%20Materials%20Enable%20Hypersonic%20Flight{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''white box system''' is a mechanical system installed in the [[engine room]] of a [[ship]] for controlling and monitoring the engine room [[bilge]] water discharge from the vessel.

The system consists of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the discharge from the vessel's [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]]. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The [[bilge water]] from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter. A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil content meter and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [[tamper resistance | cannot be tampered with]] and equally importantly provides the evidence that the vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as [[Port State Control]], [[United States Coast Guard]], [[Vetting]] or [[Classification society]] officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to [[MARPOL 73/78]] (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.

D.  | title = Processes in word recognition  | journal = Cognitive Psychology  | volume = 1  | issue = 1  | pages = 59–85  | year = 1970  | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/32833  | accessdate = 2008-06-30  | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(70)90005-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell first wrote, "I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no [[wikt:connexion|connexion]] as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters".&lt;ref name="Cattell 1886"/&gt;

G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a [[two-alternative forced choice]] (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word "card", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as "cqrd".&lt;ref name="Falikman"/&gt; Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word.

The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using [[Connectionism|connectionist networks]].

==Experimental task==
The WSE has traditionally been tested using a [[tachistoscope]], as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prinzmetal  | first = W.  | title = The word-superiority effect does not require a T-scope  | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics  | volume = 51  | pages = 473–484  | year = 1992  | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=5231389  | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | issue = 5 | doi=10.3758/bf03211643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if "WOSK" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether "K" or "H" had been in "WOSK". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. "WKRG") or single letters.

==Hypotheses==
The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have [[semantic]] value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind).

Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Johnston | first = J. C.  |author2=J. L. McClelland  | title = Visual factors in word perception  | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics  | volume = 14  | pages = 365–370  | year = 1973  | url = http://psychology.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/PublicationFiles/73-79_Add_To_ONLINE_Pubs/JohnstonMcClelland73VisualFactors.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | doi=10.3758/bf03212406}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the duration of the masks.

==Models==
The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the [[Interactive activation and competition networks|interactive activation model]] (IAM)&lt;ref name="McCelland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCelland | first1 = J. | last2 = Rumelhart | first2 = D. | year = 1981 | title = An interactive activation model of context effects in letter perception: part 1. An account of basic findings | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 375–407 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.88.5.375}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[reading for special needs#Approaches and Models of Reading|dual-route coding model]] (DRC)&lt;ref name="Ziegler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ziegler | first1 = J. | last2 = Rastle | first2 = K. | last3 = Perry | first3 = C. | last4 = Langdon | first4 = R. | last5 = Coltheart | first5 = M. | year = 2001 | title = DRC: A dual route cascaded model of visual word recognition and reading aloud | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 204–56 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204 | pmid=11212628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing.&lt;ref name="Falikman"/&gt;

The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from [[Lexical decision task|lexical decision]] and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision.&lt;ref name="Paap"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paap | first1 = K. R. | last2 = Newsome | first2 = S. L. | last3 = McDonald | first3 = J. E. | last4 = Schvaneveldt | first4 = R. W. | year = 1982 | title = An activation-verification model for letter and word recognition: the word superiority effect | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 573–594 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.89.5.573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase "A cow says..." a person would guess "moo" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters).&lt;ref name="Paap" /&gt;

===The WSE and an interactive-activation model===
[[Image:Word superiority effect.svg|right|300px|thumb|Rumelhart &amp; McClelland's interactive-activation model.]]
The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. &lt;!-- Can we reference this? --&gt; According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for "C", horizontal and vertical bars for "H", etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chase|first=Christopher H.|last2=Tallal|first2=Paula|title=A developmental, interactive activation model of the word superiority effect|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0965(90)90069-K|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=448–487|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(90)90069-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word "WORK" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader).

According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus.  However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE.

===Activation-verification model===
The AVM&lt;ref name=Paap/&gt; deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification.

==Adverse word superiority effect==
One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland report&lt;!-- Can we reference this? --&gt;was that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular ''position'', they would experience the adverse word superiority effect&lt;!-- This needs a basic definition.--&gt;. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word.
