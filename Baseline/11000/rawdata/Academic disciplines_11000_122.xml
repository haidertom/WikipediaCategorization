&lt;/score&gt;|width=210|caption=The most common accidentals. From left to right: [[flat (music)|flat]], [[natural (music)|natural]], and [[sharp (music)|sharp]].}}
In [[music]], an '''accidental''' is a [[Musical note|note]] of a [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (or [[pitch class]]) that is not a member of the [[Scale (music)|scale]] or [[Mode (music)|mode]] indicated by the [[Modulation (music)|most recently applied]] [[key signature]]. In [[musical notation]], the [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|sharp}}), [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{music|flat}}), and [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{music|natural}}) symbols, among others, mark such notes—and those symbols are also called accidentals.

In the measure (bar) where it appears, an accidental sign raises or lowers the immediately following note (and any repetition of it in the bar) from its normal pitch, overriding sharps or flats in the key signature. A note is usually raised or lowered by a [[semitone]], although [[microtonal music]] may use "fractional" accidental signs. There are also occasionally double sharps or flats, which raise or lower the indicated note by a [[Major second|whole tone]]. Accidentals apply within the [[Bar (music)|measure]] and [[octave]] in which they appear, unless canceled by another accidental sign, or [[Tie (music)|tied]] into the following measure. If a note has an accidental and the note is repeated in a different octave within the same measure, the accidental does ''not'' apply to the same note of the different octave.

The modern accidental signs derive from the two forms of the lower-case letter&amp;nbsp;''b'' used in [[Gregorian chant]] manuscripts to signify the two pitches of B, the only note that could be altered. The "round" ''b'' became the flat sign, while the "square" ''b'' diverged into the sharp and natural signs.

Sometimes the black keys on a [[musical keyboard]] are called accidentals (i.e., ''sharps'' or ''flats''), and the white keys are called ''naturals''.&lt;ref&gt;Palmieri, Robert, and Margaret W. Palmieri. "Ebonies", [https://books.google.com/books?id=g2ZJNN98LFAC ''Piano: An Encyclopedia''], p.118. New York: Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-93796-5}}.&lt;br&gt;"The ebonies are the black keys of a piano, called variously sharps or accidentals, …"&lt;br&gt;"The ivories are the white keys of the piano (also called naturals), ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard use of accidentals==

=== Typical system ===
In most cases, a [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] raises the pitch of a note one [[semitone]] while a [[flat (music)|flat]] lowers it one semitone. A [[natural sign|natural]] is used to cancel the effect of a flat or sharp. This system of accidentals operates in conjunction with the [[key signature]], whose effect continues throughout an entire piece, unless canceled by another key signature. An accidental can also be used to cancel a previous accidental or reinstate the flats or sharps of the key signature

Accidentals apply to subsequent notes on the same [[staff position]] for the remainder of the measure where they occur, unless explicitly changed by another accidental. Once a [[Bar (music)|barline]] is passed, the effect of the accidental ends, except when a note affected by an accidental is tied to the same note across a barline. Subsequent notes at the same staff position in the second or later bars are not affected by the accidental carried through with the tied note. 

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
    \relative c'' {
        \time 3/4
        g4 gis gis | g? ges ges~ | ges gis g
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Under this system, the notes in the example above are: 

* '''{{Abbr|m.|measure}} 1''': G{{music|natural}}, G{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} (the sharp carries over)
* '''m. 2''': G{{music|natural}} (with [[courtesy accidental]]), G{{music|flat}}, G{{music|flat}} (the flat carries over)
* '''m. 3''': G{{music|flat}} (which is tied from the previous note), G{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|natural}} (the natural sign cancels the sharp sign)

=== Note-for-note system ===
Though this convention is still in use particularly in [[Tonality|tonal music]], it may be cumbersome in music that features frequent accidentals, as is often the case in [[Atonality|atonal music]]. As a result, an alternative system of note-for-note accidentals has been adopted, with the aim of reducing the number of accidentals required to notate a [[bar (music)|bar]]. The system is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Kurt.  ''Music Notation in the Twentieth Century:  A Practical Guidebook'', {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

* An accidental carries through the bar affecting both the note it immediately precedes and any following notes on the same line or space in the measure.&lt;ref&gt;Manoff, T: "The Music Kit Workbook", fourth edition (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001): p. 47; Anthony Pryer, "Accidental", ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', edited by Alison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). {{ISBN|9780198662129}}; Gardner Read, ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'' (Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1969): 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Accidentals are not repeated on tied notes unless the tie goes from line to line or page to page.
* Accidentals are not repeated for repeated notes unless one or more different pitches (or rests) intervene.
* If a sharp or flat pitch is followed directly by its natural form, a natural is used.
* Courtesy accidentals or naturals (in parentheses) may be used to clarify ambiguities but are kept to a minimum

Because seven of the twelve notes of the chromatic equal-tempered scale are naturals (the "white notes", A; B; C; D; E; F; and G on a piano keyboard) this system can significantly reduce the number of naturals required in a notated passage.

Occasionally, an accidental may change the note by more than a semitone: for example, if a G{{Music|sharp}} is followed in the same measure by a G{{Music|flat}}, the flat sign on the latter note means it is two semitones lower than if no accidental were present. Thus, the effect of the accidental must be understood in relation to the "natural" meaning of the note's [[staff position]]. 

In some atonal scores (particularly by composers of the [[Second Viennese School]]), an accidental is notated on every note, including natural notes and repeated pitches. This system was adopted for "the specific intellectual reason that a note with an accidental was not simply an [[Inflection (music)|inflected]] version of a natural note but a pitch of equal status."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701032248|title=Behind Bars: The Definitive Guide to Music Notation|last=Gould|first=Elaine|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=0571514561|location=London|pages=86|oclc=701032248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Double accidentals ==

        aeses1 aisis
    }  }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=180|caption=The two double accidentals. From left to right: [[double flat]] and [[double sharp]].}}
Double accidentals raise or lower the pitch of a note by two semitones,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Benward &amp; Marilyn Nadine Saker, ''Music in Theory and Practice'', seventh edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2003): vol&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;br /&gt;"''Double Sharp'' ({{music|x}})—raises the pitch two half steps. Double flat ({{music|bb}})—lowers the pitch two half steps."&lt;/ref&gt; an innovation developed as early as 1615.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} This applies to the written note, ignoring key signature. An F with a double sharp applied raises it a [[whole step]] so it is [[enharmonic]]ally equivalent to a G. 

Usage varies on how to notate the situation in which a note with a double sharp (or flat) is followed in the same measure by a note with a single sharp (or flat). Some publications simply use the single accidental for the latter note, whereas others use a combination of a natural and a sharp (shown below), with the natural being understood to apply to only the second sharp.

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
    \relative c'' {
        \time 4/4
        gisis2 gis
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The double accidental with respect to a specific key signature raises or lowers the notes containing a sharp or flat by a semitone. For example, when in the key of C{{Music|sharp}} minor or E major, F, C, G, and D contain a sharp. Adding a double accidental (double sharp) to F in this case only raises F{{Music|sharp}} by one further semitone, creating G natural. Conversely, adding a double sharp to any other note not sharped or flatted in the key signature raises the note by two semitones with respect to the chromatic scale. For example, in the aforementioned key signature, any note that is not F, C, G, and D is raised by two semitones instead of one, so an A double sharp raises the note A natural to the enharmonic equivalent of B natural.

==Courtesy accidentals==
{{Image frame|content=&lt;score&gt; {

\override Score.TimeSignature
#'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {

        aes1 a?
    }  }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=180|caption=An A{{music|flat}} followed by an A{{music|natural}} in the next measure. The A{{music|natural}} is given a courtesy accidental to remind the player that the flat sign does not apply to it.}}
In modern scores, a barline cancels an accidental (except for a tied note)—but publishers often use a ''courtesy accidental'' (also called a ''cautionary accidental'' or ''reminder accidental'') to remind the musician of the correct pitch if the same note occurs in the following measure. This practice varies, though a few situations require a courtesy accidental, such as

* When the first note of a measure had an accidental in the previous measure
* After a tie carries an accidental across a barline, and the same note appears in the next measure
Other uses are inconsistent. Courtesy accidentals are sometimes enclosed in parentheses to emphasize their role as reminders.

Publishers of [[free jazz]] music and some [[atonal]] music sometimes eschew all courtesy accidentals.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Wolf (2008). ''Stuff! Good Guitar Players Should Know: An A-Z Guide to Getting Better'', p.59. {{ISBN|9781423430087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=220|caption=A common notation for quarter tones. From left to right, half-flat, flat-and-a-half, half-sharp, sharp-and-a-half.}}
Composers of [[microtonal music]] have developed a number of notations for indicating the various pitches outside of standard notation. One such system for notating [[quarter tone]]s, used by the Czech [[Alois Hába]] and other composers, is shown on the right.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when Turkish musicians switched from their traditional notation systems—which were not staff-based—to the European staff-based system, they refined the European accidental system so they could notate Turkish scales that use intervals smaller than a tempered semitone. There are several such systems, which vary as to how they divide the octave they presuppose or the graphical shape of the accidentals. The most widely used system (created by [[Rauf Yekta Bey]]) uses a system of four sharps (roughly +25 [[cent (music)|cent]]s, +75 cents, +125 cents and +175 cents) and four flats (roughly −25 cents, −75 cents, −125 cents and −175 cents), none of which correspond to the tempered sharp and flat. They presuppose a Pythagorean division of the octave taking the [[Pythagorean comma]] (about an eighth of the tempered tone, actually closer to 24 cents, defined as the difference between seven octaves and 12 just-intonation fifths) as the basic interval. The Turkish systems have also been adopted by some Arab musicians.

[[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] created a system of [[Musical Notation|notation]] for pieces in [[just intonation]] where the unmarked C, F, and G major chords are just major chords (4:5:6) and accidentals create just tuning in other keys. Between 2000 and 2003, Wolfgang von Schweinitz and [[Marc Sabat]] developed the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation, a modern adaptation and extension of the notation principles first used by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Arthur von Oettingen]], and [[Alexander John Ellis]] that some other musicians use for notating extended just intonation.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==History of notation of accidentals==
The three principal symbols indicating whether a note should be raised or lowered in pitch are derived from variations of the small letter&amp;nbsp;''b'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Niecks|Niecks, Frederick]]. ''The Flat, Sharp, and Natural. A Historical Sketch''. Proceedings of the Musical Association, 16th Sess., (1889&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1890), pp. 79-100.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/765359 (JSTOR)]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|sharp}}) and [[natural (music)|natural]] ({{music|natural}}) signs from the square "[[b quadratum]]", and the [[flat (music)|flat]] sign ({{music|flat}}) from the round "[[b rotundum]]" ''b''.

In the early [[Middle Ages]], a widespread musical tradition was based on the [[hexachord]] system defined by [[Guido of Arezzo]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The basic system, called ''musica recta'', had three overlapping hexachords. Change from one hexachord to another was possible, called a ''mutation''. A major problem with the system was that mutation from one hexachord to another could introduce intervals like the [[tritone]] that musicians of the time considered undesirable. To avoid the dissonance, a practice called [[musica ficta]] arose from the late 12th century onward. This introduced modifications of the hexachord, so that "false" or "feigned" notes could be sung, partly to avoid dissonance. At first only B could be flattened, moving from the ''hexachordum durum'' (the ''hard hexachord'') G–A–B–C–D–E where B is natural, to the ''hexachordum molle'' (the ''soft hexachord'') F–G–A–B{{music|flat}}–C–D where it is flat. The note B is not present in the third hexachord ''hexachordum naturale'' (the ''natural hexachord'') C–D–E–F–G–A.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The different kinds of B were eventually written differently, so as to distinguish them in music theory treatises and in notation. The flat sign {{music|flat}} derives from a round ''b'' that signified the soft hexachord, ''hexachordum molle'', particularly the presence of B{{music|flat}}. The name of the flat sign in French is ''bémol'' from medieval French ''bé mol'', which in modern French is ''bé mou'' ("soft b"). The natural sign {{music|natural}} and the sharp sign {{music|sharp}} derive from variations of a square ''b'' that signified the hard hexachord, ''hexachordum durum'', where the note in question is B{{music|natural}}. The name of the natural sign in French is ''bécarre'' from medieval French ''bé quarre'', which in modern French is ''bé carré'' ("square b"). In German music notation the letter ''B'' or ''b'' always designates B{{Music|flat}} while the letter ''H'' or ''h'' – a deformation of a square ''b'' – designates B{{Music|natural}}.

As polyphony became more complex, notes other than B required alteration to avoid undesirable harmonic or melodic intervals (especially the augmented fourth, or [[tritone]], that music theory writers referred to as ''diabolus in musica'', i.e., "the devil in music"). The first sharp in use was F{{music|sharp}}, then came the second flat E{{music|flat}},{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;!--Source needed: this is counterintuitive given that two-flat signatures are found for at least two centuries before one-sharp signatures.--&gt; then C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, etc.; by the 16th century B{{music|flat}}, E{{music|flat}}, A{{music|flat}}, D{{music|flat}}, G{{music|flat}} and F{{music|sharp}}, C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}} were all in use to a greater or lesser extent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;!--Dubious chronology.--&gt;

However, those accidentals were often not notated in vocal part-books (but the correct pitches were always notated in [[tablature]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The notational practice of not marking implied accidentals—leaving them to the performer to supply instead—was called ''[[musica ficta]]'' ("feigned music").

Strictly speaking the medieval signs {{music|natural}} and {{music|flat}} indicated that the melody is progressing inside a (fictive) ''hexachord'' of which the signed note is the ''mi'' or the ''fa'' respectively. That means they refer to a group of notes ''around'' the marked note, rather than indicating that the note itself is necessarily an accidental. For example, when a  semitone relationship is indicated between F and G, either by placing a mi-sign ({{music|natural}}) on F or a fa-sign ({{Music|flat}}) on G, only the context can determine whether this means, in modern terms, F{{Music|sharp}}-G or F-G{{Music|flat}}, or even F{{Music|flat}}–G{{Music|doubleflat}}. The use of either the mi-sign on F or the fa-sign on G means only that "some kind of F goes to some kind of G, proceeding by a semitone".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Bent, "Diatonic ''Ficta''", ''Early Music History'' 4 (1984): pp.&amp;nbsp;1–48. Citation on pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention of an accidental remaining in force through a measure developed only gradually over the 18th century. Before then, accidentals only applied to immediately repeated notes or short groups when the composer felt it was obvious that the accidental should continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year = 1972|title = Accidentals|encyclopedia = Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher = Harvard University Press|location = |edition = 2nd|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The older practice continued in use well into the 18th century by many composers, notably [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pryer, "Accidental", ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', edited by Alison Latham (Oxford University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The newer convention did not achieve general currency until early in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Don Michael Randel, "Accidental", ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', fourth edition (Harvard University Press, 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-674-01163-2}}; Ian D.

'''Ashesi University''' is a private college located in [[Ghana]], [[West Africa]].

The mission of Ashesi University is to educate ethical, entrepreneurial leaders in Africa.

In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the World Innovation Summit in Education Prize,{{cn|date=November 2018}} one of the world’s biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2018, Ashesi was also awarded a Charter by the President of Ghana, granting it full independence as a nationally recognised degree-granting institution. It was the youngest university to have been granted a Presidential Charter in Ghana’s history, a rare accomplishment.

Ashesi offers a four-year bachelors programme grounded in a multidisciplinary core curriculum, featuring majors in [[Business Administration]], [[Management Information Systems]], [[Computer science|Computer Science]], Electrical and [[Electronic engineering|Electronic Engineering]], [[Computer engineering|Computer Engineering]] and [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical Engineering.]] With an academic program designed in collaboration with some of the world's best universities and organisations, Ashesi continues to shape an educational experience like no other in Africa.

==History==
Ashesi was founded by [[Patrick Awuah]], a Ghanaian who spent over 15 years living and working in the United States. [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] left Ghana in 1985 to attend [[Swarthmore College]] on a full scholarship, after which he worked for [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] as an engineer and a program manager for eight years. Experiencing first hand the dramatic impact that education can have on one's life, [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] embarked on a mission in 1997 to provide greater educational opportunities in [[Ghana]]. He enrolled in business school at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, both to evaluate the feasibility of his goal and to gain managerial skills with which to found and manage a university.

==The Meaning of Ashesi==
 [[File:Ashesi_Todd_&amp;_Ruth_Warren_Library.jpg |frame|The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi|alt=The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi]]
"If there is anything you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now."
 
These words by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe are the inspiration behind the university's name, Ashesi, which means "beginning" in Fante, a native Ghanaian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi History: Meaning of Ashesi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117100304/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi |date=17 November 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasibility study==
During the summer of 1998, a team of four MBA students from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business travelled to Ghana to conduct extensive market research and evaluate the feasibility of establishing a new university. With the goal of gathering data to provide a foundation for business decisions, the team administered over 3,300 surveys to students and parents; conducted interviews and focus groups with parents, teachers and business leaders; and gathered secondary information from local and international sources. The result was a comprehensive feasibility study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html Early years feasibility study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106021317/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html |date=6 January 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt; analysing Ghanaian tertiary education.

==Ashesi campus==
Set on 100 acres in Berekuso, overlooking Ghana's capital city of Accra, Ashesi’s campus unites traditional Ghanaian design, modern technology and environmental best practices. The  campus has interconnected courtyards, that emphasize a sense of community. The architecture borrows from the Ghanaian vernacular, with echoes of traditional compound houses, as well as elements of traditional Northern dwellings. The natural contours of the site are used in concert with buildings to create exterior gathering spaces throughout campus, as well as ramps that provide wheel chair access to buildings.  Buildings are designed to maximize natural views, light and ventilation.

Ground water is supplemented with harvested rainwater, filtered and treated to provide potable water all year round. A community-scale sewage and organic treatment plant provides environmental and economic benefits by converting waste to biogas for some of the campus’ cooking needs and recycling treated water for landscaping.

==Global Recognition==
On Wednesday 3 May 2018, [[President of the Republic of Ghana]], H.E [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] awarded Ashesi University a Presidential Charter meaning the University will now award degrees to its graduated in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com|title=Akufo-Addo grants Ashesi University Presidential Charter|last=Ibrahim|first=Abubakar|date=3 May 2018|work=Myjoyonline|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashesi, until this year was affiliated to the University of Cape Coast(UCC), Ghana meaning its graduates were awarded a UCC degree.

In 2012, the university was ranked by [[PwC]] as the seventh most respected organisation in Ghana, becoming the first university to make the list. Ashesi's President, Dr. Patrick Awuah, was also ranked the 4th Most Respected CEO in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicle.com.gh/ut-bank-rlg-bosses-outshine-rivals-at-ghanas-most-respected-ceo-awards/ UT Bank, Rlg bosses outshine rivals –at Ghana’s Most Respected CEO awards]. ''http://thechronicle.com.gh''. October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Africa.com again named Ashesi among its list of top 10 African Universities (excluding South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.com/blog/the-top-10-universities-in-africa-part-i/ The Top 10 Universities in Africa (ex South Africa) – 2015 Edition]. ''http://africa.com''. February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been ranked as one of Ghana's 50 Best Places to work (2015), according to a survey by Ghanaian consulting firm Goodman AMC; it was again, the only university on the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com/2015/03/top-50-best-places-to-work-in-ghana.html Top 50 Best Places to Work in Ghana]. ''http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[CNN]] shared the story of Ashesi and its founder on its African Voices programme. In the interview, Ashesi's President said: "If you come back in 30 years, universities will be competing for the best and brightest students. I hope that universities will also be competing on things such as whose students are the most ethical. If that happens, it will change the continent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/world/africa/patrick-awuah-ashesi-ghana/ Millionaire who quit Microsoft to educate Africa's future leaders]. ''http://cnn.com''. May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ashesi's President was ranked by [[Fortune (magazine)]] as one of the World's 50 Greatest Leaders, together with the likes of [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates]], [[Pope Francis]] and founder of [[Amazon.com]], [[Jeff Bezos]]. The list according to Forbes, was made up of men and women who "in an era that feels starved for leadership, will inspire you—some famous, others little known, all of them energizing their followers and making the world better." &lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2014/03/20/worlds-50-greatest-leaders/ The World's 50 Greatest Leaders: 2015]. ''http://fortune.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the [https://www.wise-qatar.org/2017-wise-prize-education-patrick-awuah World Innovation Summit in Education Prize], one of the world’s biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2018, Ashesi was also awarded a Charter by the President of Ghana, granting it full independence as a nationally recognised degree-granting institution. It was the youngest university to have been granted a Presidential Charter in Ghana’s history, a rare accomplishment.

== Australia ==
Architectural education in Australia varies depending on the university offering the course. All Australian architecture schools and programs have recently moved to some variation on the 3 + 2 Bologna model, with a three-year undergraduate degree, followed by a two-year course-work based Master of Architecture professional degree. Some universities also require 6–12 months of practice work experience between the two degrees. Registration as an architect is via state-based boards and requires a minimum of two years practice experience under the supervision of a registered architect. In addition there are double degrees offered by many universities, such as those combining architecture with construction or landscape architecture. Some universities also offer masters programs in architecture via coursework or research. Many architecture faculties offer related programs in landscape architecture, urban planning, urban design, property and construction. Entry to Australian architecture programs is highly competitive and the proportion of students at some architecture schools from outside Australia is very high, up to 40%.

==France==

In France, architectural education is offered in various independent schools of architecture, both private and public. The first step of architectural education is the ''Diploma of Studies in Architecture'', a three-year degree equivalent to a Bachelor of Architecture. This degree does not allow registration as an architect, awardees must pursue a [[Master of Architecture]] in order to obtain vocational qualification.

==India==
In India, Bachelor of Architecture lasts for five years. Specialised institutes founded by the government of India, for excellence in the field of architecture and planning are SPAs (Schools of Planning and Architecture). They are Institutes of National Importance through an act in the Parliament, on the lines of IITs, NITs and IIMs. Currently there are three such SPAs, with the MHRD ([[Ministry of Human Resource Development]]) mulling over setting up more such institutes.

==Turkey==
Architectural education is offered in various universities as a four-year program. The language of the program depends on the university.

== United Arab Emirates ==
The [[American University of Sharjah]] is the first university outside of North America to offer a B.Arch. that is officially accredited by the US-based [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aus.edu/media/news/show_article.php?Article=950 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827010056/http://www.aus.edu/media/news/show_article.php?Article=950 |archivedate=2010-08-27 }} AUS architecture program becomes first outside North America to receive prestigious NAAB accreditation&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Architectural education in the United Kingdom (19c-20c)}}
Architectural education differs slightly in the [[United Kingdom]]. A five-year course used to exist in a similar fashion to the United States, but the 1960s saw the introduction of the [[sandwich course]] and a split of the B.Arch. into a 3-year BA (Hons.) degree (or in some cases BSc) followed by a year working in practice, after which a 2-year MA, PG-DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. is completed. A further year of work completes the student's education upon the passing of Part III final examinations (See below). Registration as an architect is then permissible by the [[Architects Registration Board]]. Many UK universities offer postgraduate programs by coursework and research in architecture and related fields such as landscape architecture, planning, and urban design.

===The RIBA three-part examinations===
In effect, for most students to become an architect in the United Kingdom they must pass or be exempted from parts I,II and III of the RIBA's examinations. Completion of the three-year BA or BSc gives an exemption from Part I. Completion of the two-year DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. gives exemption from Part II and the final two years of supervised practical training, with supplemental examinations and assignments, makes up the requirements for Part III.

An alternative route to qualification exists by sitting the exams directly - currently this administered by [[Oxford Brookes University]] on behalf of the RIBA.

=== Studying architecture in the UK ===

==United States==
The Bachelor of Architecture is accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) as a [[professional degree]], allowing the recipient to qualify for the [[Architect Registration Examination]] (ARE). NAAB-accredited B.Arch. programs must include at least 150 semester credit hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent, of which at least 45 semester hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent are in general studies.

There are also universities that offer a four-year degree such as a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies or a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (B.S.Arch) or a Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies (B.A.Arch). These are non-accredited, pre-professional degrees, and so these students must enroll in a [[Master of Architecture]] (M.Arch) program to be professionally licensed. However, enrolling in a pre-professional program often gets a student into a shorter M.Arch program.  Any architecturally-related curriculum may eventually make licensure possible, depending upon the laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which you wish to be licensed.

The course of study of the Bachelor of Architecture includes studio courses on [[design]] and [[aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], as well as practical courses on [[structures]], [[HVAC|building mechanical systems]], [[electrical engineering|electrical systems]], [[plumbing]] and [[construction]]. Student work is often in the form of drawings and renderings, either through [[computer-aided design]] or [[technical drawing|drafting]] by hand. Students also build physical models and create presentation boards for drawings and graphics.

In nearly all architecture schools in the United States, student life and work revolves around a studio class. Other classes in the architecture curriculum are designed to support the concepts emphasized in studio. One particularly rigorous aspect of studio classes is the "critique" or "review." Students "pin-up" their models and presentation drawings for instructors (and students) who offer constructive criticism.

Colleges and universities in the United States where either an NAAB accredited Bachelor of Architecture or Master of Architecture degree can be obtained are listed below. Many schools offer an M.Arch as the first professional degree, preceded by a nonprofessional B.A./B.S. in Architecture undergraduate degree.

In raster scan equipment, an image is built up by scanning an electron beam from left to right across a [[cathode ray tube|screen]] to produce a visible trace of one scan line, reducing the brightness of the beam to zero (''horizontal blanking''), moving it back as fast as possible to the left of the screen at a slightly lower position (the next scan line), restoring the brightness, and continuing until all the lines have been displayed and the beam is at the bottom right of the screen. Its intensity is then reduced to zero again (vertical blanking), and it is rapidly moved to the top left to start again, creating the next Film frame.

In television, in particular, the vertical blanking interval is long to accommodate the slow equipment available at the time the standard was set. Fast modern electronics allows digital information to be encoded into the signal during the vertical blanking interval; it is not displayed on screen as the beam is blanked, but can be processed by appropriate circuitry.

'''''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation''''', a [[style guide]], prescribes the most widely used [[legal citation]] system in the United States. ''The Bluebook'' is compiled by the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' Association, the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. Currently, it is in its 20th edition. It is so named because its cover is blue.

''The Bluebook'' is taught and used at a majority of [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]], and is also used in a majority of [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal courts]]. Alternative legal citation style guides exist, including the ''[[Maroonbook]]'' and the ''[[ALWD Citation Manual]]''. There are also several "house" citation styles used by legal publishers in their works.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] uses its own unique citation style in its opinions, even though most of the justices and their [[law clerk]]s obtained their [[Legal education in the United States|legal education]] at law schools that use ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref name="Salmon1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Susie|title=Shedding the Uniform: Beyond 'A Uniform System of Citation' to a More Efficient Fit|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=2016|volume=99|page=792|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5289&amp;context=mulr|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=Marquette University|location=Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many [[state court (United States)|state courts]] have their own citation rules that take precedence over ''The Bluebook'' for documents filed with those courts. Some of the local rules are simple modifications to ''The Bluebook'' system, such as [[Maryland]]'s requirement that citations to Maryland cases include a reference to the official Maryland reporter. [[Delaware]]'s [[Supreme Court of Delaware|Supreme Court]] has promulgated rules of citation for unreported cases markedly different from ''The Bluebook'' standards, and custom in that state as to the citation format of the [[Delaware Code]] also differs from ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 Rule 14(g)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190900/http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 |date=2016-03-03 }}, Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware.&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, notably [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Michigan]], the local rules are different from ''The Bluebook'' in that they use their own style guides. Attorneys in those states who practice both in federal court and state court must be able to switch seamlessly between citation styles depending upon whether their work product is intended for a federal or state court. Since 2008, [[California]] rules of court have allowed citations in Bluebook form as well as the state's own style manual,&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Rule of Court 1.200&lt;/ref&gt; but many practitioners and courts continue to recommend following the ''California Style Manual'' in California courts.&lt;ref name="Salmon2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Susie|title=Shedding the Uniform: Beyond 'A Uniform System of Citation' to a More Efficient Fit|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=2016|volume=99|page=791|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5289&amp;context=mulr|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=Marquette University|location=Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

According to Harvard, the origin of ''The Bluebook'' was a pamphlet for proper citation forms for articles in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' written by its editor, [[Erwin Griswold]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hurt, ''The Bluebook at Eighteen: Reflecting and Ratifying Current Trends in Legal Scholarship'', 82 {{smallcaps|Ind. L.J.}} 49, 51-52 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a recent study by two [[Yale]] librarians,&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro &amp; Julie Graves Krishnaswami, ''The Secret History of the Bluebook'', [http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ShapiroKrishnaswami_ONLINEPDF.pdf 100 {{smallcaps|Minn. L. Rev.}} 1563] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard's claim is incorrect. They trace the origin of ''The Bluebook'' to a 1920 publication by [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] at Yale on how to write law journal materials for the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Karl N. Llewellyn, The Writing of a Case Note}} (1920). This booklet had a blue cover, which Shapiro and Krishnaswami point out is "appropriate for its University," whose official color is blue.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors point out that some of the material in the 1926 first edition of ''The Bluebook'' (as well as that in a 1922 Harvard precursor to it published as ''Instructions for Editorial Work'') duplicate material in the 1920 Llewellen booklet and its 1921 successor, a blue pamphlet that the ''Yale Law Journal'' published as ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bluebook'' 1 (1926) has approximately 30 sentences in common with ''Yale Law Journal'' ’s ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation'' (1921), as well as many of the sample citations, all of the proofreading signs, and virtually all of the items in the long list of abbreviations. They both begin with the same sentence: “This pamphlet does not pretend to include a complete list of abbreviations or all the necessary data as to form.” The subtitle of the ''Bluebook'' is “Abbreviations and Form of Citation.” The ''Jones v. Smith'' Connecticut citation that is the basic case citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic case example used in Bluebook 1. The Haines ''Yale Law Journal'' citation that is the basic periodical citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic periodical example used in ''Bluebook'' 1. Most of the section on treatises is identical between 1921 and 1926.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years before the first edition of ''The Bluebook'' appeared, Yale, Columbia, and several other law journals "worked out a tentative citation plan," but Harvard initially opposed it "because of skepticism as to the results to be attained and in part because of a desire not to deviate from our forms especially at the solicitation of other Reviews." Eventually, Harvard "reversed course" and joined the coalition by 1926. According to Judge [[Henry J. Friendly]], "Attorney General [Herbert] Brownell, whom I had known ever since law school—he was Editor-in-Chief of the ''Yale Law Journal'' the year I was at the ''Harvard Law Review'' and he and I and two others [from Columbia and Pennsylvania] were the authors of the first edition of the ''Bluebook''."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Dorsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9ctStY3580C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Henry Friendly, Greatest Judge of His Era}}] 71 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the 1926 ''A Uniform System of Citation'' was green. The color was "brown from the second (1928) edition through the fifth (1936) edition. It was only with the sixth (1939) edition that it became blue."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the cover of the book was changed from brown to a "more patriotic blue" allegedly to avoid comparison with a color associated with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Darby Dickerson, ''An Un-Uniform System of Citation: Surviving with the New Bluebook'', 26 {{smallcaps|Stetson L. Rev.}} 53, 58-60 (1996). According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami, however, "The abandonment of brown is often attributed to the association of that color with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, but that idea appears to trace to a joke by Alan Strasser," in [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hcrcl12&amp;id=515&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=Alan%20Strasser&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor=10 ''Technical Due Process: ?''], 12 {{smallcaps|Harv. C.R.-C.L. Rev.}} 507, 508 (1977). Strasser states, referring to the eleventh edition's change of cover color to white with a blue border promising a "new life," that "the 1939 ''Blue Book'' had electrified the nation by parading patriotic blue covers instead of the Germanic brown ones that had disgraced the 1936 edition." ''Id''. (footnote omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; The eleventh edition, published in 1967, was actually white with a blue border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160302144344/http://blawg.law.sc.edu/2015/07/13/all-the-fun-facts-about-the-bluebook/ ''All the Fun Facts about the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; The cover color returned to blue in the twelfth edition of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Strasser, at 508. Strasser states that the first printing was a "timid" blue-gray but later printings were a "more self-assured" navy blue. ''Id''. n.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of the first (1926) through the fifteenth (1991) editions are available on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192512/https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx Introduction]'', {{smallcaps|Bluebook.com}}, (2010), (archived from the [https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx original] June 24, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bluebook'' uses two different styles.  The first is used by practitioners in preparing court documents and memoranda, while the second is used primarily in academic settings, such as [[law reviews]] and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Deborah E. Bouchoux}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=cite+checker+bouchoux&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yd6_SArt3B&amp;sig=uWjCbuvyeYJSxn0kLnnTwy7kz-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9ppr1vPDKAhVKOSYKHdmVC4cQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=cite%20checker%20bouchoux&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Cite-Checker: A Hands-on Guide to Learning Citation Form}}] 9 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter uses specific formatting to identify types of references, such as the use of [[small caps]] for books, newspapers, and law reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A rule of thumb used by many is to see if the formatting can be reproduced on a [[typewriter]]—if so, it is used by practitioners, if it requires typesetting, it is used for academic articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, ''The Bluebook'' was "the main guide and source of authority" on legal references for the past 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|William H. Putman}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research, Analysis, and Writing}} 468 (4th ed. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recognized as the "gold standard" for legal references in the United States, even though it originally was designed only to help teach law students how to cite cases and other legal material.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although other citation systems exist, they have limited acceptance, and in general, ''The Bluebook'' is followed in legal citation as the most widely accepted citation style.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468; {{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 2; Kroski, at 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states have adopted ''The Bluebook'' in full, while others have partially adopted ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  States such as Texas have supplements, such as the "Greenbook", that merely address citation issues unique to Texas and otherwise follow ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Brandon D. Quarles &amp; Matthew C. Cordon}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research for the Texas Practitioner}} 16 (2003); {{smallcaps|The Greenbook: Texas Rules of Form}} iv (12th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

=== Federal ===
The [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] issues a style guide that is designed to supplement ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Solicitor General's Style Guide}} 1 (Jack Metzler ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  This guide focuses on citation for practitioners, so as an example, only two type faces are used for law reviews, normal and italics.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other changes are also minor, such as moving ''supra'' from before the page referenced to after the page number.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The guide does state that unless explicitly specified otherwise, ''The Bluebook'' rule takes precedence in the event of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State ===
California used to require use of the ''California Style Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Edward W. Jessen}}, {{smallcaps|California Style Manual}} 1 (4th ed. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] issued a rule giving an option of using either the ''California Style Manual'' or ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Calif. R. of Ct. 1.200; {{smallcaps|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation}} 30 (Mary Miles Prince ed., 19th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The two styles are significantly different in citing cases, in use of ''Ibid'' or ''Id.'' (for ''{{lang|la|Idem}}''), and in citing books and journals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://libguides.law.ucla.edu/loader.php?type=d&amp;id=92912 Legal Research and Writing Manual]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', {{smallcaps|UCLA School of Law}} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Michigan uses a separate official citation system, issued as an administrative order of the Michigan Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Elan S.

Cooley J. Prac. &amp; Clinical L.}} 57, 58 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary difference is that the Michigan system "omits all periods in citations, uses italics somewhat differently, and does not use 'small caps.'"&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, at 58 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted, Texas merely supplements ''The Bluebook'' with items that are unique to Texas courts, such as citing to cases when Texas was an independent republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 101.&lt;/ref&gt; petition and writ history,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 20-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]] Opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar issues.

== Reception ==

=== Criticism of ''Bluebook''{{'}}s prolixity ===

At over 500 pages for the 19th edition, ''The Bluebook'' is significantly more complicated than the citation systems used by most other fields. Legal scholars have called for its replacement with a simpler system.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/review/the-bluebook-blues The Bluebook Blues]'', 120 {{smallcaps|Yale L.J.}} 850-861 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Chicago]] uses the simplified "[[Maroonbook]]",&lt;ref&gt;80 {{smallcaps|[http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/page/maroonbook The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation]}} 1 (Bradley G. Hubbard, Taylor A.R. Meehan, &amp; Kenneth A. Young eds. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and even simpler systems are in use by other parties.

Judge [[Richard Posner]] is "one of the founding fathers of ''Bluebook'' abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2797&amp;context=journal_articles Goodbye to the Bluebook]'', 53 {{smallcaps|Chi. L. Rev.}} 1343 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject." In a 2011 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation'' exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He wrote that a cursory look at the Nineteenth Edition "put [him] in mind of Mr. [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]]’s dying words in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''—'The horror! The horror!' "&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Post called it "the most boring piece of intellectual property imaginable." Adam Liptak described it as "a comically elaborate thicket of random and counterintuitive rules about how to cite judicial decisions, law review articles and the like [that] is both grotesque and indispensable." [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner personally uses a far simpler citation system based largely on the First Edition of the ''Bluebook''. This system, which he includes in a manual he provides for his law clerks, was reprinted in the aforementioned ''Yale Law Journal'' article. At the time of the article, his citation system was 885 ''words'' long, or about two printed pages—far shorter than the 511 pages of the Nineteenth Edition, the 640 pages of the then-current ''ALWD Citation Manual'', or the over 1,000 pages of the ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Manual of Style]]''.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;

=== ''BabyBlue'' copyright controversy ===
[[File:Cover of Baby Blue's Manual of Legal Citation.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[BabyBlue]]'']]
[[File:The Indigo Book cover.png|thumb|''[[Indigo Book]]'' cover]]

Another dispute is over the copyright status of ''The Bluebook''.  Open-source advocates claim that ''The Bluebook'' is not protected under copyright because it is a critical piece of legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, according to NYU Professor Christopher Sprigman, "the copyright for the 10th edition of the tome, published in 1958, was never renewed, and .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that means it is in the public domain." See [http://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/yale-law-students-support-the-end-of-the-bluebook/?rf=1 ''Yale Law Students Support The End Of The Bluebook''], {{smallcaps|Above the Law}} (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers who represent the Bluebook publishing consortium claim that the "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" are protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[American Bar Association]] | title=Legal minds differ on whether The Bluebook is subject to copyright protection | date=February 1, 2015 | author=Leslie A. Gordon | url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/legal_minds_differ_on_whether_the_bluebook_is_subject_to_copyright_protecti | access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group led by Professor Christopher J. Sprigman at NYU Law School has been preparing a "public-domain implementation of the ''Bluebook''{{’}}s Uniform System of Citation." which his group calls ''BabyBlue''. However, a law firm (Ropes &amp; Gray) representing the Harvard Law Review Association (HLRA) sent him a letter stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e believe that ''[[BabyBlue]]'' may include content identical or substantially similar to content or other aspects of ''The Bluebook'' that constitute original works of authorship protected by copyright, and which are covered by various United States copyright registrations.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[M]y client has been and remains concerned that the publication and promotion of such a work may infringe the Reviews’ copyright rights in ''The Bluebook'' and ''The Bluebook'' Online, and may cause substantial, irreparable harm to the Reviews and their rights and interests in those works.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[I]t is our client’s position that the title ''BabyBlue'', or any title consisting of or comprising the word “Blue,” when used on or in connection with your work, would so resemble the ''BLUEBOOK'' Marks as to be likely, to cause confusion, mistake, and/or deception…Accordingly, and to avoid any risk of consumer confusion, my client respectfully demands that you agree (i) not to use the title or name ''BabyBlue'', or any other title or name including the word “blue,” for your work.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter quoted in Jacob Gershman, [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/12/28/bluebook-critics-incite-copyright-clash/?mod=WSJBlog ''Bluebook Critics Incite Copyright Clash''], {{smallcaps|Wall Street Journal Law Blog}} (Dec. 28, 2015), and in Mike Masnick, ''Harvard Law Review Freaks Out, Sends Christmas Eve Threat Over Public Domain Citation Guide''], in {{smallcaps|Techdirt}} (Dec. 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the HLRA letter to Sprigman, over 150 students, faculty, staff and alumni of Harvard Law School signed a petition in support of ''BabyBlue''. Yale and NYU students added their separate petitions supporting ''BabyBlue''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hlrecord.org/2016/02/harvard-law-review-should-welcome-free-citation-manual-not-threaten-lawsuits/ ''Harvard Law Review Should Welcome Free Citation Manual, Not Threaten Lawsuits''], {{smallcaps|Harvard Law Record}} (Feb. 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A posting in the ''Harvard Law Record'' commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual property claims that the HLR Association made may or may not be spurious. But independent of that, the tactics employed by the HLR Association’s counsel in dealing with Mr. Malamud and Prof. Sprigman are deplorable. The Harvard Law Review claims to be an organization that promotes knowledge and access to legal scholarship. It is a venerated part of the traditions of Harvard Law School. But these actions by the Harvard Law Review speak of competition and not of justice.&lt;ref name="''id''."&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The posting also suggested that HLRA should "redirect the money it spends on legal fees ($185,664 in 2013)" to a more worthy purpose.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt;

David Post commented: "It’s copyright nonsense, and Harvard should be ashamed of itself for loosing its legal hounds to dispense it in order to protect its (apparently fairly lucrative) publication monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2016, it was announced that the project had changed its name to the ''[[Indigo Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Michael|title=Response|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2806393/Harvard-Response-20160331.pdf|publisher=public.resource.org|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial controversy ==

Revenues from the sale of the ''Bluebook'' are estimated "in the millions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro and Julie Graves Krishnaswami, [http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=308111088105096097087001004108109007054027040080070045096086028073001068126123008002126026116029049096000076016091095116108107016036036048035081098124089024081068068022023075002115125103105125088011113029091090012067007071118120093113072117092124096115&amp;EXT=pdf ''The Secret History of the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 50 years, the Harvard Law Review kept 100 percent of the revenues.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt; In 1974, the editors of the ''[[Columbia Law Review|Columbia]]'' and ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]s'' and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' apparently discovered this, due to an indiscretion.&lt;ref&gt;According to Joan G. Wexler, Dean and then President of [[Brooklyn Law School]], some members of the ''Harvard Law Review'' disclosed to her at a lunch one day in [[San Francisco]] where they were all summer associates "[w]hat a cash cow" the ''Bluebook'' was for their review. She consulted Professor [[Ralph S. Brown]] at Yale Law School, who taught copyright, and he said "sue them!" See Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; They complained that Harvard was illegally keeping all profits from the first eleven editions, estimated to total $20,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;W. Duane Benton, ''Developments in the Law – Legal Citation'', 86 {{smallcaps|Yale}} L.J. 197, 202 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; After they threatened to sue, and considerable wrangling, Harvard agreed with them to split the revenue: 40 percent for Harvard, 20 percent each for Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale; Harvard would continue to provide the production and distribution services.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Legal technology and future ==

The ''Bluebook'' has also been affected by the disruptions to the legal industry due to [[legal technology]].&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[startup company]] LegalEase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LegalEase official website|url=https://www.legaleasecite.com/bluebook-citation-generator}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a [[legal citation]] generator that enables its users to create citations in the ''Bluebook'' format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyberg|first1=Cheryl|title=Bluebook 101 Online Citation Generators|url=http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=375743&amp;p=2550183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cellosaurus''' is an on-line knowledge resource on cell lines &lt;ref name=Bairoch2018&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bairoch Amos|title=The Cellosaurus, a cell-line knowledge resource |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Techniques |volume=29 |pages=1-14 |year=2018 |pmid=29805321 |doi=10.7171/jbt.18-2902-002 |issue=[Epub ahead of print |pmc=5945021}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is provided by the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] (SIB) as one of its contribution &lt;ref&gt;https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/cellosaurus&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}} to [[ELIXIR]]. It is the contributing resource for cell lines on the Resource Identification Portal &lt;ref&gt;https://scicrunch.org/resources/Cell%20Lines/source/SCR_013869-1/search?q=%2A&amp;l=&lt;/ref&gt;.

Its scope includes [[immortalised cell line]]s, naturally immortal cell lines (example: [[embryonic stem cell]]s) and finite life cell lines when those are distributed and used widely.
The Cellosaurus provides a wealth of manually curated information;
for each cell line it lists a recommended name, synonyms and the species of origin. 
Other types of information include standardised disease terminology (for [[cancer]] or [[genetic disorder]] cell lines),
the transformant used to immortalise a cell line, transfected or knocked-out genes, microsatellite instability, doubling time, gender and age of donor (patient or animal), important sequence variations, web links, publication references and cross-references to more than 70 different databases, ontologies, cell collections and other relevant resources.

Since many cell lines used in research have been misidentified or [[Cell culture#Cell line cross-contamination|contaminated]],
the Cellosaurus keeps track of problematic cell lines, including all those listed in the
International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) &lt;ref&gt;http://iclac.org/wp-content/uploads/Cross-Contaminations-v8_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; tables.

For human as well as some dog cell lines, it provides [[short tandem repeat]] (STR) profile information.

Since July 2018, all cell lines in the Cellosaurus are represented as items in [[Wikidata]].

It is developed by [[Amos Bairoch]] at the CALIPHO group &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sib.swiss/bairoch-amos-lane-lydie/amos-bairoch-lydie-lane-sub CALIPHO group], on the web site of the SIB&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}} of the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] (SIB).

G.|title=Small Group Decision Making: Communication and the group Process|year=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Group communication ==
The first important research study of small group communication was performed in front of a live studio audience in Hollywood California by social psychologist Robert Bales and published in a series of books and articles in the early and mid 1950s .&lt;ref name="Bales"&gt;Bales, R. F. (1950). ''Interaction process analysis''. Page 33. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Balesss"&gt;Bales, R. F. (1950). ''Interaction process analysis''. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bales, R. F., and Strodtbeck, F. L. (1951). Phases in group problem-solving. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 46,'' 485-495.&lt;/ref&gt; This research entailed the [[content analysis]] of discussions within groups making decisions about "human relations" problems (i.e., vignettes about relationship difficulties within families or organizations). Bales made a series of important discoveries. First, group discussion tends to shift back and forth relatively quickly between the discussion of the group task and discussion relevant to the relationship among the members. He believed that this shifting was the product of an implicit attempt to balance the demands of task completion and group cohesion, under the presumption that conflict generated during task discussion causes stress among members, which must be released through positive relational talk. Second, task group discussion shifts from an emphasis on opinion exchange, through an attentiveness to values underlying the decision, to making the decision. This implication that group discussion goes through the same series of stages in the same order for any decision-making group is known as the ''linear phase model''. Third, the most talkative member of a group tends to make between 40 and 50 percent of the comments and the second most talkative member between 25 and 30, no matter the size of the group.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a consequence, large groups tend to be dominated by one or two members to the detriment of the others.

===Linear phase model===
The most influential of these discoveries has been the latter; the linear phase model. The idea that all groups performing a given type of task go through the same series of stages in the same order was replicated through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; with most finding four phases of discussion. For example, communication researcher B. Aubrey Fisher showed groups going sequentially through an orientation stage, a conflict stage, a stage in which a decision emerges and a stage in which that decision is reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, B. A.  (1970). Decision emergence: Phases in group decision making. ''Speech Monographs, 37,'' 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this research (although not necessarily Fisher's) had two fundamental flaws. First, all group data was combined before analysis, making it impossible to determine whether there were differences among groups in their sequence of discussion. Second, group discussion content was compared across the same number of stages as the researcher hypothesized, such that if the researcher believed there were four stages to discussion, there was no way to find out if there actually were five or more. In the 1980s, communication researcher [[Marshall Scott Poole]] examined a sample of groups without making these errors and noted substantial differences among them in the number and order of stages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Scott Poole|Poole, M. S.]], &amp; Roth, J. (1989). Decision development in small groups IV: A typology of group decision paths. ''Human Communication Research, 15,'' 323-356.&lt;/ref&gt; He hypothesized that groups finding themselves in some difficulty due to task complexity, an unclear leadership structure or poor cohesion act as if they feel the need to conduct a "complete" discussion and thus are more likely to pass through all stages as the linear phase model implies, whereas groups feeling confident due to task simplicity, a clear leadership structure and cohesion are more likely to skip stages apparently deemed unnecessary.

===Idea development===
Another milestone in the study of group discussion content was early 1960s work by communication researchers Thomas Scheidel and Laura Crowell regarding the process by which groups examine individual proposed solutions to their problem.&lt;ref&gt;Scheidel, T. M., &amp; Crowell, L. (1964). Idea development in small discussion groups. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 50,'' 140-145.&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that after a proposal is made, groups discuss it in an implied attempt to determine their "comfort level" with it and then drop it in lieu of a different proposal. In a procedure akin to the survival of the fittest, proposals viewed favorably would emerge later in discussion, whereas those viewed unfavorably would not; the authors referred to this process as "spiraling."  Although there are serious methodological problems with this work, other studies have led to similar conclusions. For example, in the 1970s, social psychologist L. Richard Hoffman noted that odds of a proposal's acceptance is strongly associated with the arithmetical difference between the number of utterances supporting versus rejecting that proposal. More recent work has shown that groups differ substantially in the extent to which they spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, L. R. (1979). ''The group problem-solving process''. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional developments have taken place within group communication theory as researchers move away from conducting research on zero-history groups, and toward a "bona fide" groups perspective. The bona fide group, as described by Linda L. Putnam and Cynthia Stohl in 1990, fosters a sense of interdependence among the members of the group, along with specific boundaries that have been agreed upon by members over time.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, L. L., &amp; Stohl, C. (1990). Bona fide groups: A reconceptualization of groups in context. ''Communication Studies, 41, 3,'' 248-265.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides researchers with model of group behavior that stays true to the characteristics displayed by most naturally occurring groups, (s).

== Social influence in groups ==
Work relevant to [[social influence]] in groups has a long history. Two early examples of social psychological research have been particularly influential. The first of these was by [[Muzafer Sherif]] in 1935 using the [[autokinetic effect]]. Sherif asked participants to voice their judgments of light movement in the presence of others and noted that these judgments tended to converge.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M. (1935). A study of some social factors in perception. ''Archives of Psychology, 27''(187).&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these was a series of studies by [[Solomon Asch]], in which naive participants were asked to voice their judgments of the similarity of the length of lines after hearing the "judgments" of several confederates (research assistants posing as participants) who purposely voiced the same obviously wrong judgment. On about 1/3 of the cases, participants voiced the obviously wrong judgment. When asked why, many of these participants reported that they had originally made the correct judgment but after hearing the confederates, decided the judgments of several others (the confederates) should be trusted over theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: 1. A minority of one against a unanimous majority. ''Psychological Monographs, 70''(9), Whole #416.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these and other studies, social psychologists have come to distinguish between two types of social influence; informational and normative (see [[conformity]]). Informational influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the content of what they read or hear to accept an opinion; Sherif's study appears to be an example. Normative influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the knowledge that a majority of group members have a view. Normative influence should not be confused with compliance, which occurs when group members are not persuaded but voice the opinions of the group majority. Although some of the participants in the Asch studies who conformed admitted that they had complied, the ones mentioned above who believed the majority to be correct are best considered to have been persuaded through normative influence.

===Conflict resolution===
Any group has conflicts, topics that people do not agree on, different points of view on how to move forward with a task and so on. As a result, to be able to overcome any conflict that might arise, a six step conflict resolution will help to overcome the problem.&lt;ref name="Guffey, Mary E. 2010"&gt;Guffey, Mary E., Kathleen Rhodes and Patricia Rogin. ''Business Communication: Process and Product''. 3rd ed. Toronto: Thomson South-Western, 2010. 32. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the group members have to listen carefully to each other
* Understand the different points of view that were discussed
* Be respectful and show interest in maintaining a good relationship with the group members regardless of their opinions
* Try to find a common ground
* Come up with new solutions to the problem or situation
* Finally, reach on a fair agreement that will benefit everyone

===Group decisions===
By the end of the 1950s, studies such as Sherif's led to the reasonable conclusion that social influence in groups leads group members to converge on the average judgment of the individual members. As a consequence, it was a surprise to many social psychologists when in the early 1960s, evidence appeared that group decisions often became more extreme than the average of the individual predisposed judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, M. A., Kogan, N., &amp; Bem, D. J. (1962). Group influence on individual risk taking. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 65,'' 75-86.&lt;/ref&gt; This was originally thought to be a tendency for groups to be riskier than their members would be alone (the [[risky shift]]), but later found to be a tendency for extremity in any direction based on which way the members individually tended to lean before discussion ([[group polarization]]). Research has clearly demonstrated that group polarization is primarily a product of persuasion not compliance. Two theoretical explanations for group polarization have come to predominate. One is based on [[social comparison theory]], claiming that members look to one another for the "socially correct" side of the issue and if they find themselves deviant in this regard, shift their opinion toward the extreme of the socially correct position.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R. S., Dion, K. L., Baron, P. H., &amp; Miller, N. (1971). Group consensus and cultural values as determinants of risk taking. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 20,'' 446-455.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an example of normative influence. The other 'persuasive arguments theory' (PAT), begins with the notion that each group member enters discussion aware of a set of items of information favoring both sides of the issue but lean toward that side that boasts the greater amount of information. Some of these items are shared among the members (all are aware of them), others are unshared (only one member is aware of each). Assuming most or all group members lean in the same direction, during discussion, items of unshared information supporting that direction are voiced, giving members previously unaware of them more reason to lean in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;Vinokur, A., &amp; Burnstein, E. (1974). Effects of partially shared persuasive arguments on group induced shifts: A group problem-solving approach. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29,'' 305-315.&lt;/ref&gt; PAT is an example of informational influence. Although PAT has strong empirical support, it would imply that unshared items of information on the opposite side of the favored position would also come up in discussion, canceling the tendency to polarize. Research has shown that when group members all lean in one direction, discussion content is biased toward the side favored by the group, inconsistent with PAT. This finding is consistent with social comparison notions; upon discovering where the group stands, members only voice items of information on the socially correct side. It follows that an explanation for group polarization must include information influence and normative influence.

The possibility exists that the majority of information known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but that the majority of information known to each member individually, supports the other side of the issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware of 3 items of information supporting job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 items of information supporting job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 items of information supporting candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware of more information supporting B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the items of information favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job. This circumstance, first studied by Stasser and Titus, is known as a "[[hidden profile]]" and is more likely to occur as group size increases and as the proportion of shared versus unshared items of information increases.&lt;ref&gt;Stasser, G., &amp; Titus, W. (1985). Pooling of unshared information in group decision making: Biased information sampling during discussion. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53,'' 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many methods may be used in reaching group decisions. The most popular method in Western culture is by majority, but other ways to make team decisions are available. Firstly, voting by majority brings quick decision making, and that is one of the reasons why it is the most widely used. A second method is by consensus. Reaching decisions by consensus is time consuming, but it allows everyone to bring forward their opinion. A third method is by averaging. This method requires all teammates to reach a decision by compromising. Reaching decisions by minority decision calls for a subcommittee getting together and reaching decisions without the whole groupe being involved. A final method is by authority rule. In this method, the group leader listens to individual group member's ideas, and has final say on a decision.&lt;ref name="Guffey, Mary E. 2010"/&gt;

=== Nonverbal communication ===
{{Main|Nonverbal communication}}
'''Body language''' is a form of nonverbal communication, consisting of body pose, gestures, eye movements and paralinguistic cues (i.e. tone of voice and rate of speech). Humans send and interpret such signals unconsciously.
It is often said that human communication consists of 93% body language and paralinguistic cues, while only 7% of communication consists of words themselves&lt;ref&gt;Borg, John. Body Language: 7 Easy Lessons to Master the Silent Language. Prentice Hall life, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; - however, [[Albert Mehrabian]], the researcher whose 1960s work is the source of these statistics, has stated that this is a misunderstanding of the findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

=== Physical expression ===

Physical expressions like waving, pointing, touching and slouching are all forms of nonverbal communication.  The study of body movement and expression is known as [[kinesics]].  Humans move their bodies when communicating because as research has shown, it helps "ease the mental effort when communication is difficult."  Physical expressions reveal many things about the person using them for example, gestures can emphasize a point or relay a message, posture can reveal boredom or great interest, and touch can convey encouragement or caution.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples list ===

*''Hands on knees'': indicates readiness.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"&gt;Matthew McKay, Martha Davis, Patrick Fanning [1983] (1995) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bUDNZkqUt0AC Messages: The Communication Skills Book]'', Second Edition, New Harbinger Publications, {{ISBN|1-57224-592-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57224-592-1}}, pp.56-57&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hands on hips'': indicates impatience.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Lock your hands behind your back'': indicates self-control.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Locked hands behind head'': states confidence.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Sitting with a leg over the arm of the chair'': suggests indifference.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Legs and feet pointed in a particular direction'': the direction where more interest is felt&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Crossed arms'': indicates submissiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnow, E. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Body language is a form of non-verbal communication involving the use of stylized gestures, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to other people. Humans, sometimes unconsciously, send and receive non-verbal signals all the time.

== Body language and space ==

Interpersonal space refers to the psychological "bubble" that we can imagine exists when someone is standing far too close to us.  Research has revealed that in North America there are four different zones of interpersonal space. The first zone is called intimate distance and ranges from touching to about eighteen inches apart.  Intimate distance is the space around us that we reserve for lovers, children, as well as close family members and friends.  The second zone is called personal distance and begins about an arm's length away; starting around eighteen inches from our person and ending about four feet away.  We use personal distance in conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions.  The third zone of interpersonal space is called social distance and is the area that ranges from four to eight feet away from you.  Social distance is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances.  The fourth identified zone of space is public distance and includes anything more than eight feet away from you.  This zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language difficulties===

Misunderstandings in communication are common because of the many different factor, that is the way of conveying message; which is done through language.  Though there is no right or wrong way to communicate, avoiding language barriers such as jargon, bypassing, and offensive language may prevent misunderstandings in group or interpersonal discussions.
One of the more common barriers in communication is the inappropriate use of jargon.  Jargon is a fictive language invented by and for the group as a verbal shorthand.  It also syllabifies group membership when used properly.  The problem with jargon is that it can make words confusing and can be used to conceal the truth.
Another barrier to language is bypassing.  Bypassing occurs when group members have different meanings for different words and phrases and thus miss each other's meanings.  To overcome the risk of bypassing it is important to look to what the speaker wants and not always at what the speaker says.  The third most common language barrier is offensive language.  Offensive language is "any terminology that demeans, excludes, or stereotypes people for any reason.  Avoiding sexist, discriminating, or labeling talk will greatly reduce chances of miscommunication.  Remember, there is no right or wrong way to communicate.  Though language difficulties are common, avoiding barriers like jargon, bypassing, and offensive language, will greatly reduce your chances of being misunderstood.  Only through habitual awareness can one begin to truly understand and then be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 126-129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tihanyi The Critic.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Critic'' by [[Lajos Tihanyi]]. Oil on canvas, c.1916.]]

A '''critic''' is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from [[critical thinking]] or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.

Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are important too. Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. In architecture and food criticism, the item's function, value and cost may be added components.

Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. Influential critics of art, music, theatre and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. One very famous example is [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' and ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''. Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. For instance, they may take a Feminist or Freudian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdP2BgxsM3wC|title=The Feminist Spectator as Critic|last=Dolan|first=Jill|date=2012-10-24|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472035193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as "[[pundits]]" instead of critics.

Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails some [[subjectivity]]. An established critic can play a powerful role as a public [[arbitration|arbiter]] of taste or opinion. Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

== Derivation ==

The word "critic" comes {{ety|gre|''κριτικός'' (kritikós)|able to discern}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkritiko%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Kritikos'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a Greek derivation of the word {{lang|grc|κριτής}} ''(krités)'', meaning a person who offers reasoned judgment or analysis, value judgment, interpretation or observation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkrith%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Krites'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; Early English meaning of criticism was based mainly on the criticism of literature and it was in the 17th century that more general forms of criticism began.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Critics' views of criticism ==

Cultural critic [[Clement Greenberg]] wrote that a good critic excels through "insights into the evidence … and by … loyalty to the relevant"; poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] wrote "a critic must have a very highly developed sense of fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art and Culture – Critical Essays|last = Greenberg|first = Clement|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 1961|isbn = |location = Boston|page = 239|chapter = T.S. Eliot: A Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Harold C. Schonberg]], chief music critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'' from 1960 to 1980, said that he wrote for himself, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;not necessarily for readers, not for musicians. ...It's not a critic's job to be right or wrong; it's his job to express an opinion in readable English.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/nyregion/harold-c-schonberg-87-dies-won-pulitzer-prize-as-music-critic-for-the-times.html|title=Harold C.

Restaurant critic Terry Durack explained that from a critic "you hope for a thorough, objective and legitimate discussion" that puts "opera, art or book into context, so that it adds to your own body of knowledge"; in the context of a restaurant criticism, this means it is "not about me liking it or not; it's about me helping you decide whether you are going to like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-role-of-a-restaurant-critic-in-the-digital-age-20161201-gt1ndf.html|title=The role of a restaurant critic in the digital age|last=Durack|first=Terry|date=3 December 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=5 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and political critics ==

Social and political critics have used various forms of art to express their criticism, including literature and music. [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], for example, prior to the [[French Revolution]], used his play [[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|''The Marriage of Figaro'']] to denounce aristocratic privilege. A critic's influence is enhanced by subsequent reworkings such as the operatic versions of Beaumarchais's play (''[[The Barber of Seville]]'') by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'') by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. Among the most famous social/political criticism in literary form are [[Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift's]] [[satire]] ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and [[George Orwell]]'s satire ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Some political critics, such as [[Ai Weiwei]] use visual art as their medium. Throughout history, political critics have faced higher risks, including the risk of imprisonment or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/hrw-calls-for-release-of-thai-government-critic/3238970.html|title=HRW Calls for Release of Thai Government Critic|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2016/03/21/zambian-opposition-leader-arrested-for-defaming-president-lungu/|title=Zambian opposition leader arrested for ‘defaming’ President Lungu|website=africanews.channel|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistanis-throng-for-funeral-of-man-hanged-for-killing-critic-of-blasphemy-laws-1456855688|title=Pakistanis Throng Funeral of Man Hanged for Killing Critic of Blasphemy Laws|last=Shah|first=Saeed|last2=Nauman|first2=Qasim|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nemtsov-idUSKCN0W00M4|title=Thousands march in Moscow to honor slain Kremlin critic Nemtsov|date=2016-02-28|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/beijing-critic-family-detained-china-internet-crackdown/3256261.html|title=Beijing Critic Says Family Detained in China in Internet Crackdown|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online critics ==

Several websites have developed for the purpose of compiling or publishing original critical reviews. Examples include ''[[Blogcritics|BlogCritics Magazine]]'', [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and [[Yelp]]. According to [[A. O. Scott]], chief film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', everyone on the Internet is a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/sunday-review/everybodys-a-critic-and-thats-how-it-should-be.html|title=Everybody’s a Critic.

== Responses to critics ==

People whose work is the subject of criticism have a full range of responses to it. For example, they may be appreciative, offended, distressed, encouraged, amused or nonplussed.
{{Quotebox|quote=''We do not object to criticism; and we do not expect that the critic will read the book before writing a notice of it.

[[Cursive]] handwriting instruction is a historical instrument for composition and important to the learning capability of young students.

== History ==
Cursive has traditionally been used as a way of signing one's name, a [[signature]], and is considered a very important skill. The last few lines of the [[Declaration of Independence]] remind us what it means to inscribe a signature.&lt;ref name="signature value"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Value of the Signature|url=http://med.uth.tmc.edu/students-current/SCAIP/signature-value.htm|work=Student Committee for Academic Integrity and Professionalism|publisher=The University of Texas Medical School at Houston|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''"And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Declaration of Independence|url=http://federalist.freeservers.com/|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:- [[Thomas Jefferson]], ''Declaration of Independence''

While many people sign their names enough that it becomes very routine, it is still an important skill to have.&lt;ref name="signature value" /&gt; A ''false signature'', [[forgery]], is a punishable by law offense. Writing a [[Certified check|check]], signing a [[credit slip]], signing a [[marriage certificate]], and signing an apartment lease are just a few of the occasions when a valid signature is necessary.&lt;ref name="signature value" /&gt; Signatures are reflections of the identity of a person  and that person as a professional.&lt;ref name="signature value" /&gt;

=== Important Figures ===
Autographs are some of the most expensive collectors items on the market. Typically, an autograph is a signature written in cursive by someone of notable fame. One of the most notable signatures comes from [[John Hancock]], which is also the most notable signature on the Declaration of Independence.

== No Child Left Behind ==
When the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] was implemented, several changes were made to the classroom curriculum. One of those changes, that has been frequently altered, is the requirement for cursive handwriting. The [[U.S. Department of Education]] has provided updates of the changes as they are implemented into the school systems. The general curriculum states that by 5th grade, students use cursive exclusively and give oral presentations.&lt;ref name="no child 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 No Child Left Behind- Blue Ribbon Schools Program |url=http://nces.ed.gov/ |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |accessdate=March 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116125625/http://nces.ed.gov/ |archivedate=January 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there have been more recent updates of the required curriculum for primary schools nationwide, cursive handwriting has been an essential part of reading and writing instruction.

== Handwriting ==
"[[Handwriting]] is a psychomotor skill taught by instruction".&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arslan|first=Derya|author2=Mehmet Akif Ersoy University|title=Examining First Grade Teachers' Handwriting Instruction|journal=Education Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwriting instruction is a student's primary means of communicating academic progress to teachers, and that is doubly true for cursive handwriting instruction.&lt;ref name="comparison of cursive"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shimel|first=Kristin |author2=Candler, Catherine |author3=Neville-Smith, Marsha|title=Comparison of Cursive Handwriting Instruction Programs Among Students Without Identified Problems|journal=Physical &amp; Occupational Therapy in Pediatrics|year=2009|volume=29|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many important aspects of handwriting instruction, the most important items are; age of handwriting instruction, handwriting style, methods of handwriting instruction, handwriting equipment, evaluation, and handwriting difficulties.&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction" /&gt; Legibility is the main determinant in handwriting evaluations, especially cursive handwriting.&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction" /&gt; It is very important that handwriting instruction is taught properly; it is a skill that is very difficult to restore if it is gained incorrectly.&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction" /&gt;

== Current Events ==
Many schools have removed cursive handwriting instruction from their curriculum. A recent news article claims that a new bill could require cursive writing in schools again.&lt;ref name="require cursive"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Jessika|title=New Bill Could Require Cursive Writing In School Again|newspaper=The Free Press (Kinstin, North Carolina)|date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bill was filed in North Carolina, it is something that is being conversed about in many of the states of America. If the bill is approved, it will alter the curriculum to include cursive handwriting instruction.&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt; "These schools would be required to provide instruction for students to create legible, cursive documents by the end of the fifth grade."&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt;  Under the LCS cursive guidelines, student's are not expected to be completely proficient in cursive writing by the end of the fifth grade but be able to use the skill.&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt;  When the system was revisited, after the skill was taken out of the core requirements, school therapists reported that some students struggled with manuscript but excelled in cursive writing.&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt; Several students interviewed said they enjoy writing in cursive for reasons such that "you can write faster than normal," "you can use it as you get older," and "it helps you learn more."&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt; Students in Atlantic Shores Christian School, in Virginia, say that there is no substitute for cursive handwriting instruction.&lt;ref name="cursive lost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winborn|first=Tracy|title=Writing in Cursive: Skill Lost on America's Youth?|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2011/June/Writing-in-Cursive-Skill-Lost-on-Americas-Youth-/|accessdate=March 27, 2013|newspaper=CBN News|date=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cursive is something you need to sign your name in a legal document, "it teaches you to get more muscles in your hand," and "because it's fun...you get to do different symbols than normal."&lt;ref name="cursive lost" /&gt;
Many schools have adopted keyboarding as an alternative to cursive handwriting instruction. Because cursive handwriting instruction has been removed from the mandatory curriculum, schools around the country are debating whether or not to spend teaching resources on penmanship.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news|title=Schools Debate Cursive Handwriting Instruction Nationwide|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/30/cursive-handwriting-instr_n_842069.html|accessdate=March 27, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether or not the next generation will be taught to read manuscripts, although the sentiment, "Nobody reads handwriting anymore," expressed by [[Luis von Ahn]], seems to encourage the idea that cursive handwriting instruction may become obsolete in the near future.&lt;ref name="debate" /&gt;

=== Text Messaging ===
Text messaging, or simply [[texting]], is a very popular way to communicate through a text only message. It began as a simple message sent from a computer in 1992 to a billion dollar operation in 2011.&lt;ref name=texting&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Messaging: A timeline of how 160 characters changed the way we communicate|url=http://www.tatango.com/blog/history-of-text-messaging-timeline-wide/|work=tatango|publisher=SMS Marketing Blog|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing notes in class has become a thing of the past as it is not very common to see students in grades [[K-12]] without a [[cellular phone]] but the majority of cell phone owners who text on a regular basis are age 18-25.&lt;ref name="texting ruins" /&gt;  Forty-one states have adopted new standards that replace cursive handwriting instruction with keyboarding.&lt;ref name="cursive lost" /&gt; Students in Augusta, Georgia expressed that "texting is my life" and "texting is more fun".&lt;ref name="cursive lost" /&gt; While it may be an acceptable form of communication among friends, text lingo is also diminishing proper grammar and spelling techniques. As the use of [[textese]] increases, test scores, specifically grammar, decrease.&lt;ref name="texting ruins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Texting Ruining the English Language?|url=http://sourcefednews.com/is-texting-ruining-the-english-language/|publisher=Source Fed|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relevancy of this section as it pertains to the subject isn't known at this time.

[[File:Fedor Bronnikov 014.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Poetry reading by Horace, an early advocate of decorum. Painting by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]]]
'''Decorum''' (from the [[Latin]]: "right, proper") was a principle of classical [[rhetoric]], poetry and theatrical theory that was about the fitness or otherwise of a style to a theatrical subject. The concept of decorum is also applied to [[#Social decorum|prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior]] within set situations.

==In rhetoric and poetry==
In classical rhetoric and poetic theory, decorum designates the appropriateness of style to subject. Both [[Aristotle]] (in, for example, his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') and [[Horace]] (in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'') discussed the importance of appropriate style in [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]], [[comedy]], etc. Horace says, for example: "A comic subject is not susceptible of treatment in a tragic style, and similarly the banquet of [[Thyestes]] cannot be fitly described in the strains of everyday life or in those that approach the tone of comedy. Let each of these styles be kept to the role properly allotted to it."&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 82 (corresponding to lines 81-106 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellenistic and Latin [[rhetor]]s divided style into: the grand style, the middle style and the low (or plain) style; certain types of vocabulary and diction were considered appropriate for each stylistic level. A discussion of this division of styles was set out in the pseudo-[[Cicero]]nian ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]''. Modeled on [[Virgil]]'s three-part literary career (''[[Bucolics]]'', ''[[Georgics]]'', ''[[Aeneid]]''), ancient, medieval and Renaissance theorists often linked each style to a specific [[genre]]: [[Epic poetry|epic]] (high style), [[didactic]] (middle style) and [[pastoral]] (plain style). In the Middle Ages, this concept was called "Virgil's wheel". For stylistic purists, the mixing of styles within a work was considered inappropriate, and a consistent use of the high style was mandated for the epic.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Boyle. ''Roman Epic.'' Routledge, 1993. p.6. {{ISBN|0-415-14357-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iOMyLO_Etj8C Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; However, stylistic diversity had been a hallmark of classical epic (as seen in the inclusion of comic and/or erotic scenes in the epics of Virgil or Homer).
Poetry, perhaps more than any other literary form, usually expressed words or phrases that were not current in ordinary conversation, characterized as [[poetic diction]].

With the arrival of [[Christianity]], concepts of decorum became involved with those of the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] in a different way from in the previous classical religions. Although in the [[Middle Ages]] religious subjects were often treated with broad humour in a "low" manner, especially in [[medieval drama]], the churches policed carefully the treatment in more permanent art forms, insisting on a consistent "high style". By the Renaissance the mixture of revived [[classical mythology]] and Christian subjects was also considered to fall under the heading of decorum, as was the increasing habit of mixing religious subjects in art with lively [[genre painting]] or portraiture of the fashionable. The Catholic [[Council of Trent]] [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|specifically forbade]], among other things, the "indecorous" in religious art.

Concepts of decorum, increasingly sensed as inhibitive and stultifying, were aggressively attacked and [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] by writers of the [[Modernism|Modernist movement]], with the result that readers' expectations were no longer based on decorum, and in consequence the violations of decorum that underlie the wit of [[mock-heroic]], of literary [[burlesque]], and even a sense of [[bathos]], were dulled in the twentieth-century reader.

==In theatre==
In continental European debates on theatre in the Renaissance and post-Renaissance, decorum is concerned with the appropriateness of certain actions or events to the stage. In their emulation of classical models and of the theoretical works by Aristotle and Horace (including the notion of the "[[Three Unities]]"), certain subjects were deemed to be better left to narration. In Horace's ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the poet (in addition to speaking about appropriate vocabulary and diction, as discussed above) counseled playwrights to respect decorum by avoiding the portrayal, on stage, of scenes that would shock the audience by their cruelty or unbelievable nature: "But you will not bring on to the stage anything that ought properly to be taking place behinds the scenes, and you will keep out of sight many episodes that are to be described later by the eloquent tongue of a narrator. [[Medea]] must not butcher her children in the presence of the audience, nor the monstrous [[Atreus]] cook his dish of human flesh within public view, nor [[Procne]] be metamorphosed into a bird, nor [[Cadmus]] into a snake. I shall turn in disgust from anything of this kind that you show me. "&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 85 (corresponding to lines 164-193 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Italy, important debates on decorum in theater were set off by [[Sperone Speroni]]'s play ''[[Canace (play)|Canace]]'' (portraying incest between a brother and sister) and [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]]'s play ''[[Orbecche]]'' (involving patricide and cruel scenes of vengeance).&lt;ref&gt;See Timothy Reiss. "Renaissance theatre and the theory of tragedy." ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism.'' Volume III: The Renaissance. pp.229-247. {{ISBN|0-521-30008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seventeenth-century France, the notion of decorum (''les bienséances'') was a key component of French classicism in both theater and the novel (see [[French literature of the 17th century]]), as well as the visual arts - see [[hierarchy of genres]].

==Social decorum==
''Social'' decorum sets down appropriate [[social behavior]] and propriety, and is thus linked to notions of [[etiquette]] and [[manners]].

The precepts of social decorum as we understand them, of the preservation of external decency, were consciously set by [[Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], who was looking for a translation of ''les moeurs'': "Manners are too little, morals are too much."&lt;ref&gt;Chesterfield, in the ''World'', 12 August 1756, noted by Watson 1947:197.&lt;/ref&gt; The word decorum survives in Chesterfield's severely reduced form as an element of etiquette: the prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within a set situation. The use of this word in this sense is of the sixteenth-century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]'s use of ''decorum'' in discussing virtue in ''De officiis'' does not distinguish it from ''honestum'', according to Melvin R. Watson, "Lord Chesterfield and 'Decorum'" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''62'''.3 (March 1947), pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; prescribing the boundaries established in drama and literature, used by [[Roger Ascham]], ''The Scholemaster'' (1570) and echoed in [[Malvolio]]'s tirade in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', "My masters, are you mad, or what are you? Have you no wit, manners nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?...Is there no respect of persons, place nor time in you?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kranidas, "Malvolio on Decorum" ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' '''15'''.4 (Autumn 1964, pp. 450-451) p 450; see also T. McAlindon, ''Shakespeare and Decorum'' (New York) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of decorum in the courtroom, of the type of argument that is within bounds, remains pertinent:&lt;ref&gt;"Decorum of Attorney in Argument: Propriety of Appeals to the Pathetic or Sentimental" ''Michigan Law Review'' '''2'''.1 (June 1903), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; the decorum of argument was a constant topic during the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]].

During [[Model United Nations]] conferences the honorable chair may have to announce, "Decorum delegates!" if delegates are not adhering to parliamentary procedure dictated by the rules. This often happens if a delegate speaks out of turn or if the delegation is being disruptive.

[[File:Blasting honkanummi 4-6.jpg|thumb|Rock blasting in Finland]]

'''Drilling and blasting''' is the controlled use of [[explosives]] and other methods such as [[gas pressure blasting]] pyrotechnics, to break [[rock (geology)|rock]] for [[earthworks (engineering)|excavation]]. It is practiced most often in [[mining]], [[quarrying]] and [[civil engineering]] such as [[dam]] or road construction. The result of rock blasting is often known as a '''rock cut'''.&lt;!--'''shot-firing''' as synonym?--&gt;

Drilling and blasting currently utilizes many different varieties of [[explosive material|explosives]] with different compositions and performance properties.  Higher [[velocity]] explosives are used for relatively hard rock in order to shatter and break the rock, while low velocity explosives are used in soft rocks to generate more gas pressure and a greater heaving effect. For instance, an early 20th-century blasting manual compared the effects of black powder to that of a wedge, and dynamite to that of a hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurice|first=William|title=The Shot-Firer's Guide|year=c. 1910|publisher="The Electrician" Printing and Publishing Company Ltd.|location=London|pages=79–80|url=https://archive.org/stream/shotfirersguidep00maurrich#page/78/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used explosives in mining today are [[ANFO]] based blends due to lower cost than [[dynamite]].

Before the advent of [[tunnel boring machine]]s, drilling and blasting was the only economical way of excavating long [[tunnel]]s through hard rock, where digging is not possible. Even today, the method is still used in the construction of  tunnels, such as in the construction of the [[Lötschberg Base Tunnel]]. The decision whether to construct a tunnel using a TBM or using a drill and blast method includes a number of factors.  Tunnel length is a key issue that needs to be addressed because large TBMs for a rock tunnel have a high capital cost, but because they are usually quicker than a drill and blast tunnel the price per metre of tunnel is lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolymbas|first=Dimitrios|title=Tunelling and tunnel mechanics: a rational approach to tunnelling |year=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-25196-0|pages=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that shorter tunnels tend to be less economical to construct with a TBM and are therefore usually constructed by drill and blast. Managing ground conditions can also have a significant effect on the choice with different methods suited to different hazards in the ground.

== History ==
The use of explosives in mining goes back to the year 1627,&lt;ref&gt;Gary L. Buffington, [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=ASSE-00-005 The Art of Blasting on Construction and Surface Mining Sites], American Society of Safety Engineers (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; when [[gunpowder]] was first used in place of mechanical tools in the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] (now [[Slovakia|Slovak]]) town of [[Banská Štiavnica]]. The innovation spread quickly throughout Europe and the Americas.

While drilling and blasting saw limited use in pre-industrial times using [[gunpowder]] (such as with the [[Blue Ridge Tunnel]] in the United States, built in the 1850s), it was not until more powerful (and safer) [[explosive]]s, such as [[dynamite]] (patented 1867), as well as powered [[drill]]s were developed, that its potential was fully realised.

Drilling and blasting was successfully used to construct tunnels throughout the world, notably the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]],  the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel]], the [[Simplon Tunnel]], the [[Jungfraubahn]] and even the longest road tunnel in the world, [[Lærdalstunnelen]], are constructed using this method.

In 1990, 2.1 million [[tonnes]] (2.32 million short tons) of commercial explosives were consumed in the United States, representing an estimated expenditure of 3.5 to 4 billion 1993 dollars on blasting. Australia had the highest explosives consumption that year at 500 million tonnes (551 million short tons), with [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] another leader in rock blasting (Persson et al. 1994:1).

== Procedure ==
[[File:Södermalmstunneln 2009a.jpg|thumb|A [[Drilling jumbo|drill jumbo]] during the construction of [[Citybanan]] under Stockholm, used for drilling holes for explosives]]
As the name suggests, drilling and blasting works as follows:

*A number of holes are drilled into the rock, which are then filled with explosives.
*Detonating the explosive causes the rock to collapse.
*Rubble is removed and the new tunnel surface is reinforced.
*Repeating these steps until desired excavation is complete.

The positions and depths of the holes (and the amount of explosive each hole receives) are determined by a carefully constructed pattern, which, together with the correct timing of the individual explosions, will guarantee that the tunnel will have an approximately circular cross-section.

During operation, [[blasting mat]]s may be used to contain the blast, suppress dust and noise, for fly rock prevention and sometimes to direct the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hansen|editor1-first=T. C.|title=Recycling of Demolished Concrete and Masonry|date=2004|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]]|isbn=0-203-62645-1|page=284|edition=Illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4KM4Xrr6Y0C&amp;dq=blasting+mat&amp;hl=sv&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incidents like Cape Ray blasting mishap deemed rare|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/incidents-like-cape-ray-blasting-mishap-deemed-rare-1.3205477|website=www.cbc.ca|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock support ==
As a tunnel or excavation progresses the roof and side walls need to be supported to stop the rock falling into the excavation. The philosophy and methods for rock support vary widely but typical rock support systems can include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5305">{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}'''Eisegesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|s|ɪ|s}}) is the process of interpreting a text or portion of text in such a way that the process introduces one's own presuppositions, agendas, or biases into and onto the text. This is commonly referred to as ''reading into'' the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = eisegesis… the interpretation of a text (as of the Bible) by reading into it one's own ideas… | last = Webster | title = New Collegiate Dictionary | page = 364 | publisher = G. &amp; C. Merriam | edition = 8th | year = 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The act is often used to "prove" a pre-held point of concern to the reader and to provide him or her with [[confirmation bias]] in accordance with his or her pre-held agenda. Eisegesis is best understood when contrasted with ''[[exegesis]]''. While exegesis is the process of drawing out the meaning from a text in accordance with the context and discoverable meaning of its author, ''eisegesis'' occurs when a reader imposes his or her interpretation into and onto the text. As a result, exegesis tends to be objective when employed effectively while eisegesis is regarded as highly subjective.

The plural of eisegesis is ''eisegeses'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|s|i:|z}}). An individual who practices eisegesis is known as an ''eisegete'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|t}}); this is also the verb form. The term "eisegete" is often used in a mildly derogatory fashion.

Although the terms ''eisegesis'' and ''[[exegesis]]'' are commonly heard in association with Biblical interpretations, both (and especially exegesis) are broadly used across literary disciplines.

==In Biblical study==
While [[exegesis]] is an attempt to determine the historical context within which a particular verse exists—the so-called "[[Sitz im Leben]]" or life setting—eisegetes often neglect this aspect of [[Bible |Biblical study]].

In the field of [[Biblical exegesis]], scholars take great care to avoid eisegesis. In this field, eisegesis is regarded as "poor exegesis".

In the field of ''biblical [[Prooftext |proof texts]]'', Christian theologians and missionaries are often accused of practicing eisegesis using isolated, out-of-context quotations from the Christian Bible to establish a proposition or to read Christ into the Hebrew Bible.

While some denominations and scholars denounce Biblical eisegesis, many Christians are known to employ it—albeit inadvertently—as part of their own experiential [[theology]]. Modern [[Evangelicalism |evangelical]] scholars accuse [[liberal Protestant]]s of practicing Biblical eisegesis, while [[Mainline (Protestant) |mainline]] scholars accuse [[Fundamentalist Christianity |fundamentalists]] of practicing eisegesis. [[Roman Catholic Church |Roman Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church |Orthodox Christians]] say that all [[Protestantism |Protestants]] engage in eisegesis, because the [[Bible]] can be correctly understood only through the lens of [[Holy Tradition]] as handed down by the institutional Church; this is articulated in the ''[[Dei verbum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dei verbum | chapter = III |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html| website= The Vatican |publisher= The Holy See |accessdate= 16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews, in turn, might assert that Christians practice eisegesis when they read the Old Testament as anticipating Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaiser, Jr.|Kaiser, W. C., Jr.]], ''The Majesty of God in the Old Testament: A Guide for Preaching and Teaching'' ([[Grand Rapids, MI]]: [[Baker Publishing Group |Baker Academic]], 2007), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=1fgSJLLanNIC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 16–17].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, M. [http://www.aish.com/sp/ph/Isaiah_53_The_Suffering_Servant.html "Isaiah 53: The Suffering Servant—Cutting Through the Distortions and Mistranslations of this Enigmatic Text"], Aish, May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In conducting Bible translation, translators have to make many exegetical decisions. Sometimes the decisions made by translators are criticized by those who disagree, and who characterize the work of the translators as involving "eisegesis". Some translators make their doctrinal distinctives clear in a preface, such as Stephen Reynolds in his [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], where he explained his belief that Christians should never drink alcohol, and translated accordingly. Such translators may be accused by some of eisegesis, but they have made their positions clear.

Exactly what constitutes eisegesis remains a source of debate among theologians, but most scholars agree about the importance of determining the authorial intentions. Determining the author's intent can often be difficult, especially for books which were written anonymously.

[[File:Electric motor.gif|thumb|Animation of an Electric motor.]]

An '''electric motor''' is an [[electric machine|electrical machine]] that converts [[electrical energy]] into [[mechanical energy]]. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's [[magnetic field]] and [[electrical conductor|winding currents]] to generate force in the form of [[rotation]]. Electric motors can be powered by [[direct current]] (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by [[alternating current]] (AC) sources, such as a power grid, [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] or electrical generators. An [[electric generator]] is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in the reverse direction, accepting mechanical energy (such as from flowing water) and converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy. 

Electric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, internal construction, application and type of motion output. In addition to AC versus DC types, motors may be [[brushed motor|brushed]] or [[brushless motor|brushless]], may be of various phase (see [[single-phase]], [[two-phase electric power|two-phase]], or [[three-phase]]), and may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. General-purpose motors with standard dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors are found in industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches. 

In certain applications, such as in [[regenerative braking]] with [[traction motor]]s, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.

Electric motors produce linear or rotary force ([[torque]]) and can be distinguished from devices such as magnetic [[Solenoid|solenoids]] and loudspeakers that convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical force, which are respectively referred to as actuators and transducers.

{{main|History of the electric motor}}

===Early motors===
[[File:Faraday magnetic rotation.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Faraday's electromagnetic experiment, 1821&lt;ref name="Faraday (1822)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faraday|first=Michael|title=On Some New Electro-Magnetical Motion, and on the Theory of Magnetism|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and the Arts|year=1822|volume=XII|pages=74–96 (§IX)|url=https://archive.org/details/quarterlyjournal12jour|accessdate=12 February 2013|publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first electric motors were simple [[electrostatic motor|electrostatic]] devices described in experiments by Scottish monk [[Andrew Gordon (Benedictine)|Andrew Gordon]] and American experimenter [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the 1740s.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Tom McInally, The Sixth Scottish University. The Scots Colleges Abroad: 1575 to 1799 (Brill, Leiden, 2012) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OLEG D. JEFIMENKO, Electrostatic Motors, Their History, Types, and Principles of Operation, Electret Scientific Company - 1973, page 22-45&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical principle behind them, [[Ampère's force law]], was discovered by [[André-Marie Ampère]] in 1820. The law described the production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] means was demonstrated by English scientist [[Michael Faraday]] in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a [[permanent magnet|permanent magnet (PM)]] was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire.&lt;ref name="SparkMuseum (Motor)"&gt;{{cite conference|title=The Development of the Electric Motor,|url=http://www.sparkmuseum.com/MOTORS.HTM|publisher=SparkMuseum|accessdate=12 February 2013|booktitle=Early Electric Motors|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306085840/http://www.sparkmuseum.com/MOTORS.HTM|archivedate=6 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, substituting [[brine]] for (toxic) mercury. Though [[Barlow's wheel]] was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar [[homopolar motor]]s remained unsuited to practical application until late in the century.

In 1827, [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[physicist]] [[Ányos Jedlik]] started experimenting with [[electromagnetic coil]]s. After Jedlik solved the technical problems of continuous rotation with the invention of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], he called his early devices "electromagnetic self-rotors". Although they were used only for teaching, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical [[Direct current|DC]] motors: the [[stator]], [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.&lt;ref name="Guillemin (1891)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guillemin|first=Amédée|trans-title=Electricity and Magnetism|year=1891|publisher=McMillan and Co.|title='Le Magnétisme et l'Électricitée'|others=trans., ed. &amp; rev. from the French by Sylvanus P.

===DC motors===
After many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus Prussian [[Moritz von Jacobi]] created the first real rotating electric motor in May 1834. It developed remarkable mechanical output power. His motor set a world record, which Jacobi improved four years later in September 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richter |first=Jan |title=Jacobi's Motor |publisher=Elektrotechnischen Instituts. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology |date=7 February 2013|accessdate= 14 May 2017 |url=https://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1382.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512221521/http://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1382.php |archivedate=2017-05-12 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; His second motor was powerful enough to drive a boat with 14 people across a wide river. It was also in 1839/40 that other developers managed to build motors with similar and then higher performance.

The first [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] {{visible anchor|DC electric motor}} capable of turning machinery was invented by British scientist [[William Sturgeon]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=William|others=|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|chapter=Sturgeon, William (1783–1850)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor was built by American inventor [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]], which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press.&lt;ref name="Garrison (1998)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Ervan G.|title=A History of Engineering and Technology: Artful Methods|year=1998|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5mvVElGudyYC}}|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-9810-X|edition=2nd|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of [[battery (electricity)|primary battery power]], the motors were commercially unsuccessful and bankrupted Davenport. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors, but all encountered the same battery cost issues. No [[Electric power distribution|electricity distribution]] system was available at the time. No practical commercial market emerged for these motors.&lt;ref name="Nye (1990)"&gt;{{cite book |title=Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/electrifying-america |year=1990 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-64030-5 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403044745/http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/electrifying-america |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, Jedlik built a device using similar principles to those used in his electromagnetic self-rotors that was capable of useful work.&lt;ref name="Guillemin (1891)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Electropaedia (home)" /&gt; He built a model [[electric vehicle]] that same year.&lt;ref name="Hungarianscience (Frankfurt)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition on the History of Hungarian Science|url=http://www.frankfurt.matav.hu/angol/magytud.htm|accessdate=13 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826080638/http://www.frankfurt.matav.hu/angol/magytud.htm|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major turning point came in 1864, when [[Antonio Pacinotti]] first described the ring armature. This featured symmetrically-grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a commutator, the brushes of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current.&lt;ref name="Antonio Pacinotti"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonio Pacinotti|url=http://ethw.org/Antonio_Pacinotti|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305154622/http://ethw.org/Antonio_Pacinotti|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=w0o5Ld53wAEC|page=164}}|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104232726/https://books.google.com/books?id=w0o5Ld53wAEC&amp;pg=PT164&amp;lpg=PT164&amp;dq=pacinotti+dc+motor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s9gxdk7Xb1&amp;sig=6bXaoWnI8s1M1SXb-cQl9KUtzLc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_-u_B75PLAhWBPpQKHTksCO8Q6AEIODAG#v=onepage&amp;q=pacinotti%20dc%20motor&amp;false|archivedate= 2018-01-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful DC motors followed the invention by [[Zénobe Gramme]] who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti's design. In 1873, Gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor, [[:fr:Hippolyte Fontaine#1873 : l'expérience décisive|which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in Vienna and Philadelphia]] by connecting two such DC motors up to 2&amp;nbsp;km from each other, using one as a generator.&lt;ref name="gamme"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/270.html|title=Zénobe Théophile Gramme|accessdate=2012-09-19|booktitle=Invent Now, Inc.

In 1886, [[Frank Julian Sprague]] invented the first practical DC motor, a non-sparking device that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads. Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by [[Thomas Edison]]), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided control systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887–88 in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently-powered centrally-controlled cars. The latter were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the [[South Side Elevated Railroad]], where it became popularly known as the "[[Chicago "L"|L]]". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of an air gap between the rotor and stator. Efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap.&lt;ref name="Ganot (1881)"&gt;

Electric motors revolutionized industry. Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead, every machine could be equipped with its own power source, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors consume more than half of the electric energy produced in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/pdfs/mc-0382.pdf|title=Buying an Energy-Efficient Electric Motor - Fact Sheet|publisher=USDoE|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902144422/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/pdfs/mc-0382.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC motors===

In 1888, Tesla presented his paper ''A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers'' to the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE]] that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting [[reluctance motor]], another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting [[induction motor]], and the third a true [[synchronous motor]] with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding.

One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. [[George Westinghouse]] promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned [[Charles F. Scott (engineer)|C. F. Scott]] to help Tesla; however, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.&lt;ref name="Vuckovic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris (EBE)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography of Galileo Ferraris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neidhofer (2007)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pansini (1989)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alger|first=P.L.|last2=Arnold z|first2=R.E.|title=The History of Induction Motors in America|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|year=1976|volume=64|issue=9|pages=1380–1383|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10329}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klooster (2009)"&gt;

Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb [[transformer]] in 1890.

[[Benjamin G. Lamme|B. G. Lamme]] later developed a rotating bar winding rotor.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt;

The [[General Electric Company]] began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt; By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the [[squirrel-cage rotor]].&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt; Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100-[[horsepower|horsepower (HP)]] induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt;

==Components==
[[File:Stator and rotor by Zureks.JPG|thumb|right|Electric motor rotor (left) and stator (right)]]

===Rotor===
{{main|Rotor (electric)}}
In an electric motor, the moving part is the rotor, which turns the shaft to deliver the mechanical power. The rotor usually has conductors laid into it that carry currents, which interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft. Alternatively, some rotors carry permanent magnets, and the stator holds the conductors.

===Bearings===
The rotor is supported by [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], which allow the rotor to turn on its axis.  The bearings are in turn supported by the motor housing.  The motor shaft extends through the bearings to the outside of the motor, where the load is applied.  Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be ''overhung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How belt drives impact overhung load |publisher=Gates Corporation |date=2017 |url=http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222054609/http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stator===
{{main|Stator}}
The stator is the stationary part of the motor’s electromagnetic circuit and usually consists of either windings or permanent magnets. The stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets, called laminations. Laminations are used to reduce energy losses that would result if a solid core were used.

===Air gap===
The distance between the rotor and stator is called the air gap. The air gap has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong negative effect on performance. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate.  The magnetizing current increases with the air gap. For this reason, the air gap should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.

[[File:Salient-pole rotor.png|thumb|right|Salient-pole rotor]]

===Windings===
{{main|Windings}}
Windings are wires that are laid in [[electromagnetic coil|coils]], usually wrapped around a laminated soft iron [[magnetic core]] so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current.

Electric machines come in two basic magnet field pole configurations: ''salient-'' and ''nonsalient-pole'' configurations. In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face.

Some motors have conductors that consist of thicker metal, such as bars or sheets of metal, usually [[copper]], alternatively [[aluminum]]. These are usually powered by [[electromagnetic induction]].

===Commutator===
{{main|Commutator (electric)}}
[[File:Tiny motor windings - commutator - brushes in Zip Zaps toy R-C car.jpg|thumb|A toy's small DC motor with its commutator]]
A [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] is a mechanism used to [[switch]] the input of most DC machines and certain AC machines. It consists of slip-ring segments insulated from each other and from the shaft. The motor's armature current is supplied through stationary [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal, and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] rotates from pole to pole.{{sfn|Hameyer|2001|p=  62}}&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, §83, p. 812&lt;/ref&gt; In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of improved technologies in the electronic-controller, sensorless-control, induction-motor, and permanent-magnet-motor fields, externally-commutated induction and [[permanent-magnet motor]]s are displacing electromechanically-commutated motors.

==Motor supply and control==

===Motor supply===
A DC motor is usually supplied through slip ring commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation can be either slip ring commutator or externally commutated type, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. [[Universal motor]]s can run on either AC or DC.

===Motor control===
Fixed-speed controlled AC motors are provided with direct-on-line or soft-start starters.

Variable-speed controlled AC motors are provided with a range of different [[power inverter]], [[variable-frequency drive]] or electronic commutator technologies.

The term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated [[brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] and [[switched reluctance motor]] applications.

==Major categories==
Electric motors operate on three different physical principles: [[magnetism]], [[electrostatic motor|electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectric motor|piezoelectricity]]. By far, the most common is magnetism.

In magnetic motors, magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields gives rise to a force, and thus a torque on the motor shaft. One, or both, of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.

The main types are DC motors and AC motors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=

Once started, a synchronous motor requires synchronism with the moving magnetic field's synchronous speed for all normal torque conditions.

In synchronous machines, the magnetic field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets.

A [[fractional-horsepower motor|fractional-horsepower (FHP)]] motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower (0.746&amp;nbsp;kW), or is manufactured with a standard-frame size smaller than a standard 1 HP motor. Many household and industrial motors are in the fractional-horsepower class.

==Self-commutated motor==

===Brushed DC motor===
{{main|DC motor}}
By definition, all self-commutated DC motors run on DC electric power. Most DC motors are small permanent magnet (PM) types. They contain a [[Brush (electric)|brushed]] internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings' current in synchronism with rotation.&lt;ref name="Weiβmantel (2008)"&gt;{{cite book|first=H|last =Weiβmantel|author2=Oesingmann, P. |author3=Möckel, A. |title=§2.1 Motors with Commutator in Chapter 2 - Motors with Continuous Rotation|pages=13–160}} in {{harvnb|Stölting|Kallenbach|Amrhein|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrically excited DC motor====
{{Main|Brushed DC electric motor}}
[[File:Electric motor cycle 2.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Workings of a brushed electric motor with a two-pole rotor and PM stator. ("N" and "S" designate polarities on the inside faces of the magnets; the outside faces have opposite polarities.)]]
A commutated DC motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.

The rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, [[soft magnetic material|magnetically "soft"]] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an [[electromagnet]]). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.

Many of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the [[inductance]] of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their [[resistivity]], limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates [[electrical noise]]; sparking generates [[Radio frequency interference|RFI]]. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.

While most commutators are cylindrical, some are flat discs consisting of several segments (typically, at least three) mounted on an insulator.

Large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.

DC machines are defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Dorf (1997)"&gt;{{cite conference|editor-last=Dorf|editor-first=Richard C.

There are five types of brushed DC motor:-
* DC shunt-wound motor
* DC series-wound motor
* DC compound motor (two configurations):
** Cumulative compound
** Differentially compounded
* PM DC motor (not shown)
* Separately excited (not shown).

====Permanent magnet DC motor====
{{main|Permanent-magnet electric motor}}
A PM (permanent magnet) motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the "dynamo" type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.

To minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with [[neodymium]] or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed [[#Singly fed electric motor|singly-fed]] synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.

===Electronic commutator (EC) motor===

====Brushless DC motor====
{{Main|Brushless DC electric motor}}
Some of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in the BLDC design. In this motor, the mechanical "rotating switch" or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor's position. BLDC motors are typically 85–90% efficient or more. Efficiency for a BLDC motor of up to 96.5% have been reported,&lt;ref name="Nozawa (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nozawa|first=Tetsuo (2009)|title=Tokai University Unveils 100W DC Motor with 96% Efficiency|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|publisher=Tech-On -- Nikkei Electronics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101131311/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|archivedate=2011-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas DC motors with brushgear are typically 75–80% efficient.

The BLDC motor's characteristic trapezoidal [[counter-electromotive force]] (CEMF) waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from the placement of the rotor's permanent magnets. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use [[Hall effect sensor]]s mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost [[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control]] of the electronic commutator.

BLDC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary, as in computer disk drives or in video cassette recorders, the spindles within CD, CD-ROM (etc.) drives, and mechanisms within office products, such as fans, laser printers and photocopiers. They have several advantages over conventional motors:
* Compared to AC fans using shaded-pole motors, they are very efficient, running much cooler than the equivalent AC motors. This cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan's bearings.
* Without a commutator to wear out, the life of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a DC motor using brushes and a commutator. Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a commutator or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.
* The same Hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also provide a convenient [[tachometer]] signal for closed-loop control (servo-controlled) applications. In fans, the tachometer signal can be used to derive a "fan OK" signal as well as provide running speed feedback.
* The motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external clock, leading to precise speed control.
* BLDC motors have no chance of sparking, unlike brushed motors, making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels. Also, sparking generates ozone, which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings risking harm to occupants' health.
* BLDC motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to get rid of unwanted heat.
* They are also acoustically very quiet motors, which is an advantage if being used in equipment that is affected by vibrations.
Modern BLDC motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors up to about 100&amp;nbsp;kW rating are used in electric vehicles. They also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft.

====Switched reluctance motor====
[[File:Switched reluctance motor 6-4.svg|thumb|right|6/4 pole switched reluctance motor]]
{{Main|Switched reluctance motor}}

The SRM has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents.
Instead, torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator.
The rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field.

The magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the rotor turns, different windings will be energized, keeping the rotor turning.

SRMs are used in some appliances&lt;ref name="Bush (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Steve (2009) |title=Dyson vacuums 104,000&amp;nbsp;rpm brushless DC technology |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |publisher=Electronics Weekly Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411205153/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |archivedate=2012-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/11/tesla-model-3-motor-in-depth/|title=Tesla Model 3 Motor — Everything I've Been Able To Learn About It (Welcome To The Machine) {{!}} CleanTechnica|last=|first=|date=March 11, 2018|website=cleantechnica.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal AC/DC motor===
{{main|Universal motor}}
[[File:Universalmotor 3.JPG|thumb|Modern low-cost universal motor, from a vacuum cleaner. Field windings are dark copper-colored, toward the back, on both sides. The rotor's laminated core is gray metallic, with dark slots for winding the coils. The commutator (partly hidden) has become dark from use; it is toward the front. The large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes (both sides), as well as the front motor bearing.]]
A commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.

Operating at normal [[utility frequency|power line frequencies]], universal motors are often found in a range less than {{nowrap|1000 watts}}. Universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in [[Railway electrification system#Low-frequency alternating current|electric railways]]. In this application, the use of AC to power a motor originally designed to run on DC would lead to efficiency losses due to [[eddy current]] heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron and they are now rarely used.

An advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to [[TRIAC#Application|electronic speed control]] and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.

Whereas SCIMs cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency, universal motors can run at much higher speeds. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed {{nowrap|10,000 rpm}}, while many similar miniature grinders exceed {{nowrap|30,000 rpm}}.

==Externally commutated AC machine==
{{Main|AC motor}}

The design of AC induction and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC to produce a rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.

===Induction motor===
{{Main|Induction motor}}

[[File:Elliott-Motor.jpg|thumb|Large 4,500 HP AC Induction Motor.]]

====Cage and wound rotor induction motor====
An induction motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An induction motor resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.

Induction motors may be further divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors and [[Wound rotor motor|Wound Rotor Induction Motors]] (WRIMs). SCIMs have a heavy winding made up of solid bars, usually aluminum or copper, joined by rings at the ends of the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.

Currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.

In a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to [[slip ring]]s on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.

The WRIM is used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.

Motor speed can be changed because the torque curve of the motor is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque will be further reduced.

When used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.

====Torque motor====
{{main|Torque motor}}
A torque motor is a specialized form of electric motor that can operate indefinitely while stalled, that is, with the rotor blocked from turning, without incurring damage. In this mode of operation, the motor will apply a steady torque to the load (hence the name).

A common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.

Another common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion [[engine]] in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.

===Synchronous motor===
{{Main|Synchronous motor}}

A synchronous electric motor is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.

Finally, hysteresis synchronous motors typically are (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it act like a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The rotor material, like that of a common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.

Low-power synchronous timing motors (such as those for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole permanent magnet external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque. ''Telechron'' clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque, and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor.

===Doubly-fed electric machine===
{{Main|Doubly-fed electric machine}}

Doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) power to the energy conversion process, with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as [[singly-fed electric machine]]s, which have only one active winding set.

A doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.&lt;ref name="Lander (1993)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Lander|first=Cyril W.|title=§9–8 'Slip Ring Induction Motor Control' in Chapter 9 - A.C.

==Special magnetic motors==

===Rotary===

====Ironless or coreless rotor motor====
[[File:Miniature Coreless DC Motor.jpg|thumb|A miniature coreless motor]]
Nothing in the principle of any of the motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the ''coreless or ironless DC motor'', a specialized form of a permanent magnet DC motor.&lt;ref name="Weiβmantel (2008)"/&gt; Optimized for rapid [[acceleration]], these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.

Because the rotor is much lighter in weight (mass) than a conventional rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations, the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical [[time constant]] under one ms. This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air. Overheating might be an issue for coreless DC motor designs. Modern software, such as [[Motor-CAD]], can help to increase the thermal efficiency of motors while still in the design stage.

Among these types are the disc-rotor types, described in more detail in the next section.

The [[vibrating alert]] of cellular phones is sometimes generated by tiny cylindrical permanent-magnet field types, but there are also disc-shaped types that have a thin multipolar disc field magnet, and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils. Metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils.

Related limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin permanent magnets. These are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk ("hard disk") drives. Although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers, it is still loosely (and incorrectly) referred to as a "voice coil" structure, because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines, and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker.

====Pancake or axial rotor motor====
The printed armature or pancake motor has the windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets. The magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor with space in between to form an axial air gap.&lt;ref name="Krishnan (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=R.|title=Selection Criteria for Servo Motor Drives|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications|date=March 1987|volume=IA-23|issue=2|pages=270–275|doi=10.1109/TIA.1987.4504902|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4504902&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Ddesc_p_Publication_Year%26searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dpancake+DC+motor|accessdate=26 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515051920/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4504902&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Ddesc_p_Publication_Year%26searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dpancake+DC+motor|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its flat profile. The technology has had many brand names since its inception, such as ServoDisc.

The printed armature (originally formed on a printed circuit board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc. The printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in that it does not have a separate ring commutator. The brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact.

An alternative manufacturing method is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate, mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180&amp;nbsp;°C, Class H rating.

The unique advantage of ironless DC motors is the absence of [[Cogging torque|cogging]] (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (&gt;40&amp;nbsp;kHz) or DC because of decreased [[electromagnetic induction]].

These motors were originally invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic tape drives, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.

Another approach (Magnax) is to use a single stator sandwiched between two rotors. One such design has produced peak power of 15 kW/kg, sustained power around 7.5 kW/kg. This yokeless axial flux motor offers a shorter flux path, keeping the magnets further from the axis. The design allows zero winding overhang; 100 percent of the windings are active. This is enhanced with the use of rectangular-section copper wire. The motors can be stacked to work in parallel. Instabilities are minimized by ensuring that the two rotor discs put equal and opposing forces onto the stator disc. The rotors are connected directly to one another via a shaft ring, cancelling out the magnetic forces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/magnax-axial-flux-electric-motor/54821|title=Magnax prepares to manufacture radically high-powered, compact axial flux electric motor|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=May 30, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnax motors range in size from {{Convert|.15-5.4|m|}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Servo motor ====
{{Main|Servo motor}}
A servomotor is a motor, very often sold as a complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor permanent magnet synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.&lt;ref name="Krishnan (1987)"/&gt;

A servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running. A stepper system inherently operates open-loop - relying on the motor not to "miss steps" for short term accuracy - with any feedback such as a "home" switch or position encoder being external to the motor system.&lt;ref name="Patrick (1997)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Patrick|first=Dale R.|author2=Fardo, Stephen W.|booktitle=Rotating Electrical Machines and Power Systems|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Fairmont Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88173-239-9|title=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.

====Stepper motor====
{{Main|Stepper motor}}
[[File:Stepper motor.svg|thumb|A stepper motor with a soft iron rotor, with active windings shown. In 'A' the active windings tend to hold the rotor in position. In 'B' a different set of windings are carrying a current, which generates torque and rotation.]]
Stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing permanent magnets or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.

Simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to "cog" to a limited number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly. This mode of operation is often called [[stepper motor#Microstepping|microstepping]]. Computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a digital [[servomechanism|servo-controlled]] system.

Stepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term "voice coil" in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.)

Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.

So-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors; they have one coil, draw very little power, and have a permanent magnet rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepping motor.

Closely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs are classified as variable reluctance motor type.{{Sfn|Bose|2006|pp=569–570, 891}} Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and [[Numerical control|computer numerical control (CNC)]] machines such as routers, plasma cutters and CNC lathes.

===Linear motor===
{{Main|Linear motor}}
A linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been "unrolled" so that, instead of producing a [[torque]] (rotation), it produces a straight-line force along its length.

Linear motors are most commonly [[linear induction motor|induction motors]] or stepper motors. Linear motors are commonly found in many roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail. They are also used in [[maglev train]]s, where the train "flies" over the ground. On a smaller scale, the 1978 era HP 7225A pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the X and Y axes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenoglio|first=John A.|author2=Chin, Bessie W.

==Electromagnetism==
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}

===Force and torque===
The fundamental purpose of the vast majority of the world's electric motors is to electromagnetically induce relative movement in an air gap between a stator and rotor to produce useful torque or linear force.

According to [[Lorentz force law#Force on a current-carrying wire|Lorentz force law]] the force of a winding conductor can be given simply by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I \boldsymbol{\ell} \times \mathbf{B} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or more generally, to handle conductors with any geometry:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
The most general approaches to calculating the forces in motors use tensors.&lt;ref name="Kirtley (2005)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Kirtley|first=James L., Jr.|booktitle=6.6585 - Electric Machines|title=Class Notes 1: Electromagnetic Forces|publisher=MIT Dept of Electrical Engineering|accessdate=15 March 2013|url=http://web.mit.edu/course/6/6.685/www/chapter1.pdf|year=2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104210907/http://web.mit.edu/course/6/6.685/www/chapter1.pdf|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power===
Where [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] is shaft speed and T is [[torque]], a motor's mechanical power output P&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; is given by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/46|title = DC Motor Calculations, part 1|date = 30 November 2011|publisher = National Instruments|accessdate = 7 December 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012234329/http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/46|archivedate = 12 October 2007|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

in British units with T expressed in foot-pounds,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = \frac {rpm \times T}{5252}&lt;/math&gt; (horsepower), and,
in [[International System of Units|SI units]] with shaft [[Angular frequency|angular speed]] expressed in radians per second, and T expressed in newton-meters,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = {angular speed \times T}&lt;/math&gt; (watts).

For a linear motor, with force F expressed in newtons and velocity v expressed in meters per second,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = F\times{v}&lt;/math&gt; (watts).

In an asynchronous or induction motor, the relationship between motor speed and air gap power is, neglecting [[skin effect]], given by the following:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{airgap}=\frac{R_r}{s} * I_r^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, where
::R&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; - rotor resistance
::I&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - square of current induced in the rotor
::s - motor slip; i.e., difference between synchronous speed and slip speed, which provides the relative movement needed for current induction in the rotor.

===Back emf===
{{Main|Electromotive force}}
Since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, they have a voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called "[[electromotive force|back electromotive force (emf)]]". The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.&lt;ref name="Dwight (1949)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwight|first=Herbert B.|last2=Fink |first2=D. G.|title=§27 to §35A Electromagnetic Induction of EMF in Sec. 2 - Electric and Magnetic Circuits|pages=36–41}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back emf source within the machine; as an example, this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs.&lt;ref name="Dwight (1949)"/&gt;

===Losses===
[[Losses in electrical systems|Motor losses]] are mainly due to [[Joule heating|resistive losses]] in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.

Losses also occur in commutation, mechanical commutators spark, and electronic commutators and also dissipate heat.

===Efficiency===
To calculate a motor's efficiency, the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{P_m}{P_e}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is [[energy conversion efficiency]], &lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; is electrical input power, and &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; is mechanical output power:

:&lt;math&gt;P_e = I V&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_m = T \omega&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is input voltage, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is input current, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is output torque, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is output angular velocity. It is possible to derive analytically the point of maximum efficiency. It is typically at less than 1/2 the [[stall torque]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced and implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher-efficiency electric motors.

===Goodness factor===
{{main|Goodness factor}}
[[Eric Laithwaite]]&lt;ref name=Laithwaite&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laithwaite|first=E.R.|title=Linear electric machines - A personal view|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=February 1975|volume=63|issue=2|pages=250–290|doi=10.1109/PROC.1975.9734|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1451664&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DLinear+Electric+Machines-+A+Personal+View|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515032704/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1451664&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DLinear+Electric+Machines-+A+Personal+View|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a metric to determine the 'goodness' of an electric motor:&lt;ref name="Patterson (2003)"&gt;{{cite conference|title=The "Goodness" of Small Contemporary Permanent Magnet Electric Machines|last=Patterson|first=D.

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac {\omega} {resistance \times reluctance} = \frac {\omega \mu \sigma A_m A_e} {l_m l_e}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the goodness factor (factors above 1 are likely to be efficient)
:&lt;math&gt;A_m, A_e&lt;/math&gt; are the cross sectional areas of the magnetic and electric circuit
:&lt;math&gt;l_m, l_e&lt;/math&gt; are the lengths of the magnetic and electric circuits
:&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of the core
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency the motor is driven at

From this, he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to have relatively large magnetic poles. However, the equation only directly relates to non PM motors.

==Performance parameters==

===Torque capability of motor types===
{{generalize|section|date=March 2012}}
All the electromagnetic motors, and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.

Once this is done a figure relating the current to the torque can be used as a useful parameter for motor selection. The maximum torque for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be only usable until thermal considerations take precedence.

When optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic core saturation]] or safe [[operating temperature]] rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.

Capacity for bursts of torque should not be confused with field weakening capability. Field weakening allows an electric machine to operate beyond the designed frequency of excitation. Field weakening is done when the maximum speed cannot be reached by increasing the applied voltage. This applies to only motors with current controlled fields and therefore cannot be achieved with permanent magnet motors.

Electric machines without a transformer circuit topology, such as that of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless. Furthermore, the permanent magnet assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged, if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted.

Electric machines with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.

Electric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Still, bursts of torque that are two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.

The brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port).&lt;ref name="Klatt (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klatt|first=Frederick W.|title=Sensorless Real Time Control (RTC): Brushless Wound-Rotor [Synchronous] Doubly-Fed Machine|journal=Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives -SLED 2012|date=September 2012|doi=10.1109/SLED.2012.6422811|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.

===Continuous torque density===
The continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or permanent magnet damage.

Other sources state that various e-machine topologies have differing torque density.  One source shows the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BYkwEsmHqKYCPropulsion|page=68}}|title=Propulsion Systems for Hybrid Vehicles|last=Miller|first=John M.|date=2008|publisher=IET|year=|isbn=9780863419157|location=|pages=68, 69|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous power density===
The continuous power density is determined by the product of the continuous torque density and the constant torque speed range of the electric machine.

==Acoustic noise and vibrations==
Acoustic noise and vibrations of electric motors are usually classified in three sources:
* mechanical sources (e.g. due to [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]])
* aerodynamic sources (e.g. due to shaft-mounted [[fan (machine)|fans]])
* magnetic sources (e.g. due to magnetic forces such as [[Maxwell stress tensor|Maxwell]] and [[magnetostriction]] forces acting on stator and rotor structures)
The latter source, which can be responsible for the "whining noise" of electric motors, is called [[electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise and vibration|electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise]].

==Non-magnetic motors==
{{Main|Electrostatic motor|Piezoelectric motor|Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion}}

An electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge. Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although very small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Today, the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems ([[MEMS]]) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. Also, the molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric material]] when an [[electric field]] is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or [[ultrasonic motor|ultrasonic]] vibrations to produce linear or rotary motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IdCg2dDZQr8C|page=38}}|title=Ultra-fast Material Metrology|last=Horn|first=Alexander|date=2009-07-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527627936|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shafik|first1=Amro|last2=Ben Mrad|first2=Ridha|title=Nanopositioning Technologies: Fundamentals and Applications|date=2016|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-23853-1|page=39|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23853-1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates |date=September 2017}}
'''Evolvability''' is defined as the capacity of a system for adaptive [[evolution]]. Evolvability is the ability of a population of organisms to not merely generate [[genetic diversity]], but to generate ''[[adaptation |adaptive]]'' genetic diversity, and thereby evolve through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Colegrave N, Collins S |title=Experimental evolution: experimental evolution and evolvability |journal=Heredity |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=464–70 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18212804 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6801095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.15.8420 |vauthors=Kirschner M, Gerhart J |title=Evolvability |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=15 |pages=8420–8427 |year=1998 |pmid=9671692 |pmc=33871|bibcode=1998PNAS...95.8420K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altenberg 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/3-540-59046-3_11 |author=Altenberg, Lee |title=Genome growth and the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/yl347l100328g5g6/ |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=899 |pages=205–259 |year=1995|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn=978-3-540-59046-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a biological organism to evolve by natural selection, there must be a certain minimum probability that new, heritable variants are beneficial. Random [[mutation]]s, unless they occur in [[Non-coding DNA|DNA sequences with no function]], are expected to be mostly detrimental. Beneficial mutations are always rare, but if they are too rare, then [[adaptation]] cannot occur. Early failed efforts to evolve computer programs by random mutation and selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Friedberg RM |title=A Learning Machine: Part I &amp;#124; |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–13 |year=1958 |doi=10.1147/rd.21.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that evolvability is not a given, but depends on the representation{{clarify|date=October 2018}} of the program{{clarify|date=September 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor= Kinnear, Kenneth |author=Altenberg, Lee |title=The evolution of evolvability in genetic programming |url=http://dynamics.org/Altenberg/PAPERS/EEGP/ |journal=Advances in Genetic Programming |pages=47–74 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, the evolvability of organisms depends on their [[Genetic architecture|genotype–phenotype]] map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2410639 |pmid=28565291 |vauthors=Wagner GP, Altenberg L |title=Complex adaptations and the evolution of evolvability |journal=Evolution |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=967–976 |year=1996 |jstor=2410639}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that [[genome]]s are structured in ways that make beneficial changes less unlikely. This has been taken as evidence that evolution has created not just fitter organisms, but populations of organisms that are better able to evolve.

== Alternative definitions ==

[[Andreas Wagner]]&lt;ref name="Wagner 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wagner A |title=Robustness and evolvability in living systems |publisher=Princeton University Press |series=Princeton Studies in Complexity |year=2005 | isbn=0-691-12240-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes two definitions of evolvability. According to the first definition, a biological system is evolvable:
* if its properties show heritable genetic variation, and
* if natural selection can thus change these properties.

According to the second definition, a biological system is evolvable:
* if it can acquire novel functions through genetic change, functions that help the organism survive and reproduce.

For example, consider an [[enzyme]] with multiple [[alleles]] in the population. Each allele catalyzes the same reaction, but with a different level of activity. However, even after millions of years of evolution, exploring many sequences with similar function, no mutation might exist that gives this enzyme the ability to catalyze a different reaction. Thus, although the enzyme's activity is evolvable in the first sense, that does not mean that the enzyme's function is evolvable in the second sense. However, every system evolvable in the second sense must also be evolvable in the first.

[[Massimo Pigliucci |Pigliucci]]&lt;ref name="Pigliucci 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pigliucci M |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci |title=Is evolvability evolvable? |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=75–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18059367 |doi=10.1038/nrg2278}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes three classes of definition, depending on timescale. The first corresponds to Wagner's first, and represents the very short timescales that are described by [[quantitative genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1732160 |pmc=1204793 |year=1992 |author1=Houle |first1=D |title=Comparing evolvability and variability of quantitative traits |journal=Genetics |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=195–204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11692-011-9127-6 |title=Heritability is not Evolvability |journal=Evolutionary Biology |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=258 |year=2011 |last1=Hansen |first1=Thomas F |last2=Pélabon |first2=Christophe |last3=Houle |first3=David }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He divides Wagner's second definition into two categories, one representing the intermediate timescales that can be studied using [[population genetics]], and one representing exceedingly rare long-term innovations of form.

[[Massimo Pigliucci |Pigliucci]]'s second definition of evolvability includes Altenberg's&lt;ref name="Altenberg 1994" /&gt; quantitative concept of evolvability, being not a single number, but the entire upper tail of the fitness distribution of the offspring produced by the population. This quantity was considered a "local" property of the instantaneous state of a population, and its integration over the population's evolutionary trajectory, and over many possible populations, would be necessary to give a more global measure of evolvability.

==Generating more variation==
More heritable phenotypic variation means more evolvability. While mutation is the ultimate source of heritable variation, its permutations and combinations also make a big difference. Sexual reproduction generates more variation (and thereby evolvability) relative to asexual reproduction (see [[evolution of sexual reproduction]]). Evolvability is further increased by generating more variation when an organism is stressed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ram |first=Yoav |author2=Hadany, Lilach |title=THE EVOLUTION OF STRESS-INDUCED HYPERMUTATION IN ASEXUAL POPULATIONS |journal=Evolution |year=2012 |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=2315–2328 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01576.x |pmid=22759304}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus likely to be less well adapted, but less variation when an organism is doing well. The amount of variation generated can be adjusted in many different ways, for example via the [[mutation rate]], via the probability of [[sexual reproduction |sexual]] vs. [[asexual reproduction]], via the probability of [[outcrossing]] vs. [[inbreeding]], via [[biological dispersal |dispersal]], and via access to previously cryptic variants through the switching of an [[evolutionary capacitance |evolutionary capacitor]]. A large population size increases the influx of novel mutations each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karasov |first=Talia |author2=Messer, Philipp W. |author3=Petrov, Dmitri A. |author4= Malik, Harmit S. |title=Evidence that Adaptation in Drosophila Is Not Limited by Mutation at Single Sites |journal=PLoS Genetics |date=June 17, 2010 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e1000924 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000924|pmid=20585551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enhancement of selection==
Rather than creating more phenotypic variation, some mechanisms increase the intensity and effectiveness with which selection acts on existing phenotypic variation.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt; For example:

* Mating rituals that allow [[sexual selection]] on "good genes", and so intensify [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;
* Large [[effective population size]] increasing the threshold value of the [[selection coefficient]] above which selection becomes an important player. This could happen through an increase in the census population size, decreasing [[genetic drift]], through an increase in the recombination rate, decreasing [[genetic draft]], or through changes in the probability distribution of the numbers of offspring..&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;
* Recombination decreasing the importance of the [[Hill-Robertson effect]], where different genotypes contain different adaptive mutations. Recombination brings the two alleles together, creating a super-genotype in place of two competing lineages..&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;
* Shorter generation time.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;

== Robustness and evolvability ==
{{further|Mutational robustness}}

The relationship between robustness and evolvability depends on whether recombination can be ignored.&lt;ref name="Masel 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2010.06.002 |author1=Masel J |author1link=Joanna Masel |author2=Trotter MV |title=Robustness and evolvability |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=406–414 |year=2010 |pmid=20598394 |pmc=3198833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombination can generally be ignored in asexual populations and for traits affected by single genes.

=== Without recombination ===

[[Mutational robustness|Robustness in the face of mutation]] does not increase evolvability in the first sense. In organisms with a high level of robustness, mutations have smaller phenotypic effects than in organisms with a low level of robustness. Thus, robustness reduces the amount of heritable genetic variation on which selection can act. However, robustness may allow exploration of large regions of [[fitness landscape |genotype space]], increasing evolvability according to the second sense.&lt;ref name="Wagner 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masel 2010" /&gt; Even without genetic diversity, some genotypes have higher evolvability than others, and selection for robustness can increase the "neighborhood richness" of phenotypes that can be accessed from the same starting genotype by mutation. For example, one reason many proteins are less robust to mutation is that they have marginal [[Protein folding|thermodynamic stability]], and most mutations reduce this stability further. Proteins that are more thermostable can tolerate a wider range of mutations and are more evolvable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bloom JD, Labthavikul ST, Otey, CR, Arnold FH |title=Protein stability promotes evolvability |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=15 |pages=5869–5874 |year=2006 |pmid=16581913 |pmc=1458665 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510098103 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/15/5869|bibcode=2006PNAS..103.5869B }}&lt;/ref&gt; For polygenic traits, neighborhood richness contributes more to evolvability than does genetic diversity or "spread" across genotype space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rajon |first=E |author2=Masel, J |author2link=Joanna Masel |title=Compensatory Evolution and the Origins of Innovations |journal=Genetics |date=January 18, 2013 |volume=193 |issue=4 |pages=1209–1220 |doi=10.1534/genetics.112.148627 |pmid=23335336 |pmc=3606098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With recombination ===
Temporary robustness, or [[canalisation (genetics) |canalisation]], may lead to the accumulation of significant quantities of cryptic genetic variation. In a new environment or genetic background, this variation may be [[evolutionary capacitance |revealed]] and sometimes be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Masel 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Whitacre and Bender | title=Degeneracy: a design principle for achieving robustness and evolvability | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=2010 | volume=263 | issue=1 | pages=143–153 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=19925810 | accessdate=2011-03-11 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.11.008 | last2=Bender | first2=Axel | pmid=19925810| arxiv=0907.0510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploration ahead of time ==
When [[mutational robustness]] exists, many mutants will persist in a cryptic state. Mutations tend to fall into two categories, having either a very bad effect or very little effect: few mutations fall somewhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eyre-Walker A, Keightley, PD |title=The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=610–618 |year=2007 |pmid=17637733 |doi=10.1038/nrg2146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fudala A, Korona R | title=Low frequency of mutations with strongly deleterious but nonlethal fitness effects | journal=Evolution | year=2009 |volume=63 | issue=8 | pages=2164–2171 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00713.x | pmid=19473394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, these mutations will not be completely invisible, but still have rare effects, with very low [[penetrance]]. When this happens, natural selection weeds out the very bad mutations, while leaving the others relatively unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Masel | first=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel |title=Cryptic Genetic Variation Is Enriched for Potential Adaptations | journal=Genetics | volume=172 | issue=3 | pages=1985–1991 | publisher=[[Genetics Society of America]] | location= | date=March 2006 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?&amp;artid=1456269 | doi=10.1534/genetics.105.051649 | id= | accessdate = | pmid=16387877 | pmc=1456269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rajon E |author2=Masel J |author2link=Joanna Masel | title=Evolution of molecular error rates and the consequences for evolvability | journal=PNAS | year=2011 |volume=108 | issue=3 | pages=1082–1087 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1012918108 | pmid=21199946 | pmc=3024668 |bibcode=2011PNAS..108.1082R }}&lt;/ref&gt; While evolution has no "foresight" to know which environment will be encountered in the future, some mutations cause major disruption to a basic biological process, and will never be adaptive in any environment. Screening these out in advance leads to [[preadaptation |preadapted]] stocks of cryptic genetic variation.

Another way that phenotypes can be explored, prior to strong genetic commitment, is through learning. An organism that learns gets to "sample" several different phenotypes during its early development, and later sticks to whatever worked best. Later in evolution, the optimal phenotype can be [[genetic assimilation |genetically assimilated]] so it becomes the default behavior rather than a rare behavior. This is known as the [[Baldwin effect]], and it can increase evolvability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hinton GE, Nowlan SJ | title=How learning can guide evolution | journal=Complex Systems | volume=1 |pages=495–502 | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01125.x |vauthors=Borenstein E, Meilijson I, Ruppin E | title=The effect of phenotypic plasticity on evolution in multipeaked fitness landscapes | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=19 |issue=5 | pages=1555–1570 | year=2006 |pmid=16910985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning biases phenotypes in a beneficial direction. But an exploratory flattening of the [[fitness landscape]] can also increase evolvability even when it has no direction, for example when the flattening is a result of random errors in molecular and/or developmental processes. This increase in evolvability can happen when evolution is faced with crossing a "valley" in an [[fitness landscape |adaptive landscape]]. This means that two mutations exist that are deleterious by themselves, but beneficial in combination. These combinations can evolve more easily when the landscape is first flattened, and the discovered phenotype is then fixed by [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00166.x | author=Kim Y | title=Rate of adaptive peak shifts with partial genetic robustness | journal=Evolution | volume=61 | issue=8 | pages=1847–1856 |year=2007 | pmid=17683428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitehead DJ, Wilke CO, Vernazobres D, Bornberg-Bauer E | title=The look-ahead effect of phenotypic mutations | journal=Biology Direct | volume=3 | pages=18 |year=2008 | pmid=18479505 | pmc=2423361 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-3-18 |url=http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/18 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Griswold CK, Masel J | title=Complex Adaptations Can Drive the Evolution of the Capacitor PSI+, Even with Realistic Rates of Yeast Sex | journal=PLoS Genetics | volume=5 | issue=6 | pages=e1000517 | year=2009 | pmid=19521499 | pmc=2686163 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000517 |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000517 | editor1-last=Úbeda | editor1-first=Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modularity==
If every mutation affected every trait, then a mutation that was an improvement for one trait would be a disadvantage for other traits. This means that almost no mutations would be beneficial overall. But if [[pleiotropy]] is restricted to within functional [[modularity |modules]], then mutations affect only one trait at a time, and adaptation is much less constrained. In a modular gene network, for example, a gene that induces a limited set of other genes that control a specific trait under selection may evolve more readily than one that also induces other gene pathways controlling traits not under selection.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olson-Manning |first=Carrie |author2=MR Wagner |author3=T Mitchell-Olds |title=Adaptive evolution: Evaluating empirical support for theoretical predictions |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=December 2012 |volume=13 |pages=867–877 |doi=10.1038/nrg3322 |pmid=23154809 |issue=12|pmc=3748133 }}&lt;!-- |accessdate=November 23, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Individual genes also exhibit modularity. A mutation in one cis-regulatory element of a gene's promoter region may allow the expression of the gene to be altered only in specific tissues, developmental stages, or environmental conditions rather than changing gene activity in the entire organism simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Olson-Manning et al. 2012" /&gt;

==Evolution of evolvability==
While variation yielding high evolvability could be useful in the long term, in the short term most of that variation is likely to be a disadvantage. For example, naively it would seem that increasing the [[mutation rate]] via a mutator allele would increase evolvability. But as an extreme example, if the mutation rate is too high then all individuals will be dead or at least carry a heavy [[genetic load |mutation load]]. Short-term selection for low variation most of the time is usually thought{{Who |date=February 2016}} likely to be more powerful than long-term selection for evolvability, making it difficult for natural selection to cause the evolution of evolvability. Other forces of selection also affect the generation of variation; for example, mutation and recombination may in part be byproducts of mechanisms to cope with DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michod RE |title=On fitness and adaptedness and their role in evolutionary explanation |journal=J Hist Biol |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=289–302 |year=1986 |pmid=11611993 |doi= 10.1007/bf00138880 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When recombination is low, mutator alleles may still sometimes [[genetic hitchhiking |hitchhike]] on the success of adaptive mutations that they cause. In this case, selection can take place at the level of the lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3212376 |author=Eshel I |title=Clone-selection and optimal rates of mutation |journal=Journal of Applied Probability |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=728–738 |year=1973 |jstor=3212376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain why mutators are often seen during [[experimental evolution]] of microbes. Mutator alleles can also evolve more easily when they only increase mutation rates in nearby DNA sequences, not across the whole genome: this is known as a contingency locus.

The evolution of evolvability is less controversial if it occurs via the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]], or via the tendency of variation-generating mechanisms to become more active when an organism is stressed. The [[Fungal prions |yeast prion]] [PSI+] may also be an example of the evolution of evolvability through [[evolutionary capacitance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Masel J |author1link=Joanna Masel |author2=Bergman A |title=The evolution of the evolvability properties of the yeast prion [PSI+] |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=7 |pages=1498–1512 |year=2003 |pmid=12940355 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lancaster AK, Bardill JP, True HL, Masel J |year=2010 |title=The Spontaneous Appearance Rate of the Yeast Prion PSI+ and Its Implications for the Evolution of the Evolvability Properties of the PSI+ System |journal=Genetics |pmid=19917766 |volume=184 |issue=2 |pmc=2828720 |pages=393–400 |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.110213}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evolutionary capacitor is a switch that turns genetic variation on and off. This is very much like [[Bet-hedging (biology) |bet-hedging]] the risk that a future environment will be similar or different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2007.08.006 |author1=King O |author2=Masel J |author2link=Joanna Masel |year=2007 |title=The Evolution of Bet-Hedging Adaptations to Rare Scenarios |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=560–575 |pmid=17915273 |pmc=2118055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical models also predict the evolution of evolvability via modularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Draghi J, Wagner G |year=2008 |title=Evolution of evolvability in a developmental model |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=301–315 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00303.x |pmid=18031304}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the costs of evolvability are sufficiently short-lived, more evolvable lineages may be the most successful in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1198914 |vauthors=Woods RJ, Barrick JE, Cooper TF, Shrestha U, Kauth MR, Lenski RE |year=2011 |title=Second-order selection for evolvability in a large Escherichia coli population |journal=Science |volume=331 |issue=6023 |pages=1433–1436 |pmid=21415350 |pmc=3176658|bibcode=2011Sci...331.1433W }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hypothesis that evolvability is an adaptation is often rejected in favor of alternative hypotheses, e.g. minimization of costs.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci 2008" /&gt;

==Applications==
Evolvability phenomena have practical applications. For [[protein engineering]] we wish to increase evolvability, and in medicine and agriculture we wish to decrease it. Protein evolvability is defined as the ability of the protein to acquire sequence diversity and conformational flexibility which can enable it to evolve toward a new function.&lt;ref name="SoskineTawfik2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soskine|first1=Misha|last2=Tawfik|first2=Dan S.|title=Mutational effects and the evolution of new protein functions|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=11|issue=8|year=2010|pages=572–582 |doi=10.1038/nrg2808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' is an annual promotional campaign which happens once every year, organized and funded by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] to increase awareness of Fairtrade products. It makes use of volunteers who support the goals of Fairtrade but who may also be committed to the more general concepts of fair trade, ethical trading or concerned by development issues. The concept was pioneered by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], initially held in 1997 in Scotland and directed by [[Barnaby Miln]].

The inaugural national launch was on 12 February 1997&lt;ref&gt;Herald, 13 February 1997, Retailing by Simon Bain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Evening News, 14 February 1997, Shop around for fair trade by John Vidal&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Augustine United Church]] on [[Edinburgh]]'s George IV Bridge by Lady [[Marion Fraser]], chairman of the charity [[Christian Aid]]. She broke a bar of Fairtrade chocolate to launch the event. It turned out to be a highly successful campaign to get every supermarket throughout Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Life and Work magazine, March 1997, Pester power puts fairness into focus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Episcopalian, April 1997, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Aid News, April/June 1997, Pester power rules! page 12&lt;/ref&gt; to stock Fairtrade products. Barnaby Miln sent supporters of Christian Aid Scotland, [[SCIAF]], [[Traidcraft]], [[Oxfam]] and the [[World Development Movement]] a list of 85 supermarkets in Scotland's cities and larger towns, and encouraged during the Fortnight to go and ask for Fairtrade products.

'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' spread to the rest of the United Kingdom the following year; today, Fairtrade Fortnights are celebrated in several countries, most notably [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Awareness raising and promotion of [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade certified products]] to the public are the main objectives of the Fortnight.

Usually events held during the fortnight include:
* Fetes
* Fairs
* [[Fairtrade]] food and drink tastings,
* Fashion shows
* Community, school, college and university events

These events are often supported by local authorities and governments, Fairtrade Steering Groups, dozens of [[charities]] and [[Alternative trading organization|ATOs]], all seeking to ensure that the local populace purchase fair and ethically traded goods. Local schools and colleges where Fairtrade is a frequently discussed topic can also play significant roles during Fairtrade Fortnight.

Events are highlighted and recorded on various nations' Fairtrade licensing bodies' websites (e.g. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK or [[Fairtrade Canada]]). Most media outlets are keen to support a fast-growing trend in which previously disadvantaged third world producers have a fairer market to sell their wares and develop their economic capabilities.

'''In 2018 Fairtrade Fortnight is celebrated from 28 February to 11 March.'''

==Criticism of Fairtrade==
{{Main|Fair trade debate}}

Critics in the [[Fair trade debate]] claim that some volunteers can have an incorrect view of Fairtrade, because the information is concealed from them,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P. (2012),  “Ethical Objections to Fairtrade”, Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm, Accessed 2 February 2012; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular that the evidence that little or none of the extra amount paid by consumers always reaches the producers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N.

&lt;/ref&gt; and an alleged lack of evidence that Fairtrade has a positive impact on Third World producers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is now largely obsolete as FLO-CERT, the Fairtrade Foundation and other nations' representative organisations and overseas development agencies continue to publish commodity reports and market analyses clearly indicating the benefits of the Fairtrade certification scheme over standard free market trade.

Using volunteers who allegedly do not understand the facts has in the past been criticised by Messrs. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; in their report that The Day Chocolate Company, "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

Fairtrade International and The Fairtrade Foundation produce a significant volume of information and resources for volunteers and interested people who wish to learn more about all aspects of the Fairtrade framework, in addition to more in-depth commodity reports and market analyses across all commodity sectors where it licenses products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33097">In [[fluid flow]], '''friction loss''' (or skin friction) is the [[Head loss|loss of pressure or “head”]] that occurs in pipe or [[Duct (flow)|duct flow]] due to the effect of the fluid's [[viscosity]] near the surface of the pipe or duct.&lt;ref name=Munson&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In mechanical systems such as [[internal combustion engine]]s, the term refers to the power lost in overcoming the friction between two moving surfaces, a different phenomenon.

== Economics ==
Friction loss is a significant economic concern wherever fluids are made to flow, whether entirely enclosed in a pipe or duct, or with a surface open to the air.
* Historically, it is a concern in [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] of all kinds, throughout human history. It is also relevant to sewer lines. Systematic study traces back to [[Henry Darcy]], an aqueduct engineer. 
* Natural flows in river beds are important to human activity; friction loss in a stream bed has an effect on the height of the flow, particularly significant during flooding. 
* The economies of pipelines for petrochemical delivery are highly affected by friction loss. The Yamal–Europe pipeline carries methane at a volume flow rate of 32.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of gas per year, at [[Reynolds number]]s greater than 50&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* In [[hydropower]] applications, the energy lost to skin friction in [[flume]] and [[penstock]] is not available for useful work, say generating electricity. 
* [[Irrigation]] water is pumped at large yearly volumes of flow, entailing significant expense.
* [[HVAC]] systems pump conditioning air on a widespread basis.
* In [[refrigeration]] applications, energy is expended pumping the coolant fluid through pipes or through the condenser. In split systems, the pipes carrying the coolant take the place of the air ducts in HVAC systems. 
* Wells and domestic water systems must be engineered for effective and economical operation.

== Defining Friction Loss ==
In the following discussion, we define volumetric flow rate V̇ (i.e. volume of fluid flowing) 
V̇ = πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;v

where
: r = radius of the pipe (for a pipe of circular section, the internal radius of the pipe).
: v = mean velocity of fluid flowing through the pipe.
: A = cross sectional area of the pipe.
In long pipes, the loss in pressure (assuming the pipe is level) is proportional to the length of pipe involved.
Friction loss is then the change in pressure Δp per unit length of pipe ''L''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \Delta p }{ L }. &lt;/math&gt;
When the pressure is expressed in terms of the equivalent height of a column of that fluid, as is common with water, the friction loss is expressed as ''S'', the "head loss" per length of pipe, a dimensionless quantity also known as the ''hydraulic slope''. 
: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{h_f }{ L } = \frac{ 1 }{ \rho  \mathrm{g} } \frac{ \Delta p }{ L } .&lt;/math&gt;
where
: ρ = [[density|density of the fluid]], (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
: g = the local [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]];

== Characterizing Friction Loss ==

&lt;!--This mode of energy loss is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, that flow being characterized as either [[Laminar flow|laminar]] or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]].  
In the case of laminar flow, obtained at low flow velocity, that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the surface, where it is zero. 
In turbulent flow (obtained at higher velocity) a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow.
For turbulent flow, the pressure drop is influenced by the roughness of the surface; in the laminar case, such effects are negligible because the velocity near the surface is zero.&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;--&gt;

Friction loss, which is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, depends on the conditions of flow and the physical properties of the system. These conditions can be encapsulated into a dimensionless number Re, known as the [[Reynolds number]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}=\frac{1}{\nu}VD&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the mean fluid velocity and ''D'' the diameter of the (cylindrical) pipe.  In this expression, the properties of the fluid itself are reduced to the [[kinematic viscosity]] ν
:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where
: μ = [[viscosity|viscosity of the fluid]] (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s)

=== Friction loss in straight pipe ===
The friction loss In a uniform, straight sections of pipe, known as "major loss", is caused by the effects of [[viscosity]], the movement of fluid [[molecules]] against each other or against the (possibly rough) wall of the pipe. Here, it is greatly affected by whether the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]] (Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2000) or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]] (Re &gt; 4000):&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;
* In [[laminar flow]], losses are [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation|proportional to fluid velocity]], ''V''; that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface, where it is zero. The roughness of the pipe surface influences neither the fluid flow nor the friction loss. 
* In [[turbulent flow]], losses are proportional to the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|square of the fluid velocity]], ''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;  here, a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the pipe surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow. In this domain, the effects of the roughness of the pipe surface must be considered. It is useful to characterize that roughness as the ratio of the roughness height ε to the pipe diameter ''D'', the "relative roughness".  Three sub-domains pertain to turbulent flow:
** In the smooth pipe domain, friction loss is relatively insensitive to roughness. 
** In the rough pipe domain, friction loss is dominated by the relative roughness and is insensitive to Reynolds number.
** In the transition domain, friction loss is sensitive to both. 
* For Reynolds numbers 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, the flow is unstable, varying with time as vortices within the flow form and vanish randomly. This domain of flow is not well modeled, nor are the details well understood.

=== Form friction ===
Factors other than straight pipe flow induce friction loss; these are known as “minor loss”:
* Fittings, such as bends, couplings, valves, or transitions in [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] or [[piping|pipe]] diameter, or
* Objects intruded into the fluid flow.
For the purposes of calculating the total friction loss of a system, the sources of form friction are sometimes reduced to an equivalent length of pipe.

== Measurements ==
Because of the importance of friction loss in civil engineering and in industry, it has been studied extensively for over a century.

== Calculating friction loss ==

=== Hagen–Poiseuille ===
Laminar flow is encountered in practice with very viscous fluids, such as motor oil, flowing through small-diameter tubes, at low velocity. Friction loss under conditions of laminar flow follow the [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]], which is an exact solution to the [[Hagen–Poiseuille flow from the Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]]. For a circular pipe with a fluid of density ''ρ'' and viscosity ''μ'', the hydraulic slope ''S'' can be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{64}{\mathrm{Re}} \frac{V^2}{2gD} = \frac{64\nu}{2g} \frac{V}{D^2}&lt;/math&gt;
In laminar flow (that is, with Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;~2000), the hydraulic slope is proportional to the flow velocity.

=== Darcy–Weisbach ===
In many practical engineering applications, the fluid flow is more rapid, therefore turbulent rather than laminar. Under turbulent flow, the friction loss is found to be roughly proportional to the square of the flow velocity and inversely proportional to the pipe diameter, that is, the friction loss follows the phenomenological [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]] in which the ''hydraulic slope'' ''S'' can be expressed&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S = f_D \frac{ 1 }{ 2g } \frac{V^2}{D} &lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;]] (but see [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Confusion with the Fanning friction factor|''Confusion with the Fanning friction factor'']]);
: ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor]]
Note that the value of this dimensionless factor depends on the pipe diameter ''D'' and the roughness of the pipe surface ε. Furthermore, it varies as well with the flow velocity ''V''  and on the physical properties of the fluid (usually cast together into the Reynolds number Re). Thus, the friction loss is not precisely proportional to the flow velocity squared, nor to the inverse of the pipe diameter: the friction factor takes account of the remaining dependency on these parameters.

From experimental measurements, the general features of the variation of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; are, for fixed ''relative roughness'' ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' and for Reynolds number Re = ''V'' ''D''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;ν&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;~2000,{{efn|See [[Moody chart]]}}
* With relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; declines in value with increasing Re in an approximate power law, with one order of magnitude change in ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; over four orders of magnitude in Re. This is called the "smooth pipe" regime, where the flow is turbulent but not sensitive to the roughness features of the pipe (because the vortices are much larger than those features). 
* At higher roughness, with increasing Reynolds number Re, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; climbs from its smooth pipe value, approaching an asymptote that itself varies logarithmically with the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''; this regime is called "rough pipe" flow. 
* The point of departure from smooth flow occurs at a Reynolds number roughly inversely proportional to the value of the relative roughness: the higher the relative roughness, the lower the Re of departure. The range of Re and ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' between smooth pipe flow and rough pipe flow is labeled "transitional". In this region, the measurements of Nikuradse show a decline in the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; with Re, before approaching its asymptotic value from below,&lt;ref name=Nikuradse1933/&gt; although Moody chose not to follow those data in his chart,&lt;ref name = Moody1944&gt;{{citation

* At values of 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, there is a ''critical zone'' of flow, a transition from laminar to turbulence, where the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; increases from its laminar value of 64&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Re to its smooth pipe value. In this regime, the fluid flow is found to be unstable, with vortices appearing and disappearing within the flow over time.
* The entire dependence of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; on the pipe diameter ''D'' is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re and the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'', likewise the entire dependence on fluid properties density ρ and viscosity μ is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re.

With these quantities as inputs, the friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed in closed form in the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Turbulent Regime|Colebrook–White equation or other fitting function]], and the flow volume ''Q'' and flow velocity ''V'' can be calculated therefrom.

The difference in the character of the flow from the case of water in a pipe stems from the differing Reynolds number Re and the roughness of the duct.

The friction loss is customarily given as pressure loss for a given duct length, Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', in units of (US) inches of water for 100 feet or (SI) kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For specific choices of duct material, and assuming air at standard temperature and pressure (STP), standard charts can be used to calculate the expected friction loss.&lt;ref name=FreeCalc /&gt;&lt;ref name=PDHonline&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chart exhibited in this section can be used to graphically determine the required diameter of duct to be installed in an application where the volume of flow is determined and where the goal is to keep the pressure loss per unit length of duct ''S'' below some target value in all portions of the system under study. First, select the desired pressure loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', say 1&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.12 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft) on the vertical axis (ordinate). Next scan horizontally to the needed flow volume ''Q'', say 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s (2000 cfm): the choice of duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.5 m (20 in.) will result in a pressure loss rate Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' less than the target value. Note in passing that selecting a duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.6 m (24 in.) will result in a loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' of 0.02&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.02 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft), illustrating the great gains in blower efficiency to be achieved by using modestly larger ducts.

The following table gives flow rate ''Q'' such that friction loss per unit length Δ''p'' / ''L'' (SI kg / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is  0.082, 0.245, and 0.816, respectively, for a variety of nominal duct sizes. The three values chosen for friction loss correspond to, in US units inch water column per 100 feet, 0.01, .03, and 0.1. Note that, in approximation, for a given value of flow volume, a step up in duct size (say from 100mm to 120mm) will reduce the friction loss by a factor of 3.

'''General Internet Corpus of Russian (GICR)''' is a corpus of Russian internet texts that has been accessible on request through an online query interface since 2013. The corpus includes rich text materials from the blogosphere, social networks, major news sources and literary magazines.

== Goals of the project ==

The project has the status of an educational and scientific one, and many tasks of computational linguistics are solved by independent researchers and research groups with the materials obtained by GICR. 
While other corpus projects of Russian are focused on fiction and edited texts, General Internet Corpus provides linguists timely opportunity to learn the language as it is, with all the slang and regional peculiarities.

Corpus gives the opportunity to carry out research in
* Linguistic research of a wide range: dialectological research, study of word distribution, study of the language of the social networks, study of the influence of gender, age and other factors on the language, frequency of words, fixed expressions and different constructions, stylistic features of texts of different segments of the Internet, etc.
* Social media analysis 
* Corpus-based machine learning for evaluating automatic tagging&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialog-21.ru/digests/dialog2015/materials/pdf/LagutinMBetal.pdf Automatic Classification of Web Texts Using Functional Text Dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, student papers and independent researches were carried out on the project material by students, graduates and employees of MSU, MIPT, Russian State Humanitarian University, Novosibirsk State University, Higher School of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences, SFU, CSU, SGMP, IAAS of MSU.

Scientific project leaders:
*Belikov V. - RSUH, Moscow, Russia
*Selegey V. - RSUH, ABBYY, Moscow, Russia
*Sharoff S. - RSUH, Moscow, Russia; University of Leeds, UK&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcorpora.ru/en/collective&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizations involved in support of GICR: 
* [[Russian State University of Humanities]]
* [[ABBYY|ABBYY Company]]
* [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]
* [[Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology]]

== Size and content of the corpus ==

Corpus size for the summer 2016 is 19.8 billion tokens, of which 49% are from [[VKontakte]], 40% are from [[LiveJournal]], another 4% - from [[Mail.ru]] Blogs and News, and 2% - from [http://magazines.russ.ru/ Russian Magazine Hall].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcorpora.ru/%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B5&lt;/ref&gt;
The sources collected in news segment are: [[RIA Novosti]], [[REGNUM News Agency|Regnum]], [[Lenta.ru]], [http://www.rosbalt.ru/ Rosbalt].
Texts are provided with metamarkup (by date of creation of the text, sex, place and year of birth of the author, Internet genre, etc.); all texts are provided with automatic morphological tagging and lemmatization.&lt;ref&gt;://www.webcorpora.ru/%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4921">'''Giovan Antonio Rusconi''' (c. 1500-05; † 1578) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[architect]], [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]], translator and illustrator of [[Vitruvius]].

== Life ==
[[File:Della architettvra (1590) (14769861931).jpg|thumbnail|''Della Architettvra''. Illustration.]]
Apart from being introduced into building and painting young Antonio Rusconi studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Padua]] under [[Giovanni Battista Memmo]] and [[Niccolò Tartaglia]]. Extensively consulting Vitruvius’ [[De architectura|"Ten Books on Architecture"]] while he was constructing a novel type of [[watermill]] Antonio became aware of many grave technical errors within the work’s early Renaissance editions and commentaries. Finally [[Pietro Lauro]], who had rendered [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leon Battista Alberti’s]] “De Architectura” into the vernacular, convinced Rusconi to set out with a translation of his own. The text was finished until 1552 and illustrated with more than three hundred supplementary [[woodcut]]s. Earlier, Rusconi had already provided the illustrations for [[Lodovico Dolce|Lodovico Dolce’s]] version of the [[Metamorphoses|Ovidian “Metamorphoses”]].
Yet, since then countless treatises on architecture and commentaries on [[Vitruvius]] (e.g. by [[Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro|Daniele Barbaro]], [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Gicaomo Vignola]] and [[Andrea Palladio]]) were being published, Rusconi’s Venetian editors, [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]] and [[Tommaso Porcacchi]], saw no benefit in printing another title on the subject.
Together with [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] Rusconi draughted the [[Brescia#Piazza della Loggia|"Palazzo municipale" (Brescia)]] in 1562, they also took part in rebuilding the [[Doge's Palace]] after the fire of 1577 and constructing the [[Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa|Palazzo Grimani]]. Nevertheless throughout his life Rusconi’s main occupation was that of a [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]] for the [[Republic of Venice]]. After having fallen gravely ill in 1575 Giovan Antonio died in 1579.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anna Bedon, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi: illustratore di Vitruvio, artista, ingegnere, architetto'', in: ''Della Architettura di Gio''[van]''Antonio Rusconi'', Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio di Vicenza, Testi e fonti per la storia dell’architettura, Verona, Vicenza 1996, pp. IX–XXI; Louis Cellauro, ''La biblioteca di un architetto del Rinascimento la raccolta di libri di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi'', in: Arte Veneta 58 (2001), pp. 224–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rusconi's "Della Architettura" ==
Rusconi’s “Vitruvius” was only printed after his death in 1590 by the son of his former editor [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]]. Although the latter recognised the value of Giovan Antonio’s [[woodcut|xylographies]] he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange “Vitruvius without Vitruvius“ was published:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bedon 1996, p. XII: „questa strana edizione vitruviana senza Vitruvio, senza traduzione, senza autore.“&lt;/ref&gt; Just about 160 of originally 300 [[woodcut]]s were compiled with extracts from [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo’s]] and [[Cesare Cesariano|Cesariano’s]] translations of [[De architectura|Vitruvius’ treatise]]. For many of Rusconi’s illustrations containing references to textual explanations, it is particularly regrettable that his translation has hence been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Reiser, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi (1515/20–1579)'', in: ''Firmitas et Splendor. Vitruv und die Techniken des Wanddekors'', ed. by Erwin Emmerling, [[:de:Andreas Grüner|Andreas Grüner]] et al., Munich 2014 (Studien aus dem Lehrstuhl für Restaurierung, [[Technische Universität München]], Fakultät für Architektur) {{ISBN|978-3-935643-62-7}}, pp. 269-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gradhiva''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[museology|museological]] journal, founded in 1986 by the poet and social scientist [[Michel Leiris]] and by the anthropologist [[Jean Jamin]]. It is since 2005 published by the [[Musée du Quai Branly]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/enseignement/scientific-publications/gradhiva.html The 'Gradhiva' Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212230826/http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/enseignement/scientific-publications/gradhiva.html |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its title derives from a novel by W. Jensen (''[[Gradiva (novel)|Gradiva]]'') which was the basis for a famous investigation by [[Sigmund Freud]], and that strongly inspired the [[Surrealists]]. Leiris ans Jamin inserted an "H" in the word to highlight that the journal focused on the '''H'''istory of anthropology, and that the editing was done at the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in [[Paris]]. The title thus became the [[acronym]] "{{lang|fr|'''G'''roupe de '''R'''echerches et d&amp;#39;'''A'''nalyses '''D'''ocumentaires sur l&amp;#39;'''HI'''stoire et les '''V'''ariations de l&amp;#39;'''A'''nthropologie}}}" ("Research and Documentary Analysis Group, History and Variations of Anthropology). It was edited by Jean Jamin between 1986 and 1996, by Françoise Zonabend from 1996 to 2006, and by Erwan Dianteill from 2006 until 2008.

Initially dedicated to the history and the archives of anthropology, it maintained its original mission, yet latterly opened up to a greater extent to contemporary developments of anthropology and museology. Based on original examinations and the publication of archives, '''Gradhiva'' was open to a variety of disciplines: [[ethnology]],  [[aesthetics]], [[history]], [[art history]], [[sociology]], literature and even music. Finally, it sought to develop an interaction between the text and images through high-quality and original [[iconography]].

In 2007, the anthropologist Sally Price ended her review article on ''Gradhiva'' in ''The Museum Anthropology Review'' by saying:
{{cquote|For anyone who's interested in anthropology, history, and museums, this journal remains an essential resource, rich in its articles and beautiful in its presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite
|url=http://museumanthropology.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/mar-2007-2-28/

|last=Price |first=Sally
|date=30 October 2007
|newspaper=Museum Anthropology Review
|accessdate=8 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Gradhiva'' was published by the French publisher [http://www.jmplace.com/fr/revues/fiche.cfm?ProduitCode=2 Jean Michel Place] until 2004.

In 2009, the journal was retitled as ''Anthropology of Art'', with a new direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">The '''Hindmarsh–Rose model''' of [[neuron]]al activity is aimed to study the [[Action potential|spiking]]-bursting behavior of the [[membrane potential]] observed in experiments made with a single neuron. The relevant variable is the membrane potential, ''x''(''t''), which is written in [[dimensionless unit]]s. There are two more variables, ''y''(''t'') and ''z''(''t''), which take into account the transport of ions across the membrane through the [[ion channel]]s. The transport of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] ions is made through fast ion channels and its rate is measured by ''y''(''t''), which is called the spiking variable. The transport of other ions is made through slow channels, and is taken into account through ''z''(''t''), which is called the bursting variable. Then, the Hindmarsh–Rose model has the mathematical form of a system of three nonlinear [[ordinary differential equation]]s on the dimensionless dynamical variables ''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), and ''z''(''t''). They read:

[[Image:Simulation of hrose neuron.png|thumb|right|400px|Simulation of Hindmarsh–Rose neuron showing typical neuronal [[bursting]].]] 

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{d x}{d t} &amp;= y+\phi(x)-z+I, \\
\frac{d y}{d t} &amp;= \psi(x)-y, \\
\frac{d z}{d t} &amp;= r[s(x-x_R)-z],
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\phi(x) &amp;= -a x^3+b x^2, \\
\psi(x) &amp;= c-d x^2. 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The model has eight parameters: ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''r'', ''s'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''I''. It is common to fix some of them and let the others be control parameters. Usually the parameter ''I'', which means the current that enters the neuron, is taken as a control parameter. Other control parameters used often in the literature are ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', or ''r'', the first four modeling the working of the fast ion channels and the last one the slow ion channels, respectively. Frequently, the parameters held fixed are ''s'' = 4 and ''x&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -8/5. When ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are fixed the values given are ''a'' = 1, ''b'' = 3, ''c'' = 1, and ''d'' = 5. The parameter ''r'' is something of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''I'' ranges between −10 and 10.

The third state equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{d z}{d t} &amp;= r[s(x-x_R)-z],\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
allows a great variety of dynamic behaviors of the membrane potential, described by variable x, including unpredictable behavior, which is referred to as [[chaos theory|chaotic dynamics]]. This makes the Hindmarsh–Rose model relatively simple and provides a good qualitative description of the many different patterns that are observed empirically.

The '''Faculty of Natural Sciences''' is one of the three main faculties of [[Imperial College London]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/Faculties-and-departments/|publisher=[[Imperial College London]]|location=London, United Kingdom|title=Faculties, departments and institutes |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 2001 from the former [[Royal College of Science]], a constituent college of Imperial College which dated back to 1848, and the faculty largely consists of the original departments of the college. Undergraduate teaching occurs for all departments at the [[South Kensington]] campus, with research being split between South Kensington and the new innovation campus at [[White City, London|White City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/white-city-campus/research/molecular-sciences-hub/|title=The Molecular Sciences Research Hub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who study at the departments of the faulty are represented by the [[Royal College of Science Union]], a constituent union of the [[Imperial College Union|college union]] which caters specifically to students on natural science courses. Graduates who obtain an undergraduate degree, either [[BSc]] or [[MSci]], from the faculty are awarded the [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|Associateship of the Royal College of Science]] (ARCS) as an additional degree.

{{See also|Royal College of Science}}
[[File:Blackett Laboratory Front-On, Prince Consort Road.png|thumb|160px|The [[Blackett Laboratory]] is home to the Department of Physics]]

The origins of the faculty lie in the Royal College of Chemistry, which, after being founded in 1845, moved to a new site in South Kensington in the early 1870s. Incorporated into the Normal School of Science, the college was later renamed the Royal College of Science in 1890, and in 1907 became a constituent college of the newly formed [[Imperial College London|Imperial College of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol38/pp233-247#h2-0004|title=CHAPTER XVIII - Imperial College ｜ British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Imperial College was restructured to form four new faculties, including the faculties of Physical Sciences and Life Sciences, which took over the role of the Royal College of Science. These faculties were later re-merged over the course of 2005-2006 to form the Faculty of Natural Sciences, which comprises the same departments as the original Royal College of Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.cgcu.net/news/?id=1138  Live! – News: Science Faculties to Re-Merge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052851/http://live.cgcu.net/news/?id=1138 |date=31 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Solid State Physics''' ('''ISSP''', {{zh|s=固体物理研究所|hp=Gùtǐ Wùlǐ Yánjiūsuǒ}}) is one of over a dozen divisions comprising the [[Hefei Institutes of Physical Science]], [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS) situated in [[Hefei]], [[Anhui]]. The ISSP was founded in March 1982 by the renowned scientist couple [[Ke T'ing-sui]] and [[He Yizhen]]; it now employs over 200 staff members, has combined facilities of over 25,000 square meters of laboratory space, and is a training base to over 200 graduate students in the fields of condensed matter physics, materials physics and chemistry.

The ISSP is research intensive in the areas of nano-materials technology, novel functional materials, computational physics, internal friction and defects of solids, materials physics under extreme environments, environmental and energy nanomaterials, nuclear engineering and special metallic materials. Most of its research is funded by the [[National Natural Science Foundation of China]], the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province and the private sector. The ISSP also has close ties with the [[University of Science and Technology of China]] in both R&amp;D and training of graduate students.

'''Isopropyl cyanide''' is a complex organic molecule that has been recently found in several meteorites arrived from space. The singularity of this chemical is due to the fact that it is the only one among the molecules arriving from the universe that has a branched, rather than straight, carbon backbone which is larger than usual, in comparison with others.

== History ==

Both isopropyl cyanide and its straight-chain isomer, [[Butyronitrile|''n''-propyl cyanide,]] were detected by astronomers from [[Cornell University]], the [[Max Planck Institute|Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]] and the [[University of Cologne]] by means of using the [[Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array]] (ALMA) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1513/|title = Complex Organic Molecules Discovered in Infant Star System}}&lt;/ref&gt; — a set of radiotelescopes in Chile —. The chemical was found within an immense gas cloud in the star-forming region called [[Sgr B2|Sagittarius B2]]. This interestellar space is located at about 300 [[light years]] away from the galactic center [[Sagittarius A*|Sgr A*]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.com/news/2014/09/new-molecule-found-in-space-connotes-life-origins | title = New molecule found in space connotes life origins | publisher = astronomy.com | date = September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 27,000 light years from [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New molecule found in space connotes life origins {{!}} Cornell Chronicle|url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/09/new-molecule-found-space-connotes-life-origins|website = www.news.cornell.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
About 50 individual features for Isopropyl cyanide and 120 for normal propyl cyanide (n-propyl cyanide) were identified in the ALMA spectrum of the Sagittarius B2 region. The published astrochemical model indicates that both [[isomers]] are produced within or upon dust grain ice mantles through the addition of molecular [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]s, albeit via differing reaction pathways. 					

Scientists have come to the conclusion that isopropyl cyanide could have been essential for the creation of primary life. The discovery of this particular cyanide suggests that the complex molecules needed for life may have their origins in [[interstellar space]]. Those molecules would have been rising during the process of early star formation and been transferred to our planet later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://scienceforscientists.wordpress.com/tag/isopropyl-cyanide/|title = Science for Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rob Garrod, this detection opens a new frontier in the field regarding the complexity of molecules that can be formed in interstellar space and that might ultimately find their way to the surfaces of planets. How widespread these complex organic molecules really are in our [[Galaxy]] is one of the questions raised by this new discovery.

== Composition and structure ==
[[File:Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg|thumb|Galaxy]]
Isopropyl cyanide (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CN) contains a carbon atom bounded by a simple link to two [[methyl]] (-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) structures and to a [[cyano group]] (-CN). The cyano group is constituted by a triple link bound between one carbon and one [[nitrogen]] atom.
The greatest contribution to the production of i-PrCN  comes from the reaction of CN radicals (which are accreted from the gas) with the CH3CHCH3 radical, whereas the dominant formation mechanism for [[Butyronitrile|n-PrCN]] is the addition of C2H5 and CH2CN, a process that has no equivalent for the production of i-PrCN.
i-PrCN production dominates all reaction mechanisms for which parallel processes are available to both isomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/pressreleases/2014/10|title = Interstellar molecules are branching out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotational spectrum ===

The [[rotational spectrum]] of the branched isomer iso- or i-PrCN, which had only been previously studied to a limited extent in the [[Microwave|microwave region]], has recently been extensively recorded in the laboratory from the microwave to the submillimeter wave region along with a redetermination of the [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]], which appears to be 4.29 D.			
The latter uncertainty assumes the same source size and rotation temperature for both isomers.

Scientists were able to observe transitions in both types of cyanides. Thus, the microwave spectrum of the isopropyl cyanide has been recorded from 26.5 to 40.0&amp;nbsp;GHz. Three different excited states were found in the R-branch of i-PrCN. In the experiments carried out by the scientists, different parameters were studied: The bond distance between the different atoms and the angles between them. The results indicated that the bond distance between de carbon atom and the cyano group is 1.501 Å; the angle between the three carbon atoms is 113º while the angle between the CCC and the CN bond is 53.8º. Two different torsional modes were observed, according to the relative intensities of the excited state lines, the frequencies of which were, respectively, 200±20 and 249±10&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This could give an idea of the internal rotation energy of this molecule, which has been found to be of 3.3 Kcal/mole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022286074800529|title = Microwave spectrum, dipole moment and structure of isopropyl cyanide | doi=10.1016/0022-2860(74)80052-9 | volume=21|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|pages=289–297|bibcode=1974JMoSt..21..289D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance in life's origin ===

The branched carbon structure of isopropyl cyanide is a common feature in those molecules that are considered to be necessary life – such as [[aminoacids|amino acids]], which are the building blocks of [[proteins]]. This new discovery lends weight to the idea that biologically crucial molecules, like the mentioned amino acids which are also commonly found in [[meteorites]], were produced even before the process of star formation or before planets such as the Earth were formed.

The importance of the cyanides found in comets remains in their [[C-N bond]]. This bond has been proved to participate in the abiotic amino acid synthesis.

The two cyanide molecules – isopropyl cyanide and normal-propyl cyanide – are the largest molecules yet detected in any star-forming region.

==Applications==
[[File:Isopropylcyanide.gif|thumb|3D space-filling model of the isopropyl cyanide molecule.]]
Chemically speaking, the simple inorganic cyanides behave as chlorides in many ways. Organic nitriles act as solvents and are reacted further for various applications such as:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/organic/ISOBUTYRONITRILE.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Working as an extraction solvent for fatty acids, oils and [[unsaturated hydrocarbons]]. They are also good solvents for spinning and casting and [[extractive distillation]] based on its selective miscibility with organic compounds and can act as removing agents of colouring matters and aromatic alcohols. Inorganic cyanides are also able to perform a [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] of steroids or to be compounds for organic synthesis. Therefore, they basically act as solvents or chemical intermediates in biochemistry ( pesticide sequencing and DNA synthesis, for example).

Some other useful applications of these organic nitriles are the performance of high-pressure liquid [[Chromatography, high pressure liquid|chromatographic analysis]]. Also, the action they have as catalysts and components of transition-metal complex catalysts, stabilizers for chlorinated solvents. Furthermore, they may work as chemical intermediates and solvents for perfumes and pharmaceutical products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">'''Josias Priest''' (''c.'' 1645 – 3 January 1735 in [[Chelsea, London]]) was an [[England|English]] dancer, dancing-master and [[Choreography|choreographer]].

==Biography==
In 1669, Priest was arrested along with four others for dancing and making music without a license. In 1668, he was a dancing-master in [[Holborn]], and in 1675 he moved to [[Leicester Fields]] to run a [[boarding school]] for [[Gentleman|gentlewomen]]. In 1680 he started a similar school at Gorge's House in [[Chelsea, London]]. Here Priest &lt;!--(sic)--&gt; hosted [[opera]]s, including [[John Blow]]'s ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1684) and [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689). It is widely believed that Priest choreographed dances for these and other semi-operas by Purcell, including ''[[Dioclesian]]'', ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', ''[[The Indian Queen (opera)|The Indian Queen]]'', and ''[[King Arthur (opera)|King Arthur]]'' ; however, the evidence is not entirely conclusive. 

In 1699 [[Thomas Bray]] published a collection of dance music which included music for dances by Josias Priest and his son, Thomas Priest. Only one dance by Priest survives, a 'Minuet by Mr Preist'&lt;!--Please do not change this spelling, Preist is correct--&gt; in ''An Essay for the Further Improvement of Dancing'' (1711) published by Edmund Pemberton.  References to Priest's choreography remain in some musical sources, however.  The surviving minuet is for twelve women and uses a limited step vocabulary of [[minuet step]]s forwards, backwards and sideways, the main choreographic interest being in the floor patterns.  It is recorded in a simplified form of [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]] that was typically used for recording [[English country dance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=musdi&amp;fileName=134/musdi134.db&amp;recNum=32&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/musdibib:@field(NUMBER+@band(musdi+134)) facsimile of Priest's choreography] can be found at The Library of Congress' [[An American Ballroom Companion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21189">The '''Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing''' or '''LC4MP''' is an explanatory theory that assumes humans have a limited capacity for [[cognitive processing]] of information, as it associates with mediated message variables; moreover, they (viewers) are actively engaged in processing mediated information&lt;ref&gt;Lang, A. (2000). The information processing of mediated messages: A framework for communication research.'' Journal of Communication'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many [[mass communication]] theories, LC4MP is an amalgam that finds its origins in psychology. Specifically, this theory has its origins in the Limited Capacity Model for understanding cognitive information processing. The most fundamental assumptions of information processing are the three dimensions of [[cognitive processing]]. The three dimensions: 1) [[encoding]], 2) storage, and 3) retrieval. This is how viewers get presented information into their heads. Messages can be processed under controlled conditions or they can be automatically elicited.

== Limited capacity theory ==

When a message processor decides to pay attention to a message because it appeals to their interests, and they allocate resources to information processing, the controlled message engagement subprocess begins; conversely, when a message processor is cued automatically, and they are paying attention, the same process of allocating cognitive resources begins to elicit message processing. First, message engagement, which is a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] approach/avoidance interaction engages the appetitive and aversive cognitive subprocesses. In the most lay terms, these are basic fight or flight responses that happen in mere nanoseconds. This information then can report to sensor stores in the brain; and if it is useful, it will move to short term memory and long term memory.&lt;ref&gt;Lang et al, 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive resources ==

There are several key concepts in the LC4MP: total resources, resources allocated, resources required, resources remaining, and resources available. Total resources refer to the total resources in the resource pool. Resources allocated refer to the resources that are actually available for a processing task. The resource allocated to a task may be equivalent to the total resources, but probably is not. '''''Resources required''''' are the amount of resources necessary to complete a task ([https://drive.google.com/a/mix.wvu.edu/file/d/0B8r89BbARRQISG5NR2l4a3NFMm8/view?usp=sharing See Total-Allocated-Required Resources].).  '''''Resources remaining''''' refer to the difference between total resources and resources required. '''''Resources available''''' are the difference between the resources allocated and the resources required.&lt;ref&gt;Lang &amp; Basil, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Resources remaining and resources available may be the same if total resources are equivalent to resources allocated, but this is unlikely the case. [https://drive.google.com/a/mix.wvu.edu/file/d/0B8r89BbARRQISG5NR2l4a3NFMm8/view?usp=sharing See the overall picture of mental resources in information processing.]

The reasons for these fine-tuned distinctions are several. First, people may not allocate all of the available resources to a task at hand because they are [[cognitive miser]]s. Unless highly motivated, people tend to use as few resources as necessary. Thus, a distinction is made between total resources and allocated resources. Second, people will allocate resources only as required by the task. If people are watching a program they have seen before, fewer resources may be required because of the familiarity of the program. Conversely, if the production is such that the visual elements of the programming are important, then more resources may be required. In both cases, the same amount of resources may have been allocated to the TV program, but different amounts were actually used, leaving some allocated resources available in one case but not in another. Third, some elements in the environment will automatically draw resources. For example, formal features automatically attract attention (e.g., unrelated cuts), drawing required resources from the total pool of resources without conscious allocation of resources. In this case, the difference between the automatic attraction (i.e., required) of resources and the total resources leaves some remaining resources for allocation to other tasks.

Within this model, media messages may receive insufficient or limited processing for two basic reasons (i.e., cognitive overload). First, there may not be enough resources available to process the message fully (i.e., the required resources exceed the total resources). For example, a message on a topic that a person does not understand may require so many resources – perhaps trying to retrieve information from long-term memory – that, even though all resources may have been allocated to the task, the required resources for retrieval leave neither remaining nor available resources for attending to and encoding the message. Second, there may be enough resources available to process the message but those resources are not allocated to the task for reasons such as insufficient motivation or because the person is multitasking (e.g., resources required exceeds resources allocated). For example, when a person is cooking and watching TV at the same time, there may not be enough resources available to process the TV program entirely.

Watching TV involves a number of simultaneous cognitive processes. TV viewing often requires people to engage in processing auditory and visual information, and integrating these two channels of information.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Potter, &amp; Bolls, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, both the auditory and visual information include the content of the program as well as the formal features of TV which can act as syntax for the programming. The viewer must integrate all of this information to understand the program. In addition, viewers are storing new information in memory and activating existing knowledge to aid in comprehending the program. Research under the rubric of the LC4MP focuses on how resources are allocated to the various processes that are occurring and the effects of differential resource allocation on attention, encoding, and retrieval.

== Encoding, storage, and retrieval ==

Encoding of information is a subprocess where a stimulus orients a person to a message, vel non. In terms of message processing, its effectiveness is determined by the number of cognitive resources allocated to the encoding process.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; If the person is exposed to a stimulus, and they choose to pay attention, the brain will treat that mediated message like it was reality. That is, the brain creates an "[[orienting response]] (OR), which is an automatic cognitive response to novel information".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This response is a cognitive reaction to a change in the environment,&lt;ref&gt;Lang &amp; Basil, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and can be measured via implicit measures of recognition and explicit measures such as [[electrochemical]] reactions in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, 2006, Lang, et al. 2000, Lang et al 1999&lt;/ref&gt; These cognitive processes can be both automatic, as in the case of OR’s, or controlled. In either event, the next step in the message engagement process is to move the information into storage.

Storage is conceptually modeled as a cognitive sub-processing of information into and through the general associative network.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Associative networks are conceptual “nodes” that map brain uses as sensor stores—for short-term and long term memory.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1983, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; They are conceptualized as the site where information is stored and ultimately retrieved. Under normal conditions, if there are many associative links available for information processing, “the more readily retrievable that information will become”;&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; hence, then “retrieval” time of information is faster and more accessible. Storage of information is measured via [[cued recall]].

Information retrieval is conceptualized as the third fundamental conceptual sub process of information processing, and it is a function of memory, which is measured via free recall. Measuring free recall is based on an individual’s levels of sensitivity to stimuli, without being cued to the information.

== Cognitive memory ==

Automatic cognitive responses are elicited via a cognitive response to novel information, the primary method in which automatic responses are elicited is through structural cues of the communication situation.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Lang, et al. (2000) elaborates on this by controlling the structural features. They discovered that the relatedness of the media messages mattered. They dissected the pacing of mediated content into two categories: one that used related editing in camera angle and content; and, another with unrelated cuts to unrelated information to the previous information that was being encoded and stored.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, et al. 2000, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; These pacing cues are important to media producers because they can either help reinforce attention into memory; or they can created a low memory retention condition in the minds of the message processor.

By inserting edits, which are operationalized by the process of switching cameras or transitions in visual or audio media, media producers can elicit orienting responses in attentive viewers. This is accomplished because the mechanism of allocating resources to memory message processing is effective in low, medium, and high edit conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, et al. 2000, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, retrieval is also possible and is measured via recognition testing. However, unlike related editing cues, unrelated cuts do not make it into memory, especially when the cuts are coming at the message processor rapidly. This is important, secondarily, because the entire illusion of a commercially driven media system is premised on the concept that advertising sells products. More importantly, this article's primary concern is to instruct media producers—who are concerned with generating public information, the importance of editing cues, and the deleterious uses of disparate advertising and its ineffectiveness.

== Methods ==

Methodologically, the LC4MP uses three primary sets of measures to study how people allocate resources and process information. Secondary task reaction time (STRT) is a measure of the amount of resources allocated to attention. STRT involves people engaging in a primary task such as watching TV while also monitoring a second task such as pressing a button whenever a cue such as a tone sounds or a light comes on.&lt;ref&gt;see more specific explanation of STRTs; Lang &amp; Basil, 1998; Reeves &amp; Thorson, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of resources that are available (i.e., resources allocated minus resources required) has been demonstrated to influence how long it takes people to respond in the STRT.&lt;ref&gt;Lang &amp; Basil, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; When there are a lot of resources available, people quickly notice the light or tone and are quick to press a button. But when resources are low or taxed, people take longer to notice the light or tone and are slower to respond. For example, a cut to an unrelated scene tends to tax resources because of the new information that needs to be processed, and STRT is slower. Critically, STRT is a function of both the resources allocated to the task and the resources required by the task.&lt;ref&gt;Lang et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A second set of methodological tools involves physiological measures such as heart rate, galvanic skin responses (sweating) or muscle activity. Heart rate is used as a measure of whether an orienting response has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000; Lang, Geiger, Strickwerda &amp; Sumner, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; When people show an aroused response, their heart rate decelerates for a few seconds before returning toward their baseline. Likewise, an increase in skin conductance is evidence of an aroused response. Thus, the combined evidence of heart rate deceleration and an increase in skin conductance provides convergent evidence that an orienting response (OR) has occurred.

A final set of methodological tools involves measures of memory including recall and recognition measures.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The measures of memory are used to make inferences about encoding and retrieval processes. For example, if messages are simple, increasing people’s attention to a message through the inclusion of formal features that orient attention, such as edits, results in improvements in memory for the message. This finding suggests that there were available resources (i.e., more resources allocated than required) that could be diverted to encoding processes. Conversely, with a complex message, the addition of features that increase ORs tends to lead to decrements in memory, which suggests that ORs automatically drew resources away from encoding processes and resulted in worse memory. The decreased performance on memory tests is one indication that the resources required has exceeded the resources allocated to the task.

== Limits of LC4MP ==

The ability of information processing of [[mediated messages]] has limits. Interference with the encoding, storage, and retrieval of messages; especially when the receiver is not interested in the message, creates a situation where the required resources needed to process information are not dedicated; and, “fewer associative links will be made available to the message... therefore, it limits their ability to process media” (&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;). This is a concern for researchers interested in studying how people encode and store information because if information processors do not devote the appropriate number of resources required to process information, then [[information overload]] will inhibit the abilities of individuals to encoding, store, and retrieve information.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the ability to information processors to process messages is also limited by their unique retrieval sub processing abilities, which are related to perceptions compiled over time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Thus, the sub process of retrieval is affected by two dimensions termed, “later retrieval-done after the fact and concurrent retrieval- in real time affect information processing of messages”.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 2000, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

As a conceptual level of LC4MP, constructivism argues the limitation of information processing theoretical view, although the argues are not in the mediated media world but in more foundational psychology world. Before to point out specific limits of the view, it is useful to summarize the characteristics of information processing views for contrast. First, this view has it that information gains (e.g., learning) can be conceived as internal structures (e.g., long term memory) changing to reflect changes in the external world, which represents "reality". Within the traditional information processing view this real world is "knowable" and, as a consequence a student's knowledge can be ultimately judged as right or wrong. A second important characteristic of the information processing view is that there are general principles of learning, knowledge, etc. that hold true across situations and across learners, and it is the job of the researcher and theorist to ascertain these general principles.

On the other hand, a fundamental characteristic of the prototypical constructivist view is that no knowledge is absolute, rather knowledge is constructed. For example, the constructivists point to all the times in history when something was thought be a "fact", but was later discounted. This view is in contrast with the "absolute reality" basis of the information processing view. Another fundamental characteristics of the structuralist perspective is that learning only occurs within some context. So, for example, to consider learning independent of the environment in which it occurs (e.g., school, work, or play), is unrealistic and incomplete. This, again, is inconsistent with both the behaviorist and information processing views (and much of science in general, for that matter) in that these latter theories are based on the assumption that fundamental principles can be ascertained that will apply broadly across contexts and across learners.

These distinctions may sound quite abstract and removed from "real life" classroom instruction to you. In fact, in a practical/applied sense there are some important implications and practices that have emerged from this constructivist view since it has come into favor in the last decade. The general view that knowledge is not so absolute, that it is "constructed" puts more of an emphasis on the knowledge and conceptions that students brings to the classroom. This leads to a more "learner centered approach", with the teacher as more of a "guide on the side", as opposed to a "sage on the stage". Further, in a "constructivist classroom" students are more free to participate in the planning (i.e., "negotiate") and, even, the assessment process. Another implication of the "relative" nature of knowledge contention is that it is important to present the learner with multiple perspectives on a single topic or concept.

==Introduction==

A model of teaching is a plan or pattern that can be used to shape curriculum's,to design instructional materials and to guide instruction in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=models of teaching social science|url=http://www.slideshare.net/AileenAsim/models-of-teaching-11201700|ref=slideshare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance==
* To understand the society in which they live and to learn how it is structured, governed and managed.
* To grow up as an active,responsible and reflective members of society.
* To learn to respect each other's differences of opinion,lifestyle and language.
* To question and examine received ideas,institutions and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Models of teaching social science|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/new_ncert/ncert/rightside/links/pdf/focus_group/social_sciencel.pdf|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of teaching models ==
* Classroom Teaching- It helps to strengthen one's responsibility to oneself and others.This model has rules and structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=models of teaching social science|url=http://thesecondprinciple.com/teaching-essentials/models-teaching/|ref=webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Graffiti model- In this model the students are asked to given written responses to questions posed by teachers.
* Jigsaw model-This model was started originally in 1960's to facilitate racial integration. This is a co-operative learning technique that reduces racial conflict among students,promotes better learning,improves motivation among students and increases enjoyment of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Models of teaching social science|url=https://www.jigsaw.org/|ref=webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Role play model-This is a teaching strategy.It is used by teachers especially to help solve interpersonal problems in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Models of teaching social science|url=http://www2.maxwell.syr.edu/plegal/crit3/a1.html|ref=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9161">'''Numerical algebraic geometry''' is a field of [[computational mathematics]], particularly [[computational algebraic geometry]], which uses methods from [[numerical analysis]] to study and manipulate algebraic varieties on a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Andrew J. Sommese, What is numerical algebraic geometry?, Journal of Symbolic Computation, Volume 79, Part 3, March–April 2017, pages 499–507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www3.nd.edu/~cwample1/Preprints/intro2AlgGeom.pdf |title=Introduction to Numerical Algebraic Geometry |last=Sommese |first=Andrew J. |last2=Verschelde |first2=Jan |last3=Wampler |first3=Charles W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Homotopy continuation==
{{see also|System of polynomial equations#Homotopy continuation}}
{{see also|Numerical continuation}}
The primary computational method used in numerical algebraic geometry is homotopy continuation, in which a [[homotopy]] is formed between two polynomial systems, and the isolated solutions (points) of one are continued to the other. This is a specification of the more general method of [[numerical continuation]].

Let &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; represent the variables of the system.  By abuse of notation, and to facilitate the spectrum of ambient spaces over which one can solve system, we do not use vector notation for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly for the polynomial systems &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Current canonical notation calls the start system &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and the target system – the system to solve – &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Sommese, Charles W. Wampler, The Numerical Solution of Systems of Polynomials Arising in Engineering and Science, World Scientific, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Bates, Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Andrew J. Sommese, Charles W. Wampler, Numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini, SIAM, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  A very common homotopy, the straight-line homotopy, between &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math display="block"&gt; H(z,t) = (1-t) f(z) + t g(z).&lt;/math&gt;

In the above homotopy, one starts the path variable at &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{start}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and continues toward &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{end}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Another common choice is to run from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  In principle, the choice is completely arbitrary.  In practice, regarding endgame methods for computing singular solutions using homotopy continuation, the target time being &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; can significantly ease analysis, so this perspective is here taken.{{Citation needed|reason=need a citation indicating that the analysis is actually easier with target time 0|date=January 2017}}  

Regardless of the choice of start and target times, the &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; ought to be formulated such that &lt;math&gt;H(z, t_{\text{start}}) = g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H(z, t_{\text{end}}) = f(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

One has a choice in &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, including

* Roots of unity
* Total degree
* Polyhedral
* Multi-homogeneous

and beyond these, specific [[Start system|start systems]] that closely mirror the structure of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may be formed for particular systems.  The choice of start system impacts the computational time it takes to solve &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, in that those that are easy to formulate (such as total degree) tend to have higher numbers of paths to track, and those that take significant effort (such as the polyhedral method) are much sharper.  There is currently no good way to predict which will lead to the quickest time to solve.{{Citation needed|reason=need a source indicating this please|date=January 2017}}

Actual continuation is typically done using [[predictor–corrector method]]s, with additional features as implemented.  Predicting is done using a standard [[ordinary differential equation|ODE]] predictor method, such as [[Runge–Kutta]], and correction often uses Newton–Raphson iteration.

Because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are polynomial, homotopy continuation in this context is theoretically guaranteed to compute all solutions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, due to [[Theorem of Bertini|Bertini's theorem]].  However, this guarantee is not always achieved in practice, because of issues arising from limitations of the modern computer, most namely finite precision.  That is, despite the strength of the probability-1 argument underlying this theory, without using a priori certified tracking methods, some paths may fail to track perfectly for various reasons.

==Witness set==
A witness set 
&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a data structure used to describe [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]. The witness set for an affine variety that is equidimensional consists of three pieces of information. The first piece of information is a system of equations &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. These equations define the algebraic variety &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt; that is being studied. The second piece of information is a linear space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. The dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the codimension of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;, and chosen to intersect &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt; transversely. The third piece of information is the list of points in the intersection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\cap{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. This intersection has finitely many points and the number of points is the degree of the algebraic variety &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, witness sets encode the answer to the first two questions one asks about an algebraic variety: What is the dimension, and what is the degree? Witness sets also allow one to perform a numerical irreducible decomposition, component membership tests, and component sampling. This makes witness sets a good description of an algebraic variety.

==Certification==

Solutions to polynomial systems computed using numerical algebraic geometric methods can be certified, meaning that the approximate solution is "correct".  This can be achieved in several ways, either a priori using a certified tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beltrán|first=Carlos|last2=Leykin|first2=Anton|date=2012-03-01|title=Certified Numerical Homotopy Tracking|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2011.606184|journal=Experimental Mathematics|volume=21|issue=1|pages=69–83|doi=10.1080/10586458.2011.606184|issn=1058-6458|arxiv=0912.0920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beltrán|first=Carlos|last2=Leykin|first2=Anton|date=2013-02-01|title=Robust Certified Numerical Homotopy Tracking|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-013-9143-2|journal=Foundations of Computational Mathematics|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=253–295|doi=10.1007/s10208-013-9143-2|issn=1615-3375|arxiv=1105.5992}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a posteriori by showing that the point is, say, in the basin of convergence for Newton's method.&lt;ref name = "alphaCertified"&gt;Hauenstein, Jonathan D., and Sottile, Frank. "Algorithm 921: alphaCertified: certifying solutions to polynomial systems." ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS) 38.4 (2012): 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several software packages implement portions of the theoretical body of numerical algebraic geometry. These include, in alphabetic order:

==Theorem Star==
Often researchers use results from both probabilistic symbolic computations and numerical computations to prove theorems. The notation ''Theorem Star'' is often used to indicate the reliance on such computations. 
     ''Our methods include probabilistic symbolic computations and numerical computations. Though they have been carefully tested and produce completely reproducible results, they are technically only true with high probability, or up to the numerical precision of the computers we use. To indicate reliance on such computations, we designate those theorems, corollaries, and propositions with a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oeding|first1=Luke|last2=Sam|first2=Steven|title=Equations for the fifth secant variety of Segre products of projective spaces|journal=Experimental Mathematics|date=2016|volume=25|issue=1|page=94--99|doi=10.1080/10586458.2015.1037872|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10586458.2015.1037872|arxiv=1502.00203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work environment has played a significant role in the occurrence of adverse human health effects due to chemical and biological hazards for centuries. Occupational health specialists, including toxicologists, rely upon human and animal data to determine safe exposure levels. If effects observed in workers can be reproduced in a laboratory animal, it becomes possible to investigate the mechanisms that might reasonably be expected to produce such effects. On the other hand, shedding light on the mechanism by which a designated effect is produced in a test animal species may make it easier to find ways to prevent such effects from occurring in humans. Such an understanding may also help to identify subtle or delayed effects that have not been observed in workers, but to which health professionals should be alerted.&lt;ref&gt;PRINCIPLES OF TOXICOLOGY , Environmental and Industrial Applications , SECOND EDITION , Edited by Phillip L. Williams,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure==
Occupational exposures involve situations ranging، for example from a secretary using typewriter correction fluid to the loading and off-loading of tanker trucks with thousands of gallons of gasoline.

== History ==

Early writings by Ulrich Ellenbog (1435–1499), [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]] (1494–1555), and [[Paracelsus]] (1492–1541) revealed the toxic nature of exposures in [[mining]], [[smelting]], and [[metallurgy]].
A systematic treatise by [[Ramazzini]] (1633–1714) described the hazards as they applied to miners, chemists, metal workers, [[Driver (series)|tanners]], [[pharmacists]], grain sifters, stonecutters, sewage workers, and even corpse bearers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==How is occupational toxicology used?==
*Role in decision making within hierarchical control
*Role in setting exposure standards for workplace chemicals
*Role in biological monitoring for chemical exposure&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Biological monitoring ==
The [[measurement]] of a chemical, its [[metabolite]], or a [[biochemical]] effect in a biologic [[Biological specimen|specimen]] for the purpose of assessing [[Exposure assessment|exposure]]. Biologic [[Biomonitoring|monitoring]] is an important [[tool]] to identify the nature and amount of chemical exposures in [[occupational]] and [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;CURRENT Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine,fourth edition Edited by Joseph LaDou&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Heavy metals]]==
[[Metal]]s with a [[density]] of more than 5 g/cm3 and [[toxic]] effects.
Including [[arsenic]], [[cobalt]], [[lead]], [[lithium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[thorium]], have documented ototoxic potential.
The metals represent a different aspect of toxicology in that they do not undergo breakdown to other metals (to do so would be transmutation of the elements, an old alchemical principle still not possible without huge sources of energy, and a particle accelerator!). The absorption, disposition and excretion of metals are largely dependent on physical factors, such as solubility, ionisation, particle size and chemical species (for metal salts). About 70–80 elements in the periodic table are considered metals. Groups Ia and IIa, the‘s block’ metals, form monovalent and divalent cations respectively. Groups IIIb to VIb constitute the ‘p block’ elements, which include metals that can have ions of different valencies. These are called the transition elements. Of the metal elements, about 40 are considered to be ‘common’ metals. However, less than 30 have compounds that have been reported to produce toxicity. Metals are probably some of the oldest toxicants known to humans. Health effects such as colic were reported following exposure to lead, arsenic and mercury over 2000 years ago. On the other hand, metals such as cadmium, chromium and nickel belong to the modern era. The importance of some of the rarer metals may become apparent with emerging changes in technology, such as microelectronics and superconductors. The toxicity of a metal is only partially related to its position in the periodic table. Toxicity decreases with the stability of the configuration of electrons in the atomic nuclei. This produces a number of properties that can affect toxicity&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Toxicolog, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Postmodern feminism''' is an approach to [[feminist theory]] that incorporates [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist theory]], seeing itself as moving beyond the [[modernist]] polarities of [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 100-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism has been seen as having an affinity to postmodern philosophy through a shared interest in [[speech act]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The emphasis on ''practices'', which is one of the most radical powers of both postmodernism and feminism, throws renewed emphasis on speech acts and on the enacted, performative aspects of languages." E. D. Ermarth, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 172-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and theory ==

===Butler===
Postmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that [[sex]], or at least [[gender]] is itself [[social construction|constructed]] through [[discourse|language]], a view notably propounded in [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. She draws on and critiques the work of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as on [[Luce Irigaray]]'s argument that what we conventionally regard as 'feminine' is only a reflection of what is constructed as masculine.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2002) p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler criticises the distinction drawn by previous feminisms between (biological) sex and (socially constructed) [[gender]]. She asks why we assume that material things (such as the body) are not subject to processes of social construction themselves. Butler argues that this does not allow for a sufficient criticism of [[essentialism]]: though recognizing that gender is a social construct, feminists assume it is always constructed in the same way. Her argument implies that [[women]]'s subordination has no single cause or single solution; postmodern feminism is thus criticized for offering no clear path to action.  Butler herself rejects the term "postmodernism" as too vague to be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler, "Contingent Foundations" in Seyla Benhabib et al., ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange'' (New York: Routledge, 1995), pp. 35-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Moya argues that Butler derives this rejection to postmodernism from misreadings of [[Cherríe Moraga]]'s work. "She reads Moraga's statement that 'the danger lies in ranking the oppressions' to mean that we have no way of adjudicating among different kinds of oppressions—that any attempt to casually relate or hierarchize the varieties of oppressions people suffer constitutes an imperializing, colonizing, or totalizing gesture that renders the effort invalid…thus, although Butler at first appears to have understood the critiques of women who have been historically precluded from occupying the position of the 'subject' of feminism, it becomes clear that their voices have been merely instrumental to her" (Moya, 790) Moya contends that because Butler feels that the varieties of oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, that they cannot be ranked at all; and takes a short-cut by throwing out the idea of not only postmodernism, but women in general.&lt;ref&gt;Moya, Paula M.L. ''From Postmodernism, 'Realism,' and the Politics of Identity: [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Chicana feminism|Chicana Feminism]]'' in {{cite book | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = Susan M. | last2 = Gubar | first2 = Susan Eds | title=Feminist literary theory and criticism : a Norton reader | year = 2007 | publisher = W.W. Norton | location = New York | isbn=9780393927900 | pages = 787–797 | edition = 1st | authorlink=From Postmodernism, "Realism," and the Politics of Identity: Cherrie Morage and Chicana Feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frug===
Although [[postmodernism]] resists characterization, it is possible to identify certain themes or orientations that postmodern feminists share. [[Mary Joe Frug]] suggested that one "principle" of postmodernism is that human experience is located "inescapably within language".  Power is exercised not only through direct coercion, but also through the way in which language shapes and restricts our reality. However, because language is always open to re-interpretation, it can also be used to resist this shaping and restriction, and so is a potentially fruitful site of political struggle.

Frug's second postmodern principle is that sex is not something natural, nor is it something completely determinate and definable. Rather, sex is part of a system of meaning, produced by language. Frug argues that "cultural mechanisms ... encode the female body with meanings", and that these cultural mechanisms then go on explain these meanings "by an appeal to the 'natural' differences between the sexes, differences that the rules themselves help to produce".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Joe Frug, "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft)," ''Harvard Law Review'', Vol. 105, No. 5. (Mar., 1992), pp. 1045-1075, at p. 1049.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea of a natural basis to sexual difference allows us to see that it is always susceptible to new interpretations. Like other systems of meaning, it is less like a cage, and more like a tool: it constrains but never completely determines what one can do with it.

===French feminism===
[[French feminism]] from the 1970s onwards has forged specific routes in postmodern feminism and in feminist [[psychoanalysis]], through such writers as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].

Cixous argued for a new form of writing, writing with the body—a kind of writing rooted not in biology but in linguistic change.&lt;ref&gt;Ermath, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Irigaray considered that "man would search, with nostalgia and repulsion, in woman for his own repressed and uncultivated natural pole"—something which would "prevent woman from truly being an other for him".&lt;ref&gt;Luce Irigaray, ''Sharing the World'' (2008) p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristeva argued that 'woman' does not exist, but is rather in a state of becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toril Moi]] has stressed that issues of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] as well as of femininity are central to the concerns of all the above writers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentz eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bornstein===
[[Kate Bornstein]], transgender author and playwright, calls herself a [[postmodernism|postmodern feminist]].

== Critiques ==

Critics like [[Meaghan Morris]] have argued that postmodern feminism runs the risk of undercutting the basis of a politics of action based upon gender difference, through its very anti-essentialism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt, ''The Theatre of Transformation'' (2005) p. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

"One of the most appealing aspects of postmodernism to many feminists has been its focus on difference. The notion that women have been created and defined as 'other' by men has long been argued and explored by feminists, most notably Simone de Beauvoir. She challenged male definitions of woman and called on women to define themselves outside the male female dyad. Women, she urged, must be the subject rather than the object (other) of analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who Is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist Moya Lloyd adds that a postmodernist feminism "does not necessarily represent a post-feminism, but alternatively, can affirm feminist politics in their plural, multivocal, fluid, oft-changing hue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.1993.tb00492.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-structuralism is defined in the Penguin Reference, Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory, as "... a more rigorous working out of the possibilities, implications and shortcomings of structuralism and its basis to Saussurean linguistics itself... . Post-structuralism doubts the adequacy of structuralism and, as far as literature is concerned, tends to reveal that the meaning of any text is, of its nature, unstable. It reveals that signification is, of its nature, unstable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Post-structuralism, pursues further the Saussurean perception that in language there are only differences without positive terms and shows that the signifier and signified are, as it were, not only oppositional, but plural, pulling against each other, and, by so doing, creating numerous deferments of meaning, apparently endless criss-crossing patterns in sequences of meaning. In short, what are called 'disseminations.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gloria Steinem]] has [[Gloria Steinem#Feminist theory|criticized feminist theory]], and especially postmodernist feminist theory, as being overly academic, "I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Psophometric voltage''' is a [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] noise [[voltage]] measured with a [[psophometer]] that includes a CCIF-1951&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[weighting filter|weighting network]]. 

''"Psophometric voltage"'' should not be confused with ''"psophometric emf," i.e.'', the emf in a generator or [[line (electrical engineering)|line]] with 600 Ω internal resistance. For practical purposes, the psophometric emf is twice the corresponding psophometric voltage. 

Psophometric voltage readings, ''V'', in millivolts, are commonly converted to [[dBm]](psoph) by dBm(psoph) = 20 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;57.78.

:"transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education..."[section 300.24(a)]. 

Students who need [[special education]] and specially designed instruction are eligible for related serves under ''IDEA''.  During the evaluation process the student is evaluated to first find out if the student has a disability, and secondly to determine what types of related services the student requires.  Within ''IDEA'' it can be in many forms. 

The related services include:  audiology, counseling services, early identification, family training-counseling and home visits, health services, medical services, nursing services, nutrition services, occupational therapy, orientation and mobility services, parent counseling and training, physical therapy, psychological services, recreation and therapeutic recreation, rehabilitative counseling services, interpretation services,  school health services, service coordination services, social work services in schools, speech pathology and speech-language pathology, transportation and related costs, and assistive technology and services.  Related services were mandated in the ''IDEA'' 1997, and more than 6.1 million children with disabilities received related services in 1998-1999 (Nichcy). 

Children with exceptionalities depend on related services in their individualized education programs.  The related services according to ''IDEA'', "...assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education" [section 300.24(a)].  Related services also help children with exceptionalities to reach their IEP goals and objectives.  In fact, in the IEP the related services section is located directly after the goals and objectives section.  The IEP requires the document constructor to list the service provided, the location that the service will be provided in, the frequency that the service will be provided, the projected beginning date of the service, and the anticipated duration of the service.  In order to make sure that this section of the IEP is written correctly is it essential that the service provider of the particular service either attend the IEP meeting, or send a written document describing the details of the service that will be provided.

{{otheruses|Assimilation (disambiguation)}}

'''Religious assimilation''' refers to the adoption of a majority or dominant [[culture]]'s [[Religion|religious]] practices and [[Belief|beliefs]] by a minority or subordinate culture. It is an important form of [[cultural assimilation]].

Religious assimilation includes the [[religious conversion]] of individuals from a minority [[faith]] to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious [[indoctrination]] of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among [[Immigration|immigrant]] groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems.{{r|Connor-2010|p=134}}

In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion.{{r|Connor-2010|p=3}} Some researchers, such as [[Will Herberg]], have advanced a thesis of perpetual [[religious pluralism]], to the effect that [[Immigration|immigrants]] would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture.{{r|Yang-and-Ebaugh-2010|p=368}} Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of [[religious persecution]].{{r|LeMay-2010}} These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.{{r|LeMay-2010}}

'''''Rhema''''' (ῥῆμα in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]) literally means an "utterance" or "thing said" in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of linguistics'' by Mark Aronoff, Janie Rees-Miller 2003 {{ISBN|1-4051-0252-7}} page 83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8LDiR11nYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sophists (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3, Part 1)'' by W. K. C. Guthrie 1977 {{ISBN|0-521-09666-9}} page 220 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pDOqZfQ5tqUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvF4TLqoCoaG4Qb9zr27Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], it was used by both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to refer to [[proposition]]s or sentences.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"/&gt;

In [[Christianity]], it is used in reference to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou''; Jesus Christ's sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun [[wikt:ῥῆμα|ῥῆμα]] "saying, utterance, word, verb" is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) "say" (cf. [[wikt:εἴρω|εἴρω]] "I say"; ἐρῶ "I will say") and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.

Both [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) used the terms ''logos'', ''rhema'' and ''onoma''. In Plato's usage, a [[logos]] (often translatable as a ''sentence'') is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema ''which denotes actions'' and onoma a ''mark set on those who do the actions''.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} page 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: ''onoma'', ''rhema'' and ''logos''. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion—grammar or logic, as in the table on the right. But it was only in the 12th century that grammarians began to think in terms of units we understand as ''subject'' and ''predicate''.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} page 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Septuagint usage==
The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms ''rhema'' and ''logos'' as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew]] word ''[[dabar]]'', as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 {{ISBN|0-8028-2404-8}} page 508 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Rhema (doctrine)}}
In Christianity, ''rhema'' is used in [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] to signify Jesus Christ's utterances.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Greek word ''rhema'' is useful to distinguish between two meanings of ''word''. While both ''rhema'' and ''logos'' are translated into the English ''word'', in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction.

Some modern usage distinguishes ''rhema'' from ''logos'' in [[Christian theology]], with ''rhema'' at times called "spoken word",&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; referring to the revelation received by disciples when the  [[Holy Spirit]] "speaks" to them.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;''What Every Christian Ought to Know'' by Adrian Rogers 2005 {{ISBN|0-8054-2692-2}} page 162 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0os7ZiHsf0C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Identified Life of Christ'' by Joe Norvell 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-294-3}} page [https://books.google.com/books?id=3FAhz_eshkMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this usage, "Logos" refers to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian controversy'' by William G.

The '''science of morality''' may refer to various forms of [[ethical naturalism]] grounding [[morality]] in rational, [[empirical]] consideration of the natural world.&lt;ref name="sep-naturalism-moral"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Lenman |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Moral Naturalism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/naturalism-moral/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Moral science may refer to the consideration of what is best for, and how to maximize the [[flourishing]] of, either particular individuals&lt;ref&gt;Carrier&lt;/ref&gt; or all conscious creatures.&lt;ref name="tedharris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Moral Landscape'', pp. 39ff&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that "morality" can be appropriately defined on the basis of fundamental premises necessary for ''any'' empirical, secular, and philosophical discussion and that societies can use the methods of science to provide answers to moral questions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Daleiden ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations''; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', 2010; and Richard Carrier ''Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = In sum, from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on [[David Hume|Hume]]’s warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences.

The norms advocated by moral scientists (e.g. rights to [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], and [[drug liberalization]] under certain circumstances) would be founded upon the shifting and growing collection of human understanding.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;  Even with science's admitted degree of ignorance, and the various semantic issues, moral scientists can meaningfully discuss things as being ''almost certainly'' "better" or "worse" for promoting flourishing.&lt;ref name=HarrisFlourishing&gt;Sam Harris (2010), page 183: "Much of the skepticism I encounter when speaking about these issues comes from people who think "happiness" is a superficial state of mind and that there are far more important things in life than "being happy." Some reasers may think that concepts like "well-being" and "flourishing" are similarly effete. However, I don't know of any better terms with which to signify the most positive states of being to which we can aspire. One of the virtues of thinking about a moral landscape, the heights of which remain to be discovered, is that it frees us from these semantic difficulties. Generally speaking, we need only worry about what it will mean to move "up" as opposed to "down".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In philosophy===
[[Utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] discussed some of the ways moral investigations are a science.&lt;ref&gt;''Deontology, or The Science of Morality''&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes [[Deontology|deontological ethics]] for failing to recognize that it needed to make the same presumptions as his science of morality to really work – whilst pursuing rules that were to be obeyed in every situation (something that worried Bentham).

[[W.V.O. Quine]] advocated naturalizing epistemology by looking to natural sciences like psychology for a full explanation of knowledge.{{explain|date=October 2015}} His work contributed to a resurgence of moral naturalism in the last half of the 20th century. [[Paul Kurtz]], who believes that the careful, secular pursuit of normative rules is vital to society, coined the term ''eupraxophy'' to refer to his approach to normative ethics. [[Steven Pinker]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Peter Singer]] believe that we learn what is right and wrong through reason and empirical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/steven-pinker-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debate1&gt;At 11:25 in the video debate at http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maria Ossowska.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Maria Ossowska]] used the methods of science to understand the origins of moral norms.]]
[[Maria Ossowska]] thought that sociology was inextricably related to philosophical reflections on morality, including normative ethics. She proposed that science analyze: (a) existing social norms and their history, (b) the psychology of morality, and the way that individuals interact with moral matters and prescriptions, and (c) the sociology of morality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/6/3/311 Marcin T. Zdrenka. (2006). "Moral philosopher or sociologist of morals?". Journal of Classical Sociology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular literature===
The theory and methods of a normative science of morality are explicitly discussed in Joseph Daleiden's ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations'' (1998). Daleiden's book, in contrast to Harris, extensively discusses the relevant philosophical literature.  In ''[[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]'', [[Sam Harris]]'s goal is to show how moral truth can be backed by "science", or more specifically, [[empirical knowledge]], critical thinking, philosophy, but most controversially, the [[scientific method]].

[[Patricia Churchland]] offers that, accepting [[David Hume|Hume]]'s [[Is–ought problem|is-ought problem]], the use of induction from premises and definitions remains a valid way of reasoning in life and science.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|Our moral behavior, while more complex than the social behavior of other animals, is similar in that it represents our attempt to manage well in the existing social ecology....from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on Hume's warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences....The truth seems to be that values rooted in the circuitry for caring—for well-being of self, offspring, mates, kin, and others—shape social reasoning about many issues: conflict resolutions, keeping the peace, defense, trade, resource distribution, and many other aspects of social life in all its vast richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia Smith |last=Churchland |year=2011 |title=Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13703-2 |lccn=2010043584 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLsIzyFR08IC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Patricia Churchland|Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality}}

Daleiden and [[Leonard Carmichael]] warn that science is probabilistic, and that [[certainty]] is not possible. One should therefore expect that moral prescriptions will change as humans gain understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p502, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|To quote Carmichael: "We do not turn aside from what we know about astronomy at any time because there is still a great deal we do not know, or because so much of what we once thought we knew is no longer recognized as true. May not the same argument be accepted in our thinking about ethical and esthetic judgements?"&lt;ref&gt;Leaonard Carmichael, the chapter "Absolutes, Relativism and the Scientific Psychology of Human Nature", H. Schoeck and J. Wiggins (eds), in the book "Relativism and the Study of Man, Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand, 1961, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

==Views in scientific Morality==
{{See also|Moral psychology}}

===Training to promote good behaviour===
The science of morality may aim to discover the best ways to motivate and shape individuals. Methods to accomplish this include instilling explicit [[virtue]]s, building [[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|character strengths]], and forming [[Association (psychology)|mental associations]]. These generally require some level of practical reason. James Rest suggested that abstract reasoning is also a factor in making moral judgements&lt;ref name=RestJudging/&gt; and emphasized that moral judgements alone do not predict moral behaviour: “Moral judgement may be closely related to advocacy behaviour, which in turn influences social institutions, which in turn creates a system of norms and sanctions that influences people’s behaviour.”&lt;ref name=RestJudging&gt;James R. Rest, Development in Judging Moral Issues. (1979). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Daleiden suggested that religions instill a practical sense of virtue and justice, right and wrong. They also effectively use art and myths to educate people about moral situations.&lt;ref&gt;323, 326, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of government====
Harris argues that moral science does not imply an "[[George Orwell|Orwell]]ian future" with "scientists at every door". Instead, Harris imagines data about normative moral issues being shared in the same way as other sciences (e.g. peer-reviewed journals on medicine).&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ www.salon.com] Asked "Let's say scientists do end up discovering moral truths. How are they supposed to enforce their findings? Would they become something like policemen or priests?" Harris writes ''"They wouldn’t necessarily enforce them any more than they enforce their knowledge about human health. What are scientists doing with the knowledge that smoking causes cancer or obesity is bad for your health, or that the common cold is spread by not washing your hands? We’re not living in some Orwellian world where we have scientists in lab coats at every door. Imagine we discovered that there is a best way to teach your children to be compassionate, or to defer short-term gratification in the service of a long-term goal. What if it turns out to be true that calcium intake in the first two years of life has a significant effect on a child’s emotional life? If we learn that, what parent wouldn’t want that knowledge? The fear of a "Brave New World" component to this argument is unfounded."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Daleiden specifies that government, like any organization, should have limited power. He says "centralization of power irrevocably in the hands of one person or an elite has always ultimately led to great evil for the human race. It was the novel experiment of democracy—a clear break with tradition—that ended the long tradition of tyranny.”&lt;ref&gt;219, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also explicit that [[government]] should only use law to enforce the most basic, reasonable, evidence and widely supported moral norms. In other words, there are a great many moral norms that should never be the task of the government to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;273–274, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of punishment====
{{Main|Differential reinforcement|Prison}}
One author has argued that to attain a society where people are motivated by conditioned self-interest, [[punishment]] must go hand-in-hand with [[reward system|reward]].&lt;ref&gt;77, Daleiden (1998), quote “We use rewards and punishments, praise and blame, in training any animal. The human species is only different in degree in this regard, not in kind.”&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in this line of reasoning, prison remains necessary for many perpetrators of crimes. This is so, even if libertarian free will is false. This is because punishment can still serve its purposes: it deters others from committing their own crimes, educates and reminds everyone about what the society stands for, incapacitates the criminal from doing more harm, goes some way to relieving or repaying the victim, and corrects the criminal (also see [[recidivism]]). This author argues that, at least, any prison system ''should'' be pursuing those goals, and that it is an empirical question as to what sorts of punishment realize these goals most effectively, and how well various [[prison]] systems actually serve these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;289, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
{{see also| Positive psychology|Moral development}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ "Bzdok, D. et al. Parsing the neural correlates of moral cognition: ALE meta-analysis on morality, theory of mind, and empathy. Brain Struct Funct, 2011."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons’ points of view and to grasping others’ feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.
An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R. Nathan |title=Salience network engagement with the detection of morally laden information |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=July 2017 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1118–1127 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsx035|pmid=28338944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The salience network responds to behaviorally salient events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeley |first1=W. W. |last2=Menon |first2=V. |last3=Schatzberg |first3=A. F. |last4=Keller |first4=J. |last5=Glover |first5=G. H. |last6=Kenna |first6=H. |last7=Reiss |first7=A. L. |last8=Greicius |first8=M. D. |title=Dissociable Intrinsic Connectivity Networks for Salience Processing and Executive Control |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |date=28 February 2007 |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=2349–2356 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5587-06.2007|pmc=2680293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menon |first1=Vinod |last2=Uddin |first2=Lucina Q. |title=Saliency, switching, attention and control: a network model of insula function |journal=Brain Structure and Function |date=29 May 2010 |volume=214 |issue=5–6 |pages=655–667 |doi=10.1007/s00429-010-0262-0|pmc=2899886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes. This suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain networks and their interactions.

===Other implications===

Daleiden provides examples of how science can use empirical evidence to assess the effect that specific behaviors can have on the well-being of individuals and society with regard to various moral issues. He argues that science supports [[Drug liberalization|decriminalization and regulation of drugs]], euthanasia under some circumstances, and the permission of sexual behaviors that are not tolerated in some cultures (he cites [[homosexuality]] as an example). Daleiden further argues that in seeking to reduce human suffering, [[abortion]] should not only be permissible, but at times a moral obligation (as in the case of a mother of a potential child who would face the probability of much suffering). Like all moral claims in his book, however, Daleiden is adamant that these decisions remain grounded in, and contingent on empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Joseph Daleiden's final word regarding his book, ''The Science of Morality,'' is that “[The study of ethics] should be included with the social sciences and be subject to as rigorous a scientific program of research as any other area of human behaviour. Lacking this scientific rigour, the moral conclusions drawn in this volume must be considered as working hypotheses, some with greater degree of evidentiary support than others. It is the process by which to assess and transmit moral norms that was the primary focus of this work, and I hope it will serve as a new way of deciding moral issues.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of [[cultural relativity]], to Daleiden, do offer some lessons: investigators must be careful not to judge a person's behaviour without understanding the environmental context. An action may be necessary and more moral once we are aware of circumstances.&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"&gt;100, Daleiden&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daleiden emphasizes that this does not mean all ethical norms or systems are equally effective at promoting flourishing&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"/&gt; and he often offers the equal treatment of women as a reliably superior norm, wherever it is practiced.

== Criticisms ==

The idea of a normative science of morality has met with some criticisms. Critics include physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]], who argues that morality cannot be part of science.&lt;ref name=twsJun14eef&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Sean Carroll
 |title= Science And Morality: You Can’t Derive 'Ought' From 'Is'
 |publisher= ''NPR''
 |quote= Casting morality as a maximization problem might seem overly restrictive at first glance, but the procedure can potentially account for a wide variety of approaches. A libertarian might want to maximize a feeling of personal freedom, while a traditional utilitarian might want to maximize some version of happiness. The point is simply that the goal of morality should be to create certain conditions that are, in principle, directly measurable by empirical means. ...Nevertheless, I want to argue that this program is simply not possible. ... Morality is not part of science, however much we would like it to be. There are a large number of arguments one could advance for in support of this claim, but I'll stick to three.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and other critics cite the widely held "[[fact-value distinction]]", that the [[scientific method]] cannot answer "moral" questions, although it can describe the norms of different cultures. In contrast, moral scientists defend the position that such a division between values and scientific facts ("moral relativism") is not only arbitrary and illusory, but impeding progress towards taking action against documented cases of human rights violations in different cultures.&lt;ref name=Moralconfusion&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= There are also very practical, moral concerns that follow from the glib idea that anyone is free to value anything—the most consequential being that it is precisely what allows highly educated, secular, and otherwise well-intentioned people to pause thoughtfully, and often interminably, before condemning practices like compulsory veiling, genital excision, bride-burning, forced marriage, and the other cheerful products of alternative “morality” found elsewhere in the world. Fanciers of Hume’s is/ought distinction never seem to realize what the stakes are, and they do not see what an abject failure of compassion their intellectual “tolerance” of moral difference amounts to. While much of this debate must be had in academic terms, this is not merely an academic debate. There are women and girls getting their faces burned off with acid at this moment for daring to learn to read, or for not consenting to marry men they have never met, or even for the crime of getting raped.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that science and religion occupy "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]". To Gould, science is concerned with questions of fact and theory, but not with meaning and morality – the magisteria of religion. In the same vein, [[Edward Teller]] proposed that politics decides what is right, whereas science decides what is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5367/1200 Essays on Science and Society. "Science and Morality".]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a discussion on the role that [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] might play in professions like [[nursing]], Philosopher Trevor Hussey calls the popular view that science is unconcerned with morality "too simplistic". Although his main focus in the paper is naturalism in nursing, he goes on to explain that science can, at very least, be interested in morality at a descriptive level. He even briefly entertains the idea that morality could itself be a scientific subject, writing that one ''might'' argue "..that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one. If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here."
{{#tag:ref|Hussey writes "The relationship between naturalism and morality and politics is complicated, and is difficult to state in a few sentences because it involves deep philosophical issues. Only the briefest discussion is possible here. The most popular view is that science, and hence naturalism, is concerned with objective facts and not with values: with what is the case rather than what ought to be. But this is too simplistic." He gives a reason immediately: "First, at the very least, science can study morality and politics at a descriptive level and try to understand their workings within societies and in the lives of individuals, and investigate their evolutionary origins, their social propagation, and so on." Hussey then describes how scientists must adhere to certain values, but also how values guide what it is that science may investigate. His real interest in the paper is to justify naturalism as a nursing practice, yet he does eventually write: "Finally, the idea that science and morality are separate realms, one dealing with facts the other with values, is not as certain and clear-cut as it seems. Various versions of moral realism are now widely discussed among philosophers (e.g. Railton, 1986, 1996, 2003; Sayre-McCord, 1988; Dancy, 1993; Casebeer, 2003; Shafer-Landau, 2003; Baghramian, 2004; Smith, 1994, 2004). Despite their differences, moral realists generally agree on two principles. First, that our moral utterances, such as ‘Murder is morally wrong’ or ‘We ought to be honest’ are genuine statements and hence they are capable of being either true or false. Second, what makes them either true or false are aspects of the real world, open to objective examination. It can be argued that it is an implication of this thesis that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one." He continues "If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here. It is sufficient to say that it has at least as much credibility as any theory claiming a supernatural or divine foundation for morality: views which, while popular among the general public, do not have widespread support among moral philosophers – for what that is worth." Hussey thus directs discussion back towards Naturalism in nursing because his main point in all this was, in the end, to prove that naturalistic moralities are not necessarily less credible than supernatural ones, and may even be more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Naturalistic nursing, Trevor Hussey (2011), Nursing Philosophy, Vol 12, Pg.45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

'''Segmental analysis''' is a method of [[anatomical]] analysis for describing the connective [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the [[human body]]. Instead of describing anatomy in terms of spatial relativity, as in the [[anatomical position]] method, segmental analysis describes anatomy in terms of which organs, tissues, etc. connect to each other, and the characteristics of those connections.

'''Social orphan''' is a term in various foreign languages, such as Ukrainian,&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/16/marcel-theroux-ukraines-street-children | title=Marcel Theroux: life with Ukraine's street children | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=May 17, 2012 | location=London | date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; denoting that a child has no adults looking after it, even though one or more parents are still alive. Usually the parents are alcoholics, drug abusers, or simply are not interested in the child. It is therefore not the same as an [[orphan]], who has no living parents.

The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] has brought many countries to reassess their mandate to care for children inside their borders thus bringing to light various new ways of thinking about international [[child care]].{{fact|date=May 2012}}

==Populations==
In a study of [[Honduras]] it was found that 54.3% of children commonly identified as "orphans" were actually social orphans.&lt;ref&gt;Tercer informe periódico sobre la situación en el cumplimiento de la Convención de los Derechos del Niño {{cite web |url=http://www.ihnfa.hn/Documentos/Informe_sobre_cumplimiento_de_la_CDN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611052315/http://www.ihnfa.hn/Documentos/Informe_sobre_cumplimiento_de_la_CDN.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }} (Honduras Data)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Star Walk''''' is an application developed for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] by [[Vito Technology]] presented in the mobile software market since 2001.

The objective of ''Star Walk'' is to help [[astronomy]] amateurs, students and professionals locate and identify over 200,000 stars, [[planets]], [[constellations]] and [[satellites]] in the night sky. Since its release ''Star Walk'' has been downloaded more than 5 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17 of Apple's Favorite Apps|url=http://money.cnn.com/gallery/magazines/fortune/2013/04/08/17-of-apples-favorite-apps.fortune/9.html|publisher=Money.cnn.com|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
[[File:StarWalk-iPad-screenshot.png|left|upright|thumb|300px|''Time Machine'' will help users explore the map of the night sky of tomorrow or years ago.]]

The application allows users to explore [[astronomical objects]] in real time, watch moon phases, [[meteor showers]], [[iridium flares]], see daily [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]] times, elevation angle, and day length. Most of the objects in the application are complemented with extensive information about them.

''Star Walk'' shows users a list of upcoming celestial events which they can add to the calendar and set a reminder for.

Also, the application is equipped with time machine feature which gives an opportunity to explore the map of the night sky in the past and future.
Besides, ''Star Walk'' uses iOS device camera for [[augmented reality]] feature. It combines the image data from camera with the star map to give the user a real time view of [[celestial objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Jason|title=iPad App Review Marathon Live (Part 2)|url=https://gizmodo.com/5509335/ipad-app-review-marathon-live-part-2|publisher=Gizmodo.com|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sublime Frequencies''' is a [[record label]] based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] that focuses exclusively on "acquiring and exposing obscure sights and sounds from modern and traditional urban and rural frontiers," mostly from [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].

The releases are usually divided into four categories: [[field recordings]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music|pop]] compilations, radio collages from specific geographic locales, and [[DVD]]s. The label is headed by [[Alan Bishop]] and [[Hisham Mayet]]. Its releases are produced in limited quantities (usually 1,000 copies).

Its mission statement is:  Sublime Frequencies is a collective of explorers dedicated to acquiring and exposing obscure sights and sounds from modern and traditional urban and rural frontiers via film and video, field recordings, radio and short wave transmissions, international folk and pop music, sound anomalies, and other forms of human and natural expression not documented sufficiently through all channels of academic research, the modern recording industry, media, or corporate foundations. Sublime Frequencies is focused on an aesthetic of [[extra-geography]] and soulful experience inspired by music and culture, world travel, research.

In 2014 Sublime Frequencies created a [[Bandcamp]] page where listeners can listen to and purchase digital copies of some albums or individual tracks, including some previously sold-out albums. In 2016 E. Tammy Kim and Michael E. Veal published Punk Ethnography: Artists &amp; Scholars Listen to Sublime Frequencies which is a collection of interviews and essays about the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Veal|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Kim|editor2-first=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">{{short description|The sixth of 17 Sustainable Development Goals calling for clean water and sanitation for all people by 2030}}
'''Sustainable Development Goal 6''' ('''SDG6''' or '''SDG 6'''), one of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and [[sanitation]] for all people. The official wording is: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal has eight targets to be achieved by at least 2030. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven "indicators."     

SDG6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  For example, improving sanitation also helps make cities more sustainable (Goal 11). Sanitation improvements can lead to more jobs (Goal 8) which would also lead to economic growth (Goal 8).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  SDG6 progress improves [[health]] (Goal 3) and [[social justice]] (Goal 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targets==

SDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020 and one has no target year.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators for SDG6.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]:&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt; 

# By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]] for all
# By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] for all and end [[open defecation]], paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
# By 2030, improve water quality by reducing [[Water pollution|pollution]], eliminating dumping and minimizing release of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]] and materials, halving the proportion of untreated [[wastewater]] and substantially increasing [[Reclaimed water|recycling and safe reuse]] globally

Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption supports education and employment, both of which are the foundation of alleviating poverty. Therefore, toilets at school and at the work place are included in the second target ("achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all"). Equitable sanitation and hygiene solutions address the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.

Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. Preserving natural sources of water is very important so as to achieve universal access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]]. Therefore, one target aims to reduce [[water pollution]] by eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and untreated [[wastewater]]. The potential for recycling and safe [[Reclaimed water|reuse of wastewater]] is also mentioned.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt;

==Indicators==
[[File:Pit latrines in Zambia (3233256285).jpg|thumb|Unimproved sanitation example: [[pit latrine]] without slab in [[Lusaka]], Zambia]]
The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]] services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The current statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The JMP is a joint program of [[UNICEF]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and compiles data to monitor SDG6 progress. 

The definition of safely managed sanitation service is: "Use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite."&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Links with other SDGs==
The SDGs are all interlinked. [[WASH]] experts have stated that without progress on Goal 6, the other goals and targets cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="IPSnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/10/opinion-sanitation-water-hygiene-for-all-cannot-wait-for-2030/|title=Opinion: “Sanitation, Water &amp; Hygiene For All” Cannot Wait for 2030|last1=Rao Gupta|first1=Geeta|date=October 2015|website=Inter Press|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/beyond-the-sdgs-how-to-deliver-water-and-sanitation-to-everyone-everywhere-86975|title=Beyond the SDGs: How to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhere|last1=Batty|first1=Margaret|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, accomplishing the other SDGs will require assuring clean water and sanitation for all as stated in SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=SuSanA|first=|date=2017|website=|publisher=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sanitation systems with a [[Reuse of excreta|resource recovery]] and reuse focus are getting increased attention and can contribute to achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20170919145350-bovq7|title=The rise of the sanitation economy: how business can help solve a global crisis|last=Paranipe|first=Nitin|date=14 November 2017|website=Thomson Reuters Foundation News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Kim|last2=Dickin|first2=Sarah|last3=Rosemarin|first3=Arno|date=2016-12-08|title=Towards "Sustainable" Sanitation: Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Areas|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1289|doi=10.3390/su8121289}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving Goal 12 ([[sustainable consumption]] and [[sustainable production|production]]) and Goal 2 (end hunger). 

Ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal 11 ([[sustainable cities]] and communities), Goal 1 (no poverty) and Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Organizations==

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) works on sanitation issues as a global network of 9000 individuals and 300 partner organizations. Global organizations such as [[Oxfam]], [[UNICEF]], [[WaterAid]] and many small NGOs as well as universities, research centres, private enterprises, government-owned entities etc. are all part of SuSanA and are dedicated to achieving SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the population. This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko,, Tan, Tay Keong,, Flynn, Patricia M.,|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UCL Institute of Jewish Studies''' is an institute located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] dedicated to the academic study of all branches of [[Jewish]] history and civilization.&lt;ref name=jpr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/publications/publication.php?id=97&amp;sid=106|title=Appendix 1: Jewish Communal Organizations Engaged in Representation|accessdate=8 October 2010|publisher=Institute for Jewish Policy Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a privately funded institute within the Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at [[University College London|University College London (UCL)]], the largest department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=jpr/&gt;&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/aboutus/aboutus.php|title=About Us |accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=UCL Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is located at the [[UCL Main Building|main UCL campus]] in [[Bloomsbury]], close to the [[The British Library|British Library]], the [[Wiener Library]], the [[Warburg Institute]], [[Dr Williams's Library]], the library of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] and the UCL Jewish Studies Collection, which houses the Moccatta Library, the Altman Collection and a substantial collection of unique Yiddish material.&lt;ref name=contact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ijs/contact-us|title=Contact us|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Institute of Jewish Studies, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The staff and students are mostly Jewish, unlike other UK faculties for Jewish studies in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4me0TRqPOB4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=,+The+Oxford+handbook+of+Jewish+studies&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3H3uTdGrFo3F8QOk-72WBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford handbook of Jewish studies |author1=Martin Goodman |author2=Jeremy Cohen |author3=David Sorkin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Institute was founded by [[Alexander Altmann]] in [[Manchester]] in 1954 as the Institute of Jewish Studies.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ijs/about-us|title=About Us|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Institute of Jewish Studies, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, following the departure of Altmann as director, the Institute moved to UCL.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

Altmann's justification for the activities of the Institute was given in a 1957 lecture to the [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel Foundation]] of London {{Harv|Ivry|Wolfson|Arkush|1998}}:

{{quotation|''Being connected with our past, at home in our literature, and in sympathy with ourselves as it were, we shall find it easier to approach the ultimate questions.''}}

[[Victor Mishcon, Baron Mishcon|Victor Mishcon]] became chairman of the Institute in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/30/guardianobituaries.mainsection|title=Obituary: Lord Mishcon|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Events===

The Institute organises public lectures, symposia and seminars throughout the academic year, where leading scholars from Europe, [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] communicate the results of their research to scholars, students and the public, thereby creating the opportunity for regular exchange of ideas and interests.&lt;ref name=events&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ijs/events|title=Events|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Institute of Jewish Studies, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute also hosts one or more major international conferences annually, which focus on significant themes relating to Jewish civilisation, and bring together eminent scholars from different countries working in the same or allied fields of research.&lt;ref name=events/&gt;

===Research===

The Institute regularly sponsors research projects by postgraduates and scholars in important academic fields.

===Publications===

The Institute sponsors the publication of its conference proceedings and other academic works in co-operation with publishers, including [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Oxford University Press]], and the Littman Library of Jewish Civilisation.&lt;ref name=publicat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ijs/publications|title=Publications|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Institute of Jewish Studies, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanical engineering]], '''ultimate failure''' describes the breaking of a material.  In general there are two types of failure: [[fracture]] and [[buckling]].  Fracture of a material occurs when either an internal or external crack elongates the width or length of the material.  In ultimate failure this will result in one or more breaks in the material.  Buckling occurs when compressive loads are applied to the material and instead of cracking the material bows.  This is undesirable because most tools that are designed to be straight will be inadequate if curved.  If the buckling continues, it will create tension on the outer side of the bend and compression on the inner side, potentially fracturing the material.

In engineering there are multiple types of failure based upon the application of the material.  In many machine applications any change in the part due to yielding will result in the machine piece needing to be replaced.  Although this deformation or weakening of the material is not the technical definition of ultimate failure, the piece has failed.  In most technical applications pieces are rarely allowed to reach their ultimate failure or breakage point, instead for safety factors they are removed at the first signs of significant wear.

There are two different types of fracture: brittle and ductile.  Each of these types of failure occur based on the material's [[ductility]].  Brittle failure occurs with little to no plastic deformation before fracture.  An example of this would be stretching a clay pot or rod, when it is stretched it will not neck or elongate, but merely break into two or more pieces.  While applying a tensile stress to a ductile material, instead of immediately breaking the material will instead elongate.  The material will begin by elongating uniformly until it reaches the [[yield (engineering)|yield]] point, then the material will begin to neck.  When necking occurs the material will begin to stretch more in the middle and the radius will decrease.  Once this begins the material has entered a stage called plastic deformation.  Once the material has reached its [[ultimate tensile strength]] it will elongate more easily until it reaches ultimate failure and breaks.

'''Zenodotus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ζηνόδοτος}}) was a [[Greek language|Greek]] grammarian, [[literary critic]], [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholar]], and the first [[librarian]] of the [[Library of Alexandria]].{{efn|name="Two Others}} A native of [[Ephesus]] and a pupil of [[Philitas of Cos]], he lived during the reigns of the first two [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], and was at the height of his reputation about 280 BC.

==Biography==
Zenodotus was the first superintendent of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and the first critical editor ({{lang|grc|διορθωτής}} ''diorthōtes'') of [[Homer]]. His colleagues in the librarianship were [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander of Aetolia]] and [[Lycophron of Chalcis]], to whom were allotted the tragic and comic writers respectively, Homer and other epic poets being assigned to Zenodotus.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

Although he has been reproached with arbitrariness and an insufficient knowledge of Greek, his recension undoubtedly laid a sound foundation for future criticism. Having collated the different manuscripts in the library, he expunged or obelized doubtful verses, transposed or altered lines, and introduced new readings. It is probable that he was responsible for the division of the Homeric poems into twenty-four books each (using capital Greek letters for the ''[[Iliad]]'', and lower-case for the ''[[Odyssey]]''){{dubious|date=March 2016}}, and possibly was the author of the calculation of the days of the ''Iliad'' in the ''[[Tabula Iliaca]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

He does not appear to have written any regular commentary on Homer, but his Homeric {{lang|grc|γλῶσσαι}} (''[[wikt:γλῶσσα|glōssai]]'', "lists of unusual words, [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]]") probably formed the source of the explanations of Homer attributed by the grammarians to Zenodotus. He also lectured upon [[Hesiod]], [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] and [[Pindar]], if he did not publish editions of them. He is further called an epic poet by the ''[[Suda]],'' and three epigrams in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' are assigned to him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

In addition to his other scholarly work, Zenodotus introduced an organization system on the materials in the [[Library of Alexandria]] whereby texts were assigned to different rooms based on their subject matter. Within their subjects, Zenodotus organized the works [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] by the first letter of the name of their author. The principle of alphabetic organization was introduced by Zenodotus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}  In addition, library staff attached a small tag to the end of each scroll which contained information on each work’s author, title, and subject so that materials could be easily returned to the area in which they had been classified, but also so that library users did not have to unroll each scroll in order to see what it contained. This was the first recorded use of [[metadata]], a landmark in library history.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}

==Notes==
{{noteslist|refs=
{{efn|name="Two Others|There appear to have been at least two other grammarians of the same name:
#''Zenodotus of Alexandria'', surnamed {{lang|grc|ὁ ἐν ἄστει}} (''ho en astei'', "the one from the city", i.e. Alexandria)
#''Zenodotus of Mallus'', the disciple of [[Crates of Mallus|Crates]], who like his master attacked [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]]}}
