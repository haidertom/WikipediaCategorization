* Greater emphasis on analysis of concepts and themes
* Shifting focus to coverage of six core countries: China, Great Britain, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia (France and India were eliminated)

'''Advanced Placement World History''' (also known as '''AP World History''', '''WHAP''', '''AP World''' or '''APWH''') is a college-level course and examination offered to high school students through the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement Program]] designed to help students develop a greater understanding of the evolution of global processes and contacts as well as interactions between different types of human society. The course advances this understanding through a combination of selective factual knowledge and appropriate analytical skills. Students study all prehistory and history, especially from 8000 [[Common Era|BC]]E to the present day. It was announced in July 2018 that the test would be changed to an AP World History: Modern exam that only contains content since 1200 CE, starting in the 2019-2020 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-world-history/course/2019-20-changes|title=SA:WH:2019-20 AP World History Changes|work=AP Central|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP World History exam was first administered in 2002. The course has undergone multiple changes with the latest changes effective Fall 2017. Often times in the United States, students take the course in their sophomore year of high school, but this is not a requirement.

The multiple choice section is weighted as 40% of one's  total score (Section I Part A). It consists of 55 questions to be answered in 55 minutes based on the accompanying sources.

While previously the exam deducted 1/4 of a point for every incorrect answer, starting from 2011 on, the penalty for incorrect answers had been removed. It is to one's advantage to attempt every question possible within the time limit.  Note also that the number of multiple choice options is being reduced from five to four at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP World History Course and Exam Description|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/AP_WorldHistoryCED_Effective_Fall_2011.pdf|publisher=College Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This test underwent a major re-haul for the 2017 exam, however, due to the prodigious number of students that struggled with the free response section, the College Board decided to initiate yet another round of sweeping reform, to be put in effect in May 2018. Currently it has the same format as [[Advanced Placement United States History]] and [[Advanced Placement European History]]. The exam features a new section (Section I Part B) that requires three short answer questions, one of which is selected from two options. Each question has three parts, making for a total of 9 parts within the SAQ section. Students have forty minutes to answer these, and they count for twenty percent of the exam score.

Section II lasts for a total of 100 minutes, and it includes a document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question (LEQ). Students are allowed to work on either essay within this total time period. The section begins with a 15-minute reading period where students are advised to read both the documents for DBQ. However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen. Each LEQ prompt addresses a different period, with one addressing periods 1 &amp; 2, another addressing periods 3 &amp; 4, and a third addressing periods 5 &amp; 6.

The DBQ counts for 25% of the total exam score, and the LEQ is 15%. The essays are out of seven points and six points, respectively. Students are required to analyze and synthesize the documents of the DBQ, but some outside information is still needed. The LEQ only provides a prompt and no sort of stimulus, so a large amount of outside information is necessary.

In 2012, the head of AP Grading, Trevor Packer, stated that the reason for the low percentages of 5s is that "AP World History is a college-level course, &amp; many sophomores aren't yet writing at that level." 10.44 percent of all seniors who took the exam in 2012 received a 5, while 6.62 percent of sophomores received a 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AP_Trevor/status/215559243930144770|title=Trevor Packer|work=Twitter|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Art Workers News''''', also known as '''''Art &amp; Artists''''', was the highly influential artist-run publication of the [[Foundation for the Community of Artists]] (FCA), an organization that grew out of the National Art Workers Community (a splinter group of the [[Art Workers Coalition|Art Workers’ Coalition]]). From 1971 to 1989, the publication was the paper of record for the world of working artists. Its circulation reached a high of 40 thousand subscribers.
{{infobox newsletter
|image=Art and Artists Full Page.jpg
}}

Originally a four-page newsletter, ''Art Workers News'' grew into a monthly newspaper. During the early 1980s, FCA changed the publication’s name to ''Art&amp;Artists'' and made it a bi-monthly.

Rather than reviewing shows, AWN/A&amp;A focused on topics central to the lives of working artists in the 1970s and ’80s, (and continuing today): artist housing, health hazards, business practices, health insurance, women’s issues, issues affecting artists of color, law and the arts and censorship were impacting the daily life of artists. The publication featured, as well, contemporary theories and philosophies in the arts, general news articles, a select number of book reviews, commentaries, editorials and special issues.

The special issues were wide-ranging, reflecting the times and the interests of the editors and writers who were involved at a given time over the course of its existence.

Special issues included: “Art Against Apartheid.” “Art and Sports,” “Are There Too Many Artists?,” “Tilted Arc by Richard Serra,” "Museums," and “Artists Against US Intervention in Central America.”

''Art Workers News'' was also the publication of record for the [[CETA_Artists_Project_(NYC_Cultural_Council_Foundation_1978-80)|Comprehensive Employment Act (CETA) Artists Program]] in New York City and documented the work of artists in all media associated with the project.&lt;ref&gt;Judd Tully, a writer for the CETA Artists Project, has digitized some of his ''AWN'' articles (retrieved 1/30/18) &lt;http://juddtully.net/publications/art-workers-news/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''AWN/A&amp;A'' produced 160 issues over eighteen years. Editors and production staff were volunteers; writers and photographers were paid (minimally) in accordance with the belief that people, including artists and writers, deserved to be paid for their work. The journal newspaper gave voice to many artists, critics and journalists who were prominent in the cultural milieu of its time, as well as to younger professionals at the start of their careers.

Many of the original newsprint issues and some microfiche editions are catalogued in libraries across the U.S., Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;WorldCat lists the number of libraries archiving AWN/A&amp;A at 44 (retrieved 1/30/18) &lt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/artworkers-news/oclc/3257241&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Fales Library at New York University has most of the volumes, and is a source for researchers, artists, art historians, students and scholars. Gwen Allen, a professor at San Francisco State University includes additional information about the publication in her book, ''Artists’ Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art.''&lt;ref&gt;''Artists’ Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art'', Gwen Allen, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011, p 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference took place in March 2010 and the recommendations were published in November 2010. The goal was identify and minimize risks involved with [[climate engineering]] (geoengineering), and was based on the 1975 [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]] which discussed the potential biohazards and regulation of [[biotechnology]]. A group of over 150 scientist and engineers gathered together with lawyers, environmentalists and [[disaster relief]] workers in an open meeting to avoid accusations of conspiracy  during this discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/Doc_Zone/1242299559/ID=1664956266 CBC.ca Player&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Asilomar Conference focused exclusively on the development of [[Disaster Risk Reduction|risk reduction]] guidelines for climate intervention experiments.&lt;ref name="climateresponsefund.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://climateresponsefund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=81 |title=Conference Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2010-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016101517/http://climateresponsefund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=81 |archive-date=2012-10-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan 1916 QST Oscillating Audion.png|thumb|Schematic of an early autodyne receiver.]]

The '''autodyne''' circuit was an improvement to radio signal amplification using the [[Lee De Forest|De Forest]] [[Audion]] vacuum tube amplifier. By allowing the tube to oscillate at a frequency slightly different from the desired signal, the sensitivity over other receivers was greatly improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|p=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autodyne circuit was invented by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] of [[Columbia University]], New York, NY.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  He inserted a tuned circuit in the output circuit of the Audion [[vacuum tube]] amplifier.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!-- why use Audion when triode was available? July 2018 - Huh? The Audion IS a triode! --&gt;  By adjusting the tuning of this tuned circuit, Armstrong was able to dramatically increase the gain of the Audion amplifier.  Further increase in tuning resulted in the Audion amplifier reaching self-oscillation.

This [[oscillating]] receiver circuit meant that the then latest technology continuous wave (''CW'') transmissions could be demodulated.  Previously only spark, interrupted continuous wave (''ICW'', signals which were produced by a motor chopping or turning the signal on and off at an audio rate), or modulated continuous wave (MCW), could produce intelligible output from a receiver.

When the autodyne oscillator was advanced to self-oscillation, continuous wave [[Morse code]] dots and dashes would be clearly heard from the headphones as short or long periods of sound of a particular tone, instead of an all but impossible to decode series of thumps. Spark and chopped CW (ICW) were amplitude modulated signals which didn't require an oscillating detector.
Such a [[regenerative circuit]] is capable of receiving weak signals, if carefully coupled to an antenna. Antenna coupling interacts with tuning, making optimum adjustments difficult.

==Heterodyne detection==
{{Main|Heterodyne}}

===Damped wave transmission===
Early transmitters emitted ''damped waves'', which were radio frequency sine wave bursts of a number of cycles duration, of decreasing amplitude with each cycle. These bursts recurred at an audio frequency rate, producing an amplitude modulated transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damped waves were a result of the available technologies to generate radio frequencies.  ''See'' [[spark gap transmitter]]. The transmitters could be keyed on and off to send Morse code.

Receivers could be made with a tuned circuit, a [[crystal detector]], and a headphone. The headphone would respond to the detected bursts, and the operator could copy the Morse code. The received signal was not a sinewave. Instead of a crystal detector, a Fleming valve (tube diode) could be used; it was a stable detector, but not very sensitive. Even better was a using a vacuum triode because it provided some amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[regenerative receiver]] supplied even more gain, but required careful adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undamped wave transmission===
Damped wave transmission had drawbacks, and the focus shifted to ''undamped waves'' or ''continuous wave'' (CW) transmission. The [[arc converter]] could produce high power CW transmissions.

The typical damped wave receiver was ineffective for receiving CW because CW had, ideally, no modulation of the radio frequency during the period of the dot or dash. Several methods were employed to generate an audible tone at the receiver: (1) a chopper, (2) a variable condensor with rotating plates (slope demodulation), (3) a [[tikker]], (4) a separate heterodyne, and (5) the autodyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bureau of Standards|1922|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fessenden researched the heterodyne detector.&lt;!-- and need more... --&gt;

==Application==
The autodyne was widely used in both commercially produced and amateur receiver designs from shortly after the time of its invention until the middle 1930s. It became popular at the beginning of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] (ca early 1930s) for [[Frequency_mixer|''first detector'']] applications in superheterodyne receivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_malloryMYE_73827616/MYE_Technical_Manual_1942#page/n31/mode/2up  P. R. Mallory &amp; Co., ''MYE Technical Manual'', Indianapolis: P. R. Mallory &amp; Co., 1942, p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, ''autodyne converters'' are employed in radio receivers for the AM and FM broadcast band. A single transistor combines the functions of amplifier, mixer and local oscillator of an otherwise conventional [[superheterodyne receiver]]. Such a stage accepts as input the antenna signal, and provides an output to the intermediate frequency amplifier. In this application, the transistor is made to self-oscillate at the local oscillator frequency.

The autodyne detector has appeared in specialized fields in the 1960s through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bruin |first=F. |last2=Van Soest |first2=P.

In biology, a '''cline''' (from the Greek ''“klinein”'', meaning ''“to lean”'') is a measurable gradient in a single character (or biological trait) of a species across its [[Range (biology)|geographical range]].&lt;ref name="Huxley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=Julian|title=Clines: an Auxiliary Taxonomic Principle|journal=Nature|date=30 July 1938|volume=142|issue=3587|pages=219–220|doi=10.1038/142219a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; First coined by [[Julian Huxley]] in 1938, the “character” of the cline referred to is usually genetic (e.g [[allele frequency]], [[blood type]]), or phenotypic (e.g. body size, skin pigmentation). Clines can show smooth, continuous gradation in a character, or they may show more abrupt changes in the trait from one geographic region to the next.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

A cline refers to a spatial gradient in a specific, singular trait, rather than a gradient in a [[population]] as a whole.&lt;ref name= "Huxley biography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dronamraju|first1=Krishna R.|last2=Needham|first2=Joseph|title=If I Am To Be Remembered: Correspondence Of Julian Huxley|date=1993|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xrLsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=continuous+discontinuous+clines#v=onepage&amp;q=continuous%20discontinuous%20clines&amp;f=false|isbn=9789814505192}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single population can therefore theoretically have as many clines as it has traits.&lt;ref name="Forest genetics" /&gt; Additionally, Huxley recognised that these multiple independent clines may not act in concordance with each other. For example, it has been observed that in Australia, birds generally become smaller the further towards the north of the country they are found. In contrast, the intensity of their plumage colouration follows a different geographical trajectory, being most vibrant where humidity is highest and becoming less vibrant further into the arid centre of the country.&lt;ref name= "Mayr1963"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Populations, species, and evolution: an abridgment of Animal species and evolution|date=1963|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qNGQ_uP5njUC|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because of this, clines were defined by Huxley as being an “auxiliary taxonomic principle”; that is, clinal variation in a species is not awarded taxonomic recognition in the way [[subspecies]] or [[species]] are.&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

While the terms “[[ecotype]]” and “cline” are sometimes used interchangeably, they do in fact differ in that “ecotype” refers to a population which differs from other populations in a number of characters, rather than the single character that varies amongst populations in a cline.&lt;ref name="Forest genetics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Timothy L.|last2=Adams|first2=W.

==Drivers and the evolution of clines==
[[File:Gene flow (butterflies).svg|thumb|upright=1|Two populations with individuals moving between the populations to demonstrate gene flow.]]
Clines are often cited to be the result of two opposing drivers: [[Natural selection|selection]] and [[gene flow]] (also known as migration).&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; Selection causes [[adaptation]] to the local environment, resulting in different genotypes or phenotypes being favoured in different environments. This diversifying force is countered by gene flow, which has a homogenising effect on populations and prevents [[speciation]] through causing [[genetic admixture]] and blurring any distinct genetic boundaries.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt;

===Development of clines===
Clines are generally thought to arise under one of two conditions: “primary differentiation” (also known as "primary contact" or "primary intergradation" ), or “secondary contact” (also known as "secondary introgression", or "secondary intergradation").&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayr1942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

====Primary differentiation====
[[File:Final Primary Differentiation.svg|thumb|upright=1|Primary differentiation is demonstrated using the peppered moth as an example, with a change in an environmental variable such as sooty coverage of trees imposing a selective pressure on a previously uniformly coloured moth population. This causes the frequency of melanic morphs to increase the more soot there is on vegetation.]]
Clines produced through this way are generated by spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions. The mechanism of selection acting upon organisms is therefore external. Species ranges frequently span environmental gradients (e.g. humidity, rainfall, temperature, or day length) and, according to natural selection, different environments will favour different [[genotype]]s or [[phenotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles R.|title=On the Origin of Species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life|date=1859|publisher=London: John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, when previously genetically or phenotypically uniform populations spread into novel environments, they will evolve to be uniquely adapted to the local environment, in the process potentially creating a gradient in a genotypic or phenotypic trait.

Such clines in characters can not be maintained through selection alone if lots of gene flow occurred between populations, as this would tend to swamp out the effects of local adaptation. However, because species usually tend to have a limited dispersal range (e.g. in an [[isolation by distance]] model), restricted gene flow can serve as a type of barrier which encourages geographic differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Sewall|title=Isolation by Distance|journal=Genetics|date=1943|volume=28|issue=2|pages=114–138|pmc=1209196|pmid=17247074}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some degree of migration is often required to maintain a cline; without it, [[speciation]] is likely to eventually occur, as local adaptation can cause reproductive isolation between populations.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

A classic example of the role of environmental gradients in creating clines is that of the peppered moth, [[Peppered moth|''Biston betularia'']], in the UK. During the 19th century, when the industrial sector gained traction, coal emissions blackened vegetation across northwest England and parts of northern Wales. As a result of this, lighter [[morph (zoology)|morph]]s of the moth were more visible to predators against the blackened tree trunks and were therefore more heavily predated relative to the darker morphs. Consequently, the frequency of the more [[Crypsis|cryptic]] melanic morph of the peppered moth increased drastically in northern England. This cline in morph colour, from a dominance of lighter morphs in the west of England (which did not suffer as heavily from pollution), to the higher frequency of melanic forms in the north, has slowly been degrading since limitations to sooty emissions were introduced in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saccheri|first1=Illik J.|last2=Rousset|first2=Francois|last3=Watts|first3=Phillip C.|last4=Brakefield|first4=Paul M.|last5=Cook|first5=Laurence M.|title=Selection and gene flow on a diminishing cline of melanic peppered moths|journal=PNAS|date=2008|volume=105|issue=42|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secondary contact====
{{main|Secondary contact}}
[[File:Secondary Introgression.svg|thumb|upright=1|Secondary contact between two previously isolated populations. Two previously isolated populations establish contact and therefore gene flow, creating an intermediate zone in the phenotypic or genotypic character between the two populations.]] 
Clines generated through this mechanism have arisen through the joining of two formerly isolated populations which differentiated in [[allopatric speciation|allopatry]], creating an intermediate zone. This secondary contact scenario may occur, for example, when climatic conditions change, allowing the ranges of populations to expand and meet.&lt;ref name="Mayr1942" /&gt; Because over time the effect of gene flow will tend to eventually swamp out any regional differences and cause one large homogenous population, for a stable cline to be maintained when two populations join there must usually be a selective pressure maintaining a degree of differentiation between the two populations.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

The mechanism of selection maintaining the clines in this scenario is often intrinsic. This means that the fitness of individuals is independent of the external environment, and selection is instead dependent on the genome of the individual. Intrinsic, or endogenous, selection can give rise to clines in characters though a variety of mechanisms. One way it may act is through [[heterozygote]] disadvantage, in which intermediate genotypes have a lower relative fitness than either homozygote genotypes. Because of this disadvantage, one allele will tend to become fixed in a given population, such that populations will consist largely of either ''AA'' ([[homozygote|homozygous]] dominant) or ''aa'' (homozygous recessive) individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazykin|first1=A. D.|title=Hypothetical Mechanism of Speciation|journal=Evolution|date=1969|volume=23|issue=4|pages=685–687|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1969.tb03550.x|pmid=28562864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cline of heterozygotes that is created when these respective populations come into contact is then shaped by the opposing forces of selection and gene flow; even if selection against heterozygotes is great, if there is some degree of gene flow between the two populations, then a steep cline may be able to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Benjamin M.|title=Alternative forms for genomic clines|journal=Ecology and Evolution|date=July 2013|volume=3|issue=7|pages=1951–1966|doi=10.1002/ece3.609|pmid=23919142|pmc=3728937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Richard G.|title=Hybrid Zones and the Evolutionary Process|date=1993|publisher=Oxford Univserity Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aFJFkVKskYIC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=frequency+dependent+selection+clines#v=onepage&amp;q=frequency%20dependent%20selection%20clines&amp;f=true|accessdate=17 April 2018|isbn=9780195069174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because instrinsic selection is independent of the external environment, clines generated by selection against hybrids are not fixed to any given geographical area and can move around the geographic landscape.&lt;ref name="EoE" /&gt; Such [[hybrid zone]]s where hybrids are a disadvantage relative to their parental lines (but which are nonetheless maintained through selection being counteracted by gene flow) are known as “tension zones”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazykin|first1=A. D.|title=Hypothetical Mechanism of Speciaton|journal=Evolution|date=December 1969|volume=23|issue=4|pages=685–687|doi=10.2307/2406862|pmid=28562864|jstor=2406862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which selection can generate clines is through [[frequency-dependent selection]]. Characters that could be maintained by such frequency-dependent selective pressures include warning signals ([[aposematism]]). For example, aposematic signals in ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies sometimes display steep clines between populations, which are maintained through [[Frequency-dependent selection#Positive|positive frequency dependence]].&lt;ref name="Richard1993" /&gt; This is because heterozygosity, [[mutation]]s and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] can all produce patterns that deviate from those well-established signals which mark prey as being unpalatable. These individuals are then predated more heavily relative to their counterparts with "normal" markings (i.e. selected against), creating populations dominated by a particular  pattern of warning signal. As with heterozygote disadvantage, when these populations join, a narrow cline of intermediate individuals could be produced, maintained by gene flow counteracting selection.&lt;ref name="Richard1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mallet|first1=James|last2=Barton|first2=Nicholas H.|title=Strong natural selection in a warning-colour hybrid zone|journal=Evolution|date=1989|volume=43|issue=2|jstor=2409217|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary contact  could lead to a cline with a steep gradient if heterozygote disadvantage or frequency-dependent selection exists, as intermediates are heavily selected against. Alternatively, steep clines could exist because the populations have only recently established secondary contact, and the character in the original allopatric populations had a large degree of differentiation. As genetic admixture between the population increases with time however, the steepness of the cline is likely to decrease as the difference in character is eroded. However, if the character in the original allopatric populations was not very differentiated to begin with, the cline between the populations need not display a very steep gradient.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; Because both primary differentiation and secondary contact can therefore give rise to similar or identical clinal patterns (e.g. gently sloping clines), distinguishing which of these two processes is responsible for generating a cline is difficult and often impossible.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; However, in some circumstances a cline and a geographic variable (such as humidity) may be very tightly linked, with a change in one corresponding closely to a change in the other. In such cases it may be tentatively concluded that the cline is generated by primary differentiation and therefore moulded by environmental selective pressures.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

====No selection (drift/migration balance)====
While selection can therefore clearly play a key role in creating clines, it is theoretically feasible that they might be generated by [[genetic drift]] alone. It is unlikely that large-scale clines in genotype or phenotype frequency will be produced solely by drift. However, across smaller geographical scales and in smaller populations, drift could produce temporary clines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Futuyma|first1=Douglas|title=Evolution|date=2005|publisher=Sinauer Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that drift is a weak force upholding the cline however means that clines produced this way are often random (i.e uncorrelated with environmental variables) and subject to breakdown or reversal over time.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; Such clines are therefore unstable and sometimes called “transient clines”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polechová|first1=Jitka|last2=Barton|first2=Nick|title=Genetic Drift Widens the Expected Cline but Narrows the Expected Cline Width|journal=Genetics|date=September 2011|volume=189|issue=1|pages=227–235|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.129817|pmid=21705747|pmc=3176109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinal structure and terminology==
[[File:Character-Cline Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1|Clinal characters change from one end of the geographic range to another. The extent of this change is reflected in the slope of the cline.]]
The steepness, or gradient, of a cline reflects the extent of the differentiation in the character across a geographic range.&lt;ref name="Endler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Endler|first1=John A.|title=Geographic Variation, Speciation, and Clines|date=1977|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BL12fYUMobwC&amp;dq=rassenkreis+cline|isbn=978-0691081922}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a steep cline could indicate large variation in the colour of plumage between adjacent bird populations. It has been previously outlined that such steep clines may be the result of two previously allopatric populations with a large degree of difference in the trait having only recently established gene flow, or where there is strong selection against hybrids. However, it may also reflect a sudden environmental change or boundary. Examples of rapidly changing environmental boundaries like this include abrupt changes in the heavy metal content of soils, and the consequent narrow clines produced between populations of ''[[Agrostis]]'' that are either adapted to these soils with high metal content, or adapted to "normal" soil.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain|first1=S K|last2=Bradshaw|first2=A D|title=Evolutionary divergence among adjacent plant populations I. The evidence and its theoretical analysis|journal=Heredity|date=1 August 1966|volume=21|issue=3|pages=407–441|doi=10.1038/hdy.1966.42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a shallow cline indicates little geographical variation in the character or trait across a given geographical distance. This may have arisen through weak differential environmental selective pressure, or where two populations established secondary contact a long time ago and gene flow has eroded the large character differentiation between the populations.

The gradient of a cline is related to another commonly referred to property, clinal width. A cline with a steep slope is said to have a small, or narrow, width, while shallower clines have larger widths.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Numerical Taxonomy|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BW7tCAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=cline+slope+steepness|isbn=9783642690242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of clines==
[[File:Clinal Variation by Huxley.svg|thumb|upright=1|Categories and subcategories of clines, as defined by Huxley.]]
According to Huxley, clines can be classified into two categories; continuous clines and discontinuous stepped clines.&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt; These types of clines characterise the way that a genetic or phenotypic trait transforms from one end of its geographical range of the species to the other. 

===Continuous clines===
In continuous clines, all populations of the species are able to interbreed and there is gene flow throughout the entire range of the species. In this way, these clines are both biologically (no clear subgroups) and geographically (contiguous distribution) continuous. 
Continuous clines can be further sub-divided into smooth and stepped clines. 
*Continuous smooth clines are characterised by the lack of any abrupt changes or delineation in the genetic or phenotypic trait across the cline, instead displaying a smooth gradation throughout. Huxley recognised that this type of cline, with its uniform slope throughout, was unlikely to be common. 
*Continuous stepped clines consist of an overall shallow cline, interspersed by sections of much steeper slope. The shallow slope represents the populations, and the shorter, steeper sections the larger change in character between populations.&lt;ref name="hedrick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hedrick|first1=Philip|title=Genetics of Populations|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stepped clines can be further subdivided into horizontally stepped clines, and obliquely stepped clines. 
**Horizontally stepped clines show no intra-population variation or gradation in the character, therefore displaying a horizontal gradient. These uniform populations are connected by steeper sections of the cline, characterised by larger changes in the form of the character. However, because in continuous clines all populations exchange genetic material, the intergradation zone between the groups can never have a vertical slope.&lt;ref name="hedrick" /&gt; 
**In obliquely stepped clines, conversely, each population also demonstrates a cline in the character, albeit of a shallower slope than the clines connecting the populations together. Huxley compared obliquely stepped clines to looking like a “stepped ramp”, rather than taking on the formation of a staircase as in the case of horizontally stepped clines.&lt;ref name="Huxley biography" /&gt;

===Discontinuous stepped clines===
Unlike in continuous clines, in discontinuous clines the populations of species are allopatric, meaning there is very little or no gene flow amongst populations. The genetic or phenotypic trait in question always shows a steeper gradient between groups than within groups, as in continuous clines. Discontinuous clines follow the same principles as continuous clines by displaying either
*Horizontally stepped clines, where intra-group variation is very small or non-existent and the geographic space separating groups shows a sharp change in character
*Obliquely stepped clines, where there is some intra-group gradation, but this is less than the gradation in the character between populations&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

==Clines and speciation==
[[File:Parapatric Speciation Schematic.svg|thumb|upright=1|[[Parapatric speciation]]]]
It was originally assumed that geographic isolation was a necessary precursor to speciation ([[allopatric speciation]]).&lt;ref name="Mayr1942"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species from the viewpoint of a zoologist|date=1942|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that clines may be a precursor to speciation was therefore ignored, as they were assumed to be evidence of the fact that in contiguous populations gene flow was too strong a force of homogenisation, and selection too weak a force of differentiation, for speciation to take place.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; However, the existence of particular types of clines, such as [[ring species]], in which populations did not differentiate in allopatry but the terminal ends of the cline nonetheless do not interbreed, cast into doubt whether complete geographical isolation of populations is an absolute requirement for speciation.

Because clines can exist in populations connected by some degree of gene flow, the generation of new species from a previously clinal population is termed [[parapatric speciation]]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic selection can serve to generate varying degrees of [[reproductive isolation]] and thereby instigate the process of [[speciation]]. For example, through environmental selection acting on populations and favouring particular allele frequencies, large genetic differences between populations may accumulate (this would be reflected in clinal structure by the presence of numerous very steep clines). If the local genetic differences are great enough, it may lead unfavourable combinations of genotypes and therefore to hybrids being at a decreased fitness relative to the parental lines. When this hybrid disadvantage is great enough, natural selection will select for [[Reproductive isolation#Pre-zygotic isolation|pre-zygotic]] traits in the homozygous parental lines that reduce the likelihood of disadvantageous hybridisation - in other words, natural selection will favour traits that promote assortative mating in the parental lines.&lt;ref name="EoE"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jorgensen|first1=Sven|last2=Fath|first2=Brian|title=Encyclopaedia of Ecology|date=2014|publisher=Newnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]] and plays an important role in parapatric and [[sympatric speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coyne|first1=Jerry A.|last2=Orr|first2=H. Allen|title=Speciation|date=2004|publisher=Sinauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

==Clinal maps==
Clines can be portrayed graphically on maps using lines that show the transition in character state from one end of the geographic range to the other. Character states can however additionally be represented using isophenes, defined by Ernst Mayr as “lines of equal expression of a clinally varying character”.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; In other words, areas on maps that demonstrate the same biological phenomenon or character will be connected by something that resembles a contour line. When mapping clines therefore, which follow a character gradation from one extreme to the other, isophenes will transect clinal lines at a right angle.

==Examples of clines==
[[File:Northern red fox &amp; southern desert red fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Bergmann's Rule demonstrated showing the difference in size between a larger northern fox, whose range spans colder regions, and a smaller desert fox, whose range is primarily in hot regions.]]
Although the term “cline” was first officially coined by Huxley in 1938, gradients and geographic variations in the character states of species have been observed for centuries. Indeed, some gradations have been considered so ubiquitous that they have been labelled [[Biological rules|ecological “rules”]]. One commonly cited example of a gradient in morphology is [[Gloger's rule|Gloger's Rule]], named after [[C. L. Gloger|Constantin Gloger]], who observed in 1833 that environmental factors and the pigmentation of avian [[plumage]] tend to covary with each other, such that birds found in arid areas near the Equator tend to be much darker than those in less arid areas closer to the Poles.  Since then, this rule has been extended to include many other animals, including flies, butterflies, and wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Fundamentals of Biogeography|date=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ecogeographical rules include [[Bergmann’s rule|Bergmann's Rule]], coined by [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]] in 1857, which states that [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] closer to the Equator tend to be smaller than their more northerly or southerly conspecifics.&lt;ref name="Wool" /&gt; One of the proposed reasons for this cline is that larger animals have a relatively smaller surface area to volume ratio and therefore improved heat conservancy – an important advantage in cold climates.&lt;ref name="Wool"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wool|first1=David|title=The Driving Forces of Evolution: Genetic Processes in Populations|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ydWuuBw6xeYC&amp;dq=huxley+1942+cline|isbn=9781578084456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the environment in imposing a selective pressure and producing this cline has been heavily implicated due to the fact that Bergmann’s Rule has been observed across many independent lineages of species and continents. For example, the [[house sparrow]], which was introduced in the early 1850s to the eastern United States, evolved a north-south gradient in size soon after its introduction. This gradient reflects the gradient that already existed in the house sparrow’s native range in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Geoecology: An evolutionary approach|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Geoecology.html?id=VyQjwI9UkVIC|isbn=9780415086899}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
[[File:Ring Species (gene flow around a barrier) BLANK.png|thumb|right|Interbreeding populations represented by a gradient of coloured circles around a geographic barrier]]
[[File:Ring species seagull.svg|thumb|right|The ''Larus'' gulls interbreed in a ring around the arctic.&lt;br /&gt;1: ''Larus argentatus argentatus'', 2: ''Larus fuscus'' (''sensu stricto''), 3: ''Larus fuscus heuglini'', 4: ''Larus argentatus birulai'', 5: ''Larus argentatus vegae'', 6: ''Larus argentatus smithsonianus'', 7: ''Larus argentatus argenteus'']]
[[Ring species]]&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of biogeography'', Richard J. Huggett, 2nd ed. (2004), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; are a distinct type of cline where the geographical distribution in question is circular in shape, so that the two ends of the cline overlap with one another, giving two adjacent populations that rarely [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]] due to the cumulative effect of the many changes in phenotype along the cline. The populations elsewhere along the cline interbreed with their geographically adjacent populations as in a standard cline. In the case of ''[[Larus]]'' gulls, the habitats of the end populations even overlap, which introduces questions as to what constitutes a species: nowhere along the cline can a line be drawn between the populations, but they are unable to interbreed.&lt;ref name="Larus"&gt;''[[Larus]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, clines in the frequency of blood types has allowed scientists to infer past population migrations. For example, the Type B blood group reaches its highest frequency in Asia, but become less frequent further west. From this, it has been possible to infer that some Asian populations migrated towards Europe around 2,000 years ago, causing genetic admixture in an [[isolation by distance]] model. In contrast to this cline, blood Type A shows the reverse pattern, reaching its highest frequency in Europe and declining in frequency towards Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birx|first1=H. James|title=Encyclopaedia of Anthropology|date=2006|publisher=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational science''' (also '''scientific computing''' or '''scientific computation''' ('''SC''')) is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. It is an area of science which spans many disciplines, but at its core it involves the development of models and simulations to understand natural systems.

*  [[Algorithm]]s ([[Numerical analysis|numerical]] and non-numerical): [[Mathematical model|mathematical models]], [[Computational model|computational models]], and [[Computer simulation|computer simulations]] developed to solve [[science]] (e.g., [[Computational biology|biological]], [[Computational physics|physical]], and [[Computational sociology|social]]), [[engineering]], and [[humanities]] problems
* [[Computer and information science]] that develops and optimizes the advanced system [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], [[Computer network|networking]], and [[data management]] components needed to solve computationally demanding problems
* The computing infrastructure that supports both the science and engineering problem solving and the developmental computer and information science 
In practical use, it is typically the application of [[computer simulation]] and other forms of [[computation]] from [[numerical analysis]] and [[theoretical computer science]] to solve problems in various scientific disciplines. The field is different from theory and laboratory experiment which are the traditional forms of science and [[engineering]]. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding, mainly through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on [[computer]]s. Scientists and engineers develop [[computer programs]], [[application software]], that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters. The essence of computational science is the application of numerical algorithms&lt;ref&gt;Nonweiler T. R., 1986. Computational Mathematics: An Introduction to Numerical Approximation, John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[computational mathematics]]. In some cases, these models require massive amounts of calculations (usually [[floating-point]]) and are often executed on [[supercomputer]]s or [[distributed computing]] platforms.

== The computational scientist ==
[[File:Ways to study a system.png|thumb|Ways to study a system]]
The term [[computational scientist]] is used to describe someone skilled in scientific computing. This person is usually a scientist, an engineer or an applied mathematician who applies [[high-performance computing]] in different ways to advance the state-of-the-art in their respective applied disciplines in physics, chemistry or engineering.

Computational science is now commonly considered a third mode of [[science]], complementing and adding to [[experimentation]]/[[observation]] and [[theory]] (see image on the right).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering].Siam.org, [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) website; accessed Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, we define a [[system]] as a potential source of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Modeling and Simulation|last=Siegler|first=Bernard|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[experiment]] as a process of extracting data from a system by exerting it through its inputs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuous System Modelling|last=Cellier|first=François|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Computer model|model]] (''M'') for a system (''S'') and an experiment (''E'') as anything to which E can be applied in order to answer questions about S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Models,Minds, Machines|last=Minski|first=Marvin|publisher=|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A computational scientist should be capable of:
* recognizing '''complex problems'''
* adequately '''conceptualise''' the system containing these problems
* design a framework of algorithms suitable for studying this system: the '''simulation'''
* choose a suitable '''computing infrastructure''' ([[parallel computing]]/[[grid computing]]/[[supercomputer]]s)
* hereby, maximising the '''computational power''' of the simulation
* assessing to what level the output of the simulation resembles the systems: the model is '''validated'''
* adjust the conceptualisation of the system accordingly
* repeat cycle until a suitable level of validation is obtained: the computational scientists trusts that the simulation generates adequately realistic results for the system, under the studied conditions
In fact, substantial effort in computational sciences has been devoted to the development of algorithms, the efficient implementation in programming languages, and validation of computational results. A collection of problems and solutions in computational science can be found in Steeb, Hardy, Hardy and Stoop (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Steeb W.-H., Hardy Y., Hardy A. and Stoop R., 2004. Problems and Solutions in Scientific Computing with C++ and Java Simulations, World Scientific Publishing. {{ISBN|981-256-112-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers of science addressed the question to what degree computational science qualifies as science, among them Humphreys&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Paul. ''Extending ourselves: Computational science, empiricism, and scientific method.'' Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gelfert&lt;ref&gt;Gelfert, Axel. 2016. ''How to do science with models: A philosophical primer.'' Cham: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; They address the general question of epistemology: how do we gain insight from such computational science approaches. Tolk&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, Andreas. "Learning Something Right from Models That Are Wrong: Epistemology of Simulation." In ''Concepts and Methodologies for Modeling and Simulation,'' edited by L. Yilmaz, pp. 87-106, Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; uses these insights to show the epistemological constraints of computer-based simulation research. As computational science uses mathematical models representing the underlying theory in executable form, in essence they apply modeling (theory building) and simulation (implementation and execution). While simulation and computational science are our most sophisticated way to express our knowledge and understanding, they also come with all constraints and limits already known for computational solutions.

== Applications of computational science ==
Problem domains for computational science/scientific computing include:

=== Urban complex systems ===
In 2015, over half the worlds population live in cities. By the middle of the 21st century, it is estimated that 75% of the world’s population will be [[Urban area|urban]]. This urban growth is focused in the urban populations of developing countries where cities dwellers will more than double, increasing from 2.5 billion in 2009 to almost 5.2 billion in 2050. Cities are massive complex systems created by humans, made up of humans and governed by humans. Trying to predict, understand and somehow shape the development of cities in the future requires complexity thinking, and requires computational models and simulations to help mitigate challenges and possible disasters. The focus of research in urban complex systems is, through modelling and simulation, to build greater understanding of city dynamics and help prepare for the coming [[Urbanization|urbanisation]].

=== Computational finance ===
{{main|Computational finance}}
In today’s [[financial market]]s huge volumes of interdependent assets are traded by a large number of interacting market participants in different locations and time zones. Their behavior is of unprecedented complexity and the characterization and measurement of the risk inherent to these highly diverse set of instruments is typically based on complicated [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] and [[computational model]]s. Solving these models exactly in closed form, even at a single instrument level, is typically not possible, and therefore we have to look for efficient [[numerical algorithm]]s. This has become even more urgent and complex recently, as the credit crisis has clearly demonstrated the role of cascading effects going from single instruments through portfolios of single institutions to even the interconnected trading network. Understanding this requires a multi-scale and holistic approach where interdependent risk factors such as market, credit and liquidity risk are modelled simultaneously and at different interconnected scales.

=== Computational biology ===
{{main|Computational biology}}
Exciting new developments in [[biotechnology]] are now revolutionizing biology and [[biomedical research]]. Examples of these techniques are [[DNA sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]], high-throughput [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative PCR]], intra-cellular imaging, [[In situ hybridization|in-situ hybridization]] of gene expression, three-dimensional imaging techniques like [[Light sheet fluorescence microscopy|Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy]] and [[Optical projection tomography|Optical Projection]], (micro)-[[CT scan|Computer Tomography]]. Given the massive amounts of complicated data that is generated by these techniques, their meaningful interpretation, and even their storage, form major challenges calling for new approaches. Going beyond current bioinformatics approaches, computational biology needs to develop new methods to discover meaningful patterns in these large data sets. Model-based reconstruction of [[Gene regulatory network|gene networks]] can be used to organize the gene expression data in systematic way and to guide future data collection. A major challenge here is to understand how gene regulation is controlling fundamental biological processes like [[Biomineralization|biomineralisation]] and [[embryogenesis]]. The sub-processes like [[gene regulation]], [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] interacting with the mineral deposition process, [[Cell (biology)|cellular processes]], [[physiology]] and other processes at the tissue and environmental levels are linked. Rather than being directed by a central control mechanism, biomineralisation and embryogenesis can be viewed as an emergent behavior resulting from a complex system in which several sub-processes on very different [[Temporal scales|temporal]] and [[spatial scale]]s (ranging from nanometer and nanoseconds to meters and years) are connected into a multi-scale system. One of the few available options to understand such systems is by developing a [[Multiscale modeling|multi-scale model]] of the system.

=== Complex systems theory ===
{{main|Complex systems}}
Using [[information theory]], [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium dynamics]] and explicit simulations computational systems theory tries to uncover the true nature of [[complex adaptive system]]s.

=== Computational science in engineering ===
{{main|Computational engineering}}

Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations, often coupled with [[high-performance computing]], to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design (computational engineering) as well as natural phenomena (computational science). CSE has been described as the "third mode of discovery" (next to theory and experimentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cseprograms.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/CSEHandbook-Students-v11.pdf |title=Computational Science and Engineering Program: Graduate Student Handbook | website=cseprograms.gatech.edu |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, computer simulation is integral and therefore essential to business and research. Computer simulation provides the capability to enter fields that are either inaccessible to traditional experimentation or where carrying out traditional empirical inquiries is prohibitively expensive. CSE should neither be confused with pure [[computer science]], nor with [[computer engineering]], although a wide domain in the former is used in CSE (e.g., certain algorithms, data structures, parallel programming, high performance computing) and some problems in the latter can be modeled and solved with CSE methods (as an application area).

==Methods and algorithms==
Algorithms and mathematical methods used in computational science are varied. Commonly applied methods include:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Numerical analysis]]
* Application of [[Taylor series]] as convergent and asymptotic series
* [[Computing]] derivatives by [[Automatic differentiation]] (AD)
* [[Computing]] derivatives by [[finite differences]]
* [[Finite element method]]
* Graph theoretic suites
* High order difference approximations via [[Taylor series]] and [[Richardson extrapolation]]
* [[Methods of integration]] on a uniform [[Mesh (mathematics)|mesh]]: [[rectangle rule]] (also called ''midpoint rule''), [[trapezoid rule]], [[Simpson's rule]]
* [[Runge-Kutta methods|Runge Kutta method]] for solving ordinary differential equations
* [[Monte Carlo method]]s
* [[Molecular dynamics]]

Both historically and today, [[Fortran]] remains popular for most applications of scientific computing.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/scientific-computings-future-can-any-coding-language-top-a-1950s-behemoth/ |title=Scientific computing’s future: Can any coding language top a 1950s behemoth? |last=Phillips |first=Lee |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=2014-05-07 |accessdate=2016-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/landau_firstCourse/FortranCD/AllFort.pdf |format=PDF |title=A First Course in Scientific Computing |last=Landau |first=Rubin |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |date=2014-05-07 |accessdate=2016-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[programming language]]s and [[computer algebra systems]] commonly used for the more mathematical aspects of scientific computing applications include [[GNU Octave]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]],&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt; [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]],&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt; [[Maple (software)|Maple]],&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt; [[Mathematica]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific-computing.com/products/review_details.php?review_id=17 Mathematica 6] Scientific Computing World, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[MATLAB]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (with third-party [[SciPy]] library), [[Perl]] (with third-party [[Perl Data Language|PDL]] library),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[R (programming language)|R]], [[SciLab]], and [[TK Solver]]. The more computationally intensive aspects of scientific computing will often use some variation of [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]] and optimized algebra libraries such as [[BLAS]] or [[LAPACK]].

Computational science application programs often model real-world changing conditions, such as weather, air flow around a plane, automobile body distortions in a crash, the motion of stars in a galaxy, an explosive device, etc. Such programs might create a 'logical mesh' in computer memory where each item corresponds to an area in space and contains information about that space relevant to the model. For example, in weather models, each item might be a square kilometer; with land elevation, current wind direction, humidity, temperature, pressure, etc. The program would calculate the likely next state based on the current state, in simulated time steps, solving equations that describe how the system operates; and then repeat the process to calculate the next state.

==Conferences and journals==

In the year 2001, the [http://www.iccs-meeting.org/ ''International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)''] was first organised. Since then it has been organised yearly. ICCS is an '''A-rank''' conference in CORE classification.

==Education==
At some institutions a specialization in scientific computation can be earned as a "minor" within another program (which may be at varying levels). However, there are increasingly many [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|master's]] and [[doctoral degree|doctoral]] programs in computational science. The joint degree programme [http://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/subsites/graduate-school-of-sciences/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html?origin=5BOaRAofTjCccATraJp2XA master program computational science] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam|Vrije Universiteit]] in computational science was first offered in 2004. In this programme, students:
* learn to build computational models from real-life observations;
* develop skills in turning these models into computational structures and in performing large-scale simulations;
* learn theory that will give a firm basis for the analysis of complex systems;
* learn to analyse the results of simulations in a virtual laboratory using advanced numerical algorithms.

[[George Mason University]] was one of the early pioneers first offering a multidisciplinary doctorate Ph.D program in Computational Sciences and Informatics in 1992 that focused on a number of specialty areas including [[Bioinformatics|bioinformatics]], [[Computational chemistry|computational chemistry]], earth systems and global changes, [[Computational mathematics|computational mathematics]], [[Computational physics|computational physics]], space sciences, and [[Computational statistics|computational statistics]]

The '''''Confutatio Augustana''''' was the [[Roman Catholic]] refutation ([[confutation]]) of the ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'', often referred to in the theological literature as simply the ''Confutatio''.

On 25 June 1530 the Protestant [[Imperial States]] of the realm met at the [[Diet of Augsburg]], and presented [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] with the Augsburg Confession, largely the work of [[Philipp Melanchthon]] setting out the doctrines and practices of the church in the [[Protestation at Speyer|Protestant principalities]]. The emperor commissioned the papal theologians to prepare a response. An initial version of the ''Confutatio'' was rejected by the emperor, as excessively polemic and verbose. In formulating the ''Confutatio'', the lead was taken by Johann Eck. On 3 August 1530, the final version was read at the Diet. The ''Confutatio'' clearly rejected the statements of the Augsburg Confession, and called for a return to the Roman doctrine.

In other respects, however, the ''Confutatio'' found common ground with the Augsburg Confession. Emperor Charles V refused to hand over the text to the Protestants, unless they agreed not to respond, which they refused. But the Protestants had transcribed it as it was read. Melanchthon responded with the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'', completed in 1531, but not presented to the emperor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">The '''Copenhagen Peace Research Institute''' (COPRI) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[research institute]] established in 1985 by the [[Danish Parliament]]. Its aim was to support and strengthen multidisciplinary research on [[peace]] and [[security]].

A '''curtain wall''' system is an outer covering of a building in which the outer walls are non-structural, utilized to keep the weather out and the occupants in.  Since the curtain wall is non-structural, it can be made of lightweight materials, thereby reducing construction costs.  When [[architectural glass|glass]] is used as the curtain wall, an advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall [[façade]] does not carry any [[dead and live loads|structural load]] from the building other than its own dead load weight.  The wall transfers lateral [[wind engineering|wind loads]] that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, absorb sway induced by wind and [[earthquake engineering|seismic]] forces acting on the building, withstand wind loads, and support its own dead load weight forces.

Curtain wall systems are typically designed with [[aluminum extrusion|extruded aluminum]] framing members, although the first curtain walls were made with steel frames. The aluminum frame is typically infilled with glass, which provides an architecturally pleasing building, as well as benefits such as [[daylighting]]. However, the effects of light on visual comfort as well as solar heat gain in a building are more difficult to control when using large amounts of glass infill. Other common infills include: stone veneer, metal panels, [[louver|louvres]], and operable windows or vents.

Curtain walls differ from storefront systems in that they are designed to span multiple floors, taking into consideration design requirements such as: thermal expansion and contraction; [[tuned mass damper|building sway]] and movement; water diversion; and thermal efficiency for cost-effective heating, cooling, and lighting in the building.

==History==
Buildings have long been constructed with the exterior walls of the building supporting the load of the entire structure. The development and widespread use of [[structural steel]] and later [[reinforced concrete]] allowed relatively small [[columns]] to support large loads; hence, exterior walls of buildings were no longer required for structural support. The exterior walls could be non-[[load-bearing wall|load bearing]] and thus much lighter and more open than the masonry load-bearing walls of the past.  This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior façade, and the modern-day curtain wall was born.

Early prototype versions of curtain walls may have existed in buildings of timber construction before the 19th century, should columns have been used to support the building rather than the walls themselves, particularly when large panels of glass infill were involved. When iron began to be used extensively in buildings in late 18th-century Britain such as at [[Ditherington Flax Mill]], and later when buildings of wrought iron and glass such as [[The Crystal Palace]] were built, the building blocks of structural understanding were laid for the development of curtain walls.

[[Oriel Chambers]] (1864) and [[16 Cook Street]] (1866), both built in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], by local architect and [[civil engineer]] [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]], are characterised by their extensive use of glass in their facades. Towards the courtyards they even boasted metal-framed glass curtain walls, which makes them two of the world's first buildings to include this architectural feature. The extensive glass walls allowed light to penetrate further into the building, utilizing more floor space and reducing lighting costs. Oriel Chambers comprises {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} set over five floors without an [[elevator]], which had only recently been invented and was not yet widespread.&lt;ref name="Oriel Chambers History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orielchambers.co.uk/#/411|title=History|publisher=Oriel Chambers|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of an all-steel curtain wall used in the classical style is the ''{{lang|de|Kaufhaus Tietz}}'' department store on ''{{lang|de|[[Leipziger Straße]]}}'', [[Berlin]], built in 1901 (since demolished).&lt;ref name="Tietz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8725928@N02/9416991555/|title=History|publisher= janwillemsen|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first curtain walls were made with steel [[mullions]], and the [[polished plate glass]] was attached to the mullions with asbestos- or fiberglass-modified glazing compound. Eventually [[silicone]] [[sealant]]s or glazing tape were substituted for the glazing compound. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The first curtain wall installed in [[New York City]], in the [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] building (Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, 1952), was this type of construction. Earlier [[modernist]] examples are the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]] (1926) and the [[Hallidie Building]] in [[San Francisco]] (1918).

During the 1970s, the widespread use of aluminium [[extrusion]]s for mullions began. [[Aluminum alloy]]s offer the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease. The [[Omni San Diego Hotel]] curtain wall in California (developed by JMI Realty, designed by architectural firm Hornberger and Worstel, is an example of a unitized curtain-wall system with integrated sunshades.&lt;ref&gt;Wausau Press Releases, [http://www.wausauwindow.com/resources/pressReleases/Wausau_CA_Omni.pdf "Omni San Diego Hotel offers breathtaking Bay views through Wausau’s curtainwall"], ''Wausau Press Releases'', Retrieved 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems and principles==
===Stick systems===
The vast majority of ground-floor curtain walls are installed as long pieces (referred to as ''sticks'') between floors vertically and between vertical members horizontally. Framing members may be fabricated in a shop, but installation and [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] is typically performed at the jobsite.

===Ladder systems===
Very similar to a stick system, a ladder system has mullions which can be split and then either snapped or screwed together consisting of a half box and plate. This allows sections of curtain wall to be fabricated in a shop, effectively reducing the time spent installing the system on site. The drawbacks of using such a system is reduced structural performance and visible joint lines down the length of each mullion.

===Unitized systems===
Unitized curtain walls entail factory fabrication and assembly of panels and may include factory glazing. These completed units are installed on the building structure to form the building enclosure.  Unitized curtain wall has the advantages of: speed; lower field installation costs; and [[quality control]] within an interior climate-controlled environment. The economic benefits are typically realized on large projects or in areas of high field labor rates.

===Rainscreen principle===
A common feature in curtain wall technology, the [[rainscreen]] principle theorizes that equilibrium of air pressure between the outside and inside of the "rainscreen" prevents water penetration into the building. For example, the glass is captured between an inner and an outer gasket in a space called the glazing rebate. The glazing rebate is ventilated to the exterior so that the pressure on the inner and outer sides of the exterior gasket is the same. When the pressure is equal across this gasket, water cannot be drawn through joints or defects in the gasket.

==Design concerns==
Curtain wall systems must be designed to handle all loads imposed on it as well as keep air and water from penetrating the building envelope.

===Loads===
{{main|Structural load}}
The loads imposed on the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure through the anchors which attach the mullions to the building.

;Dead load
''Dead load'' is defined as the weight of structural elements and the permanent features on the structure.&lt;ref&gt;2006 International Building Code, Section 1602.1&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of curtain walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of the curtain wall, as well as the weight of the infill material.  Additional dead loads imposed on the curtain wall may include sunshades or signage attached to the curtain wall.

;Wind load
''Wind load'' is a normal force acting on the building as the result of [[wind]] blowing on the building.&lt;ref&gt;"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures," American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Wind pressure is resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building.  Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in [[hurricane]]-prone regions. For each project location, [[building code]]s specify the required design wind loads. Often, a [[wind tunnel]] study is performed on large or unusually-shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account [[vortex shedding]] around corners and the effects of surrounding topography and buildings.

;Seismic load
''Seismic loads'' in curtain wall system are limited to the interstory drift induced on the building during an earthquake. In most situations, the curtain wall is able to naturally withstand [[seismology|seismic]] and wind induced building sway because of the space provided between the glazing infill and the mullion. In tests, standard curtain wall systems are typically able to withstand up to three inches (75&amp;nbsp;mm) of relative floor movement without glass breakage or water leakage.

;Snow load
''Snow loads'' and [[dead and live loads|live loads]] are not typically an issue in curtain walls, since curtain walls are designed to be vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures," American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

;Thermal load
''Thermal loads'' are induced in a curtain wall system because aluminum has a relatively high [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. This means that over the span of a couple of floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions.  In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by gaskets. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement.  Incidentally, this slot also accounts for live load deflection and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] in the floor slabs of the building structure.

;Blast load
Accidental explosions and terrorist threats have brought on increased concern for the fragility of a curtain wall system in relation to blast loads. The bombing of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], has spawned much of the current research and mandates in regards to building response to blast loads. Currently, all new federal buildings in the U.S. and all U.S. embassies built on foreign soil must have some provision for resistance to bomb blasts.&lt;ref&gt;"Design of Buildings to Resist Progressive Collapse," UFC 4-023-03, U.S. Department of Defense, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the curtain wall is at the exterior of the building, it becomes the first line of defense in a bomb attack. As such, blast resistant curtain walls are designed to withstand such forces without compromising the interior of the building to protect its occupants. Since blast loads are very high loads with short durations, the curtain wall response should be analyzed in a [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] load analysis, with full-scale [[mock-up]] testing performed prior to design completion and installation.

Blast resistant glazing consists of [[laminated glass]], which is meant to break but not separate from the mullions. Similar technology is used in [[hurricane]]-prone areas for impact protection from wind-borne debris.

===Air Infiltration===
''Air infiltration'' is the air which passes through the curtain wall from the exterior to the interior of the building. The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical [[mullions]], through [[weep hole]]s, and through imperfect sealing. The [[American Architectural Manufacturers Association]] (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall.&lt;ref&gt;Testing is typically conducted by an independent third party agency using the ASTM E-783 standard.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water penetration===
''Water penetration'' is defined as water passing from the exterior of the building to the interior of the curtain wall system. Sometimes, depending on the building [[specifications]], a small amount of controlled water on the interior is deemed acceptable. Controlled water penetration is defined as water that penetrates beyond the inner most vertical plane of the test specimen, but has a designed means of drainage back to the exterior. AAMA Voluntary Specifications allow for controlled water penetration while the underlying ASTM E1105 test method would define such water penetration as a failure. To test the ability of a curtain wall to withstand water penetration in the field, an ASTM E1105 water spray rack system is placed on the exterior side of the test specimen, and a positive air pressure difference is applied to the system. This set up simulates a wind driven rain event on the curtain wall to check for field performance of the product and of the installation.  Field quality control and assurance checks for water penetration has become the norm as builders and installers apply such quality programs to help reduce the number of water damage litigation suits against their work.

===Deflection===
One of the disadvantages of using aluminum for mullions is that its [[modulus of elasticity]] is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] in an aluminum mullion compared to a similar steel section under a given load. Building specifications set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load-induced) deflections. These deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions.  Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the curtain wall. Building construction may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough.

Deflection limits are typically expressed as the distance between anchor points divided by a constant number. A deflection limit of L/175 is common in curtain wall specifications, based on experience with deflection limits that are unlikely to cause damage to the glass held by the mullion. Say a given curtain wall is anchored at 12 foot (144&amp;nbsp;in) floor heights.  The allowable deflection would then be 144/175 = 0.823&amp;nbsp;inches, which means the wall is allowed to deflect inward or outward a maximum of 0.823&amp;nbsp;inches at the maximum wind pressure.  However, some panels require stricter movement restrictions, or certainly those that prohibit a torque-like motion.

Deflection in mullions is controlled by different shapes and depths of curtain wall members. The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the [[second moment of area|area moment of inertia]] required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at one-third the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load at a lower cost or smaller depth.

===Strength===
Strength (or maximum usable [[Stress (physics)|stress]]) available to a particular material is not related to its material stiffness (the material property governing deflection); it is a separate criterion in curtain wall [[structural design|design]] and [[structural analysis|analysis]].  This often affects the selection of materials and sizes for design of the system.  The allowable bending strength for certain aluminum alloys, such as those typically used in curtain wall framing, approaches the allowable bending strength of steel alloys used in building construction.

===Thermal criteria===
Relative to other building components, aluminum has a high heat transfer coefficient, meaning that aluminum is a very good [[heat conduction|conductor]] of heat. This translates into high heat loss through aluminum curtain wall mullions.
There are several ways to compensate for this heat loss, the most common way being the addition of thermal breaks. ''[[Thermal break]]s'' are barriers between exterior metal and interior metal, usually made of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). These breaks provide a significant decrease in the [[thermal conductivity]] of the curtain wall. However, since the thermal break interrupts the aluminum mullion, the overall moment of inertia of the mullion is reduced and must be accounted for in the structural analysis and deflection analysis of the system.

Thermal conductivity of the curtain wall system is important because of heat loss through the wall, which affects the heating and cooling costs of the building. On a poorly performing curtain wall, [[condensation]] may form on the interior of the mullions. This could cause damage to adjacent interior trim and walls.

Rigid [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] is provided in [[spandrel]] areas to provide a higher [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] at these locations.

==Infills==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

''Infill'' refers to the large panels that are inserted into the curtain wall between mullions. Infills are typically glass but may be made up of nearly any exterior building element. Some common infills include metal panels, louvers, a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] panels.

===Glass===
[[File:Serre cactees JdP.jpg|thumb|left|The Mexican [[greenhouse|hothouse]] at the [[Jardin des Plantes]], built by [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]] from 1834 to 1836, is an early example of metal and glass curtain wall architecture.]]
By far the most common glazing type, [[float glass|glass]] can be of an almost infinite combination of color, thickness, and [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]].
For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) monolithic and 1&amp;nbsp;inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Insulated glazing|insulating glass]]. Presently, 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch glass is typically used only in [[spandrel]] areas, while insulating glass is used for the rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as insulating glass as well). The 1&amp;nbsp;inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch (12&amp;nbsp;mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some [[inert gas]]es, such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]] may be used to offer better [[thermal transmittance]] values.

In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) monolithic and 5/8&amp;nbsp;inch (16&amp;nbsp;mm) insulating glass. Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, [[relative humidity]], or [[Acoustic transmission|sound transmission]] requirements, such as laboratory areas or [[recording studio]]s.

Glass may be used which is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], [[translucent]], or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. ''Transparent'' glass usually refers to ''vision'' glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes.  ''Opaque'' glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through ''shadow box'' construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.

===Fabric veneer===
Fabric is another type of material which is common for curtain walls. Fabric is often much less expensive and serves as a less permanent solution. Unlike glass or stone, fabric is much faster to install, less expensive, and often much easier to modify after it is installed.
Because of low density of fabrics total weight of structure is very low then strength consideration of structure is not too important.

===Stone veneer===
Thin blocks (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;inches (75–100&amp;nbsp;mm)) of stone can be inset within a curtain wall system. The type of stone used is limited only by the strength of the stone and the ability to manufacture it in the proper shape and size. Common stone types used are: [[calcium silicate]], [[granite]], [[marble]], [[travertine]], and [[limestone]]. To reduce weight and improve strength, the natural stone may be attached to an aluminum honeycomb backing.

===Panels===
Metal panels can take various forms including aluminum plate; [[aluminum composite panels]] consisting of two thin aluminum sheets sandwiching a thin plastic interlayer; [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding|copper wall cladding]], and panels consisting of metal sheets bonded to rigid insulation, with or without an inner metal sheet to create a sandwich panel. Other opaque panel materials include [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] (FRP), stainless steel, and [[terracotta]]. Terracotta curtain wall panels were first used in Europe, but only a few manufacturers produce high quality modern terracotta curtain wall panels.

===Louvers===
A [[louver]] is provided in an area where mechanical equipment located inside the building requires ventilation or fresh air to operate. They can also serve as a means of allowing outside air to filter into the building to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions and minimize the usage of energy-consuming [[HVAC]] systems. Curtain wall systems can be adapted to accept most types of louver systems to maintain the same architectural sightlines and style while providing the functionality.

===Windows and vents===
Most curtain wall glazing is fixed, meaning there is no access to the exterior of the building except through doors. However, windows or vents can be glazed into the curtain wall system as well, to provide required ventilation or operable windows. Nearly any window type can be made to fit into a curtain wall system.

==Fire safety==
[[File:Curtain wall backpan styrofoam.jpg|thumb|right|Combustible [[polystyrene]] insulation in point contact with [[sheet metal]] backban. Incomplete [[firestop]] in the [[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]], made of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]] without topcaulking.]]
[[Firestop]]ping at the ''[[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]]'', which is a gap between the floor and the curtain wall, is essential to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior face of the curtain wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. The firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the [[fire-resistance rating]] of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)]] is typically based upon ''closed'' compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is [[fire sprinkler system|sprinklered]], fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered from heat, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building.

Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the 1988 [[First Interstate Tower fire]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The fire leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the aluminum framing holding the glass.&lt;ref name="TechReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafire.com/famous_fires/880504_1stInterstateFire/FEMA-TecReport/FEMA-report.htm|title=Technical Report, Interstate Bank Building Fire|publisher=[[United States Fire Administration]]|accessdate=21 November 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lafire.com%2Ffamous_fires%2F880504_1stInterstateFire%2FFEMA-TecReport%2FFEMA-report.htm&amp;date=2010-07-13 |archivedate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminum's melting temperature is 660&amp;nbsp;°C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100&amp;nbsp;°C. The melting point of aluminum is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire.

Fireman knock-out glazing panels are often required for venting and emergency access from the exterior. Knock-out panels are generally fully [[Architectural Glass|tempered]] glass to allow full fracturing of the panel into small pieces and relatively safe removal from the opening.

==Maintenance and repair==
Curtain walls and perimeter sealants require maintenance to maximize service life. Perimeter sealants, properly designed and installed, have a typical service life of 10 to 15 years. Removal and replacement of perimeter sealants require meticulous surface preparation and proper detailing.

Aluminum frames are generally painted or [[anodising|anodized]]. Care must be taken when cleaning areas around anodized material as some cleaning agents will destroy the finish. Factory applied [[fluoropolymer]] thermoset coatings have good resistance to environmental degradation and require only periodic cleaning. Recoating with an air-dry fluoropolymer coating is possible but requires special surface preparation and is not as durable as the baked-on original coating. Anodized aluminum frames cannot be "re-anodized" in place but can be cleaned and protected by proprietary clear coatings to improve appearance and durability.

Stainless steel curtain walls require no coatings, and embossed, as opposed to abrasively finished, surfaces maintain their original appearance indefinitely without cleaning or other maintenance. Some specially textured matte stainless steel surface finishes are hydrophobic and resist airborne and rain-borne pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Michael F., "Stainless Steel for Design Engineers", ASM International, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been valuable in the American Southwest and in the Mideast for avoiding dust, as well as avoiding soot and smoke staining in polluted urban areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10866">{{about|the rhetorical genre|the manner in which words are set to music|Text declamation}}
'''Declamation''' (from the Latin: '''''declamatio'''''  for "declaration") is an artistic form of public speaking. It is a dramatic oration designed to present through articulation, emphasis and gesture the full sense of the message being imparted.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}}

==History==
In Ancient Rome, declamation was a genre of ancient [[rhetoric]] and a mainstay of the [[Education in Ancient Rome|Roman higher education]] system. It was separated into two component subgenres, the ''[[controversia]]'', speeches of defense or prosecution in fictitious court cases, and the ''[[suasoria]]'', in which the speaker advised a historical or legendary figure as to a course of action. Roman declamations survive in four corpora: the compilations of [[Seneca the Elder]] and [[Calpurnius Flaccus]], as well as two sets of ''controversiae'', the ''Major Declamations'' and ''Minor Declamations'' spuriously attributed to [[Quintilian]].

Declamation had its origin in the form of preliminary exercises for Greek students of rhetoric: works from the Greek declamatory tradition survive in works such as the collections of [[Sopater]] and [[Choricius of Gaza]]. Of the remaining Roman declamations the vast majority are ''controversiae''; only one book of ''suasoriae'' survive, that being in Seneca the Elder's collection. The ''controversia'' as they currently exist normally consist of several elements: an imaginary law, a theme which introduced a tricky legal situation, and an argument which records a successful or model speech on the topic. It was normal for students to employ illustrative ''exempla'' from Roman history and legend (such as were collected in the work of [[Valerius Maximus]]) to support their case. Important points were often summed up via pithy epigrammatic statements (''sententiae''). Common themes include ties of fidelity between fathers and sons, heroes and tyrants in the archaic city, and conflicts between rich and poor men.

As a critical part of rhetorical education, declamation's influence was widespread in Roman elite culture. In addition to its didactic role, it is also attested as a performative genre: public declamations were visited by such figures as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Asinius Pollio]], [[Maecenas]], and the emperor [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sussmann|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Ovid]] is recorded by Seneca the Elder as being a star declaimer, and the works of the satirists [[Martial]] and [[Juvenal]], as well as the historian [[Tacitus]], reveal a substantial declamatory influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sussmann|1994|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later examples of declamation can be seen in the work of the sixth century AD bishop and author [[Ennodius]].

==Classic revival==
In the eighteenth century, a classical revival of the art of public speaking, often referred to as [[elocution|The Elocution Movement]] occurred in Britain. While elocution focused on the voice—articulation, diction, and pronunciation—declamation focused on delivery. Rather than a narrow focus on [[rhetoric]], or persuasion, practitioners involved in the movement focused on improving speech and gesture{{sfn|Goring|2014}} to convey the full sentiment of the message.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}} Traditionally, practitioners of declamation served in the clergy, legislature or law, but by the nineteenth century, the practice had extended to theatrical and reformist venues.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}}{{sfn|Goring|2014}} Initially, the aim was to improve the standard of oral communication, as high rates of illiteracy made it imperative for churches, courts and parliaments, to rely on the spoken word.{{sfn|Goring|2014}} Through modification of inflection and phrasing, along with appropriate gestures, speakers were taught to convey the meaning and persuade the audience, rather than deliver monotonous litanies.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}} 

By the mid-nineteenth century, reformers were using the "art of declamation" to publicly address vice and provide moral guidance. In the Americas, missionary-run schools focused on teaching former slaves the art of public speaking to enable them to elevate others of their race as teachers and ministers.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=7}} Using drama as a tool to teach, reformers hoped to standardize the spoken word, while creating a sense of national pride.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|Harrington|2010|p=68}} Studies and presentation of declamation flourished in Latin America and particularly in the African-American and Afro-Caribbean communities through the first third of the twentieth century. Practitioners attempted to interpret their orations to convey the emotions and feeling behind the writer's words to the audience, rather than simply recite them.{{sfn|Kuhnheim|2008|p=137}} In the twentieth century, among black practitioners, topical focus often was on the irony of their lives in a post-slavery world, recognizing that they had gained freedom but were not free to express themselves. Presentation involved utilization of African rhythms from dance and music,{{sfn|''ABC Color''|2006}} and local dialect, as a form of social protest.{{sfn|Kuhnheim|2008|p=141}}

'''Ecocity Builders''' is a 501c non profit located in [[Oakland, California]] that provides advocacy, consulting, and education in [[Urban planning#Sustainable development and sustainability|sustainable city planning]] with a focus on access by proximity and pedestrian-oriented development. Ecocity Builders also implements urban design projects utilizing a large network of alliances with city governments, businesses and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. Ecocity Builders' approach is based the work of founder [[Richard Register]], an American artist, peace activist and urban theorist.

==Core Principles==

Ecocity Builders is primarily concerned with promoting the creation of [[ecocity|ecocities]], a phrase first coined by Richard Register at the 1st International Ecocity Conference in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/2014/07/14/firsts-observing-our-ecocity-influence-unfolding/ |title=Firsts: Observing our ecocity influence unfolding |author=Richard Register |publisher=Ecocity Builders |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.T.A. Pickett, M.L. Cadenasso, and Brian McGrath, ‘’Resilience in Ecology and Urban Design: Linking Theory and Practice for Sustainable Cities.’’ (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013), pp. 290-219&lt;/ref&gt; Ecocity Builders defines an ecocity as an "ecologically healthy human settlement modeled on the self-sustaining resilient structure and function of natural [[ecosystem]]s and living organisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/why-ecocities/ecocity-definition/ |title=Ecocities: Definition |publisher=Ecocity Builders |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ecocity can encompass any size of settlement, from neighborhood or village up to metropolis, that functions in harmony with the ecosystems of which it is part. These greater environmental systems include the [[Drainage basin|watershed]], [[bioregion]], and ultimately, of the planet, as well as human social systems such as local, regional, national and world economic, governmental, and cultural exchange systems.

[[Biometrics]] is central to the Ecocity concept through the analogy of the cities as living organisms. Cities (including their inhabitants) exhibit and require systems for movement (transport), respiration (processes to obtain energy), sensitivity (responding to its environment), growth (evolving/changing over time), reproduction (including education, construction, planning and development, etc.), excretion (outputs and wastes), and nutrition (need for air, water, soil, food for inhabitants, materials, etc.).

Ecocities exhibit characteristic design elements such as pedestrian-oriented "nodes" or centers of resources and social interaction, mixed-use planning, pervasive natural features (gardens, urban agriculture, parks), de-emphasis on individual vehicular transit, and equitable access to resources. Register's ecocities are influenced by the [[arcology]] movement including an emphasis on hyperstructures—large, complex interconnected buildings. Register has published collections of his extensive drawings of ecocity plans and interventions in several books (see “Sources”).

==History and Early Years==

Ecocity Builders was founded by Richard Register in 1992 in order to further specific aims of the first International Ecocity Conference (Berkeley, 1990). The first conference was convened by the Urban Ecology group, an organization also founded by Richard Register. Ecocity Builders went on to involve many of the same key actors as Urban Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us: History |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/about-us/history/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecocity Builders' early years were characterized by a number of local projects in the [[San Francisco East Bay]], primarily [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. These projects included creek daylighting Cordonices Creek, Slow Streets, and community projects.

===Creek Daylighting===

Ecocity Builders flagship project included one of the earliest daylighted and [[Stream restoration|restored creek beds]] in the United States. The [[Codornices Creek]] project, 1994, removed the water channel from its cement culvert along the Albany/Oakland border and created a mile-long park. Ecocity Builders collaborated with the [http://urbancreeks.org/ Urban Creeks Council], who applied for and received $25,000 from the Department of Water Resources Board to fund the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Codornices Creek |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/codornices-creek/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Depaving the World |author=Richard Register |url=http://www.culturechange.org/issue10/rregister.html |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second lower half of the creek park was restored in 2004 on a budget of $2.1 million under the auspices of the [http://www.codornicescreekwatershed.org/projects.htm Codornices Creek Watershed Council].

===Depaving===

Ecocity Builders helped plan and provided support for a variety of small to medium-sized depaving projects in Berkeley. Examples include removing five parking spaces at University Avenue Homes' low income residence for a garden, and Halcyon Commons.&lt;ref name="Richard Register, 2006"&gt;Richard Register, ''Ecocities: Building Cities in Balance with Nature'' (Gabriola Island, BC, Canada: New Society Publishers, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The latter converted a 28 space parking lot into a community-designed mini-park featuring a large grassy area surrounded by flowering shrubs and trees, a picnic area, and a tire swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Depaving |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/depaving/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow Streets===

Starting in 1979 Richard Register and other Berkeley activists began advocating the City of Berkeley for traffic-calming street plans based on the Australian "slow ways" streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/milvia-slow-street/&lt;/ref&gt; The Milvia Slow Street, part of the City of Berkeley's Bicycle Boulevard network, was finally designed under their guidance in 1990. The design covers roughly six blocks of residential street in which 30 curb bulb-outs were placed to narrow the street at intersections and mid-block locations. These bulb-outs and planted islands create a serpentine design, which requires vehicles to slow and negotiate a winding path along the street. Official studies confirmed the Milvia Slow Street to have a significant calming impact on vehicle speed and volume along the corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berkeley Bicycle Boulevard Design Tools and Guidelines, Chapter 5, pp. 5.1-5.3 |date=2000-04-13 |url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_General/ch5.pdf |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecocity District Mapping===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ecocity Builders urban villages map Berkeley.jpg|thumbnail|Urban villages mapping of Berkeley, CA]] --&gt;Richard Register piloted a method for identifying “urban villages” in large urban areas in his book ''Ecocity Berkeley'' (1987). He proposed the eventual densification of these areas to create more compact, efficient urban entities where goods and services can be accessed via walking and biking. Ecocity Builders conducted early GIS mapping projects to formalize this process.&lt;ref name="Miller and Smith, 2013"&gt;Kirstin Miller and Richard Smith, ''Ecocity Mapping Using GIS: Introducing a Planning Method for Assessing and Improving Neighborhood Vitality,'' '''Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education and Action.''' Vol 7., Issue 1, (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The results identified actual active urban nodes (clusters of commercial, social and transit activity) as opposed to the on-the-book zoning for commercial/transit centers. They also identified barriers in these areas to being “complete” service access, such as a lack of large grocery store in [[West Oakland, Oakland, California|West Oakland]], and lack of integrated transit in [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecocity Mapping |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/current/ecocity-mapping/ |accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy and Advocacy===

In Berkeley Ecocity Builders successfully co-authored and lobbied for policies that are currently enforced, including the Ecocity Amendment to the 2001 General Plan, the Solar Greenhouse Ordinance, and the Residential Energy Conservation Ordinance (RECO).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/policy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Projects==

===International Ecocity Framework and Standards (IEFS)===

The [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]'s [https://www.bcit.ca/construction/ School of Construction and the Environment] and Ecocity Builders worked together to develop a scientific rubric for evaluating the Ecocity status of a human settlement. The rubric is based on 12 environmental, social, and resource-based indicators of urban health. The [http://www.ecocitystandards.org/ IEFS] forms the basis for several other partnerships and projects aiming to measure, map, and act on these indicators.

===Ecocitizen World Map Project===

The Ecocitizen World Map Project is a suite of tools and methods that uses PUMIS and GIS technology to explore, understand, and measure holistic urban health from a citizen’s perspective. The project provides an online mapping platform allowing residents to access and combine local, community-uploaded data with open-government data on key indicators such as air and water quality, access to transit, crime, and cultural amenities. The indicators measured by mapping align with the IEFS and can be used to evaluate a city or neighborhood’s ecocity status.

The first Ecocitizen World Map Project pilots were conducted in April 2014 in the cities of Cairo and Casablanca. Students and community members participated in "bootcamps" to learn PUMIS surveying techniques and conducted parcel audits in the neighborhoods of Roches Noires and Imbaba. Initial surveying focused on water use.

The participatory approach to data collection enables stakeholders to acquire previously unknown data and is designed to empower local communities to engage in relevant issues, giving them incentive to become involved in finding solutions to existing problems.

This Ecocitizen World Map Project is a public-private partnership led by Ecocity Builders in collaboration with principal initial partners the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Esri]], the Association of American Geographers, Eye on Earth (a partnership of [[UNEP]] + [[Abu Dhabi]] Environmental Data Initiative), along with local academic partners, [[NGO]]s and community organizations. The project's initial three pilot cities include [[Medellín]], [[Colombia]] (supported by a grant from the OAS’ Sustainable Communities in the Americas Initiative), [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] (supported by a grant from [http://www.eoesummit.org/ Eye on Earth).]

===Advising and Consulting===

Ecocity Builders provides a set of [http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/policy/ policy development and advocacy tools] as well as contracting as an adviser for projects worldwide. Ecocity Builders and Richard Register have consulted on construction, planning and development in [[Auroville]], [[India]]; [[Changwon]], [[South Korea]], [[Willits, California|Willits]], [[California]], [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Huaibei]], [[China]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]], and [[Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city|Tianjin Ecocity]], [[China]].

===Ecocity World Summit Series===

Chief ongoing project of Ecocity Builders is the biennial conference series known as the [http://www.ecocityworldsummit.com|Ecocity World Summit] (formerly the [http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/ International Ecocity Conference Series]). The series focuses on key actions cities and citizens can take to rebuild human habitat in balance with living systems. The conference focuses on design, planning, data-gathering, and governance of creating sustainable, equitable cities. This Ecocity Summit series, begun in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] in 1990, was a first of its kind and is now the longest continuously running conference on ecological towns, cities and villages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/ International Conference Series&lt;/ref&gt;

Past World Summits have featured a wide range of leaders and innovators, including environmentalist [[David Brower]]; Apollo 14 astronaut [[Edgar Mitchell]]; [[Rusong Wang]], member of the Chinese Peoples Congress and head of the environmental sciences division of the Chinese Academy of Science; India’s animal rights champion Ambika Shukla; CEO and Chairperson of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Dr. Naoko Ishii; former San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]], architect/philosopher [[Paolo Soleri]]; and [[Denis Hayes]], director of the original national Earth Day in 1970 and keynote for the first Ecocity Conference.

The 2015 Summit will take place in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] in October 2015.

There are six major classes of chemical modifications found in RNA molecules: [[N6-Methyladenosine|N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine]], [[2'-O-methylation|N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine]], [[5-Methylcytidine|5-methylcytidine]], [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine|5-hydroxylmethylcytidine]], [[inosine]], and [[pseudouridine]].&lt;ref name="epitrans_review"&gt;Li, X, Xiong, X., and Yi, C.

== Methods for profiling N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine  ==

Methylation of [[adenosine]] does not affect its ability to base-pair with [[thymidine]] or [[uracil]], so  [[N6-Methyladenosine|N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine]] (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) cannot be detected using standard sequencing or [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] methods.&lt;ref name = "comprehensive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = K.D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Comprehensive Analysis of mRNA Methylation Reveals Enrichment in 3'UTRs and near Stop Codons | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2812%2900536-3 | journal = Cell | volume = 149 | issue = 7| pages = 1635–1646 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.003| pmid = 22608085 | pmc = 3383396 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This modification is marked by the methylation of the adenosine base at the nitrogen-6 position. It is abundantly found in [[polyA]]+ mRNA; also found in tRNA, rRNA, [[snRNA]], and long [[ncRNA]].

=== m6A-seq and MeRIP-seq ===

In 2012, the first two methods for m6A sequencing came out that enabled [[transcriptome]]-wide profile of m6A in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name="epitrans_review" /&gt; These two techniques, called m6A-seq and MeRIP-seq (m6A-specific methylated [[RNA immunoprecipitation]]), are also the first methods to allow for any type of RNA modification sequencing. These methods were able to detect 10,000 m6A peaks in the mammalian transcriptome; the peaks were found to be enriched in 3’UTR regions, near STOP codons, and within long exons.&lt;ref name = "topology"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dominissini | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature11112.html | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7397| pages = 201–208 | doi=10.1038/nature11112| pmid =  22575960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comprehensive" /&gt;

The two methods were optimized to detect methylation peaks in poly(A)+ mRNA, but the protocol could be adapted to profile any type of RNA. Collected RNA sample is fragmented into ~100-nucleotide-long oligonucleotides using a fragmentation buffer, immunoprecipitation with purified anti-m6A antibody, elution and collection of antibody-tagged RNA molecules. The immunoprecipitation procedure in MeRIP-Seq is able to produce &gt;130fold enrichment of m6A sequences.&lt;ref name="comprehensive" /&gt; Random primed cDNA library generation was performed, followed by adaptor ligation and Illumina sequencing. Since the RNA strands are randomly chopped up, the m6A site should, in principle, lie somewhere in the center of the regions to which sequence reads align. At extremes, the region would be roughly 200nt wide (100nt up- and downstream of the m6A site).&lt;ref name="comprehensive" /&gt;

When the first nucleotide of a transcript is an adenosine, in addition to the ribose 2’-O-methylation, this base can be further methylated at the N6 position.&lt;ref name="epitrans_review" /&gt;
m6A-seq was confirmed to be able to detect m6Am peaks at transcription start sites.&lt;ref name = "perturbation"&gt;Schwartz, S. et al. (2014). [http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247%2814%2900442-2 Perturbation of m6A Writers Reveals Two Distinct Classes of mRNA Methylation at Internal and 50 Sites]. Cell Reports. 8: 284-296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "topology"/&gt; Adapter ligation at both ends of RNA fragment results in reads tending to pileup at the 5’ terminus of the transcript. Schwartz et al. (2015) leveraged this knowledge to detect mTSS sites by picking out sites with a high ratio of the size of pileups in the IP samples compared to input sample.&lt;ref name = "topology"/&gt; As confirmation, &gt;80% of the highly enriched pileup sites contained adenosine.

The resolution of these methods is 100-200nt, which was the range of the fragment size. 
These two methods had several drawbacks: (1) required substantial input material, (2) low resolution which made pinpointing the actual site with the m6A mark difficult, and (3) cannot directly assess false positives.&lt;ref name ="high-resolution"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = High-Resolution Mapping Reveals a Conserved, Widespread, Dynamic mRNA Methylation Program in Yeast Meiosis | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2813%2901365-2 | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 6| pages = 1409–1421 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.047| pmid = 24269006 | pmc = 3956118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in MeRIP-Seq, the bioinformatics tools that are currently available are only able to call 1 site per ~100-200nt wide peak, so a substantial portion of clustered m6As (~64nt between each individual site within a cluster) are missed.&lt;ref name = "majority"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ke | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = A majority of m6A residues are in the last exons, allowing the potential for 3′ UTR regulation | url = http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/early/2015/09/21/gad.269415.115 | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 29 | issue = 19| pages = 2037–2053 | doi=10.1101/gad.269415.115| pmid = 26404942 | pmc = 4604345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "single-nucleotide-resolution"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linder | first1 = B. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A and m6Am throughout the transcriptome | url = http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n8/full/nmeth.3453.html | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 767–772 | doi=10.1038/nmeth.3453| pmid = 26121403 | pmc = 4487409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cluster can contain up to 15 m6A residues.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;

In 2013, a modified version of m6A-seq based on the previous two methods m6A-seq and MeRIP-seq came out which aimed to increase resolution, and demonstrated this in the yeast transcriptome. They achieved this by decreasing fragment size and employing a ligation-based strand-specific library preparation protocol capturing both ends of the fragmented RNA, ensuring that the methylated position is within the sequenced fragment.&lt;ref name = "high-resolution" /&gt; By additionally referencing the m6A consensus motif and eliminating false positive m6A peaks using negative control samples, the m6A profiling in yeast was able to be done at single-base resolution.

=== UV-based Methods ===

==== PA-m6A-seq  ====
&lt;!-- - incorporate photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)--&gt;
[[CLIP|UV-induced RNA-antibody crosslinking]] was added on top of m6A-seq to produce PA-m6A-seq (photo-crosslinking-assisted m6A-seq) which increases resolution up to ~23nt. First, [[4-thiourodine]] (4SU) is incorporated into the RNA by adding 4SU in [[growth media]], some incorporation sites presumably near m6A location. Immunoprecipitation is then performed on full-length RNA using m6A-specific antibody [36].  UV light at 365&amp;nbsp;nm is then shined onto RNA to activate the crosslinking to the antibody with 4SU. Crosslinked RNA was isolated via [[competition elution]] and fragmented further to ~25-30nt; [[proteinase K]] was used to dissociate the [[covalent bond]] between crosslinking site and antibody.&lt;ref name = "high-resolution" /&gt; Peptide fragments that remain after antibody removal from RNA cause the base to be read as a C as opposed to a T during reverse transcription, effectively inducing a point mutation at the 4SU crosslinking site.&lt;ref name = "high-resolution" /&gt; The short fragments are subjected to library construction and [[Illumina sequencing]], followed by finding the consensus methylation sequence.
The presence of the T to C mutation helps increase the signal to noise ratio of methylation site detection &lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt; as well as providing greater resolution to the methylation sequence.
One shortcoming of this method is that m6A sites that did not incorporate 4SU can’t be detected.
Another caveat is that position of 4SU incorporation can vary relative to any single m6A residue, so it still remains challenging to precisely locate m6A site using the T to C mutation.

==== m6A-CLIP and miCLIP ====

m6A-CLIP &lt;ref name="majority"/&gt; (crosslinking immunoprecipitation) and miCLIP &lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt; (m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) are UV-based sequencing techniques. These two methods activate crosslinking at 254&amp;nbsp;nm, fragments RNA molecules before immunoprecipitation with antibody, and do not depend on the incorporation of photoactivatable ribonucleosides - the antibody directly crosslinks with a base close (very predictable location) to the m6A site. These UV-based strategies uses antibodies that induces consistent and predictable mutational and truncation patterns in the cDNA strand during reverse-transcription that could be leveraged to more precisely locate the m6A site &lt;ref name="majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt;. Though both m6A-CLIP and miCLIP reply on UV induced mutations, m6A-CLIP &lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt; is distinct by taking advantage that m6A alone can induce cDNA truncation during reverse transcription and generate single-nucleotide mapping for over ten folds more precise m6A sites (MITS, m6A-induced truncation sites), permitting comprehensive and unbiased precise m6A mapping.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt; In contrast, UV-mapped m6A sites by miCLIP is only a small subset of total precise m6A sites. The precise location of tens of thousands of m6A sites in human and mouse mRNAs by m6A-CLIP reveals that m6A is enriched at last exon but not around stop codon.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt;

In m6A-CLIP &lt;ref name="majority"/&gt; and miCLIP &lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt;, RNA is fragmented to ~20-80nt first, then the 254&amp;nbsp;nm UV-induced covalent RNA/m6A antibody complex was formed in the fragments containing m6A. The antibody was removed with proteinase K before reverse-transcription, library construction and sequencing. Remnants of [[peptide]]s at the crosslinking site on the RNA after antibody removal, leads to insertions, truncations, and [[C to T mutation]]s during [[reverse transcription]] to cDNA, especially at the +1 position to the m6A site (5’ to the m6A site) in the sequence reads.&lt;ref name="majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution" /&gt;  		 	 	 		
Positive sites seen using m6A-CLIP and miCLIP had high percent of matches with those detected using [[SCARLET]], which has higher local resolution around a specific site, (see below), implicating m6A-CLIP and miCLIP has high spatial resolution and low false discovery rate.&lt;ref name = "majority"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt; 
miCLIP has been used to detect m6Am by looking at crosslinking-induced truncation sites at the 5’UTR.&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;

=== Methods for quantifying m6A modification status ===

Although m6A sites could be profiled at high resolution using UV-based methods, the stoichiometry of m6A sites - the methylation status or the ratio m6A+ to m6A- for each individual site within a type of RNA - is still unknown. SCARLET (2013) and [[m6A-LAIC-seq]] (2016) allows for the quantitation of stoichiometry at a specific locus and transcriptome-wide, respectively.&lt;ref name ="epitrans_review"/&gt;

Bioinformatics methods used to analyze m6A peaks do not make any prior assumptions about the [[sequence motif]]s within which m6A sites are usually found, and take into consideration all possible motifs. Therefore, it is less likely to miss sites.&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;

==== SCARLET ====

SCARLET (site-specific cleavage and radioactive-labeling followed by ligation-assisted extraction and thin-layer chromatography) is used determining the fraction of RNA in a sample that carries a methylated adenine at a specific site. One can start with total RNA without having to enrich for the target RNA molecule. Therefore, it is an especially suitable method for quantifying methylation status in low abundance RNAs such as tRNAs. However, it is not suitable or practical for large-scale location of m6A sites.&lt;ref name ="single-nucleotide-resolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "scarlet_review"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maity | first1 = A. | last2 = Das | first2 = B. | year = 2016 | title = N6-methyladenosine modification in mRNA: machinery, function and implications for health and diseases | url = | journal = FEBS Journal | volume = 283 | issue = 9| pages = 1607–1630 | pmid = 26645578 | doi=10.1111/febs.13614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure begins with a [[chimeric DNA]] [[oligonucleotide]] annealing to the target RNA around the candidate modification site. The chimeric [[ssDNA]] has 2’OMe/2’H modifications and is complementary to the target sequence. The chimeric oligonucleotide serves as a guide to allow [[RNase H]] to cleave the RNA strand precisely at the 5’-end of the candidate site. The cut site is then radiolabeled with phosphorus-32 and [[splint-ligate]]d to a 116nt ssDNA oligonucleotide using [[DNA ligase]].&lt;ref name = "probing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Probing N6-methyladenosine RNA modification status at single nucleotide resolution in mRNA and long noncoding RNA | journal = RNA | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 1848–1856 | pmid = 24141618 | doi=10.1261/rna.041178.113 | pmc=3884656}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RNase T1/A]] is introduced to the sample to digest all RNA, except for the RNA molecules with the 116-mers DNA attached. This radiolabeled product is then isolated and digested by nuclease to generate a mixture of modified and unmodified adenosines (5’P-m6A and 5’-P-A) which is separated using thin layer chromatography. The relative proportions of the two groups can be determined using UV absorption levels.&lt;ref name = "scarlet_review"/&gt;

====  m6A-LAIC-seq ====

m6A-LAIC-seq (m6A-level and isoform-characterization sequencing) is a high-throughput approach to quantify methylation status on a whole-transcriptome scale. Full-length RNA samples are used in this method. RNAs are first subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-m6A antibody. Excess antibody is added to the mixture to ensure all m6A-containing RNAs are pulled down. The mixture is separated into eluate (m6A+ RNAs) and supernatant (m6A- RNAs) pools. [[External RNA Controls Consortium]] (ERCC) [[spike in]]s are added to the eluate and supernatant, as well as an independent control arm consisting of just ERCC spike in. After antibody cleavage in the eluate pool, each of the three mixtures are sequenced on a next generation sequencing platform. The m6A levels per site or gene could be quantified by the ERCC-normalized RNA abundances in different pools.&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "m6A-LAIC-seq"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Molinie | first1 = B. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = m6A-LAIC-seq reveals the census and complexity of the m6A epitranscriptome | url = http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v13/n8/abs/nmeth.3898.html | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 13 | issue = 8| pages = 692–698 | doi=10.1038/nmeth.3898| pmid = 27376769 | pmc = 5704921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since full-length RNA is used, it is possible to directly compare alternatively spliced isoforms between the m6A+ and m6A- fractions as well as comparing isoform abundance within the m6A+ portion.

Despite the advances in m6A-sequencing, several challenges still remain: (1) A method has yet to be developed that characterizes the stoichiometry between different sites in the same transcript; (2) Analysis results are heavily dependent on the [[bioinformatics algorithm]] used to call the peaks; (3) Current methods all use m6A-specific antibodies to tag m6A sites, but it has been reported that the antibodies contain intrinsic bias for RNA sequences.

== Methods for N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) Profiling ==
[[N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine]], abundant in [[polyA+]] mRNAs, occurs at the first nucleotide after the [[5’ cap]], when an additional methyl group is added to a [[2ʹ-O-methyladenosine]] residue at the ‘capped’ 5ʹ end of mRNA.&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt;

Since m6Am can be recognized by [[anti-m6A antibodies]] at [[transcription start site]]s, the methods used for m6A profiling can be and were adapted for m6Am profiling, namely m6A-seq, and [[miCLIP]] (see m6A-seq and miCLIP descriptions above).

== Methods for 5-methylcytidine profiling ==

[[File:M5C methods v3.png|thumb|600px|Methods developed to profile 5-methylcytidine.]]

[[5-methylcytidine]], m5C, is abundantly found in mRNA and ncRNAs, especially tRNA and rRNAs. In tRNAs, this modification stabilizes the [[secondary structure]] and influences [[anticodon stem-loop conformation]].&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt; In rRNAs, m5C affects [[translational fidelity]].&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt;

Two principles have been used to develop m5C sequencing methods. The first one is antibody-based approach (bisuphite sequencing and [[m5C-RIP]]), similar to m6C sequencing. The second is detecting targets of m5C RNA methyltransferases by covalently linking the enzyme to its target, and then using IP specific to the target enzyme to enrich for RNA molecules containing the mark (Aza-IP and miCLIP).

&lt;!--[include general illustration]--&gt;

=== Modified bisulfite sequencing ===

Modified bisulfite sequencing was optimized for rRNA, tRNA, and miRNA molecules from [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref name = "RNA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = RNA cytosine methylation analysis by bisulphite sequencing | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2| page = e12 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkn954| pmid = 19059995 | pmc = 2632927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bisulfite treatment has been most widely used to detect dm5C ([[DNA m5C]]). The treatment essentially converts a [[cytosine]] to a [[uridine]], but [[methylated cytosine]]s would be unchanged by the treatment.
Previous attempts to develop m5C sequencing protocols using bisulfite treatment were not able to effectively address the problem of the harsh treatment of RNA which causes significant degradation of the molecules. Specifically, [[bisulfite deamination]] treatment (high pH) of RNA is detrimental to the stability of [[phosphodiester bond]]s. As a result, it is difficult to pre-enrich RNA molecules or to obtain enough PCR product of the correct size for [[deep sequencing]].

A modified version of bisulfite sequencing was developed by Schaefer et al. (2009) which decreased the temperature at which bisulfite treatment of RNA from 95&amp;nbsp;°C to 60&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = "RNA"/&gt; The rationale behind the modification was that since RNA, unlike DNA, is not double-stranded, but rather, consists of regions of single-strandedness, double-stranded stem structures and loops, it could be possible to unwind RNA at a much lower temperature. Indeed, RNA could be treated for 180 minutes at 60C without significant loss of [[PCR amplicon]]s of the expected size.&lt;ref name = "RNA"/&gt; Deamination rates were determined to be 99% at 180min of treatment.

After bisulfite treatment of fragmented RNA, reverse transcription is performed, followed by [[PCR amplification]] of the cDNA products, and finally deep sequencing was done using the [[Roche 454]] platform.&lt;ref name = "RNA"/&gt;

Since the developers of the method used the Roche platform, they also used [[GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer]] (Roche) for analyzing deep sequencing data to quantify sequence-specific cytosine content.
However, recent papers have suggested that the method have several flaws: (1) Incomplete conversion of regular cytosines in double-stranded regions of RNA; (2) areas containing other modifications that resulted in bisulfite-treatment resistance; and (3) sites containing potential false-positives due to (1) and (2) &lt;ref name="messenger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = W.V. | last2 = Bell | first2 = T.A. | last3 = Schaening | first3 = C. | year = 2016 | title = Messenger RNA modifications: form, distribution, and function | journal = Science | volume = 352 | issue = 6292| pages = 1408–1412 | pmid = 27313037 | doi=10.1126/science.aad8711 | pmc=5094196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="characterizing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hussain | first1 = S. | last2 = Aleksic | first2 = J. | last3 = Blanco | first3 = S. | last4 = Dietmann | first4 = S. | last5 = Frye | first5 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Characterizing 5-methylcytosine in the mammalian epitranscriptome | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 14 | issue = 11| page = 215 | doi=10.1186/gb4143| pmid = 24286375 | pmc = 4053770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="the_emerging_transcriptome"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shafik | first1 = A. | last2 = Schumann | first2 = U. | last3 = Evers | first3 = M. | last4 = Sibbritt | first4 = T. | last5 = Preiss | first5 = T. | year = 2016 | title = The emerging epitranscriptomics of long noncoding RNAs | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187493991500231X | journal = Biochim.

=== Aza-IP ===

Aza-IP [[5-azacytidine-mediated RNA immunoprecipitation]] has been optimized on and used for detecting targets of [[methyltransferases]], particularly [[NSUN2]] and [[DNMT2]] &lt;ref name = "identification"&gt;Khoddami, V. and Cairns, B.R. (2013). [http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n5/full/nbt.2566.html Identification of direct targets and modified bases of RNA cytosine methyltransferases]. Nature Biotechnology. 31(5): 459-464.&lt;/ref&gt; — the two main enzymes responsible for laying down the m5C mark.

First, the cell is made to [[overexpress]] an [[epitope]]-tagged m5C-RNA methytransferase derivative so that the antibody used later on for immunoprecipitation could recognize the enzyme. Second, [[5-aza-C]] is introduced to the cells so that it could be incorporated into nascent RNA in place of cytosine. Normally, the methyltransferases are released (i.e. covalent bond between cytosine and methyltransferase is broken) following methylation of the residue. For 5-aza-C, due to a nitrogen substitution in the C5 position of cytosine, the RNA methytransferase enzyme remains covalently bound to the target RNA molecule at the C6 position.&lt;ref name = "identification"/&gt;

Third, the cell is [[lysed]] and the m5C-RNA methyltransferase of interest is immunoprecipitated along with the RNA molecules that are covalently linked to the protein. The IP step enabled &gt;200-fold enrichment of RNA targets, which were mainly tRNAs. The enriched molecules were then fragmented and purified. cDNA library is then constructed and sequencing is performed.&lt;ref name = "identification"/&gt;

An important additional feature is that RNA methyltransferase covalent linkage to the C5 of m-aza-C induces rearrangement and [[ring opening]]. This ring opening results in preferential pairing with cytosine and is therefore read as guanosine during sequencing. This C to G transversion allows for base resolution detection of m5C sites.&lt;ref name = "epitrans_review"/&gt; 
One caveat is that m5C sites not replaced by 5-azacytosine will be missed.

=== miCLIP  ===

miCLIP ([[Methylation induced crosslinking immunoprecipitation]]) was used to detect [[NSUN2]] targets, which were found to be mostly [[non-coding RNA]]s such as tRNA. An induced mutation of C271A in NSUN2 inhibits release of enzyme from RNA target. This mutation was over-expressed in the cells of interest, and the mutated NSUN2 was also tagged with the [[Myc epitope]]. The covalently linked RNA-protein complexes are isolated via immunoprecipitation for a Myc-specific antibody. These complexes are confirmed and detected by [[radiolabeling]] with [[phosphorus-32]]. The RNA is then extracted from the complex, reverse-transcribed, amplified with PCR, and sequenced using next-generation platforms.

Both miCLIP and Aza-IP, though limited by specific targeting of enzymes, can allow for the detection of low-abundance methylated RNA without deep sequencing.&lt;ref name="epitrans_review"/&gt;

== Methods for Inosine Profiling ==

[[Inosine]] is created enzymatically when an adenosine residue is modified.

[[File:Identification of inosine.png|thumb|400px|Method of inosine identification: Inosine base pairs with cytidine while adenosine pairs with uracil.]]

=== Analysis of base-pairing properties ===
Since the chemical makeup of inosine is a deaminated adenosine, this is one of few methylation alterations that has an accompanying alteration in base pairing, which can be capitalised on. The original adenosine nucleotide will pair with a thymine, whereas the methylated inosine will pair with a cytosine. cDNA sequences obtained by [[rtPCR]] can therefore be compared to the corresponding genomic sequences; in sites where A residues are repeatedly interpreted as G, a methylation event can be assumed. At high enough accuracy, it is feasible that the quantity of mRNA molecules in the population that have been methylated can be calculated as a percentage. This method potentially has single-nucleotide resolution. In fact, the abundance of RNA-seq data that is now publicly available can be leveraged to investigate G (in cDNA) versus A (in genome). One particular pipeline, called RNA and DNA differences (RDD), claims to excludes false positives, but only 56.8% of its A-to-I sites were found to be valid by ICE-seq&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakurai | first1 = M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2014 | title = A biochemical landscape of A-to-I RNA editing in the human brain transcriptome | url = | journal = Genome Res | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 522–534 | doi=10.1101/gr.162537.113| pmid = 24407955 | pmc = 3941116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(see below).

The background noise caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), somatic mutations, pseudogenes and sequencing errors reduce the reliability of the signal, especially in a single-cell context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020391 | pmid=15534692 | pmc=526178 | volume=2 | issue=12 | title=Widespread A-to-I RNA Editing of Alu-Containing mRNAs in the Human Transcriptome | journal=PLoS Biology | page=e391| year=2004 | last1=Athanasiadis | first1=Alekos | last2=Rich | first2=Alexander | last3=Maas | first3=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical methods ===

==== Inosine-specific cleavage ====
The first method to detect A-to-I RNA modifications, developed in 1997, was inosine-specific cleavage. RNA samples are treated with glyoxal and borate to specifically modify all G bases, and subsequently enzymatically digested to by RNase T1, which cleaves after I sites. The amplification of these fragments then allows analysis of cleavage sites and inference of A-to-I modification.
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Bass | first2 = B.L. | year = 1997 | title = Detection of inosine in messenger RNA by inosine-specific cleavage | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 28| pages = 8429–8434 | doi=10.1021/bi9709607| pmid = 9264612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to prove the position of inosine at specific sites rather than identify novel sites or transcriptome-wide profiles.

===== Limitations =====
The existence of two A-to-I modifications in relatively close proximity, which is common in Alu elements, means the downstream mod is less likely to be detected since the cDNA synthesis will be truncated at a prior nucleotide. The throughput is low, and the initial method required specific primers; the protocol is complicated and labour-intensive.

==== ICE and ICE-seq ====
Inosine chemical erasing (ICE) refer to a process in which acrylonitrile is reacted with inosine to form N1-cyanoethylinosine (ce1I). This serves to stall reverse transcriptase and lead to truncated cDNA molecules. This was combined with deep-sequencing in a developed method called ICE-seq. Computational methods for automated analysis of the data are available, the main premise being the comparison of treated and untreated samples to identify truncated transcripts and thus infer an inosine modification by read count, with a step to reduce false positives by comparison to online database dbSNP.&lt;ref name="Masayuki Sakurai 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakurai | first1 = Masayuki | last2 = Yano | first2 = Takanori | last3 = Kawabata | first3 = Hitomi | last4 = Ueda | first4 = Hiroki | last5 = Suzuki | first5 = Tsutomu | year = 2010 | title = Inosine cyanoethylation identifies A-to-I RNA editing sites in the human transcriptome | url = | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 733–740 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.434 | pmid = 20835228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Limitations =====
The original ICE protocol involved an [[RT-PCR amplification]] step and therefore required primers and knowledge of the location or regions to be investigated,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = D. P. | last2 = Bass | first2 = B. L. | year = 1997 | title = Detection of inosine in messenger RNA by inosine-specific cleavage | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 28| pages = 8429–8434 | doi=10.1021/bi9709607| pmid = 9264612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside a maximum cDNA length of 300–500bp.
The ICE-seq method is complicated, along with being labour-, reagent- and time-intensive. One protocol from 2015 took 22 days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masayuki Sakurai 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This shares a limitation with inosine-specific cleavage, in that if there are two A-to-I modifications in relatively close proximity, the downstream mod is less likely to be detected since the cDNA synthesis will be truncated at a prior nucleotide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suzuki | first1 = Tsutomu | last2 = Ueda | first2 = Hiroki | last3 = Okada | first3 = Shunpei | last4 = Sakurai | first4 = Masayuki | year = 2015 | title = Transcriptome-wide identification of adenosine-to-inosine editing using the ICE-seq method | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 715–732 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2015.037| pmid = 25855956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both ICE and ICE-seq suffer from a lack of sensitivity to infrequently edited locations: it becomes difficult to distinguish a modification with a frequency of &lt;10% from a false positive. An increase in read depth and quality can increase sensitivity, but also then suffer from further amplification bias.

=== Biological methods ===

==== ADAR knockdown ====
The modification of A to I is effected by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), of which in mice there are three. The knockdown of these in the cell, therefore, and the subsequent cell–cell comparison of ADAR+ and ADAR- RNA content would be anticipated to provide a basis for A-to-I modification profiling. However, there are further functions of ADAR enzymes within the cell — for example, they have further roles in RNA processing, and in miRNA biogenesis — which would also be likely to change the landscape of cellular mRNA.

===== Limitations =====
The high incidence of side effects rule out ADAR knockdown as a categorical A-to-I detection method. Moreover, since ADAR knockout results in embryonic lethality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Q. | last2 = Khillan | first2 = J. | last3 = Gadue | first3 = P. | last4 = Nishikura | first4 = K. | year = 2000 | title = Requirement of the RNA editing deaminase ADAR1 gene for embryonic erythropoiesis | url = | journal = Science | volume = 290 | issue = 5497| pages = 1765–1768 | doi=10.1126/science.290.5497.1765}}&lt;/ref&gt; its utility is restricted to cultured cells.

== Methods for Pseudouridine Methylation Profiling ==

[[File:Stalling of reverse transcriptase.png|thumb|350px|ICE-based and CMC-based detection of inosine and pseudouridine. In both cases a truncated cDNA molecule is produced.]]

[[Pseudouridine]], or Ψ, the overall most abundant [[post-translational modification|post-translational RNA modification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charette | first1 = M. | last2 = Gray | first2 = M.W. | year = 2000 | title = Pseudouridine in RNA: what, where, how, and why | url = | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 341–351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is created when a uridine base is isomerised.

=== Biochemical methods ===

==== CMCT methods ====

There are multiple pseudouridine detection methods beginning with the addition of N-cyclohexyl-N′-b-(4-methylmorpholinium) ethylcarbodiimide metho-p-toluene-sulfonate (CMCT; also known as CMC), since its reaction with pseudouridine produces CMC-Ψ.  CMC-Ψ causes reverse transcriptase to stall one nucleotide in the 3’ direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bakin | first1 = A. | last2 = Ofengand | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = Four newly located pseudouridylate residues in Escherichia coli 23S ribosomal RNA are all at the peptidyltransferase center: analysis by the application of a new sequencing technique | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 32 | issue = 37| pages = 9754–9762 | doi=10.1021/bi00088a030}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods have single-nucleotide resolution.
In an optimisation step, azido-CMC can confer the ability to add [[biotin]]ylation; subsequent biotin pulldown will enrich Ψ-containing transcripts, allowing identification of even low-abundance transcripts.

===== Limitations =====
As with other procedures predicated on biochemical alteration followed by sequencing, the development of [[next-generation sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]] has removed the limitations requiring prior knowledge of sites of interest and [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] design. The method causes a lot of RNA degradation, so it is necessary to start with a large amount of sample, or use effective [[normalisation (chemistry)|normalisation]] techniques to account for [[amplification biases]]. One final limitation is that, for CMC labelling of pseudouridine to be specific, it is not complete, and therefore nor is it quantitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kellner | first1 = S. | last2 = Burhenne | first2 = J. | last3 = Helm | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Detection of RNA modifications | url = | journal = RNA Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 237–247 | doi=10.4161/rna.7.2.11468}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new reactant that could achieve a higher sensitivity with specificity would be beneficial.

== Methods for 5-hydroxylmethylcytidine Profiling ==

Cytidine residues, modified once to m5C (discussed above), can be further modified: either [[oxidised]] once for 5-hydroxylmethylcytidine (hm5C), or oxidised twice for 5-formylcytidine (f5C). Arising from the oxidative processing of m5C enacted in [[mammal]]s by ten-eleven translocation ([[TET]]) family enzymes, hm5C is known to occur in all three [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s and to have roles in regulation. While 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm5dC) is known to be found in DNA in a widespread manner, hm5C is also found in organisms for which no hm5dC has been detected, indicating it is a separate process with distinct regulatory stipulations. To observe the ''in vivo'' addition of methyl groups to cytosine RNA residues followed by oxidative processing, [[mice]] can be fed on a diet incorporating particular [[isotope]]s and these be traced by LC-[[mass spectrometry|MS/MS]] analysis. Since the metabolic pathway from nutritional intake to nucleotide incorporation is known to progress from dietary [[methionine]] --&gt; [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM) --&gt; methyl group on RNA base, the labelling of dietary methionine with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and D means these will end up in hm5C residues that have been altered since the addition of these into the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = Sabrina M. | last2 = van Delft | first2 = Pieter | last3 = Mendil | first3 = Lee | last4 = Bachman | first4 = Martin | last5 = Smollett | first5 = Katherine | last6 = Werner | first6 = Finn | last7 = Miska | first7 = Eric A. | last8 = Balasubramanian | first8 = Shankar | year = 2015 | title = Formation and Abundance of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in RNA | url = | journal = ChemBioChem | volume = 16 | issue = 5| pages = 752–755 | doi=10.1002/cbic.201500013| pmid = 25676849 | pmc = 4471624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to m5C, a large quantity of hm5C modifications have been recorded within coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delatte | first1 = B. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = RNA biochemistry. Transcriptome-wide distribution and function of RNA hydroxymethylcytosine | url = | journal = Science | volume = 351 | issue = | pages = 282–285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== hMeRIP-seq ===

hMeRIP-seq is an immunoprecipitation method, in which RNA–protein complexes are crosslinked for stability, and antibodies specific to hm5C are added. Using this method, over 3,000 hm5C peaks have been called in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' S2 cells.

==== Limitations ====

Despite two distinct base-resolution methods being available for hm5dC, there are no base-resolution methods for detection of hm5C.

[[File:Clade-grade II.svg|thumb|334px|Cladogram (family tree) of a biological group. The green box (central) may represent an ''evolutionary grade'' ([[paraphyly|paraphyletic]]), a group united by conservative anatomical and physiological traits rather than phylogeny. The flanking red and blue boxes are ''[[clade]]s'' (i.e., complete [[monophyly|monophyletic]] subtrees).]]
In [[Taxonomy (biology)#Alpha taxonomy and beta taxonomy|alpha taxonomy]], a '''grade''' is a taxon united by a level of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[physiological]] complexity. The term was coined by British biologist [[Julian Huxley]], to contrast with [[clade]], a strictly [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1959. Clades and grades. In Cain A.J. (ed) ''Function and taxonomic importance''. Systematics Association, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
An evolutionary grade is a group of species united by [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] traits, that has given rise to another group that has major differences from the ancestral condition, and is thus not considered part of the ancestral group, while still having enough similarities that we can group them under the same clade. The ancestral group will not be phylogenetically complete (i.e. will not form a [[clade]]), so will represent a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] taxon.

In order to fully understand evolutionary grades, one must first get a better understanding of [[Phylogenetics]], defined as "''In [[biology]], is the study of the [[evolution]]ary history and relationships among individuals or groups of [[organism]]s (e.g. [[species]], or [[population]]s). These relationships are discovered through [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetic inference]] methods that evaluate observed [[heritable]] traits, such as [[DNA]] sequences or [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] under a model of evolution of these traits"''

The most commonly cited example is that of [[reptiles]]. In the early 19th century, the French naturalist [[Pierre André Latreille|Latreille]] was the first to divide [[tetrapod]]s into the four familiar classes of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Latreille, P.A. (1804). ''Nouveau Dictionnaire à Histoire Naturelle'', xxiv; cited in Latreille, P.A. (1825).''Familles naturelles du règne animal, exposés succinctement et dans un ordre analytique''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, reptiles are characterized by traits such as laying membranous or shelled eggs, having skin covered in [[scale (zoology)|scales]] or [[scutes]], and having a '[[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]' metabolism. However, the ancestors of mammals and birds also had these traits and so birds and mammals can be said to "have evolved from reptiles", making the reptiles, when defined by these traits, a grade rather than a clade.&lt;ref name="tudge"/&gt; In [[microbiology]], taxa that are thus seen as excluded from their evolutionary grade parent group are called [[Taxon in disguise|taxa in disguise]].&lt;ref name="shigella"&gt;{{Cite journal

Paraphyletic taxa will often, but not always, represent evolutionary grades. In some cases paraphyletic taxa are united simply by not being part of any other groups, and give rise to so-called [[Wastebasket taxon|wastebasket taxa]] which may even be [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]].

==Grades in systematics==
[[File:Australopithecus sediba.JPG|thumb|right|The genus ''[[Australopithecus]]'' is ancestral to ''[[Homo]]'', yet actively in use in [[palaeoanthropology]].]]
The traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] way of defining taxa is through the use of anatomical traits. When the actual phylogenetic relationship is unknown, well defined groups sometimes turn out to be defined by traits that are primitive rather than derived. In Linnaean [[systematics]], evolutionary grades are accepted in higher [[taxonomic rank]]s, though generally avoided at [[family (biology)|family]] level and below. In [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] evolutionary grades (or any other form of paraphyly) are not accepted.&lt;ref name="grant1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2446408 | title = Primary Classification and Phylogeny of the Polemoniaceae, with Comments on Molecular Cladistics | year = 1998 | author = Grant, Verne | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 85 | pages = 741–752 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/85/6/741 | jstor = 2446408 | issue = 6 | publisher = Botanical Society of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where information about phylogenetic relationships is available, organisms are preferentially grouped into [[clades]]. Where data is lacking, or groups of uncertain relationship are to be compared, the cladistic method is limited and grade provides a useful tool for comparing organisms. This is particularly common in [[palaeontology]], where [[fossil]]s are often fragmentary and difficult to interpret. Thus, traditional palaeontological works are often using evolutionary grades as formal or informal taxa, including examples such as [[Labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]], [[anapsid]]s, [[synapsid]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonites]], [[eurypterid]]s, [[lobopodia]]ns and many of the more well known taxa of [[human evolution]]. Organizing organisms into grades rather than strict clades can also be very useful to understand the evolutionary sequence behind major diversification of both animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=E.

Evolutionary grades, being united by gross morphological traits, are often eminently recognizable in the field. While [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] seeks to eliminate paraphyletic taxa, such grades are sometimes kept as formal or informal groups on the basis of their usefulness for laymen and field researchers.&lt;ref name="grant1998"/&gt; In [[bacteriology]], the renaming of species or groups that turn out to be evolutionary grades is kept to a minimum to avoid misunderstanding, which in the case of [[pathogen]]s could have fatal consequences. When referring to a group of organisms, the term "grade" is usually enclosed in quotation marks to denote its status as a paraphyletic term.

==Grades and phylogenetic nomenclature==
With the rise of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], the use of evolutionary grades as formal [[taxon|taxa]] has come under debate. Under a strict phylogenetic approach, only [[monophyletic]] taxa are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kevin de Queiroz &amp; Jacques Gauthier |year=1990 |title=Phylogeny as a central principle in taxonomy: phylogenetic definitions of taxon names |journal=Syst. Zool. |volume=39 |pages=307–322 |doi=10.2307/2992353 |jstor=2992353 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from the more traditional approach of [[evolutionary taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="Mayr_Bock_2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |author-link=Ernst W. Mayr |last2=Bock |first2=W.J. |year=2002 |title=Classifications and other ordering systems |journal=J. Zool. Syst. Evol.

J.|year=2000|title=Stems, nodes, crown clades, and rank-free lists: is Linnaeus dead?|url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/phylocode/biolrev.html|journal=Biological Reviews|issn=0006-3231|volume=75|issue=4|pages=633–648|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2000.tb00055.x|pmid=11117201|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605090428/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/phylocode/biolrev.html|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the statement "B is part of A" (phylogenetic approach) and "B has evolved from A" (evolutionary approach) is, however, one of [[semantics]] rather than of phylogeny. Both express the same phylogeny, but the former emphasizes the phylogenetic continuum while the latter emphasizes a distinct shift in anatomy or ecology in B relative to A.

* [[Fish]] represent a grade, inasmuch as they have given rise to the [[tetrapod|land vertebrates]]. In fact, the three traditional [[class (biology)|classes]] of fish ([[Agnatha]], [[Chondrichthyes]] and [[Osteichthyes]]) all represent evolutionary grades.&lt;ref name="Romer"&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S. Parsons. 1977. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amphibians]] in the biological sense (including the extinct [[Labyrinthodontia|Labyrinthodonts]]) represent a grade, in that they are also the ancestors of the [[amniote]]s.&lt;ref name="Romer"/&gt;
* [[Reptiles]] are composed of the cold-blooded [[amniotes]], this excludes [[birds]] and [[mammals]].&lt;ref name="tudge"&gt;{{RefTudgeVariety}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dinosaur]]s were proposed to be the ancestors of birds as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref name=huxley1870&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=Thomas H. |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |year=1870 |title= {{ws | [[s: Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London/Volume 26/Further Evidence of the Affinity between the Dinosaurian Reptiles and Birds|Further evidence of the affinity between the dinosaurian reptiles and birds]]|ps=no}} |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London |volume=26 |pages=12–31 |doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1870.026.01-02.08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the term sees popular use as an evolutionary grade excluding birds, though most scientists use a monophyletic Dinosauria.
* [[Lizard]]s as a unit represent an evolutionary grade, defined by their retention of limbs relative to [[snake]]s and [[Amphisbaenia|Amphisbaenans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gibbons | first =J.

* [[Green algae]], represent a grade, in that they are the ancestors of [[land plants]].
* [[Prokaryote]]s, which include cellular organisms lacking a nucleus, represent a grade, in that they are the ancestors of [[eukaryote]]s, which includes [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and [[protist]]s, which itself also represents a grade, especially since it excludes the first three aforementioned groups.
*[[Crustacean]]s, represent a grade, in that they are the ancestors of [[Hexapoda|hexapod]]s, which includes [[insect]]s and related taxa.

A '''fact''' is something that is consistent with objective [[reality]] or that can be proven with [[evidence]]. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [[experience]]. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word "fact" derives from the Latin ''factum'', and was first used in English with the same meaning: ''a thing done or performed'' a meaning now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact". OED_2d_Ed_1989, (but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (1a). OED_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact is sometimes used synonymously with ''[[truth]]'', as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste.  This use is found in such phrases as, "''It is a fact that the cup is blue"'' or "''Matter of fact"'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (4a) OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "...&amp;nbsp;not history, nor fact, but imagination." Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] distinguishes between the two, claiming that "Fact creates norms, and truth illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |title=Werner Herzog Film: Statements / Texts |publisher=Wernerherzog.com |date=1999-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715011254/http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). Compact_OED)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an ''allegation or stipulation'' of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', "Fact has a long history of usage in the sense 'allegation'" AHD_4th_Ed. The OED dates this use to 1729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority.  [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A "fact" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true.&lt;ref&gt;"A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true." – ''Fact'' in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is ''about'' the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book
| title     = Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy
| first     = Edward
| last      = Craig
| publisher = Routledge, Oxford
| year      = 2005
| isbn        = 0-415-32495-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth
| first     = Pascal
| last      = Engel
| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press- MQUP
| year      = 2002
| isbn        = 0-7735-2462-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book
| title     = Truth and Interpretation
| first     = Donald
| last      = Davidson
| publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford
| year      = 1984
| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[logic of relatives|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations" Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "[[Paris]] is the capital city of [[France]]" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on.  The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{main|Fact–value distinction}}
Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:
what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well."

Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.

==In science==
{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}

In science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]].  Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]].  Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction
| first     = Barry
| last      = Gower
| publisher = Routledge
| year      = 1997
| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation.  Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;(Gower 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref&gt;(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"&gt;Gower, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"/&gt; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: "Facts and their evolution")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;ots=3V6-UmUFmP&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;sig=YtQTgNbisFSQ1QfV-JNkmW7D0n4#PPA181,M1 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' (among other interests) in scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;(Ravetz 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In history ==
{{further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]." This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean," of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined.  Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).

==In law==
{{further|Evidence (law)|Trier of fact}}
In most [[common law]] jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;Ed. note: this section of the article emphasizes common law jurisprudence (as primarily represented in Anglo-American–based legal tradition). Nevertheless, the principles described herein have analogous treatment in other legal systems (such as [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems) as well.&lt;/ref&gt; the general concept and analysis of fact reflects fundamental principles of [[jurisprudence]], and is supported by several well-established standards.&lt;ref name="Estrich000"&gt;{{cite book

=== Legal pleadings ===
{{main|Pleading}}
A party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.&lt;ref&gt;(McDonald 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taku glacier firn ice sampling.png|thumb|right|Sampling the surface of a glacier.  There is increasingly dense firn between surface snow and blue glacier ice.]]
[[File:Firn field on the top of Säuleck.jpg|thumb|right|Firn field on the top of [[Säuleck]], [[Hohe Tauern]]]]
'''Firn''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɪər|n}}; from [[Swiss German]] {{lang|gsw|firn}} "last year's", cognate with ''before'') is partially compacted [[névé]], a type of [[snow]] that has been left over from past seasons and has been [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallized]] into a substance denser than névé. It is [[ice]] that is at an intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice. Firn has the appearance of wet sugar, but has a hardness that makes it extremely resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from 0.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm³ to 0.83&amp;nbsp;g/cm³,&lt;ref&gt;Cuffey and Paterson (2010), The Physics of Glaciers 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a [[glacier]].

[[Snowflake]]s are compressed under the weight of the overlying [[snowpack]]. Individual [[crystal]]s near the melting point are semiliquid and slick, allowing them to glide along other crystal planes and to fill in the spaces between them, increasing the ice's density. Where the crystals touch they bond together, squeezing the air between them to the surface or into bubbles.

In the summer months, the crystal metamorphosis can occur more rapidly because of water percolation between the crystals. By summer's end, the result is firn.

The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the ''firn limit'', ''firn line'' or ''snowline''.

== Other uses ==
In colloquial and technical language, 'firn' is used to describe certain forms of [[Snow#By age|old snow or harsch]]:
* Old snowfields or [[névé]] (''Firnfelder''), even if the snow is not yet one year old
* the more recent snow layers of a glacier (a 'firned' glacier)
* the uppermost, soft layer of snow that is frozen overnight and, as a result of spring sunshine and high air temperatures, forms on an area of old snow or ''[[harsch]]'' (a slope ''firns up''; in Switzerland called ''Sulz'', but this term in Germany refers to a certain depth at which skiing downhill is no longer enjoyable)

'''Forensic facial reconstruction''' (or '''forensic facial approximation''') is the process of recreating the face of an individual (whose identity is often not known) from their [[skeletal]] remains through an amalgamation of artistry, [[anthropology]], [[osteology]], and [[anatomy]].  It is easily the most subjective—as well as one of the most controversial—techniques in the field of [[forensic anthropology]].  Despite this controversy, facial reconstruction has proved successful frequently enough that research and methodological developments continue to be advanced.

In addition to remains involved in criminal investigations, facial reconstructions are created for remains believed to be of historical value and for remains of [[prehistoric]] [[hominids]] and [[human]]s.

== Types of identification==
There are two forms pertaining to [[forensic identification|identification]] in [[forensic anthropology]]: '''circumstantial''' and '''positive'''.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;Burns. ''Forensic Anthropology Training Manual.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Circumstantial identification''' is established when an individual fits the biological profile of a set of skeletal or largely skeletal remains.  This type of identification does not prove or verify identity because any number of individuals may fit the same biological description.
*'''Positive identification''', one of the foremost goals of forensic science, is established when a unique set of biological characteristics of an individual are matched with a set of skeletal remains.  This type of identification requires the skeletal remains to correspond with medical or dental records, unique ante mortem wounds or pathologies, [[DNA]] analysis, and still other means.&lt;ref&gt;Reichs and Craig. ''Facial Approximation: Procedures and Pitfalls.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction presents investigators and family members involved in criminal cases concerning unidentified remains with a unique alternative when all other identification techniques have failed.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;  Facial approximations often provide the stimuli that eventually lead to the positive identification of remains.

== Legal admissibility ==
In the U.S., the [[Daubert Standard]] is a legal precedent set in 1993 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]] [[testimony]] during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods.&lt;ref name=Steadman&gt;Steadman&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple [[forensic]] artists produce approximations for the same set of skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer et al. ''Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the [[Daubert Standard]], is not considered a legally recognized technique for positive identification, and is not admissible as expert testimony. Currently, reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of positive identification in conjunction with verified methods.

== Types of reconstructions ==

=== Two-dimensional reconstructions ===
[[File:2D facial reconstruction.jpg|thumb|An example of a 2D facial reconstruction conducted by forensic artist Karen T. Taylor, and the subsequent identification, [[Murder of April Lacy|April Dawn Lacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riggs|first1=Robert|title=Robert Riggs Reports Forensic Artist Reconstructs Victims Faces May 2004|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o70ltA64lI|accessdate=13 January 2015|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Forensic facial reconstruction of Alberto di Trento.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of [[Alberto di Trento]] by Arc-Team and the 3D artist Cicero Moraes]]

Two-dimensional facial reconstructions are based on ante mortem [[photograph]]s, and the [[human skull|skull]].  Occasionally skull radiographs are used but this is not ideal since many cranial structures are not visible or at the correct scale. This method usually requires the collaboration of an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  A commonly used method of 2D facial reconstruction was pioneered by [[Karen T. Taylor]] of Austin, Texas during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Paul. "Saving Face." Forensic Files. Prod. Paul Bourdett and Vince Sherry. Dir. Michael Jordan. 28 Nov. 2007. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's method involves adhering tissue depth markers on an unidentified skull at various anthropological landmarks, then photographing the skull.  Life-size or one-to-one frontal and lateral photographic prints are then used as a foundation for facial drawings done on transparent vellum.  Recently developed, the F.A.C.E. and C.A.R.E.S. computer software programs quickly produce two-dimensional facial approximations that can be edited and manipulated with relative ease.  These programs may help speed the reconstruction process and allow subtle variations to be applied to the drawing, though they may produce more generic images than hand-drawn artwork.&lt;ref name=Reichs&gt;Reichs and Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Three-dimensional reconstructions ===
Three-dimensional facial reconstructions are either: 1) sculptures (made from casts of [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains) created with modeling clay and other materials or 2) high-resolution, [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer images]].  Like two-dimensional reconstructions, three-dimensional reconstructions usually require both an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  Computer programs create three-dimensional reconstructions by manipulating scanned [[photograph]]s of the unidentified cranial remains, [[stock photography|stock photographs]] of facial features, and other available reconstructions. These computer approximations are usually most effective in victim identification because they do not appear too artificial.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; This method has been adapted by the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]], which uses this method often to show approximations of an [[unidentified decedent]] to release to the public in hopes to identify the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Unidentified murder victim a 'total nightmare' case for detectives| url=http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| accessdate=9 July 2015| first=Adam| last=Rodewald| date=5 August 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714184728/http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| archivedate=14 July 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superimposition ===
[[Superimposition]] is a technique that is sometimes included among the methods of forensic facial reconstruction.  It is not always included as a technique because investigators must already have some kind of knowledge about the identity of the skeletal remains with which they are dealing (as opposed to 2D and 3D reconstructions, when the identity of the skeletal remains are generally completely unknown).  Forensic [[superimposition]]s are created by superimposing a photograph of an individual suspected of belonging to the unidentified skeletal remains over an [[X-ray]] of the unidentified [[human skull|skull]].  If the skull and the photograph are of the same individual, then the anatomical features of the face should align accurately.&lt;ref name=Lundy&gt;Lundy. ''Physical Anthropology In Forensic Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hermann Welcker]] in 1883 and [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]] in 1895, were the first to reproduce three-dimensional facial approximations from [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;Forensic Facial Reconstruction: The Final Frontier&lt;/ref&gt;  Most sources, however, acknowledge His as the forerunner in advancing the technique.  His also produced the first data on average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness followed by Kollmann and Buchly who later collected additional data and compiled tables that are still referenced in most laboratories working on facial reproductions today.&lt;ref name=Rhine&gt;Rhine. ''Facial Reproductions In Court.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction originated in two of the four major subfields of [[anthropology]].  In [[biological anthropology]], they were used to approximate the appearance of early [[Hominidae|hominid]] forms, while in [[archaeology]] they were used to validate the remains of historic figures.  In 1964, [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]] was probably the first to attempt paleo-anthropological facial reconstruction to estimate the appearance of ancient peoples&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Iscan. ''Craniofacial Image Analysis and Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although students of Gerasimov later used his techniques to aid in criminal investigations, it was [[Wilton M Krogman|Wilton M. Krogman]] who popularized facial reconstruction's application to the [[forensic]] field.  [[Wilton M Krogman|Krogman]] presented his method for facial reconstruction in his 1962 book, detailing his method for approximation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Others who helped popularize three-dimensional facial reconstruction include Cherry (1977), Angel (1977), Gatliff (1984), Snow (1979), and Iscan (1986).&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;

In 2004 it was for Dr. Andrew Nelson of the [[University of Western Ontario]], Department of Anthropology that noted Canadian artist [[Christian Corbet]] created the first forensic facial reconstruction of an approximately 2,200-year-old mummy based on CT and laser scans. This reconstruction is known as the Sulman Mummy project.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Technique for creating a three-dimensional clay reconstruction ==
[[File:Skulls_for_Facial_Approximation.jpg|thumb|Skulls for Facial Approximation]]

Because a standard method for creating [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] forensic facial reconstructions has not been widely agreed upon, multiple methods and techniques are used.  The process detailed below reflects the method presented by Taylor and Angel from their chapter in Craniofacial Identification in Forensic Medicine, pgs 177-185.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor and Angel. ''Facial Reconstruction and Approximation.''&lt;/ref&gt; This method assumes that the sex, age, and race of the remains to undergo facial reconstruction have already been determined through traditional [[forensic]] [[anthropological]] techniques.

The [[human skull|skull]] is the basis of facial reconstruction; however, other physical remains that are sometimes available often prove to be valuable.  Occasionally, remnants of [[soft tissue]] are found on a set of remains.  Through close inspection, the forensic artist can easily approximate the thickness of the soft tissue over the remaining areas of the skull based on the presence of these tissues.  This eliminates one of the most difficult aspects of reconstruction, the estimation of tissue thickness.  Additionally, any other bodily or physical evidence found in association with remains (e.g. jewelry, hair, glasses, etc.) are vital to the final stages of reconstruction because they directly reflect the appearance of the individual in question.

[[File:Steps of forensic facial reconstruction - Virtual Mummy - cogitas3d.gif|left|thumb|Steps of forensic facial reconstruction of a [[mummy]]]]

Most commonly, however, only the bony skull and minimal or no other soft tissues are present on the remains presented to forensic artists.  In this case, a thorough examination of the skull is completed.  This examination focuses on, but is not limited to, the identification of any bony pathologies or unusual landmarks, ruggedness of [[muscle]] attachments, profile of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], symmetry of the [[nasal bone]]s, [[dentition]], and wear of the occlusal surfaces.  All of these features have an effect on the appearance of an individual's face.

Once the examination is complete, the skull is cleaned and any damaged or fragmented areas are repaired with wax. The mandible is then reattached, again with wax, according to the alignment of teeth, or, if no teeth are present, by averaging the vertical dimensions between the mandible and [[maxilla]].  Undercuts (like the nasal openings) are filled in with modeling clay and [[prosthetic]] eyes are inserted into the orbits centered between the superior and inferior [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rims.  At this point, a plaster cast of the skull is prepared.  Extensive detail of the preparation of such a cast is presented in the article from which these methods are presented.

After the cast is set, colored plastics or the colored ends of safety matches are attached at twenty-one specific "landmark" areas that correspond to the reference data.  These sites represent the average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness for persons of the same sex, race, and age as that of the remains.  From this point on, all features are added using modeling clay.

First, the [[facial]] [[muscle]]s are layered onto the cast in the following order: temporalis, masseter, buccinator and occipito-frontals, and finally the soft tissues of the neck.  Next, the nose and lips are reconstructed before any of the other muscles are formed.  The lips are approximately as wide as the interpupillary distance.  However, this distance varies significantly with age, sex, race, and occlusion.  The nose is one of the most difficult facial features to reconstruct because the underlying [[bone]] is limited and the possibility of variation is expansive.  The nasal profile is constructed by first measuring the width of the nasal aperture and the nasal spine.  Using a calculation of three times the length of the spine plus the depth of tissue marker number five will yield the approximate nose length.  Next, the pitch of the nose is determined by examining the direction of the nasal spine - down, flat, or up.  A block of clay that is the proper length is then placed on the nasal spine and the remaining nasal tissue is filled in using tissue markers two and three as a guide for the bridge of the nose.  The [[Nasalis muscle|alae]] are created by first marking a point five millimeters below the bottom of the nasal aperture.  After the main part of the nose is constructed, the alae are created as small egg-shaped balls of clay, that are five millimeters in diameter at the widest point, these are positioned on the sides of the nose corresponding with the mark made previously.  The alae are then blended to the nose and the overall structure of the nose is rounded out and shaped appropriately.

The muscles of facial expression and the soft tissue around the eyes are added next.  Additional measurements are made according to race (especially for those with eye folds characteristic of Asian descent) during this stage.  Next, tissues are built up to within one millimeter of the tissue thickness markers and the ears (noted as being extremely complicated to reproduce) are added.  Finally, the face is "fleshed," meaning clay is added until the tissue thickness markers are covered, and any specific characterization is added (for example, hair, wrinkles in the skin, noted racial traits, glasses, etc.). The skull of Mozart was the basis of his facial reconstruction from anthropological data. The bust was unveiled at the "Salon du Son", Paris, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with facial reconstruction ==
There are multiple outstanding problems associated with forensic facial reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Lebedinskaya&gt;Lebedinskaya et al. ''Principles of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insufficient tissue thickness data ===
[[File:Gail Mathews.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction and actual photograph of [[Gary Ridgway|Green River victim]] Gail Mathews. The victim had distinctive lips, which could not be represented in the reconstruction, as her body was decomposed.]]
[[File:Durham, Ontario Jane Doe facial reconstructions.jpg|left|thumb|In many cases, the subject's hairstyle is unknown, which causes an artist to guess possible solutions, such as this unidentified woman found in Ontario, Canada.]]

The most pressing issue relates to the data used to average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness.  The data available to forensic artists are still very limited in ranges of ages, sexes, and body builds.  This disparity greatly affects the accuracy of reconstructions.  Until this data is expanded, the likelihood of producing the most accurate reconstruction possible is largely limited.&lt;ref name=Rathbun&gt;Rathbun. ''Personal Identification: Facial Reproductions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of methodological standardization ===
A second problem is the lack of a methodological standardization in approximating facial features.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; A single, official method for reconstructing the face has yet to be recognized.  This also presents major setback in facial approximation because facial features like the eyes and nose and individuating characteristics like hairstyle - the features most likely to be recalled by witnesses - lack a standard way of being reconstructed.  Recent research on [[computational forensics|computer-assisted methods]], which take advantage of digital image processing, pattern recognition, promises to overcome current limitations in facial reconstruction and linkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Subjectivity ===
Reconstructions only reveal the type of face a person ''may'' have exhibited because of artistic subjectivity.  The position and general shape of the main facial features are mostly accurate because they are greatly determined by the skull.&lt;ref name=Helmer&gt;Helmer et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Image:National Geographic - King Tut face.jpg|thumb|The facial reconstruction of [[Tutankhamun]] as shown on the cover of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in 2005.]]

In recent years, the presence of forensic facial reconstructions in the [[entertainment industry]] and the [[Mass media|media]] has increased.{{Or|date=November 2008}}  The way the fictional criminal investigators and forensic anthropologists utilize forensics and facial reconstructions are, however, often misrepresented{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} (an influence known as the "[[CSI effect]]").{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  For example, the fictional forensic investigators will often call for the creation of a facial reconstruction as soon as a set of skeletal remains is discovered. In many instances, facial reconstructions have been used as a last resort to stimulate the possibility of identifying an individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Crime: An Introduction to Forensic Archaeology'' {{ISBN|0-415-16612-8}} p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; 

Facial reconstruction has been featured as part of an array of forensic science methods in fictional TV shows like ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and their respective spinoffs in the [[CSI (franchise)|''CSI'']] and [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'']] franchises.

In ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', a long-running TV series centered around forensic analysis of decomposed and skeletal human remains, facial reconstruction is featured in the majority of episodes, used much like a police artist sketch in police procedurals. Regular cast character Angela Montenegro, the Bones team's facial reconstruction specialist, employs 3D software and holographic projection to "give victims back their faces" (as noted in the episode, "A Boy in a Bush").

In the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' episode "The Secret Of Parker House", MacGyver reconstructs the skull of Penny's aunt Betty while investigating her house.

The facial reconstruction of Egypt's [[Tutankhamun]], popularly known as King Tut, made the June 2005 cover of [[National Geographic Magazine]].

A variety of facial reconstruction kits toys are available, with "crime scene" versions, also, reconstructions of famous historical figures, like King Tut and the dinosaur [[T-Rex]].&lt;ref&gt;Several kits from various manufacturers are currently available, others have come and gone over the past decade or so, as evidenced by a Web search for "facial reconstruction kit." Several current models are [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&amp;field-keywords=facial%20reconstruction at amazon.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, facial reconstruction has been part of the process used by researchers attempting to identify human remains of two Canadian Army soldiers lost in [[World War I]]. One soldier was identified through DNA analysis in 2007, but due to DNA deterioration, identifying the second using the same techniques failed. In 2011, the second of the soldiers' remains discovered at [[Avion, Pas-de-Calais|Avion]], [[France]] were identified through a combination of 3-D printing software, reconstructive sculpture and use of isotopic analysis of bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-06-04/article-2558929/Where-science-meets-art/1|title=Where science meets art|last=Baird|first=Moira|date=June 4, 2011|work=The Telegram|publisher=Transcontinental Media|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quiring03222011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagegamer.net/2011/03/22/3d-printing-technology-helped-identify-canadian-ww1-soldier/|title=3D Printing Technology Helped Identify Canadian WW1 Soldier|last=Quiring|first=Tami|date=March 22, 2011|work=Village Gamer|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Aldergrove, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], the deceptively named '''free-space path loss''' ('''FSPL''') is the attenuation of radio energy between the feedpoints of two antennas that results from the combination of the receiving antenna's capture area plus the obstacle free, [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] path through [[free space]] (usually air).&lt;ref name="SensorsLowPower"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Islam|first1=Syad Kamrul|last2=Haider|first2=Mohammad Rafiqul|title=Sensors and Low Power Signal Processing|isbn=978-0387793917|page=49|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas",  IEEE Std 145-1993, defines "free-space loss" as "The loss between two isotropic radiators in free space, expressed as a power ratio."&lt;ref name="IEEE Std 145-1993(R2004)"&gt;{{cite book|title=IEEE Std 145-1993(R2004), IEEE Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas|date=1993|publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-55937-317-2|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this name and definition, the FSPL includes a receiving antenna aperture component in the total attenuation.&lt;ref name="SensorsLowPower"/&gt; It does not include any loss associated with hardware imperfections, or the effects of any antenna gains. A discussion of these losses may be found in the article on [[link budget]]. The FSPL is rarely used standalone, but rather as a part of the [[Friis transmission equation|Friis transmission formula]], which includes the gain of antennas.&lt;ref name="Friis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friis|first1=H.T.|title=A Note on a Simple Transmission Formula|journal=IRE Proc.|date=May 1946|pages=254-256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free-space path loss formula ==
The free-space path loss (FSPL) formula derives from the [[Friis transmission equation|Friis transmission formula]]&lt;ref name="Friis" /&gt; that states power gain of an antenna system thus...

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_r}{P_t} = D_t D_r \left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The FSPL formula expresses a loss value that is the reciprocal of gain and assumes the directivity for the transmit and receive antennas are isotropic and therefore unity. Both modifications simplify the equation to...

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
\mbox{FSPL} = \left ( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right )^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the signal wavelength,
*&lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the antennas,
*&lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt; are in the same unit of length,
*&lt;math&gt;\ d\gg\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that both antennas are in the [[Near and far field|far field]] of each other.&lt;ref name="AEH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Richard|title=Antenna Engineering Handbook|date=1984|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-07-032291-0|page=1-12|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitute &lt;math&gt;c/f&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; to calculate from frequency where:
*&lt;math&gt;\ c &lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light (in metres/s),
*&lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; is frequency (in Hz).

==Antenna effective aperture and free space loss==
Despite the misleading name, the free-space path loss formula inherits two important effects from the [[Friis Transmission Equation|Friis Transmission Formula]]:
*'''[[Intensity_(physics)|Intensity]]''' (&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;) - the power density due to path loss by spreading of the electromagnetic energy yielding loss proportional to the square of distance;&lt;ref name="SensorsLowPower"/&gt;
*'''[[Antenna_aperture|Antenna Capture Area]]''' (&lt;math&gt;A_{eff}&lt;/math&gt;) - the capability of the receiving antenna to capture electromagnetic energy yielding loss inversely proportional to the square of wavelength or proportional to the square of frequency.&lt;ref name="SensorsLowPower"/&gt;

Hence the equation for FSPL is:

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \mbox{FSPL} \propto \frac{1}{I \cdot A_{eff}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Friis implied the antennas are isotropic.&lt;ref name="Friis" /&gt; Hence the power density &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; from the isotropic transmit antenna vs. distance from the antenna &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is...

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
|I| \propto \frac{1}{4\pi d^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The effective area of the isotropic antenna is...

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
A_{eff} = \frac {\lambda^2}{4 \pi}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the two yields...

:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
\mbox{FSPL} &amp;= \left ( \frac{{4\pi d^2}}{1} \right ) \left ( \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2} \right ) \\
&amp;= \left ( \frac{16\pi^2d^2}{\lambda^2} \right ) \\
&amp;= \left ( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right )^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Free-space path loss in decibels ==

A convenient way to express FSPL is in terms of [[Decibel|dB]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mbox{FSPL(dB)}
  &amp;= 10\log_{10}\left(\left(\frac{4\pi d f}{c}\right)^2\right) \\
  &amp;= 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi d f}{c}\right)  \\
  &amp;= 20\log_{10}(d) + 20\log_{10}(f) + 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi}{c}\right) \\
  &amp;= 20\log_{10}(d) + 20\log_{10}(f) - 147.55
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the units are as before.

For typical radio applications, it is common to find &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; measured in units of [[Gigahertz|GHz]] and &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt; in km, in which case the FSPL equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mbox{FSPL(dB)} = 20\log_{10}(d) + 20\log_{10}(f) + 92.45&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\ d,f&lt;/math&gt; in meters and kilohertz, respectively, the constant becomes &lt;math&gt;\ -87.55&lt;/math&gt; .

For &lt;math&gt;\ d,f&lt;/math&gt; in meters and megahertz, respectively, the constant becomes &lt;math&gt;\ -27.55&lt;/math&gt; .

For &lt;math&gt;\ d,f&lt;/math&gt; in kilometers and megahertz, respectively, the constant becomes &lt;math&gt;\ 32.45&lt;/math&gt; .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14145">The '''geography of food''' is a field of [[human geography]]. It focuses on patterns of [[food production]] and [[food consumption|consumption]] on the local to global scale. Tracing these complex patterns helps geographers understand the unequal relationships between developed and [[developing countries]] in relation to the innovation, production, transportation, retail and consumption of food. It is also a topic that is becoming increasingly charged in the public eye. The movement to reconnect the 'space' and 'place' in the food system is growing, spearheaded by the research of geographers.

==History==
Spatial variations in food production and consumption practices have been noted for thousands of years. In fact, [[Plato]] commented on the [[environmental impact of agriculture|destructive nature of agriculture]] when he referred to the [[soil erosion]] from the mountainsides surrounding Athens, stating "[In previous years] Athens yielded far more abundant produce. In comparison of what then was, there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body; all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the land being left". Societies beyond those of ancient Greece have struggled under the pressure to feed expanding populations. The people of [[Easter Island]], the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] of [[Central America]] and most recently the inhabitants of [[Montana]] have been experiencing similar difficulties in production due to several interconnecting factors related to [[land management|land]] and [[resource management]]. These events have been extensively studied by geographers and other interested parties (the study of food has not been confined to a single discipline, and has received attention from a huge range of diverse sources).

Modern [[geographers]] initially focused on food as an economic activity, especially in terms of agricultural geography. It was not until recently that geographers have turned their attention to food in a wider sense: "The emergence of an agro-food geography that seeks to examine issues along the [[food chain]] or within systems of [[food provision]] derives, in part, from the strengthening of [[political economy]] approaches in the 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, P. and Bowler, I. 2001 ''Food in Society: Economy, Culture, Geography'' {{ISBN|978-0-340-72004-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlapping areas of study==
Food has received attention from both the [[physical sciences]] and the [[social sciences]] because it is a bridge between the natural and social worlds. Some of the earliest numerical data about food production come from bureaucratic sources linked to the ancient civilizations of Ancient Egypt and the Roman Empire. Traders have also been influential in documenting food networks. Early Indian merchants and traders mapped the location of trading posts associated with food production nodes.

[[Thomas Malthus]] famously stated that food output could only expand arithmetically (in proportion with the extension of farmland) while population could increase geometrically, leading to a 'population bomb' or a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. His theory was also given a spatial element when he predicted the [[Irish potato famine]] — a situation in which there was enough food within Ireland to feed the entire population, but access to food was limited.

==Food production==
Food production was the first element of food to receive extensive attention from geographers in the field of [[cultural geography]], particularly in [[agricultural geography]].

Globally, the production of food is unequal. This is because there are two main components involved in sustenance production that are also distributed irregularly. These components are the [[environmental capacity]] of the area, and the human capacity. Environmental capacity is its ability ‘to accommodate a particular activity or rate of an activity without unacceptable impact’.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection 1986. Environmental Capacity. An approach to marine pollution prevention.  Rep.Stud.GESAMP, (30):49p.&lt;/ref&gt; The climate, soil types, and availability of water affect it. Human capacity, in relation to food production, is the size of the population and the amount of agricultural skill within that population. When these two are at ideal levels and partnered with financial capital, the creation of intense agricultural infrastructure is possible, as the [[Green Revolution]] clearly portrays.

Simultaneously, the ability of a country to produce food is being severely impacted by a plethora of other factors:

[[Pest (organism)|Pests]] are becoming resistant to [[pesticides]], or pesticides may be killing off the useful and necessary insects.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, J. Food Security and Sustainability – Can we avert a food crisis? University of Sheffield. 29 June 2009. Keynote Address.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this happening occur around the globe. Tanzania experienced a particularly horrible infection of [[african armyworm|armyworms]] in 2005. At the infections peak, there were over 1000 larva per square meter. In 2009, Liberia experienced a state of emergency when invading [[African armyworm]] caterpillars began what became a regional [[food crisis]]. The caterpillars traveled through 65 towns and 20 000 people were forced to leave their homes, markets, and farms.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, J. Food Security and Sustainabliity – Can we avert a food crisis? University of Sheffield. 29 June 2009. Keynote Address.&lt;/ref&gt; Losses like this can cost millions to billions, depending on size and duration, and have severe effects on food security. The [[FAO]] has created an international team, the Plant Production and Protection Division, which is attempting to ‘reduce reliance on pesticides’ and ‘demonstrate that pesticide use often can be reduced considerably without affecting yields or farmer profits'&lt;ref&gt;FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). 2013. Pest and Pesticide Management. http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/core-themes/theme/pests/en/&lt;/ref&gt; in these, and other hard-struck areas.
[[File:Haboob2.jpg|thumb|Aeolian wind erosion in Phoenix, Arizona, USA on 22 August 2003.]]
[[Water stress]], [[desertification]], and erosion are leading to loss of [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). 2005. Irrigation in Africa in Figures: AQUASAT Survey – 2005. FAO Water Report No. 29. Rome, FAO ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/aglw/docs/wr29_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural practices use the bulk of the Earth’s fresh water – up to 70 percent – and those numbers are predicted to rise by 50-100 percent by 2025’.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (World Health Organization)/UN-Water. 2010. UN-Water Global Annual Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water: Targeting Resources for Better Results. Geneva, WHO/UN-Water.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries are being forced to divert more water than ever before to irrigate their land. Hydroelectric dams and mega-canal projects are becoming the new standard for countries like [[Egypt]] that can no longer depend on rainfall or natural flood cycles. These water shortages are also causing a source of conflict between neighboring nations as they live with increasingly high levels of [[water scarcity]]. Policy responses to these events could be implemented in order to strengthen the socio-economic growth, human health statuses, and environmental sustainability of these areas. Combining current limitations with water and transitions from practices such as agroforestry and shifting cultivation makes land susceptible to [[aeolian erosion]] by weakening soil composition and exposing larger areas of land to destructive wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley|first=William|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=9781405189316|location=United Kingdom|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeolian erosion largely effects deserted areas, reducing air quality, polluting water sources, and limiting fertility of nearby land.

[[Climate change]] is creating more extreme weather patterns, and agricultural practices are estimated to cause from 10 to 12 percent of greenhouses gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;The Strategy Unit. Food Matters: Towards a Strategy for the 21st Century. July 2008. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Warming will increase the previously mentioned rates of desertification and insect activity and agricultural zones near the equator may be lost. However, due to the uneven warming that will probably occur, higher latitudes are expected to warm up at faster rates than other areas of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, 1897, "A group of hypothesis bearing on climatic change" J. Geology 5:563–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are now presenting the idea that areas in Canada and Siberia may become suitable for farming at the industrial scale, and that those areas will be able to account for any farmland that is lost at the equator. Conservative estimates place the shift of traditional crops (maize, grain, potatoes) northward at 50 to 70 kilometers a decade. It is also believed that non-traditional crops (berries, sunflowers, melons) could be established on the southern sides of these countries.&lt;ref&gt;Tchebakova, N. (2012). Insight: Siberian agriculture could benefit from climate change. Krasnoyarsk: Sukachev Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in climate may force humans to adapt, adopt new practices, and alter old habits to promote success in the uncertain age of climate change ahead.

==Food consumption==
Criticisms of the [[food industry|industrialized food system]] regarding its inability to provide nutritious, ecologically sound, equitable food for the world's population has increased in recent history. Systems that are currently in place focus on providing relatively [[cheap food]] to millions, but often cost the Earth in terms of [[water pollution|water]] and [[soil degradation]], local [[food insecurity]], [[animal welfare]], rising [[obesity]] and health-related problems, and declining rural communities. Variations in diet and consumption practices on global and regional scales became the focus of geographers and economists with the vastly expanding population and widely publicized famines of the 1960s, and the food riots of 2007-2008 in 60 different countries. Due in part to these events, differences in the caloric intake of food and the composition of an average diet have been estimated and mapped for many countries since the 1960s.

Canada, USA, and Europe consume the highest amount of calories with an average [[per capita consumption]] of around 3400 calories daily.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, B., Heasman, M., &amp; Wright, J. Consumption in the Age of Affluence: The World of Food. Canada: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The recommended daily caloric intake for men and women living in these areas is 2500 and 2000 respectively. Studies focused on consumption patterns in these areas lay the blame for increased caloric intake on soft drink and fast food consumption, and decreased physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;St-Onge, M.P., Keller, K. L. &amp; Heymsfield, S. B. 2003. “Changes in childhood food consumption patterns: a cause for concern in light of increasing body weights” American Society for Clinical Nutrition. 78(6): 1068-1073.&lt;/ref&gt; Many developing countries are beginning to follow the leaders in rising caloric intake as they develop further due to increased availability of these high-impact items. Ballooning weight and associated health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart problems, and diabetes are being recorded in skyrocketing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, B., Heasman, M., &amp; Wright, J. Consumption in the Age of Affluence: The World of Food. Canada: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, consumption is still extremely uneven, with areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa still having some of the lowest rates of caloric intake per capita, often falling below the recommended levels. Much of this is due to lack of access of particular foods, which is a leading factor as to why much of the undernourished population is located in this region. In the world today, there are over 800 million people that are undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/resources/infographics/infographics-details/en/c/238873/|title=Understanding hunger and malnutrition|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] holds the lowest average, at 1800 calories daily; however, averages do not represent the range of inequality between the best and worst fed people within a region.&lt;ref&gt;Coons, K. A. &amp; Rogers, B. L. 2001. “Relationships Between Use of Television During Meals and Children’s Food Consumption Patterns.” Pediatrics. 107(1): 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, steps are being made to reduce caloric inequality. In parts of South Africa, the government has implemented a widespread electrification system featuring a free electricity allowance due to a study was conducted from 1991 to 2002 that found a positive increase in consumption habits within villages if given access to electricity. Access to electricity allowed for less time to be spent on menial tasks such as gathering firewood, and more time working on higher-level tasks that could increase income. In fact, villages often exceeded their electrical allowances.&lt;ref&gt;Madubanski, M. &amp; Shackleton, C. M. 2006. “Changing energy profiles and consumption patterns following electrification in five rural villages, South Africa.” Energy Policy. 34(18): 4081-4092.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8402">{{sociology}}
'''Historical sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] focusing on how [[society|societies]] develop through [[history]]. It looks at how [[social structures]] that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex social processes. The structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations, which affect the society - resulting in phenomena ranging from [[gender bias]] and [[income inequality]] to [[war]].

Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the [[State (polity)|state]] has developed since the [[Middle Ages]], analysing relations between states, classes, economic and political systems.

==Use of history in sociology==
As time has passed, history and sociology have developed into two different specific academic disciplines. Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways.  The first one is: Examining a theory through a Parallel investigation. To correspond with the natural-science conceptions of laws, and to look at, or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied. Or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process. The second theory that sociologists mainly use: applying and contrasting certain events or policies. Analysed by their specific, or what makes them in unique quality of a composition, certain events used by the sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared. For interpretive sociologists it is very common for them to use the 'Verstehen' tradition. And lastly, the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view. This is Mill's method: " a) principle of difference: a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent; and b) principle of agreement: cases with same effects are compared in terms of their (ideally identical) causes. There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill's method for sociological research, which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic, not deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 2007. "Comparative and Historical Sociology: Lecture Notes." &lt;http://deflem.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparative-and-historical-sociology.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Today, historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, Elizabeth S. "Toward a Historicized Sociology: Theorizing Events, Processes, and Emergence." EBSCOhost. Web. Oct.-Nov. 2010. &lt;http://ezp.tccd.edu:2321/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=cd26f66e-45f2-493d-804f-c67b713823ae%40sessionmgr114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pbh&amp;AN=26613934&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path dependence==
[[Path dependence]] to some sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past, have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future. However, sociologist James Mahoney has a different definition of path dependence. His theory suggests that "process, sequence, and temporality" have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events. There are three path-dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works. "1) the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive, in a sequence, to early historical events, which are more important than later events; 2) these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions; and 3) that once contingent events take place, the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. "Path Dependence in Historical Sociology." Welcome to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of South Carolina. 2007. Web. 2 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zcomphistnotes.html#problems&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over general theory in sociology==
James Mahoney revisited the debate over general theory in historical sociology. By bridging the gaps of different assumptions, causal agents and causal mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis, and this is seen as the general theory.
{{quote|... the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research. General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions. These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses, integrate existing findings, and explain historical outcomes. To illustrate these applications, the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology: functionalist, rational choice, power, neo-Darwinian, and cultural theories. A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James.

In [[Sharia|Islamic law]] (''sharia''), [[marriage]] (''nikāḥ'' نکاح) is a legal and social [[contract]] between two individuals. Islam is totally opposed to monasticism and celibacy.&lt;ref name="marriage1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | title=Importance of Marriage in Islam | publisher=al-islam.org | accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage is an act of [http://quran.al-islam.org Islam] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0006%3Asura%3D4%3Averse%3D4|title=Surah 4:4|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;and is strongly recommended;&lt;ref name="marriage1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onislam.net"&gt;http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/ethics-and-values/muslim-character/166329-marriage-is-the-prophets-sunnah.html&lt;/ref&gt; the age of marriage being whenever the individuals feel ready, financially and emotionally.&lt;ref name="onislam.net"/&gt; [[Polygny in Islam|Polygyny is permitted in Islam]] under some conditions, but [[polyandry]] is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article308231.ece |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311202547/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article308231.ece |archivedate=2011-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of marriage==

===Nikāḥ===
[[Image:Signing the Nikah.jpg|thumb|A Muslim bride signing the '''nikkah nama''' or marriage certificate]]
{{Main article|Nikah}}
''nikāḥ'' (Arabic: نكاح, literally, "to collect and bind together")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp Nikah.com Information: Definition of Nikah (Islamic marriage)]&lt;/ref&gt; is the first&amp;mdash;and most common&amp;mdash;form of marriage for [[Muslim]]s. It is described in the Qur'an in Surah 4:4.&lt;ref name="Q44"&gt;{{cite quran|4|4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations:
*While intended to be a permanent state, it can be terminated by the husband engaging in the ''[[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]]'' process or the wife seeking a ''[[Khula]]''.
*The couple inherit from each other.
*A legal [[contract]] is signed when entering the marriage. However it is not a requirement that the contract be in writing, it may be oral especially amongst illiterates; and if an agreed end-date is specified in the nikāḥ contract:
**In [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] jurisprudence, the contract is invalid.
**In [[Shia Islam|Shia]] jurisprudence, the contract defines a temporary marriage, ''nikāḥ mut'ah''.
{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated that prophet said, "fornicatoresses are those who marry without proof." (Tirmidhi vol. 2 book 6 no.1103)}}
Requirement of witnesses:
*two (2) witnesses from both sides&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html Witnesses for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110182956/http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html |date=2005-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permission from [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Wali]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm Nikah without Parents' Knowledge?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133650/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sunni: Compulsory ([[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]) ''or'' Strongly recommended ([[Hanafi]])
*Shia: Depending on the scholar, it is either obligatory or obligatory based on precaution.

===Nikāḥ mut‘ah===
{{Main article|Nikah mut‘ah}}
''nikāḥ mut‘ah'' (Arabic: نكاح متعة, temporary marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |website=Answering-Ansar.org |title=Mut'ah, a comprehensive guide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224032516/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |archivedate=2008-02-24 |date=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, There is controversy on the Islamic legality of this type of marriage, since Sunnis believe it was abrogated by Muhammad or Umar.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhara&lt;/ref&gt;while Shias do not hold this. According to Shia Hadith: Ali (r) said ‘Had Umar not banned Mut’ah then the only person to fornicate would have been a disgraceful person, since Mut’ah is easy, and one can attain the objective, there would have then been no need to indulge in haraam acts. It is clear that if Mut’ah’s abrogation was Sahih then Jabir would not have opposed Omar, and that if Islamic prophet outlawed it, the Companions would not have practiced it during the reign of Abu Bakr. Someone asked Abdullah bin Umar (about Mut’ah) saying: ‘Your father prohibited it. (Ibn Umar replied): ‘Is the order of the Messenger of Allah, more deserving to be followed, or the order of my father?’ [http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/mutah/umar-banned-mutah.html].

''However, similar to normal marriages that are common among Sunnis and Shi'ias, the woman still is given her ''[[mahr]]'',and the woman must still observe the ''[[iddah]]'', a period of time where the woman cannot remarry. This is to ensure that there is no pregnancy from the ex-husband and thus clarifies paternal lineage.''

Quran 4:24 (Pickthall)- And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-24/ Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 24 )]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikāḥ misyar===
{{Main article|Nikah Misyar}}
nikāḥ Misyaar is a nikāḥ in Sunni's carried out via the normal contractual procedure, with the specificity that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of [[polygamy]], the wife's rights to housing, and maintenance money (''"[[nafaqa]]"''), and the husband's right of homekeeping, and access etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |first=Yusuf |last=Al-Qaradawi |title=Misyar marriage |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104035953/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |archivedate=2011-01-04 |date=2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between this and Mut'ah is that Mut'ah has the condition of a definite time period. Allowing both husband and wife aware of a separation date, prior to a marriage contract. Sunnah Scholars have said it is permissible to marry a Woman with the intention of getting divorced, If the Wife is not informed or expecting a divorce during a marriage contract. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misyar_marriage]

===Nikah Istibdaa===
It is a marriage ( نکاح استبضاع) in which a husband would send his wife to another person, usually of noble lineage, to have sexual relations with him. The husband would refrain from sexual relations with his wife until she became pregnant by the other man. Afterwards, the man would claim paternity of the conceived child. This was done to get a child of noble breed. It was eradicated by Islam.&lt;ref&gt; Sahih Bukhari 5127 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikāḥ Shighār===
It is marriage (نکاح شغار) in which two men would exchange their daughters, sisters or other close  women for marriage without paying [[Mahr]]. It was prohibited by [[Muhammad]]. &lt;ref&gt; sahih Bukhari 6960 &lt;/ref&gt;
=== Nikāḥ ijtimaa===
{{main article|Nikah Ijtimah}}
This is polyandrous marriage, in which up to ten men would have sexual relations with the same woman at around the same time. When she bore a child she would call all the men and attribute paternity of the child to a man of her choosing. This practice was eradicated by Islam.

===Interfaith marriage===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}

Muslim males may marry a non-Muslim female, specifically, one from the "[[People of the Book]]", which includes [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. Conversion is optional for the woman,  but she is nonetheless charged with having a proper understanding of her respective faith as well as engaging in its true and thorough practise. Muslim women have generally forbidden from marrying non-Muslims by some interpretations. But today, more and more scholars have been questioning this ages-long assumption.

==Restrictions on marriage==

===Polygyny===
{{Main article|Polygyny in Islam}}
[[Muslim]] men are allowed to practise [[polygyny]], that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four, per [[Sura]] 4 Verse 3. A man does not need approval of his first wife for a second marriage as there is no evidence in the Qur'an or hadith to suggest this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#18._SECOND_MARRIAGE_WITHOUT_FIRST_WIFE_CONSENT_ Section 30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/61 Validity of second marriage without consent of first]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=82068 IslamWeb Fatwa Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; The only requirement is to create fairness among his wives and to never hurt one wife to please another as this would be unjust. If this requirement cannot be fulfilled, then he can only marry one woman.

[[Polyandry]], the practice of a woman having more than one husband, by contrast, is not permitted. One of the main reasons for this would be the potential questioning of paternal lineage. The Quran states: (30:21): “And among His signs is that He has created for you, from your selves, mates, that you may incline towards them and find rest in them, and He has engendered love and tenderness between you. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.”

===Permissible age===
''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' permits marriage once a person reaches sexual maturity (i.e.: menstruation, voice changing, wet dreams)  (''[[baligh]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Sexual maturity in Sharia law is typically understood to mean puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Islam and the Everyday World: Public Policy Dilemmas{{snd}} Page 102, Sohrab Behdad, Farhad Nomani, Farhad Nomani{{snd}} 2006&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, intercourse is forbidden until they are able to physically bear it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#4._MARRIAGE_AGE_ Requirement for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}
Traditionally, Muslim jurists hold that Muslim women may only enter into marriage with Muslim men. The Qur'an explicitly allows Muslim men to marry chaste women of the [[People of the Book]], a term which includes [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|5|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interfaith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scholarofthehouse.com/oninma.html |title=On Christian Men marrying Muslim Women |accessdate=2008-01-20 |last=El Fadl |first=Abou |year=2006 |work=Scholar of the House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arranged and forced marriages===
An [[Arranged marriage|engagement may be arranged]] between families for their children, but Islamic requirements for a legal marriage include the requirement that both parties, bride, groom and guardian for the bride (''[[wali]]''), give their legal consent. A marriage without the consent of the bride or [[forced marriage|performed under coercion]] is illegal according to the majority of scholars.

If a girl has not attained the age of puberty, the vast majority of scholars hold that she cannot be married; and many stipulate that it must be in her best interest in order to be considered a valid marriage. There is some dispute as to whether or not an under-age bride can leave her family's custody and be transferred to her husband's custody, if she has not yet reached puberty. Some evidence supporting both sides can be seen in the following narrations from Muhammad:

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that 'Aisha remained with the Prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).

Sahih Bukhari 7.18 Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for 'Aisha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said "But I am your brother." The Prophet said, "You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry."

however; evidence from other Islamic sources seems to suggest that this is not something allowed for all Muslims; rather specifically for Muhammad. The evidence for this view is as follows:

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: "A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness)." [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim &amp; Others]

It is reported in a hadith that A'ishah related that she once asked the Prophet: "In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?" He replied: "Yes, she must give her permission." She then said: "But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!" He replied: "Her silence is [considered as] her permission." [Al-Bukhari, Muslim, &amp; Others]

It appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary for her marriage to be considered valid;the above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract.

===Adulterers===
Islam does not give [[Adultery|adulterous]] men the right to marry a [[Chastity|chaste]] woman and nor may an adulterous woman marry a chaste man, except if the matter has not gone to court and the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|3|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|221|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], [[Mizan]], Chapter:The Social Law of Islam, [[Al-Mawrid]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity|{{cite quran|24|26|style=ref}}}}

===Other===
A woman or man may propose marriage directly or through an intermediary ([[Matchmaking|matchmaker]]).

Recognition or celebration of same-sex marriage is completely unjustified in the view of Islamic law. [[Homosexuality and Islam|Islam forbids homosexuality]] in Qur'anic injunctions and Islamic tradition.

A marriage is registered by the ''[[Qadi]]'' who performs the short ceremony.

Unlike the [[wedding ring]] in Western societies, there is no visible sign worn to show a woman or a man is married. However, some Muslims have found the wedding ring to be a non-religious tradition and have used a ring.

===Mahr===
{{Main article|Mahr}}
Mahr is a mandatory gift given by the groom to the bride. Unlike a [[bride price]], however, it is given directly to the bride and not to her father.  Although the gift is often money, it can be anything agreed upon by bride and groom such as a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she chooses.

===Islamic marriage contract===
{{Main article|Islamic marriage contract}}
The purpose, rules, and regulations of the [[Islamic marriage contract]]. A Muslim marriage is not a ''sacrament'', but a simple, legal agreement in which either partner is free to include conditions. These conditions are stipulated in a written contract. Violating any of the conditions stipulated in this contract is legal grounds for a partner seeking divorce. The first part of the Nikah, ''marriage ceremony'' is the signing of the marriage contract itself.

Various traditions may differ in how Nikah is performed because different groups accept different texts as authoritative. Therefore, Sunnis will likely accept the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]], while Shia will have their own collections, for example [[Kitab al-Kafi|Furu al-Kafi]], thus producing different procedures. This contract requires the consent of both parties. There is a tradition, outside of the religion, in some Muslim countries to pre-arrange a marriage for young children. However, the marriage still requires consent for the wedding to legally take place.

Divorce is not forbidden as a last resort, however the dissolution of the contract [[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]], is often described as the most disliked of permissible things in Islam and should be used as a last resort.

==Walima==
{{main article|Walima}}
The [[Walima]] is a dinner given by the groom's side of the family to celebrate the welcoming of the bride to the family. It is a strong [[sunnah]] (the repetition of an action of Muhammad) and it is recommended to be held the earliest possible day after the Nikah.

==Behavior within marriage==

===Spousal rights and obligations===
{{Main article|Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam}}
Islam advocates a role-based relationship between husband and wife.

[[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar]] narrated:
{{quote|The Prophet said, "All of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards. The ruler is a guardian and the man is a guardian of his family; the lady is a guardian and is responsible for her husband's house and his offspring; and so all of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards."|Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 7, Book 62, Number 128}}

It puts the main responsibility of earning over the husband. Both are obliged to fulfill the other's sexual needs. Both are obliged to treat each other with kindness.

====Separate accommodation for wife====
The wife has the right to live in separate accommodation with her husband and children, if she does not like to share it with anyone like her in-law or relatives. This is the view of most of the Hanafi, Shaafa’i and Hanbali fuqaha. She also has the right to refuse to live with her husband's father, mother and siblings.

Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: That he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for his charge." I definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet also said, "A man is a guardian of his father's property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges."[Sahih Bukhari]

This indicates that a wife is responsible for the house of her husband. Also that a man should be the guardian of his family, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;after his marriage he moves out of his father's house, and runs his own family affairs and is guardian of his family. In joint family, typically the head is either the father of the husband, or mother of the husband. This also indicates that a husband should look after his parent's house, as "a man is a guardian of his father's property". So the wife should not object to her husband when he is looking after affairs of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learndeen.com/jm/blog/85-razi-blog/183-rights-of-spouses-and-issues-in-joint-family-system.html Rights of Spouses and issues with joint family]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexuality====
{{Main article|Islamic sexual jurisprudence}}
Sexuality in Islam is largely described by the Qur'an, Islamic tradition, and religious leaders both past and present as being confined to marital relationships between men and women. While most traditions discourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity and modesty with regards to any relationships across gender lines, holding forth that intimacy as perceived within Islam (encompassing a swath of life more broad than strictly sex) is to be reserved for marriage.

[[Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud]] narrated:
{{quote|We were with the Prophet while we were young and had no wealth whatever. So Allah's Apostle said, "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual desire."|Volume 7, Book 62, Number 4:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614011220/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.086 |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While adulterous relationships are strictly forbidden, permissible sexual relationships within marriage are described in Islamic sources as great wells of love and closeness for the couple involved. Sexual relationship between married couples are even source of rewards from [[God]] as doing the opposite; i.e.,&amp;nbsp;satisfying sexual needs through illicit means has punishment. Specific occasions (most notably daytime [[Fasting#Islam|fasting]] (see [[sawm]]) and [[menstruation]]) are times forbidden for intercourse, though not for other ways of touching and being close to one another. [[Islamic views on anal sex|Anal sex]] with one's wife is also strictly prohibited.

Islam has an open and playful approach to sex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10031095/Sex-What-Muslim-women-really-want-in-the-bedroom.html], Article titled “Sex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom”, by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, May 2, 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "100 facts" &gt;[http://facts.randomhistory.com/islam-facts.html ], 100 Interesting Facts About …&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery.

===Gender roles===
The Qur'an asserts that there are innate differences between women and men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/3/36 "And the male is not like the female."]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Islam places different rights over the husband and wife.

Some similar rights which both the husband and wife owe to each other are:
* The right to enjoy each other.
* The right to inherit from each other.
* The right of confirmation of the lineage of their children.

Some rights which the husband owes to his wife are:
* The dower (Mahr)
* Support
* Kind and proper treatment&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Part 2: The Duties of Men |url=https://www.al-islam.org/principles-marriage-family-ethics-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/part-2-duties-men}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marital relations
* Not to be beaten on face
* Privacy
* Justice between multiple wives
* To be taught her religion
* Defense of her honor&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"/&gt;

Some rights which the wife owes to her husband are:

* Being head of the household
* To be obeyed in all that is not disobedience to Allah
* Marital relations
* That she not allow anyone in the house of whom he disapproves
* That she not leave the house without his permission
* That she protect his property
* To be thanked for his efforts
* That she can only undertake a voluntary fast with his permission

These are some of the rights which spouses owe one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_8.php Rights of spouses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#15.

'''Julius Stone''' (7 July 1907 – 1985) was [[Challis Professor]] of [[Jurisprudence]] and [[International Law]] at the [[University of Sydney]] from 1942 to 1972, and thereafter a visiting Professor of Law at the [[University of New South Wales]] and concurrently Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

He is the author of 27 books on jurisprudence and international law, and is hailed by his official biography at the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence as one of the premier legal theorists.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml Biography of Julius Stone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623171512/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml |date=23 June 2006 }}, Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence, Sydney Law School, University of Sydney.  URL accessed 5 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Stone was born in [[Leeds]], England to parents who were poor [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] refugees.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Education==
Stone received a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], where he earned Bachelor of Arts (Jurisprudence), [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] and [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degrees. He followed this with a [[Master of Laws]] from [[Leeds University]], and then a [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] from [[Harvard University]].

==Career==
Stone taught at Harvard, and briefly at Leeds, then went to [[New Zealand]] where he worked at [[Auckland University College]]. In 1942, he was appointed [[Challis Professor]] of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[University of Sydney]], a position he held until 1972. Stone's appointment was controversial for several reasons; he was perceived to have a radical jurisprudential stance, some wanted the Chair to be held open until the end of the war as it was suggested that there were suitable candidates in active service. It was suspected that the fact that he was a Jew also played a role. A debate over his appointment was carried out in both the Australian parliament and local newspapers; the Chancellor of the University, and two Fellows of the University Senate, resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; This early experience of [[anti-Semitism]] influenced his lifelong commitment to justice, according to his biographer, Leonie Star (Star 1993).

Stone has been described by his official ''JSIJ'' biography as having "a life-long commitment to Israel"&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; and in the ''[[Sydney Law Review]]'' as having an emotional and "fierce loyalty to the State of Israel" that led some of his colleagues to "express fear even to discuss Israel with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kirby|first1= Michael|authorlink=Michael Kirby (judge)|year=2005 |title= Julius Stone and the Struggle for the Soul of Law |journal= [[Sydney Law Review]] |publisher= [[University of Sydney]]  |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=323, 332 |url= http://sydney.edu.au/law/slr/docs_pdfs/editions/slr_v27_n2.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Stone moved to the [[University of New South Wales]], where he was a visiting Professor of Law until his death in 1985. While at University of New South Wales, he concurrently held the position of Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

In 1999, 15 years after Stone's death, the University of Sydney established an institute of jurisprudence which was named after him, the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="stone_inst"&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614004212/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/ |date=14 June 2006 }} Accessed 21 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Stone influenced generations of lawyers who studied at University of Sydney. For most of his time there, the Law School was a practice-based school and students learnt what they needed to become practising lawyers. According to A J Brown of Griffith University, the former [[Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] was heavily influenced at university by Stone. [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24992503-5001030,00.html]

===Israeli settlements===
Stone's view is that [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] are legal under international law, and do not constitute a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (Article 49(6)). He stated:

"Irony would...be pushed to the absurdity of claiming that Article 49(6), designed to prevent repetition of Nazi-type genocidal policies of rendering Nazi metropolitan territories judenrein, has now come to mean that...the West Bank...must be made judenrein and must be so maintained, if necessary by the use of force by the government of Israel against its own inhabitants. Common sense as well as correct historical and functional context excludes so tyrannical a reading of Article 49(6.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=378&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=5603&amp;TTL=The_Settlements_Issue:_Distorting_the_Geneva_Convention_and_the_Oslo_Accords The Settlements Issue: Distorting the Geneva Convention and the Oslo Accords ]&lt;/ref&gt;

*World Research Award from the Washington Conference on World Peace through Law (1965).
*The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence at Sydney Law School, [[University of Sydney]] is named in his honour.

==Criticism==
Stone has been criticised for his views in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] by [[Ben Saul]], saying: "Many of Stone’s positions on critical international legal issues in the Israel/Palestine conflict stepped outside even generous zones of plausible or reasonable interpretations of the law, even on the law as it then often ambiguously stood, and certainly in hindsight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ben Saul|year=2009|title=Julius Stone and the Question of Palestine in International Law|journal=Legal Studies Research Paper|issue= 09/106|pages=Abstract|publisher=University of Sidney|ssrn=1485056|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kiss''' is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object. Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely. Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of [[love]], [[Passion (emotion)|passion]], [[romance (love)|romance]], [[sexual attraction]], [[sexual activity]], [[sexual arousal]], [[affection]], [[respect]], [[greeting]], [[friendship]], [[peace]], and good luck, among many others. In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or [[sacrament]]. The word came from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:en:cyssan#Old English|cyssan]]'' ("to kiss"), in turn from ''coss'' ("a kiss").

[[Anthropologist]]s are divided into two schools on the origins of kissing, one believing that it is [[instinct]]ual and intuitive and the other that it evolved from what is known as ''[[premastication|kiss feeding]]'', a process used by mothers to feed their infants by passing chewed food to their babies' mouths.&lt;ref name=demirjian&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7348582 The (Mostly) Blissful History of Kissing], ''NPR'' February 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to kissing-like behavior comes from the [[Vedas]], Sanskrit scriptures that informed [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150714-why-do-we-kiss?ocid=fbind|title=Why do humans kiss each other when most animals don't?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], around 3,500 years ago, according to Vaughn Bryant, an anthropologist at Texas A&amp;M University who specializes in the history of the kiss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine’s-day-story-starters/] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141204235151/http://tamunews.tamu.edu/valentine%E2%80%99s-day-story-starters/ |date=2014-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both lip and tongue kissing are mentioned in [[Sumer]]ian poetry:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kramer |first=Samuel Noah |year=1981 |title=History Begins at Sumer |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-1276-1 |pages=72ff |edition=3rd revised.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kissing is described in the surviving [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptian]] love poetry from the [[New Kingdom]], found on [[Papyrus|papyri]] excavated at [[Deir el-Medina]]:
{{quote|Finally I will drink life from your lips &lt;br /&gt;and wake up from this ever lasting sleep.}}
{{quote|The wisdom of the earth in a kiss &lt;br /&gt;and everything else in your eyes.}}

{{quote|And when her lips are pressed to mine &lt;br /&gt;I am made drunk and need not wine.&lt;br /&gt;When we kiss, and her warm lips half open,&lt;br /&gt;I fly cloud-high without beer!}}
{{quote|His kisses on my lips, my breast, my hair...&lt;br /&gt;...Come! Come! Come! And kiss me when I die,&lt;br /&gt;For life, compelling life, is in thy breath;&lt;br /&gt;And at that kiss, though in the tomb I lie,&lt;br /&gt;I will arise and break the bands of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.love-poetry-of-the-world.com/Egyptian-Love-Poetry-Poem2.html|title=Love Poetry of the World (Egyptian)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest reference to kissing in the [[Old Testament]] is in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 27:26, when [[Jacob]] deceives his father to obtain his blessing:
{{quote|And his father [[Isaac]] said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.}}

Genesis 29:11 features the first man-woman kiss in the [[Bible]], when Jacob flees from [[Esau]] and goes to the house of his uncle [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]:
{{quote|And Jacob kissed [[Rachel]], and lifted up his voice, and wept.}}

Much later, there is the oft-quoted verse from the [[Song of Songs]]:
{{quote|May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,&lt;br /&gt;for your love is better than wine.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Richard S. ''Song of Songs'', Baker Academic (2005) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/songs/1-2.htm "Song of Solomon 1:2], Bible Hub, Biblos&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' (370 BC), [[Xenophon]] wrote about the [[Persis|Persian]] custom of kissing in the lips upon departure while narrating the departure of [[Cyrus the Great]] (c. 600 BC) as a boy from his [[Medes|Median]] kinsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Xen.%20Cyr.%201.4.28 1.4.27]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), when two Persians meet, the greeting formula expresses their equal or inequal status. They do not speak; rather, equals kiss each other on the mouth, and in the case where one is a little inferior to the other, the kiss is given on the cheek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/herodotus-iii|title=HERODOTUS  iii. DEFINING THE PERSIANS  – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herodotus-persians.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=legacy.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later Classical period, affectionate mouth-to-mouth kissing was first described in the Hindu epic the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

Academics who have studied it say kissing spread slowly to other parts of the world after [[Alexander the Great]] and his army conquered parts of Punjab in northern India in 326 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberalarts.tamu.edu/html/news--first-kiss-how-we-learned-to-lock-lips.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208001512/http://liberalarts.tamu.edu/html/news--first-kiss-how-we-learned-to-lock-lips.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romans]] helped to spread the habit to most of Europe and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name="Lorenzi"&gt;Lorenzi, Rossella [http://news.discovery.com/history/history-of-kissing-130214.htm Kissing's Long History: Discovery News] Feb 14, 2013 08:30 AM ET, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans were passionate about kissing and talked about several types of kissing. Kissing the hand or cheek was called an {{lang|la|osculum}}. Kissing on the lips with mouth closed was called a {{lang|la|basium}}, which was used between relatives. A kiss of passion was called a {{lang|la|suavium}}.&lt;ref name="Terry Jones"&gt;Jones, Terry "The Ancient World According to Terry Jones (Love and Sex)" (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kissing was not always an indication of ''eros'', or love, but also could show respect and rank as it was used in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]].

The study of kissing started sometime in the nineteenth century and is called '''philematology''', which has been studied by people including Cesare Lombroso, [[Ernest Crawley]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and modern scholars such as [[Elaine Hatfield]].&lt;ref name=Kirshenbaum&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/14/opinion/kirshenbaum-science-kissing "The science of kissing"], ''CNN'', Feb. 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Furtwangler&gt;[http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 "Chemical attraction: The science of kissing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090009/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=116267 |date=2013-08-23 }}, ''Medill Reports'', Feb. 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristoffer Nyrop identified a number of types of kisses, including kisses of love, affection, peace, respect and friendship. He notes, however, that the categories are somewhat contrived and overlapping, and some cultures have more kinds, including the French with twenty and the Germans with thirty.&lt;ref name=Nyrop&gt;Nyrop, Christoper. ''The Kiss and its History'', Sands &amp; Co., London (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UQgNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Read full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expression of affection ===

Kissing another person's lips has become a common expression of affection or warm greeting in many cultures worldwide. Yet in certain cultures, kissing was introduced only through European settlement, before which it was not a routine occurrence. Such cultures include certain indigenous peoples of Australia, the Tahitians, and many tribes in Africa.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;Dyer, Tristeleton T.F. "The History of Kissing", ''The American Magazine'', vol. 14 1882, pp. 611–614&lt;/ref&gt;

A kiss can also be used to express feelings without an erotic element but can be nonetheless "far deeper and more lasting", writes Nyrop. He adds that such kisses can be expressive of love "in the widest and most comprehensive meaning of the word, bringing a message of loyal affection, gratitude, compassion, sympathy, intense joy, and profound sorrow."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|79}}

Nyrop writes that the most common example is the "intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between other members of the same family, which can include those outside the immediate family circle, "everywhere where deep affection unites people."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|82}} The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when [[Orpah]] kissed her mother-in-law and when [[Moses]] went to meet his father-in-law, he "did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent" (Exodus 18:7); and when Jacob had wrestled with the Lord he met Esau, ran towards him, fell on his neck and kissed him. The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], as when [[Odysseus]], on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|82–83}}

Affection can be a cause of kissing "in all ages in grave and solemn moments," notes Nyrop, "not only among those who love each other, but also as an expression of profound gratitude. When the [[Apostle Paul]] took leave of the elders of the congregation at [[Ephesus]], "they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him" (Acts 20:37). Kisses can also be exchanged between total strangers, as when there is a profound sympathy with or the warmest interest in another person.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|85}}

[[Folk poetry]] has been the source of affectionate kisses where they sometimes played an important part, as when they had the power to cast off spells or to break bonds of witchcraft and sorcery, often restoring a man to his original shape. Nyrop notes the poetical stories of the "redeeming power of the kiss are to be found in the literature of many countries, especially, for example, in the Old French Arthurian romances (Lancelot, Guiglain, Tirant le blanc) in which the princess is changed by evil arts into a dreadful dragon, and can only resume her human shape in the case of a knight being brave enough to kiss her." In the reverse situation, in the tale of "[[Beauty and the Beast]]", a transformed prince then told the girl that he had been bewitched by a wicked fairy, and could not be recreated into a man unless a maid fell in love with him and kissed him, despite his ugliness.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|95–96}}

A kiss of affection can also take place after death. In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], it is written that when Jacob was dead, "Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him." And it is told of [[Abu Bakr]], [[Muhammad]]'s first disciple, father-in-law, and successor, that, when the prophet was dead, he went into the latter's tent, uncovered his face, and kissed him. Nyrop writes that "the kiss is the last tender proof of love bestowed on one we have loved, and was believed, in ancient times, to follow mankind to the nether world."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|97}}

Kissing on the lips can be a physical expression of affection or love between two people in which the sensations of touch, taste, and smell are involved.&lt;ref name=Brayer /&gt; According to the psychologist Menachem Brayer, although many "mammals, birds, and insects exchange caresses" which appear to be kisses of affection, they are not kisses in the human sense.

Surveys indicate that kissing is the second most common form of [[physical intimacy]] among United States adolescents (after [[holding hands]]), and that about 85% of 15 to 16-year-old adolescents in the US have experienced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00061-0 |pmid=10706169 |title=Smart teens don't have sex (or kiss much either) |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–25 |year=2000 |last1=Halpern |first1=Carolyn Tucker |last2=Joyner |first2=Kara |last3=Udry |first3=J.Richard |last4=Suchindran |first4=Chirayath }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kiss on the lips ===
The kiss on the lips can be performed between two [[friend]]s or family. This move aims to express affection for a friend. Unlike kissing for [[love]], a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The kiss on the lips is a practice that can be found in the time of [[Patriarchs (Bible)]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, [http://biblehub.com/topical/k/kiss.htm Kiss], UK, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Greece]], the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Gasc, racontemoilhistoire.com, [http://www.racontemoilhistoire.com/2016/01/20/bisou-bouche-histoire/ Le bisou], France, January 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[kiss of peace]] was recommended by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Yannick Carré, ''Le baiser sur la bouche au Moyen Âge : rites, symboles, mentalités, à travers les textes et les images, XIe-XVe siècles'', Le Léopard d'Or, 1992, page 357&lt;/ref&gt; The kiss on the lips was also common among knights.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Gasc racontemoilhistoire.com, [http://www.racontemoilhistoire.com/2016/01/20/bisou-bouche-histoire/ Le bisou], France, January 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Anderson, Adi Adams, Ian Rivers, Archives of Sexual Behavior [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47521172_I_Kiss_Them_Because_I_Love_Them_The_Emergence_of_Heterosexual_Men_Kissing_in_British_Institutes_of_Education “I Kiss Them Because I Love Them”: The Emergence of Heterosexual Men Kissing in British Institutes of Education], UK, April 2012, Volume 41. 2, pages 421–430&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal 7sur7.be, [http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1520/Sexe-Relations/article/detail/1176526/2010/10/29/Nouvelle-tendance-des-bisous-sur-la-bouche-entre-amis.dhtml Nouvelle tendance: des bisous sur la bouche entre amis!], Belgium, October 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mail Reporter, dailymail.co.uk, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1324799/How-men-kissing-lips-friendship-longer-taboo.html How men kissing each other on the lips in friendship is 'no longer taboo'], UK, October 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romantic kiss ===
[[File:Kuss.jpg|thumb|A romantic kiss]]

In many cultures, it is considered a harmless custom for [[teenagers]] to kiss on a [[dating|date]] or to engage in [[party games|kissing games]] with friends. These games serve as icebreakers at parties and may be some participants' first exposure to sexuality. There are many such games, including [[Truth or Dare?]], [[Seven Minutes in Heaven]] (or the variation "Two Minutes in the Closet"), [[Spin the Bottle]], [[Post Office (game)|Post Office]], and Wink.

The psychologist William Cane notes that kissing in [[Western world|Western]] society is often a romantic act and describes a few of its attributes:
{{quotation|It's not hard to tell when two people are in love. Maybe they're trying to hide it from the world, still they cannot conceal their inner excitement. Men will give themselves away by a certain excited trembling in the muscles of the lower jaw upon seeing their beloved. Women will often turn pale immediately of seeing their lover and then get slightly red in the face as their sweetheart draws near. This is the effect of physical closeness upon two people who are in love.&lt;ref name=Cane&gt;Cane, William. ''The Art of Kissing'', Macmillan (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|9}}}}

Romantic kissing in Western cultures is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek literature. In the Middle Ages it became a social gesture and was considered a sign of refinement of the upper classes.&lt;ref name=Brayer&gt;Brayer, Menachem M. ''The Jewish Woman in Rabbinic Literature'', KTAV Publishing House (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|150–151}} Other cultures have different definitions and uses of kissing, notes Brayer. In [[China]], for example, a similar expression of affection consists of rubbing one's nose against the cheek of another person. In other Eastern cultures kissing is not common. In South East Asian countries the "sniff kiss" is the most common form of affection and Western [[Human mouth|mouth]] to mouth kissing is often reserved for sexual foreplay. In some tribal cultures the "equivalent for our 'kiss me' is 'smell me.'"{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The kiss can be an important expression of love and [[eroticism|erotic]] emotions. In his book ''The Kiss and its History'', Kristoffer Nyrop describes the kiss of love as an "exultant message of the longing of love, love eternally young, the burning prayer of hot desire, which is born on the lovers' lips, and 'rises,' as Charles Fuster has said, 'up to the blue sky from the green plains,' like a tender, trembling thank-offering." Nyrop adds that the love kiss, "rich in promise, bestows an intoxicating feeling of infinite happiness, courage, and youth, and therefore surpasses all other earthly joys in sublimity."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|30}} He also compares it to achievements in life: "Thus even the highest work of art, yet, the loftiest reputation, is nothing in comparison with the passionate kiss of a woman one loves."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|31}}

The power of a kiss is not minimized when he writes that "we all yearn for kisses and we all seek them; it is idle to struggle against this passion. No one can evade the omnipotence of the kiss ..." Kissing, he implies, can lead one to maturity: "It is through kisses that a knowledge of life and happiness first comes to us. Runeberg says that the angels rejoice over the first kiss exchanged by lovers," and can keep one feeling young: "It carries life with it; it even bestows the gift of eternal youth." The importance of the lover's kiss can also be significant, he notes: "In the case of lovers a kiss is everything; that is the reason why a man stakes his all for a kiss," and "man craves for it as his noblest reward."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|37}}

As a result, kissing as an expression of love is contained in much of literature, old and new. Nyrop gives a vivid example in the classic love story of [[Daphnis and Chloe]]. As a reward "Chloe has bestowed a kiss on Daphnis—an innocent young-maid's kiss, but it has on him the effect of an electrical shock":&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|47}}
{{quotation|Ye gods, what are my feelings. Her lips are softer than the rose's leaf, her mouth is sweet as honey, and her kiss inflicts on me more pain than a bee's sting. I have often kissed my kids, I have often kissed my lambs, but never have I known aught like this. My pulse is beating fast, my heart throbs, it is as if I were about to suffocate, yet, nevertheless, I want to have another kiss. Strange, never-suspected pain! Has Chloe, I wonder, drunk some poisonous draught ere she kissed me? How comes it that she herself has not died of it?}}
Romantic kissing "requires more than simple proximity," notes Cane. It also needs "some degree of intimacy or privacy, ... which is why you'll see lovers stepping to the side of a busy street or sidewalk."&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt; Psychologist [[Wilhelm Reich]] "lashed out at society" for not giving young lovers enough privacy and making it difficult to be alone.&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt; However, Cane describes how many lovers manage to attain romantic privacy despite being in a public setting, as they "lock their minds together" and thereby create an invisible sense of "psychological privacy." He adds, "In this way they can kiss in public even in a crowded plaza and keep it romantic."&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt;{{Rp|10}} Nonetheless, when Cane asked people to describe the most romantic places they ever kissed, "their answers almost always referred to this ends-of-the-earth isolation, ... they mentioned an apple orchard, a beach, out in a field looking at the stars, or at a pond in a secluded area ..."&lt;ref name=Cane /&gt;{{Rp|10}}

== Kiss as ritual ==
[[File:Maestranza-1.jpg|thumb|Kiss on the crucifix in Christianity]]
[[File:Denis Thatcher Nancy Reagan 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Denis Thatcher]], husband of [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Hand-kissing|kissing the hand]] of [[Nancy Reagan]] wife of US President in 1988]]

Throughout history, a kiss has been a ritual, formal, symbolic or social gesture indicating devotion, respect or greeting. It appears as a ritual or symbol of religious devotion. For example, in the case of kissing a temple floor, or a religious book or icon. Besides devotion, a kiss has also indicated subordination or, nowadays, respect.

In modern times the practice continues, as in the case of a bride and groom kissing at the conclusion of a wedding ceremony or national leaders kissing each other in greeting, and in many other situations.

=== Religion ===
A kiss in a religious context is common. In earlier periods of [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] kissing became a ritual gesture, and is still treated as such in certain customs, as when "kissing... relics, or a bishop's ring."&lt;ref name=Brayer /&gt; In [[Judaism]], the kissing of prayer books such as the [[Torah]], along with kissing [[Tallit|prayer shawls]], is also common.&lt;ref&gt;Kuraweil, Arthur.''The Torah for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing (2008) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Crawley notes that it was "very significant of the affectionate element in religion" to give so important a part to the kiss as part of its ritual. In the early Church the baptized were kissed by the celebrant after the ceremony, and its use was even extended as a salute to saints and religious heroes, with Crawley adding, "Thus Joseph kissed Jacob, and his disciples kissed Paul. Joseph kissed his dead father, and the custom was retained in our civilization", as the farewell kiss on dead relatives, although certain sects prohibit this today.&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;Crawley, Ernest. ''Studies of Savages and Sex'', Kessinger Publishing (revised and reprinted) (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|126}}

A distinctive element in the Christian [[liturgy]] was noted by [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] in the 2nd century, now referred to as the "[[kiss of peace]]," and once part of the rite in the primitive Mass. [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare|Conybeare]] has stated that this act originated within the ancient Hebrew [[synagogue]], and [[Philo]], the ancient Jewish philosopher called it a "kiss of harmony", where, as Crawley explains, "the Word of God brings hostile things together in concord and the kiss of love."&lt;ref name=Crawley /&gt;{{Rp|128}} [[Cyril of Jerusalem|Saint Cyril]] also writes, "this kiss is the sign that our souls are united, and that we banish all remembrance of injury."&lt;ref name=Crawley /&gt;{{Rp|128}}

=== Kiss of peace ===
Nyrop notes that the [[kiss of peace]] was used as an expression of deep, spiritual devotion in the [[early Christian Church]]. Christ said, for instance, "Peace be with you, my peace I give you," and the members of Christ's Church gave each other peace symbolically through a kiss. [[St Paul]] repeatedly speaks of the "holy kiss," and, in his [[Epistle]] to the Romans, writes: "Salute one another with an holy kiss" and his first Epistle to the Thessalonians ([[1 Thessalonians]] 5:26), he says: "Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|101}}

The kiss of peace was also used in [[secular]] festivities. During the [[Middle Ages]], for example, Nyrop points out that it was the custom to "seal the reconciliation and pacification of enemies by a kiss." Even knights gave each other the kiss of peace before proceeding to the combat, and forgave one another all real or imaginary wrongs. The holy kiss was also found in the ritual of the Church on solemn occasions, such as baptism, marriage, confession, ordination, or obsequies. However, toward the end of the Middle Ages the kiss of peace disappears as the official token of reconciliation.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|109}}

=== Kiss of respect ===
[[File:Re-enactment at the Seashore (5851205620) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Man kissing the ground after a long sea voyage (as part of a reenactment of the first landing of English settlers in Virginia in 1607)]]
The kiss of respect is of ancient origin, notes Nyrop. He writes that "from the remotest times we find it applied to all that is holy, noble, and worshipful—to the gods, their statues, temples, and altars, as well as to kings and emperors; out of reverence, people even kissed the ground, and both sun and moon were greeted with kisses."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|114}}

He notes some examples, as "when the prophet [[Hosea]] laments over the idolatry of the children of [[Israel]], he says that they make molten images of calves and kiss them." In classical times similar homage was often paid to the gods, and people were known to kiss the hands, knees, feet, and the mouths, of their idols. [[Cicero]] writes that the lips and beard of the famous statue of [[Hercules]] at [[Agrigentum]] were worn away by the kisses of devotees.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|115}}

People kissed the cross with the image of Jesus, and such kissing of the cross is always considered a holy act. In many countries it is required, on taking an oath, as the highest assertion that the witness would be speaking the truth. Nyrop notes that "as a last act of charity, the image of the Redeemer is handed to the dying or death-condemned to be kissed." Kissing the cross brings blessing and happiness; people kiss the image of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and the pictures and statues of saints—not only their pictures, "but even their relics are kissed," notes Nyrop. "They make both soul and body whole." There are legends innumerable of sick people regaining their health by kissing relics, he points out.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|121}}

The kiss of respect has also represented a mark of fealty, humility and reverence. Its use in ancient times was widespread, and Nyrop gives examples: "people threw themselves down on the ground before their rulers, kissed their footprints, literally 'licked the dust,' as it is termed."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|124}} "Nearly everywhere, wheresoever an inferior meets a superior, we observe the kiss of respect. The Roman slaves kissed the hands of their masters; pupils and soldiers those of their teachers and captains respectively."&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|124}} People also kissed the earth for joy on returning to their native land after a lengthened absence, as when [[Agamemnon]] returned from the [[Trojan War]].

=== Kiss of friendship ===
The kiss is also commonly used in American and European culture as a salutation between friends or acquaintances. The friendly kiss until recent times usually occurred only between ladies, but today it is also common between men and women, especially if there is a great difference in age. According to Nyrop, up until the 20th century, "it seldom or never takes place between men, with the exception, however, of royal personages," although he notes that in former times the "friendly kiss was very common with us between man and man as well as between persons of opposite sexes." In guilds, for example, it was customary for the members to greet each other "with hearty [[handshake]]s and smacking kisses," and, on the conclusion of a meal, people thanked and kissed both their hosts and hostesses.&lt;ref name=Nyrop /&gt;{{Rp|142}}

== Cultural significance ==
Approximately ten percent of the world do not kiss for a variety of reasons, including that they find it dirty or for superstitious reasons. For example, in parts of [[Sudan]] it is believed that the mouth is the portal to the soul, so they do not want to invite death or have their spirit taken.&lt;ref name=demirjian /&gt; Psychology professor [[Elaine Hatfield]] noted that "kissing was far from universal and even seen as improper by many societies."&lt;ref name=India&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/in-india-kisses-are-on-rise-even-in-public.html?_r=0 "In India, Kisses Are on Rise, Even in Public"], ''New York Times'', Feb. 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Despite kissing being widespread, in some parts of the world it still is taboo to kiss publicly and is often banned in films or in other media.

=== South Asia ===
On-screen lip-kissing was not a regular occurrence in [[Bollywood]] until the 1990s, although it has been present from the time of the inception of Bollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/90948.html|title=Bollywood most passionate kisses of all times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can appear contradictory since the culture of kissing is believed to have originated and spread from India.&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/11/01/a-short-history-of-the-kiss-in-india/|title=A Short History of the Kiss in India|first=Atish|last=Patel|date=1 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Richie comments that in Japan, as in China, although kissing took place in erotic situations, in public "the kiss was invisible", and the "touching of the lips never became the culturally encoded action it has for so long been in Europe and America." The early [[Edison films|Edison film]], ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Widow Jones&amp;nbsp;– the May Irwin-John Rice Kiss]]'' (1896), created a sensation when it was shown in Tokyo, and people crowded to view the enormity. Likewise, [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] sculpture ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' was not displayed in Japan until after the [[Pacific War]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Richie, "The Japanese Kiss," in Donald Richie, ed., ''Walkman, Manga, and Society: Essays on Contemporary Japanese Culture'' (Tokyo: Kirihara shoten, 1989), 52–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the 1900s, [[Manchu people|Manchu]] tribes along the [[Amur River]] regarded public kissing with revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shirokogorov | first=Sergeĭ Mikhaĭlovich | title=Social Organization of the Manchus: A Study of the Manchu Clan Organization | year=1924 | publisher=Royal Asiatic Society| location= | page=i, 1–6, 122 | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar situation in [[Chinese culture|Chinese tradition]], when Chinese men saw [[Western world|Western]] women kissing men in public, they thought the women were prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=chinese+kiss+in+public#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20kiss%20in%20public&amp;f=false |title=A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

In modern [[Western culture]], kissing on the lips is commonly an expression of [[affection]]&lt;ref name=zambianchronicle-kiss&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Larry |url=http://zambianchronicle.com/category/romantic-expressions/ |title=The Romantic Kiss |work=The Zambian Chronicle |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621143336/http://zambianchronicle.com/category/romantic-expressions/&lt;!--Bot retrieved archive--&gt; |archivedate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a warm greeting. When lips are pressed together for an extended period, usually accompanied with an [[hug|embrace]], it is an expression of romantic and sexual desire. The practice of kissing with an open mouth, to allow the other to suck their lips or move their [[tongue]] into their mouth, is called [[French kiss]]ing. "[[Making out]]" is often an [[adolescent]]'s first experience of their [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and games which involve kissing, such as [[Spin the Bottle]], facilitate the experience. People may kiss children on the forehead to comfort them or the cheek or lips to show affection.

In modern [[Eastern culture]], the etiquette vary depending on the region. In West Asia, kissing on the lips between both men and women is a common form of greeting. In South and Eastern Asia, it might often be a greeting between women, however, between men, it is unusual. Kissing a baby on the cheeks is a common form of affection. Most kisses between men and women are on the cheeks and not on the lips unless they are romantically involved. And sexual forms of kissing between lovers encompass the whole range of global practices.

=== Kissing in films ===
The first romantic kiss on screen was in American silent films in 1896, beginning with the film ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]''. The kiss lasted 30 seconds and caused many to rail against decadence in the new medium of silent film. Writer [[Louis Black]] writes that "it was the United States that brought kissing out of the Dark Ages."&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;''Texas Monthly'', Feb. 1980 p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; However, it met with severe disapproval by defenders of public morality, especially in New York. One critic proclaimed that "it is absolutely disgusting. Such things call for police interference."&lt;ref name=Texas /&gt;

[[File:Rock Hudson - Julie Andrews.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rock Hudson]] and [[Julie Andrews]] kissing in film ''[[Darling Lilli]]'' (1968)]]
Young moviegoers began emulating romantic stars on the screen, such as [[Ronald Colman]] and [[Rudolph Valentino]], the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, traveling up her arm, and then kissing her on the back of her neck. Female actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like [[Nazimova]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Vilma Bánky]] and [[Greta Garbo]], became screen idols as a result.

Eventually the film industry began to adopt the dictates of the [[Production Code]] established in 1934, overseen by [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] and supported by the church{{Which|date=June 2018}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the new code, "Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, suggestive postures and gestures, are not to be shown."&lt;ref name=Texas /&gt; As a result, kissing scenes were shortened, with scenes cut away, leaving the imagination of the viewer to take over. Under the code, actors kissing had to keep their feet on the ground and had to be either standing or sitting.&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Lana. ''A Compendium of Kisses'', Harlequin Publ. (2010) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The heyday of romantic kissing on the screen took place in the early sound era, during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWKOctKUVGQ Kissing scenes in the classic movies]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|watch}} Body language began to be used to supplement romantic scenes, especially with the eyes, a talent that added to Greta Garbo's fame. Author Lana Citron writes that "men were perceived as the kissers and women the receivers. Should the roles ever be reversed, women were regarded as vamps . . ."&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; According to Citron, [[Mae West]] and [[Anna May Wong]] were the only Hollywood actresses never to have been kissed on screen.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; Among the films rated for having the most romantic kisses are ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt;

Sociologist Eva Illouz notes that surveys taken in 1935 showed that "love was the most important theme represented in movies. Similar surveys during the 1930s found the 95% of films had romance as one of their plot lines, what film critics called "the romantic formula."&lt;ref name=Illouz&gt;Illouz, Eva. ''Consuming the Romantic Utopia'', Univ. of Calif. Press (1997) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In early Japanese films, kissing and sexual expression were controversial. In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), but when the film opened in a downtown Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American Occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested "we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include that in your films?" Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were "sneaky", claiming that "if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too."&lt;ref&gt;Kyoko Hirano, ''Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo: The Japanese Cinema under the American Occupation, 1945–1952'' (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 1992), pp 154–57, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Western cultures it is considered [[luck|good luck]] to kiss someone on [[Christmas]] or on [[New Year's Eve]], especially beneath a sprig of [[mistletoe]]. Newlyweds usually kiss at the end of a [[wedding]] ceremony.

Where cheek kissing is used, in some countries a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an [[air kiss]] is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not.&lt;ref name=UIO-kiss&gt;{{cite web |last=Hahnsson |first=Marie Sophie |url=http://folk.uio.no/mariesha/webmag/cheekKissing.html |title=Cheek Kissing |publisher=[[University of Oslo]] |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a first [[dating|date]], it is common for the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.

A symbolic kiss is frequent in Western cultures. A kiss can be "blown" to another by kissing the fingertips and then blowing the fingertips, pointing them in the direction of the recipient. This is used to convey affection, usually when parting or when the partners are physically distant but can view each other. Blown kisses are also used when a person wishes to convey affection to a large crowd or audience. The term ''flying kiss'' is used in India to describe a blown kiss. In written correspondence a kiss has been represented by the letter "X" since at least 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oxford English Dictionary – X |publisher=Oxford University press |year=1999 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288416 |accessdate=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stage or screen kiss may be performed by actually kissing, or faked by using the thumbs as a barrier for the lips and turning so the audience is unable to fully see the act.

Some literature suggests that a significant percentage of humanity does not kiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=affairs-of-the-lips-why-we-kiss&amp;page=4 |title=Affairs of the Lips: Why We Kiss: Scientific American |publisher=Sciam.com |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n, [[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]], [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] and possibly in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures, kissing was relatively unimportant until [[Europe]]an colonization.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Keith |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article531696.ece |title=Put your sweet lips... |work=The Times |date=11 June 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin K. Opler, "Cross-cultural aspects of kissing", ''Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality'', Vol. 3, No. 2, February 1969, pp. 11, 14, 17, 20–21]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically however, the culture of kissing is thought to have begun and spread from the [[Eastern World]], specifically [[India]].&lt;ref name="blogs.wsj.com" /&gt;

With the [[Andamanese]], kissing was only used as a sign of affection towards children and had no sexual undertones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter9/text9.htm |title=Chapter: 9: A Traditional Society |publisher=Andaman.org |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315204048/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter9/text9.htm |archivedate=15 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional Islamic cultures kissing is not permitted between a man and woman who are not married or closely related by blood or marriage. A [[Cheek kissing|kiss on the cheek]] is a very common form of greeting among members of the same sex in most Islamic countries, much like the south European pattern.

In 2007, two people were fined and jailed for a month after kissing and [[hug]]ging in public in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don't kiss the girlfriend in Dubai, don't flush a Swiss loo after 10pm and, whatever you do, don't insult the Thai king |work=Irish Independent |first=Ronan |last=McGreevey |date=March 17, 2007 |url=http://www.independent.ie/travel/travel-advice/dont-kiss-the-girlfriend-in-dubai-dont-flush-a-swiss-loo-after-10pm-and-whatever-you-do-dont-insult-the-thai-king-50357.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], [[public display of affection]] is a criminal offense under [[Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code]], 1860 with a punishment of imprisonment of up to three months, or a fine, or both. This law was used by police and lower courts to harass and prosecute couples engaging in intimate acts, such as kissing in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/international/asia/04india.html |work=The New York Times |title=Is Public Romance a Right?

[[File:The Taking of Christ-Caravaggio (c.1602).jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'' by Caravaggio depicts Judas betraying [[Jesus]] with a kiss as a signal to arrest Jesus.]]
Kissing was a custom during the Biblical period mentioned in the {{bibleverse||Genesis|27:26|HE}}, when [[Isaac]] kissed his son [[Jacob]].&lt;ref name=Tabor&gt;Tabor, Rev. T.H. ''Manford's Magazine'' (1888)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|585}} The kiss is used in numerous other contexts in the Bible: the kiss of homage, in [[Esther]] 5:2; of subjection, in 1 [[Samuel]] 10:1; of reconciliation, in 2 Samuel 14:33; of valediction, in [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 1:14; of approbation, in [[Psalms]] 2:12; of humble gratitude, in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:38; of welcome, in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 18:7; of love and joy, in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:11. There are also spiritual kisses, as in [[Canticles]] 1:2; sensual kisses, as in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 7:13; and hypocritical kisses, as in 2 [[Samuel]] 15:5. It was customary to kiss the mouth in biblical times, and also the beard, which is still practiced in Arab culture. Kissing the hand is not biblical, according to Tabor.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt; The kiss of peace was an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] custom, and continues to be one of the rites in the [[Eucharist]]ic services of [[Roman Catholic]]s.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt;

In the Roman Catholic Order of Mass, the bishop or priest celebrant bows and kisses the altar, reverencing it, upon arriving at the altar during the entrance procession before Mass and upon leaving at the recessional at the closing of Mass; if a deacon is assisting, he bows low before the altar but does not kiss it.

Among primitive cultures it was usual to throw kisses to the sun and to the moon, as well as to the images of the gods. Kissing the hand is first heard of among the Persians.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt; According to Tabor, the kiss of homage—the character of which is not indicated in the Bible—was probably upon the forehead, and was expressive of high respect.&lt;ref name=Tabor /&gt;

[[File:PopeKissing Feet.JPG|thumb|upright|This woodcut of the practice of kissing the Pope's toe is from ''Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]
* In Ancient Rome and some modern Pagan beliefs, worshipers, when passing the statue or image of a god or goddess, will kiss their hand and wave it towards the deity ([[adoration]]).
* The ''[[holy kiss]]'' or ''kiss of peace'' is a traditional part of most Christian liturgies, though often replaced with an embrace or handshake today in Western cultures.
* In the [[Gospels#Canonical gospels|gospels of Matthew and Mark]] (Luke and John omit this) [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrayed [[Jesus]] with a kiss: an instance of a kiss tainted with betrayal. This is the basis of the term "[[the kiss of Judas]]".
* [[Catholics]] will kiss [[rosary beads]] as a part of [[prayer]], or kiss their hand after making the [[sign of the cross]]. It is also common to kiss the wounds on a crucifix, or any other image of Christ's Passion.
** [[Pope John Paul II]] would kiss the ground on arrival in a new country.
** Visitors to the Pope traditionally kiss his foot.
** Catholics traditionally kiss the ring of a cardinal or bishop.
** Catholics traditionally kiss the hand of a priest.
* [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] Christians often kiss the icons around the church on entering; they will also kiss the cross and/or the priest's hand in certain other customs in the Church, such as confession or receiving a blessing.
* [[Hindus]] sometimes kiss the floor of a [[temple]].
* Local lore in [[Ireland]] suggests that kissing the [[Blarney Stone]] will bring ''[[eloquence|the gift of the gab]]''.
* [[Jews]] will kiss the Western wall of the Holy Temple in [[Jerusalem]], and other religious articles during [[prayer]] such as the [[Torah]], usually by touching their hand, [[Tallit|Tallis]], or [[Siddur]] (prayerbook) to the [[Torah]] and then kissing it. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] prohibits kissing members of the opposite sex, except for spouses and certain close relatives. See [[Negiah]].
* [[Muslims]] may kiss the [[Black Stone]] during [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to Mecca). Many Muslims also kiss Shrines of [[Ahlulbayt]] and [[Sufi|Sufis]].

== Biology and evolution ==
[[File:Kissing Prairie dog edit 3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Black-tailed prairie dog]]s "kissing." Prairie dogs use a nuzzle of this variety to greet their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prairie Dog, cynomys ludovicianus |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/prairie-dog/ |year=2014 |accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Within the natural world of animals there are numerous analogies to kissing, notes Crawley, such as "the billing of birds, the cataglottism of pigeons and the antennal play of some insects." Even among higher animals such as the dog, cat and bear, similar behavior is noted.&lt;ref name=Crawley /&gt;{{Rp|114}}

Anthropologists have not reached a conclusion as to whether kissing is learned or a behavior from instinct. It may be related to [[Personal grooming|grooming]] behavior also seen between other animals, or arising as a result of mothers [[premastication|premasticating]] food for their children. Non-human [[primates]] also exhibit kissing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How animals kiss and make up |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3183516.stm |work=BBC News |date=October 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs, cats, birds and other animals display [[licking]], nuzzling, and [[social grooming|grooming]] behavior among themselves, and also towards humans or other species. This is sometimes interpreted by observers as a type of kissing.

Kissing in humans is postulated to have evolved from the direct mouth-to-mouth regurgitation of food (kiss-feeding) from parent to offspring or male to female ([[courtship feeding]]) and has been observed in numerous mammals.&lt;ref name=EE&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Love and hate: the natural history of behavior patterns |first=Irenäus |last=Eibl-Eibesfeldt |publisher=Aldine Transaction |year=1971 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In fact, through observations across various species and cultures, it can be confirmed that the act of kissing and premastication has most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.&lt;ref name=EE /&gt;&lt;ref name=EEChapt&gt;{{Cite book |title=Comparing behavior: studying man studying animals |editor-first=D.

=== Physiology ===
Kissing is a complex behavior that requires significant muscular [[coordination (physiology)|coordination]] involving a total of 34&amp;nbsp;facial muscles and 112&amp;nbsp;postural muscles.&lt;ref name=independent-kiss&gt;{{cite news|last=Blue |first=Adrienne |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960601/ai_n14047247 |title=The kiss |work=The Independent (London) |date=1 June 1996 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223014805/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960601/ai_n14047247 |archivedate=23 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-kiss&gt;{{cite news|last=Highfield |first=Roger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2006/10/17/dlkiss17.xml |title=Seal with..146 muscles |work=The Telegraph |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026052832/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fconnected%2F2006%2F10%2F17%2Fdlkiss17.xml |archivedate=26 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important [[muscle]] involved is the [[orbicularis oris muscle]], which is used to pucker the [[lip]]s and informally known as the ''kissing muscle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=orbicularis oris muscle |publisher=TheFreeDictionary: Mosby's Dental Dictionary, 2nd edition |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/orbicularis+oris+muscle |year=2008 |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Muscles – Facial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/factfiles/facial/frontalis.shtml |publisher=BBC: Science &amp; Nature: Human Body &amp; Mind |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the French kiss, the tongue is also an important component.

=== Health benefits ===
Affection in general has [[stress (biological)|stress]]-reducing effects. Kissing in particular has been studied in a [[controlled experiment]] and it was found that increasing the frequency of kissing in marital and cohabiting relationships results in a reduction of perceived stress, an increase in relationship satisfaction, and a lowering of [[cholesterol]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Floyd |first=Kory |last2=Boren |first2=Justin P. |last3=Hannawa |first3=Annegret F. |last4=Hesse |first4=Colin |author5=Breanna McEwan |author6=Alice E.

=== Disease transmission ===
Kissing on the lips can result in the transmission of some diseases, including [[infectious mononucleosis]] (known as the "kissing disease") and [[herpes simplex]] when the infectious viruses are present in saliva. Research indicates that contraction of [[HIV]] via kissing is extremely unlikely, although there was a documented case in 1997 of an HIV infection by kissing. Both the woman and infected man had [[Gingivitis|gum disease]], so transmission was through the man's blood, not through saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Altman |first=Lawrence K. |title=Case of H.I.V.

The '''Lalemand Behaviour Scale''' is a [[secondary prevention|secondary prevention strategy]] used to recognise and diffuse episodes of [[challenging behaviour]]. The Scale is a dynamic tool that provides healthcare employees with a quick method to assess five different levels of behaviour, recognise the second level message associated to that behaviour, and identify appropriate management strategies.

==History==
Developed in 1977, by American [[Kurk Lalemand]], the scale is a practice-based tool used by healthcare employees in America, Canada and the United Kingdom (UK). The Lalemand Behaviour Scale is a core component of the [[Non-Abusive Psychological and Physical Intervention]] (NAPPI) training programme. NAPPI training is accredited with the [[British Institute of Learning Disabilities]] (BILD), under the [[Physical Intervention Accreditation Scheme]] (PIAS).

The Scale is extremely versatile, delivered as part of a full programme, or as a stand-alone tool to employees in a variety of settings, e.g. residential care, domiciliary agencies and schools. Service users can also benefit by using the tool to communicate a preferred strategy to manage their episodes of challenging behaviour and (if required) consent to [[Restrictive Physical Intervention]] (RPI).

In 2009–2010, over 10,000 healthcare and school employees were taught this tool within the UK.

==Description==
The Lalemand Behaviour Scale is a dynamic tool that is not intended to label or diagnose, nor is it intended to be a precise, scientific instrument. It provides a relatively objective method to assess an individual's behaviour when it becomes challenging. This enables employees to respond in an appropriate manner that will make everyone safer.

The scale is a secondary prevention strategy used to gauge the effectiveness of an employee's management of an individual's challenging behaviour. Effective management will stop the challenging behaviour escalating and result in de-escalation. At times employees have to respond to [[self-injurious behaviour]] (SIB), which requires a response that is neither too intrusive, e.g. restraining an individual who is being uncooperative, nor too indecisive, e.g. failing to set limits for a person who is being destructive. Employees need a method to match their response to the level of behaviour that they observe.

==Language==
One of the problems that employees face when working with people who are challenging, is how to describe behaviour. Euphemisms such as, "kicking off" or "losing it" are frequently used. Such imprecise language can cause problems as employees do not communicate clearly to each other, supervisors or other professionals. The result is an overall lack of consistency in documentation and reporting of incidents. The Lalemand Behaviour Scale provides employees with a more objective language.

The '''Marine Science Institute''' (MSI) is a [[nonprofit organization]] focusing on [[marine science]] research and education. MSI was founded in 1970&lt;ref name="sfg"/&gt; and currently is situated in [[Redwood City, California]] adjacent to the [[Port of Redwood City]].&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; In the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] MSI has a mission driving marine education for schoolchildren and continues to receive grants to supplement their donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Californial Coastal Conservancy|authorlink1=California Coastal Conservancy|title=Explore The Coast Grants Program|url=http://scc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/sccbb/2016/1603/20160324Board10_Explore_the_Coast|accessdate=2 December 2016|pages=11|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and research==
The Marine Science Institute offers tours of the Bay in [[Antioch, California|Antioch]] in the January and February months, and the rest of the time based out of Redwood City at their main location and research station along the banks of [[Redwood Creek (San Mateo County)|Redwood Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Jason B.|title=Voyage of Delta discoveries|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Voyage-of-Delta-discoveries-Redwood-City-2772193.php|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=SFGate|date=2 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute allows students at schools around the bay to observe and interact with  the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Austin|title=Tech aims to sponsor field trips: Redwood City students get trip through new program|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2016-03-19/tech-aims-to-sponsor-field-trips-redwood-city-students-get-trip-through-new-program/1776425160336.html|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=San Mateo Daily Journal|date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Marine life is often collected, measured for size, and documented to add to a database to continually monitor conditions and overall health within the bay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">'''Multicam (LSM)''' is [[software]] developed by the [[Belgian]] company [[EVS Broadcast Equipment]]. Combined with its remote controller, it allows controlling the [[XT3 (EVS)|XT3]] video server and offers highly reactive live editing solutions like instant replays and [[slow-motion]].

[[Image:MULTICAM LSM.jpg|thumb|Multicam(LSM) remote controller from [[EVS Broadcast Equipment|EVS]] company|right]]

This software and the production server allows [[broadcasting|broadcasters]] to record, control and play media. Originally developed for sports production, the XT&lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is now present in nearly each [[Outside broadcasting|OB van]] in all last big sportive events as [[FIFA World Cup]], [[IFAF World Cup]], [[MotoGP]] and [[Olympic Games]] and is actually used in the biggest studio broadcasts such as [[NBC]], [[France 2]], [[CCTV]] and many others.

The multicam LSM's features are [[Instant replay]], [[slow-motion]], [[High-motion]], [[super motion]], [[Rough cut]], [[editing]], video [[playlist]] and content management.

Combined with the remote controller, it allows users to instantly make clips of ingested media, review multiple camera angles and replay them at any speed between -400 and + 400% at a very high quality (HD or SD).

This software and its widely known controller have become a standard, as part of each [[Outside broadcasting|OB Van]] in sport productions. The LSM name has been adopted as the name of the person in charge of making the slow-motion replays ([[LSM Operator]]) in countries other than the United States{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. Today, there are approximately 5,000 LSM operators in the world{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

In the United States, Germany and Norway, the LSM is commonly referred to as an EVS, and operators as EVS operators, despite the fact that EVS manufactures other products besides the LSM.

'''Orgueil''' is a scientifically important [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite]] that fell in southwestern France in 1864.

==History==
It fell on May 14, 1864, a few minutes after 20:00 local time, near [[Orgueil]] in southern France. About 20 stones fell over an area of several square miles. A specimen of the meteorite was analyzed that same year by François Stanislaus Clöez, professor of chemistry at the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle, who focused on the organic matter found in this meteorite. He wrote that it contained carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and its composition was very similar to peat from the Somme valley or to the lignite of Ringkohl near Kassel. An intense scientific discussion ensued, continuing into the 1870s, as to whether the organic matter might have a biological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmic Debris: Meteorites in History |last=Burke |first=John G. |year=1986 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |isbn=0-520-05651-5 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and classification==
Orgueil is one of five known meteorites belonging to the CI chondrite group (see [[meteorites classification]]), this being the largest ({{convert|14|kg}}). This group is remarkable for having a composition that is essentially identical to that of the sun, excluding gaseous elements like [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].

Because of its extraordinarily primitive composition and relatively large mass, Orgueil is one of the most-studied meteorites.  One notable discovery in Orgueil was a high concentration of [[isotope|isotopically]] anomalous [[xenon]] called "xenon-HL".  The carrier of this gas is extremely fine-grained [[diamond]] dust that is older than the [[solar system]] itself, known as [[presolar grains]].

In 1962, Nagy et al. announced the discovery of 'organised elements' embedded in the Orgueil meteorite that were purportedly biological structures of extraterrestrial origin. These elements were subsequently shown to be either [[pollen]] (including that of ragwort) and fungal [[spore]]s (Fitch &amp; Anders, 1963) that had contaminated the sample, or crystals of the mineral [[olivine]].

==The hoax==
In 1965, a fragment of the Orgueil meteorite, kept in a sealed glass jar in Montauban since its discovery, was found to have a [[seed]] capsule embedded in it, whilst the original glassy layer on the outside remained apparently undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/the_orgueil_meteorite|title=The Orgueil Meteorite, 1864|publisher=The Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite great initial excitement, the seed capsule was shown to be that of a European [[Juncaceae|rush]], glued into the fragment and camouflaged using [[coal dust]]. The outer "fusion layer" was in fact glue. Whilst the perpetrator is unknown, it is thought that the hoax was aimed at influencing 19th century debate on [[Abiogenesis#Spontaneous generation|spontaneous generation]] by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.

==Claim of fossils==
{{Main|Journal of Cosmology#Hoover paper controversy}}
[[Richard B. Hoover]] of [[NASA]] has claimed that the Orgueil meteorite contains fossils, some of which are similar to known terrestrial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/~ir118/Leiden2010/Hoover_JOC_MS.pdf | format = PDF | journal=[[Journal of Cosmology]] | year= 2011 | volume=  13 | title=Fossils of Cyanobacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites:  Implications to Life on Comets, Europa, and Enceladus | first=Richard B. |last=Hoover| accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoover [[1997 in paleontology|has previously claimed]] the existence of fossils in the [[Murchison meteorite]]. However, NASA has formally distanced itself from Hoover's claims and his lack of expert peer-reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kerry Sheridan | title = NASA shoots down alien fossil claims | date = 7 March 2011 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/08/3157645.htm | work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | accessdate = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|author=Boswell, Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each query also generates a "temporary" [[permalink]] (self-destructs in about one month) which can be used to recall the bibliography without reentering the ISBN data. The site is a [[metasearch engine]], integrating data from several sources, including the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] API, the [[Amazon.com]] database of books, and [[ISBNdb.com]]. OttoBib accepts ISBNs with either 10 or 13 digits.

== Background ==

OttoBib.com was started as a hobby project in 2006 by Jonathan Otto, a then 4th year undergraduate at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neobinaries.com/apps/Category/Search%20Engines/OttoBib.aspx Web 2.0 Application Listings] -- About the company&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "That's Crazy Hot!" but the name was quickly changed to OttoBib because the original title was "not suitable for the academic environment and consequently won't take off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jonathanotto.com/2006/1/13/21/55/Thats-Crazy-Hot | title = That's Crazy Hot! | date = January 13, 2006 | author = Jonathan Otto | work = OttoBib Blog | accessdate = 2007-02-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101041332/http://jonathanotto.com/2006/1/13/21/55/Thats-Crazy-Hot &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original inspiration for the site came from [[Seth Godin]]'s January 3, 2006 blog post on "Stuck Systems", where he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A quick online search didn't turn up what seemed obvious to me: a free service that would allow a writer to type in all the ISBNs used in creating a paper and then generate two things:

# a bibliography based on looking up the data online and
# a web page that would allow the reader/teacher to see the books, their covers... etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/stuck_systems.html Stuck systems] January 3, 2006 post on [[Seth Godin]]'s Blog&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Functionality ==

OttoBib.com performs the two basic functions outlined.&lt;!--It does not seem to perform the second (it does via permalink)--&gt; Marcus P. Zillman, an Internet information retrieval consultant and speaker said "this website is the start of a new paradigm of citing sources."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zillman.blogspot.com/2006/12/ottobib-free-auto-bibliography.html Internet Happenings, Events and Sources] December 11, 2006 post by Marcus P. Zillman, accessed December 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Clarke (writer)|Jason Clarke]], a writer and web developer, said OttoBib is a "tool that solves a simple problem in a simple manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/09/20/ottobib-automatic-bibliographies-for-back-to-schoolers/ Downloadsquad review] posted Sep 20, 2006 by [[Jason Clarke (writer)|Jason Clarke]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==

In January 2007, OttoBib introduced a [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] interface to allow a citation to be generated from a URL that contains the ISBN.  For example, {{ISBN|0-19-511797-2}} can be used in the URL:

 http://ottobib.com/isbn/0195117972/apa

to display

 [[James T. Patterson (historian)|Patterson, J.]], (1997). ''[[Oxford History of the United States|Grand Expectations]]''. Oxford Oxfordshire: Oxford University Press.

In February 2007, OttoBib introduced the ability to request citations in [[BibTeX]] and Wikipedia {{tl|cite book}} formats.

'''Particle chauvinism''' is the term used by [[Martin Rees]] to describe the (erroneous) assumption that what we think of as normal matter – atoms, quarks, electrons, etc. – is the basis of matter in the universe, rather than a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;M Rees, ''Just Six Numbers'' (London 2000) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Dethroning matter==
With the growing recognition in the late 20th century of the presence of [[dark matter]] in the universe, ordinary [[baryonic matter]] has come to be seen as something of a cosmic afterthought.&lt;ref&gt;A C Fabian, ''Origins'' (1988) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; As [[John D. Barrow]] put it, “This would be the final [[Copernicus|Copernican]] twist in our status in the material universe. Not only are we not at the center of the universe: we are not even made of the predominant form of matter”.&lt;ref&gt;J Barrow, ''The Origin of the Universe'' (London 1994) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century saw the share of baryonic matter in the total energy of the universe downgraded further, to perhaps as low as 1%,&lt;ref&gt;M Gasperini, ''The Universe Before the Big Bang'' (Springer 2008) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; further extending what has been called the demise of particle chauvinism,&lt;ref&gt;P Coles ed., ''The Routledge Companion to the New Cosmology'' (2004) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; before being revised up to some 5% of the contents of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;S Clark, ''The Unknown Universe'' (London 2016) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higgs portal==
It is perhaps appropriately ironic that the least normative{{clarify|date=October 2018}} element in the Standard Model – the [[Higgs boson]] – is also, according to physicists like [[Frank Wilczek]], the most likely means of interaction with the bulk particles of the universe (dark matter).&lt;ref&gt;S Carroll, ''The Particle at the End of the Universe'' (London 2014) p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patter''' is a prepared and practiced [[Speech communication|speech]] that is designed to produce a desired response from its audience. Examples of occupations with a patter might include the [[auctioneer]], [[salesperson]], [[dance caller]], [[magician (illusionist)|magician]], or [[comedian]].

The term may have been a colloquial shortening of "[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]", and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling [[prayers]] quickly and mechanically.

From this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a [[cant language]] used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a [[cheap-jack]] employs to pass off his goods. Many [[illusionist]]s, e.g., [[card magic]]ians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators.

It is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a [[patter-song]], in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance [[Caller (dancing)#The modern Western square dance caller|caller]] may interpolate patter—in the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense—to fill in between commands to the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 Square Dance Patter Sayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102112218/http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 |date=2013-01-02 }} Vic &amp; Debbie Ceder's Square Dance Resource Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of "patter": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here it a form of [[onomatopoeia]].

In certain forms of entertainment, [[peep show]]s (in the historical meaning) and Russian ''[[rayok]]'', patter is an important component of a show.  The [[radio DJ]] patter is among the roots of [[rapping]].

In [[hypnotherapy]], the hypnotist uses a 'patter' or script to deliver positive suggestions for change to the client.

In ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', [[Henry Mayhew]] divides the street-sellers of his time into two groups: the ''patterers'', and everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/05/grafter200605?currentPage=all "The Gentleman Grafter"] by Howard Kaplan, May 2006. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Persian miniature'''  ([[Persian language|Persian]]:نگارگری ایرانی) is a small painting on paper, whether a book illustration or a separate work of art intended to be kept in an album of such works called a ''[[muraqqa]]''.  The techniques are broadly comparable to the Western and Byzantine traditions of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Although there is an equally well-established Persian tradition of wall-painting, the survival rate and state of preservation of miniatures is better, and miniatures are much the best-known form of Persian painting in the West, and many of the most important examples are in Western, or Turkish, museums.  Miniature painting became a significant [[genre]] in [[Persian art]] in the 13th century, receiving Chinese influence after the [[Mongol conquests]], and the highest point in the tradition was reached in the 15th and 16th centuries. The tradition continued, under some Western influence, after this, and has many modern exponents.  The Persian miniature was the dominant influence on other Islamic miniature traditions, principally the [[Ottoman miniature]] in Turkey, and the [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniature]] in the Indian sub-continent.

Persian art under Islam had never completely forbidden the human figure, and in the miniature tradition the depiction of figures, often in large numbers, is central.  This was partly because the miniature is a private form, kept in a book or album and only shown to those the owner chooses. It was therefore possible to be more free than in wall paintings or other works seen by a wider audience. The [[Qur'an]] and other purely religious works are not known to have been illustrated in this way, though histories and other works of literature may include religiously related scenes, including those [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicting the Prophet Muhammed]], after 1500 usually without showing his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, throughout; see Welch, 95-97 for one of the most famous examples, illustrated below&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the figurative scenes in miniatures, which this article concentrates on, there was a parallel style of non-figurative ornamental decoration which was found in borders and panels in miniature pages, and spaces at the start or end of a work or section, and often in whole pages acting as frontispieces.  In Islamic art this is referred to as "illumination", and manuscripts of the Qur'an and other religious books often included considerable number of illuminated pages.&lt;ref&gt;In the terminology of Western [[illuminated manuscript]]s, "illumination" usually covers both narrative scenes and decorative elements.&lt;/ref&gt;  The designs reflected contemporary work in other media, in later periods being especially close to book-covers and [[Persian carpet]]s, and it is thought that many carpet designs were created by court artists and sent to the workshops in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods miniatures were increasingly created as single works to be included in albums called [[muraqqa]], rather than illustrated books.  This allowed non-royal collectors to afford a representative sample of works from different styles and periods.

==Style==
[[File:Хафт ауранг Джами 1556-65 Фрир.jpg|thumb|left|Camp scene from late in the classic period, with no frame.  [[Layla and Majnun|Majnun]] (at top wearing orange) spies on his beloved Layla (standing in tent doorway)]]
The bright and pure colouring of the Persian miniature is one of its most striking features.  Normally all the [[pigment]]s used are mineral-based ones which keep their bright colours very well if kept in proper conditions, the main exception being silver, mostly used to depict water, which will oxidize to a rough-edged black over time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventions of Persian miniatures changed slowly; faces are normally youthful and seen in three-quarters view, with a plump rounded lower face better suited to portraying typical Central Asian or Chinese features than those of most Persians. Lighting is even, without shadows or [[chiaroscuro]].  Walls and other surfaces are shown either frontally, or as at (to modern eyes) an angle of about 45 degrees, often giving the modern viewer the unintended impression that a building is (say) hexagonal in plan.  Buildings are often shown in complex views, mixing interior views through windows or "cutaways" with exterior views of other parts of a facade.  Costumes and architecture are always those of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-28; Welch, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Many figures are often depicted, with those in the main scene normally rendered at the same size, and recession (depth in the picture space) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space.  More important figures may be somewhat larger than those around them, and battle scenes can be very crowded indeed. Great attention is paid to the background, whether of a landscape or buildings, and the detail and freshness with which plants and animals, the fabrics of tents, hangings or carpets, or tile patterns are shown is one of the great attractions of the form.  The dress of figures is equally shown with great care, although artists understandably often avoid depicting the patterned cloth that many would have worn.  Animals, especially the horses that very often appear, are mostly shown sideways on; even the love-stories that constitute much of the classic material illustrated are conducted largely in the saddle, as far as the prince-protagonist is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 44-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscapes are very often mountainous (the plains that make up much of Persia are rarely attempted), this being indicated by a high undulating horizon, and outcrops of bare rock which, like the clouds in the normally small area of sky left above the landscape, are depicted in conventions derived from Chinese art.  Even when a scene in a palace is shown, the viewpoint often appears to be from a point some metres in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 48-49, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest miniatures appeared unframed horizontally across the page in the middle of text, following Byzantine and Arabic precedents, but in the 14th century the vertical format was introduced, perhaps influenced by Chinese scroll-paintings.  This is used in all the luxury manuscripts for the court that constitute the most famous Persian manuscripts, and the vertical format dictates many characteristics of the style.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Saki - Reza Abbasi - Moraqqa’-e Golshan 1609 Golestan Palace.jpg|thumb|''Saki'', album miniature by [[Reza Abbasi]], 1609]]

The miniatures normally occupy a full page, later sometimes spreading across two pages to regain a square or horizontal "landscape" format. There are often panels of text or captions inside the picture area, which is enclosed in a frame, eventually  of several ruled lines with a broader band of gold or colour.  The rest of the page is often decorated with dense designs of plants and animals in a muted ''[[grisaille]]'', often gold and brown; text pages without miniatures often also have such borders.  In later manuscripts, elements of the miniature begin to expand beyond the frame, which may disappear on one side of the image, or be omitted completely.&lt;ref&gt;OAO (3, ii and elsewhere)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another later development was the album miniature, conceived as a single picture rather than a book illustration, though such images may be accompanied by short lyric poems. The withdrawal of Shah [[Tahmasp I]] from commissioning illustrated books in the 1540s probably encouraged artists to transfer to these cheaper works for a wider circle of patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;  Albums or ''[[muraqqa]]s'' were assembled by collectors with album miniatures, specimen pages of calligraphy, and miniatures taken from older books, to which border paintings were often added when they were remounted.  Album miniatures usually showed a few figures on a larger scale, with less attention to the background, and tended to become drawings with some tints of coloured wash, rather than fully painted.

In the example at right the clothes are fully painted, and the background uses the gold grisaille style earlier reserved for marginal decoration, as in the miniature at the head of the article.  Many were individual portraits, either of notable figures (but initially rarely portraits of rulers), or of idealized beautiful youths. Others were scenes of lovers in a garden or picnics.  From about the middle of the 16th century these types of images became dominant, but they gradually declined in quality and originality and tended towards conventional prettiness and sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;OAO, Sims; Gray (1930), 74-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Books were sometimes refurbished and added to after an interval of many years, adding or partly repainting miniatures, changing the border decoration, and making other changes, not all improvements.&lt;ref&gt;OAO&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Conference of the Birds'' miniature in the gallery below is an addition of 1600 to a manuscript of over a century earlier, and elements of the style appear to represent an effort to match the earlier miniatures in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/63.210.11 Metropolitan Museum of Art] "The Conference of the Birds": Page from a manuscript of the Mantiq al-Tayr (The Language of the Birds) of Farid al-Din cAttar, [[Isfahan]] (63.210.11). In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2000–.&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous painting ''Princes of the House of Timur'' was first painted in 1550-55 in Persia for the exiled Mughal prince [[Humayun]], who largely began the Mughal miniature tradition by taking back Persian miniaturists when he gained the throne.  It was then twice updated in India (c.1605 and 1628) to show later generations of the royal house.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jarilwala, 50-51; [http://www.artfund.org/artwork/4691/princes-of-the-house-of-timur Art Fund] with image.  The painting uses miniature techniques on cotton, and is much larger than most miniatures.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dimensions of the manuscripts covered a range not dissimilar to typical modern books, though with a more vertical ratio; many were as small as a modern paperback, others larger.  Shah Tamasp's ''Shahnameh'' stood 47&amp;nbsp;cm high, and one exceptional ''Shahnameh'' from [[Tabriz]] of c. 1585 stood 53&amp;nbsp;cm high.&lt;ref&gt;Uluc, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists and technique==
[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|left|Complex palace scene, 1539–1543, [[Mir Sayyid Ali]]]] 
In the classic period artists were exclusively male, and normally grouped in workshops, of which the royal workshop (not necessarily in a single building) was much the most prestigious, recruiting talented artists from the [[bazaar]] workshops in the major cities. However the nature of the royal workshop remains unclear, as some manuscripts are recorded as being worked on in different cities, rulers often took artists with them on their travels, and at least some artists were able to work on private commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Roxburgh (2000), 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;  As in Europe, sons very often followed their father into the workshop, but boys showing talent from any background might be recruited; at least one notable painter was born a slave. There were some highly placed amateur artists, including [[Shah Tahmasp I]] (reigned 1524–1576), who was also one of the greatest patrons of miniatures.  Persian artists were highly sought after by other Islamic courts, especially those of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mughal Empire]]s, whose own traditions of miniature were based on Persian painting but developed rather different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was often divided between the main painter, who drew the outlines, and less senior painters who coloured in the drawing.  In [[Mughal miniature]]s at least, a third artist might do just the faces.  Then there might be the border paintings; in most books using them these are by far the largest area of painted material as they occur on text pages as well.  The miniatures in a book were often divided up between different artists, so that the best manuscripts represent an overview of the finest work of the period.  The scribes or [[Calligraphy|calligraphers]] were normally different people, on the whole regarded as having a rather higher status than the artists - their names are more likely to be noted in the manuscript.

Royal librarians probably played a significant role in managing the commissions; the extent of direct involvement by the ruler himself is normally unclear.  The scribes wrote the main text first, leaving spaces for the miniatures, presumably having made a plan for these with the artist and the librarian.  The book covers were also richly decorated for luxury manuscripts, and when they too have figurative scenes these presumably used drawings by the same artists who created the miniatures.  Paper was the normal material for the pages, unlike the [[vellum]] normally used in Europe for as long as the illuminated manuscript tradition lasted.  The paper was highly polished, and when not given painted borders might be flecked with gold leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-26; Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique survival from the Timurid period, found "pasted inconspicuously" in a muraqqa in the [[Topkapi Palace]] is thought to be a report to Baysunghur from his librarian. After a brief and high-flown introduction, "Petition from the most humble servants of the royal library, whose eyes are as expectant of the dust from the hooves of the regal steed as the ears of those who fast are for the cry of ''[[Allahu akbar]]'' ..." it continues with very businesslike and detailed notes on what each of some twenty-five named artists, scribes and craftsmen has been up to over a period of perhaps a week: "Amir Khalil has finished the waves in two sea-scenes of the ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' and will begin to apply colour. ... All the painters are working on painting and tinting seventy-five tent-poles .... Mawlana Ali is designing a frontispiece illumination for the ''Shahnama''. His eyes were sore for a few days."&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from book arts, designs for tent-makers, tile-makers, woodwork and a saddle are mentioned, as is the progress of the "[[begum|begim]]'s little chest".&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44; a good number of those named are mentioned in other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Muhammad during the Mi'raj - from Jami al-Tawarikh.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mi'raj]] (also called the "Night Ride") of Muhammed on [[Buraq]], Tabriz, 1307; Ilkhanid, with both Christian and Chinese influences, and horizontal format.]]

The ancient Persian religion of [[Manichaeism]] made considerable use of images; not only was the founding prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (c.216–276) a professional artist, at least according to later Islamic tradition, but one of the sacred books of the religion, the [[Arzhang]], was illustrated by the prophet himself, whose illustrations (probably essentially cosmological diagrams rather than images with figures) were regarded as part of the sacred material and always copied with the text.  Unfortunately, the Islamic suppression of the religion was so thorough that only tiny fragments of Manichean art survive.  These no doubt influenced the continuing Persian tradition, but little can be said about how.  It is also known that [[Sassanid]] palaces had wall-paintings, but only fragments of these have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

There are narrative scenes in pottery, though it is hard to judge how these relate to lost contemporary book painting.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was also a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great period of the Persian miniature began when Persia was ruled by a succession of foreign dynasties, who came from the east and north. The traumatic [[Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]] of [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|1219]] onwards established the [[Ilkhanate]] as a branch of the [[Mongol Empire]], and despite the huge destruction of life and property, the new court had a galvanising effect on book painting, importing many Chinese works and probably artists, with their long-established tradition of narrative painting. The Ilkhanids continued to migrate between summer and winter quarters, which together with other travels for war, hunting and administration, made the portable form of the illustrated book the most suitable vehicle for painting, as it also was for mobile European medieval rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Great Mongol Shahnameh]], now dispersed, is the outstanding manuscript of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1335 the Ilkhanate split into several warring dynasties, all swept aside by the new invasion of [[Timur]] from 1381. He established the [[Timurid dynasty]], bringing a fresh wave of Chinese influence, who were replaced by the [[Black Sheep Turkmen]] in 1452, followed by the [[White Sheep Turkmen]] from 1468, who were in turn replaced by the [[Safavid dynasty]] by 1501; they ruled until 1722.  After a chaotic period [[Nader Shah]] took control, but there was no long-lived dynasty until the [[Qajar dynasty]], who ruled from 1794 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 309-315, OAO; Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baysunghur's Shahname 001.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Baysonghor Shahnameh]], 1430. He was a key patron of the [[Herat]] school]]

It was only in the 14th century that the practice began of commissioning illustrated copies of classic works of [[Persian poetry]], above all the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]] (940-1020) and the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', which were to contain many of the finest miniatures.  Previously book illustration, of works in both Arabic and Persian, had been concentrated in practical and scientific treatises, often following at several removes the Byzantine miniatures copied when ancient Greek books were translated.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;  However a 14th-century flowering of Arabic illustrated literary manuscripts in Syria and Egypt collapsed at the end of the century, leaving Persia the undisputed leader in Islamic book illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the best miniatures from early manuscripts were removed from their books in later centuries and transferred to albums, several of which are now in [[Istanbul]]; this complicates tracing the art history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Simms&lt;/ref&gt;

Miniatures from the Safavid and later periods are far more common than earlier ones, but although some prefer the simpler elegance of the early 15th and 16th centuries, most art historians agree in seeing a rise in quality up to the mid-16th century, culminating in a series of superb royal commissions by the Safavid court, such as the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]] (or Houghton Shahnameh). There was a crisis in the 1540s when Shah [[Tahmasp I]], previously a patron on a large scale, ceased to commission works, apparently losing interest in painting.  Some of his artists went to the court of his nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]], governor of [[Mashad]] from 1556, where there was a brief flowering of painting until the Shah fell out with his nephew in 1565, including a ''[[Haft Awrang]]'', the "Freer Jami".  Other artists went to the Mughal court.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 103; Welch (mostly on Freer Jami after p. 24), 23-27, 31, 98-127; [http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/loveYearning/base.html Freer Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;  After this the number of illustrated book manuscript commissions falls off, and the tradition falls into over-sophistication and decline.&lt;ref&gt;OAO; Gray (1930), 74-89; Welch, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tabriz]] in the north-west of Iran is the longest established centre of production, and [[Baghdad]] (then under Persian rule) was often important. [[Shiraz]] in the south, sometimes the capital of a sub-ruler, was a centre from the late 14th century, and [[Herat]], now in [[Afghanistan]], was important in the periods when it was controlled from Persia, especially when the Timurid prince [[Baysonqor]] was governor in the 1420s; he was then the leading patron in Persia, commissioning the [[Baysonghor Shahnameh]] and other works.  Each centre developed its own style, which were largely reconciled and combined under the Safavids.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 37-55; Welch, 14-18; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools of Herat, where the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] royal workshops usually were, had developed a style of classical restraint and elegance, and the painters of Tabriz, a more expressive and imaginative style.  Tabriz was the former capital of the Turkmen rulers, and in the early [[Safavid]] period the styles were gradually harmonized in works like the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]].&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 80; Walther &amp; Wolf, 420-424&lt;/ref&gt;  But a famous unfinished miniature showing [[Rustam]] asleep, while his horse [[Rakhsh]] fights off a lion, was probably made for this manuscript, but was never finished and bound in, perhaps because its vigorous Tabriz style did not please Tahmasp. It appears to be by Sultan Mohammad, whose later works in the manuscript show a style adapted to the court style of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Bizhad]].  It is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese influences==
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]] of the Prophet by Sultan Muhammad, showing  Chinese-influenced clouds and angels, 1539-43.&lt;ref&gt;see Welch, 95-97&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Before Chinese influence was introduced, figures were tied to the ground line and included "backgrounds of solid color", or in "clear accordance with indigenous artistic traditions". However, once influenced by the Chinese, Persian painters gained much more freedom through the Chinese traditions of "unrestricted space and infinite planes". Much of the Chinese influence in Persian art is probably indirect, transmitted through Central Asia. There appear to be no Persian miniatures that are clearly the work of a Chinese artist or one trained in China itself. The most prestigious Chinese painting tradition, of ''literati'' [[landscape painting]] on scrolls, has little influence; instead the closest parallels are with wall-paintings and motifs such as clouds and dragons found in Chinese pottery, textiles, and other decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The format and composition of the Persian miniature received strong influence from Chinese paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz and Desai, 172; Meri, 585&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ilkhanid rulers did not convert to Islam for several decades, meanwhile remaining [[Tantric Buddhist]]s or Christians (usually [[Nestorian Christian|Nestorian]]s).  While very few traces now remain, Buddhist and Christian images were probably easily available to Persian artists at this period.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in Ilkhanid and Timurid [[Mongol]]-[[Persian people|Persian]] mythological miniatures,  mythical beasts were portrayed in a style close to the Chinese [[qilin]], [[fenghuang]] ([[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]), [[bixie]] and [[Chinese dragon]], though they have a much more aggressive character in Islamic art, and are often seen fighting each other or natural beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 169-173&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent Persian miniaturists ==
The workshop tradition and division of labour within both an individual miniature and a book, as described above, complicates the attribution of paintings.  Some are inscribed with the name of the artist, sometimes as part of the picture itself, for example as if painted on tiles in a building, but more often as a note added on the page or elsewhere; where and when being often uncertain.  Because of the nature of the works, literary and historical references to artists, even if they are relied upon, usually do not enable specific paintings to be identified, though there are exceptions.  The reputation of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād Herawī]], or Behzād, the leading miniaturist of the late Timurid era, and founder of the Safavid school, remained supreme in the [[Persianate]] world, and at least some of his work, and style, can be identified with a degree of confidence, despite a good deal of continuing scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 57-66; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sultan Mohammed]], [[Mir Sayyid Ali]], and [[Aqa Mirak]], were leading painters of the next generation, the Safavid culmination of the classic style, whose attributed works are found together in several manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 17-27, and many individual pictures shown&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abd al-Samad]] was one of the most successful Persian painters recruited by the [[Mughal Emperor]]s to work in India.  In the next generation, [[Reza Abbasi]] worked in the Late Safavid period producing mostly album miniatures, and his style was continued by many later painters.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the miniatures of Abu'l-Hasan Khan Gaffari ([[Sani ol molk]]), active in [[Qajar]] Persia, showed originality, naturalism, and technical perfection.&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Robinson, “[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abul-hasan-khan-gaffari-sani-al-molk-1814-66-painter-in-oils-and-miniature-lacquer-artist-and-book-illustrator Abu'l-Hasan Khan Gaffari],” Encyclopædia Iranica, I/3, pp. 306-308&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mahmoud Farshchian]] is a contemporary miniaturist whose style has broadened the scope of this art.

'''''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England''''' is a study of several [[Wicca]]n and [[ceremonial magic]] groups that assembled in southern England during the 1980s. It was written by the American anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] (1959–) of the [[University of California, San Diego]], and first published in 1989.

The work would be criticized by later academics working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] and [[western esotericism]], who charged it with dealing with those it was studying in a derogatory manner.

== Influence==
Writing in her paper within [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]' edited ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft'' anthology, Siân Reid described Luhrmann's work as "a solid ethnography". Nevertheless, she felt that the study "occasionally rings hollow" because Luhrmann failed to take into account the "subjective motivations for magical practice".{{sfn|Reid|1996|pp=146&amp;ndash;147}}
In her anthropological study of the U.S. Pagan community, ''[[Witching Culture]]'' (2004), the American academic [[Sabina Magliocco]] noted that her work both built upon and departed from Luhrmann's.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7578">'''Professional courtesy''' generally refers to a philosophy of particular professional behavior or etiquette which is extended between members of the same profession. The concept of professional courtesy is believed to have originated within the ancient practice of medicine by where physicians provided services to other physicians without charge. However, the philosophy does not necessarily involve the same courtesy across all professions. Nor is professional courtesy a mandated privilege, but is freely given at the discretion of the party extending the courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cji.edu/site/assets/files/1921/professionalcourtesy.pdf|title=Professional Courtesy Ethics in Policing|last=McVay|first=Jerold A.|date=2012-04-22|website=Crim. Justice Institute|publisher=Univ. of Arkansas|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the etiquette is not limited to physicians, the medical profession is likely the oldest and most well known for having such a long-standing tradition of professional courtesy among its professionals. Some other well known groups who have some form of professional courtesy also include attorneys, performing arts, and law enforcement. The phrase may also be applied in a literal form, such as the required ethical behavior of lawyers towards each other.&lt;ref name="KBA"&gt;{{cite web| title = Code of Professional Courtesy| work = Kentucky Bar Association| url = http://www.kybar.org/Default.aspx?tabid=228| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medicine==
In 1803, [[Thomas Percival]] wrote his classic essay on medical ethics which endorsed complimentary professional care to “All members of the profession, including apothecaries as well as physicians and surgeons, together with their wives and children, should be attended gratuitously.” In 1847, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics similarly endorsed withholding charges for services to other physicians and their families,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; known as professional courtesy. This is likely the first modern day documentation of the philosophy.

Among [[physician]]s, it has been historically traditional to provide medical care at no or reduced cost to physician colleagues and their immediate family members.&lt;ref name="ama"&gt;{{cite web| title = AMA Code of Medical Ethics, E-6.13, Professional Courtesy| work = | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?| accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of this was to discourage physicians from treating themselves and members of their own family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jones, MD, PhD, MHA|first = James|last2 = McCullough, PhD|first2 = Laurence|last3 = Richman, MA|first3 = Bruce|date = 2004-05-01|title = Ethics of Professional Courtesy|url = http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(04)00144-2/pdf|journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume = 39|issue = 5|pages = 1140–1141|doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2004.01.035|pmid =|lay-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom dates back to [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;Rathbun, Katharine C., M.D.; Richards, Edward P. III, J.D.; ''Professional Courtesy''; Missouri Medicine; 1998;95:18-20; [http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Articles/Professional_Courtesy.html (on-line)].&lt;/ref&gt; well before physicians reached middle-class income levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, physicians regularly providing free or reduced rate services as professional courtesy must remain mindful in the age of copays, insurance only billing, and referrals, the practice can run afoul of the law under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hawleytroxell.com/2011/12/professional-courtesy-problems/|title = Professional Courtesy Problems - Hawley Troxell - Health Law|last =|first =|date =|year = 2011|publisher = Hawley Troxell - Health Law|access-date = 2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the American Medical Association issued a Code of Medical Ethics Opinion advising free of charge and reduced rate services was not an ethical requirement, and physicians should use their own judgment in deciding to extend such professional courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?|title=Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 6.13 - Professional Courtesy|last=|first=|date=1994-06-01|website=American Medical Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law enforcement ==
The term has been used to refer to the practice by law enforcement officers allowing other officers to engage in traffic violations and some crimes without being reported or arrested. There are three tools that law enforcement officers use to implement "professional courtesy":

First, some states (such as [[California]]) issue "confidential [[Vehicle registration plate|plate]]s" to employees in law enforcement, and other public officials. The plates keep identities and addresses anonymous, allowing employees the inadvertent ability to travel on toll-ways without charge.&lt;ref name = "Corrupt"&gt;{{cite web| title = Special license plates shield officials from traffic tickets| work = ocregister.com|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dmv-police-confidential-2011354-program-records | accessdate = 2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even serious offences such as drunk driving are subject to professional courtesy "discretion", and [[federal law]] assists in the process by exempting police officers and firefighters from a federal law that requires truck drivers to be blood-tested after an accident.&lt;ref name = "DUI Cops"&gt;{{cite news| title = A broken system works in favor of cops busted for DUI| work = seattlepi.com|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/specials/undueinfluence/326446_dui06.html | accessdate = 2009-06-02| first1=Eric| last1=Nalder| first2=Lewis| last2=Kamb| first3=P-I| last3=Investigative| date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, there is a web site offering law enforcement employees the purchase of a "family card" they can give to friends and family to produce at, for example, a traffic stop to identify them to the officer as a family member.  Anti-police groups and people wary of the ethical actions of police officers purport that where an ordinary member of the public would get a ticket this notification card will cause the officer to overlook any violations of the law the person may have made and tell them to go on their way.&lt;ref name = "police"&gt;{{cite web| title = Professional Courtesy| work = NJLawman.com|url = http://njlawman.com/Feature%20Pieces/Professional%20Courtesy.htm| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vendor of this card is explicit about the intention behind these cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leoprocards.com/|title=LEOProCards|work=|accessdate=2012-08-05}}http://leoprocards.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619001525/http://leoprocards.com/ |date=2012-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In theater ==
Until the 1960s it was customary for theater managements to permit members of [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors Equity]] and other members of the profession into Broadway shows for free. This practice continues in the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] world where members of Equity must be admitted free of charge to any Showcase production in which there is a member of the union in the cast if there are seats left at curtain time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org AEA website]&lt;/ref&gt; This applies as well to ''bona fide'' producers, directors and casting directors, who do not have to wait until showtime to be seated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6574">In [[mathematics]] and [[optimization]], a '''pseudo-Boolean function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbf{B}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,
where '''B'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1} is a ''[[Boolean domain]]'' and ''n'' is a nonnegative integer called the [[arity]] of the function.  A [[Boolean function]] is then a special case, where the values are also restricted to 0,1.

==Representations==

Any pseudo-Boolean function can be written uniquely as a [[multi-linear]] polynomial:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the determination of the minima of pseudo-Boolean functions|last = Hammer|first = P.L.|date = 1963|journal = Studii ¸si cercetari matematice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Rosenberg|first2 = I.|last3 = Rudeanu|first3 = S.|issue = 14|publisher = |pages = 359–364|language = Romanian|issn = 0039-4068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boolean Methods in Operations Research and Related Areas|last = Hammer|first = Peter L.|publisher = Springer|year = 1968|isbn = 978-3-642-85825-3|location = |pages = |last2 = Rudeanu|first2 = Sergiu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(\boldsymbol{x}) = a + \sum_i a_ix_i + \sum_{i&lt;j}a_{ij}x_ix_j + \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}a_{ijk}x_ix_jx_k + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
The '''degree''' of the pseudo-Boolean function is simply the degree of the [[polynomial]] in this representation.

In many settings (e.g., in [[Analysis of Boolean functions|Fourier analysis of pseudo-Boolean functions]]), a pseudo-Boolean function is viewed as a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that maps &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Again in this case we can uniquely write  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a multi-linear polynomial:
&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \sum_{I\subseteq [n]}\hat{f}(I)\prod_{i\in I}x_i, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \hat{f}(I) &lt;/math&gt; are Fourier coefficients of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[n]=\{1,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Optimization==
Minimizing (or, equivalently, maximizing) a pseudo-Boolean function is [[NP-hard]]. This can easily be seen by formulating, for example, the [[maximum cut]] problem as maximizing a pseudo-Boolean function.&lt;ref name="boroshammer" /&gt;

===Submodularity===
The [[submodular set function]]s can be viewed as a special class of pseudo-Boolean functions, which is equivalent to the condition
:&lt;math&gt; f(\boldsymbol{x}) + f(\boldsymbol{y}) \ge  f(\boldsymbol{x} \wedge \boldsymbol{y}) + f(\boldsymbol{x} \vee \boldsymbol{y}), \; \forall \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}\in \mathbf{B}^n\,. &lt;/math&gt;
This is an important class of pseudo-boolean functions, because they can be [[Submodular set function#Submodular Minimization|minimized in polynomial time]].

===Roof Duality===
If ''f'' is a quadratic polynomial, a concept called ''roof duality'' can be used to obtain a lower bound for its minimum value.&lt;ref name="boroshammer"&gt;Boros and Hammer, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Roof duality may also provide a partial assignment of the variables, indicating some of the values of a minimizer to the polynomial. Several different methods of obtaining lower bounds were developed only to later be shown to be equivalent to what is now called roof duality.&lt;ref name="boroshammer" /&gt;

===Reductions===
If the degree of ''f'' is greater than 2, one can always employ ''reductions'' to obtain an equivalent quadratic problem with additional variables.&lt;ref name="ishikawa2011"&gt;Ishikawa, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reduction is
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  	-x_1x_2x_3=\min_{z\in\mathbf{B}}z(2-x_1-x_2-x_3)&lt;/math&gt;
There are other possibilities, for example,
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle  	-x_1x_2x_3=\min_{z\in\mathbf{B}}z(-x_1+x_2+x_3)-x_1x_2-x_1x_3+x_1. &lt;/math&gt;
Different reductions lead to different results. Take for example the following cubic polynomial:&lt;ref name="kahlstrandmark"&gt;Kahl and Strandmark, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle  	f(\boldsymbol{x})=-2x_1+x_2-x_3+4x_1x_2+4x_1x_3-2x_2x_3-2x_1x_2x_3. &lt;/math&gt;
Using the first reduction followed by roof duality, we obtain a lower bound of -3 and no indication on how to assign the three variables. Using the second reduction, we obtain the (tight) lower bound of -2 and the optimal assignment of every variable (which is &lt;math&gt; {(0,1,1)}&lt;/math&gt;).

===Polynomial Compression Algorithms===
Consider a pseudo-Boolean function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; as a mapping from &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; f(x)= \sum_{I\subseteq [n]}\hat{f}(I)\prod_{i\in I}x_i. &lt;/math&gt; Assume that each coefficient &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(I)&lt;/math&gt; is integral. 
Then for an integer &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; the problem P of deciding whether &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is more or equal to &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is NP-complete. It is proved in &lt;ref name="crow"&gt;Crowston et al., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; that
in polynomial time we can either solve P or reduce the number of variables to &lt;math&gt; O(k^2\log k) &lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; be the degree of the above multi-linear polynomial for &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;ref name="crow"&gt;Crowston et al., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; proved that in polynomial time we can either solve P or reduce the number of variables to &lt;math&gt; r(k-1) &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">'''RIMPUFF''' is a local-scale puff diffusion model developed by Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy, Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risoe.dtu.dk|title=Danmarks Tekniske Universitet|work=dtu.dk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311010721/http://www.risoe.dtu.dk/|archivedate=2008-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an emergency response model to help emergency management organisations deal with chemical, nuclear, biological and radiological releases to the atmosphere.

RIMPUFF is in operational use in several European national emergency centres for preparedness and prediction of nuclear accidental releases (RODOS, EURANOS, [[ARGOS DSS|ARGOS]]), chemical gas releases ([[ARGOS DSS|ARGOS]]), and for airborne Foot-and Mouth Disease virus spread &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/ The Foot and Mouth Disease] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121154728/http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/ |date=2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

RIMPUFF builds from parameterized formulas for puff diffusion, wet and dry deposition, and gamma dose radiation. Its range of application covers distances up to ~1000&amp;nbsp;km from the point of release.

RIMPUFF calculates the instantaneous atmospheric dispersion taking into account the local wind variability and the local turbulence levels. The puff sizes represent instantaneous relative diffusion (no averaging) and is calculated from similarity scaling theory.
Puff diffusion is patameterized for travel times in the range from a few seconds and up to ~1 day.

Wet and dry deposition is also calculated as a function of local rain intensity and turbulence levels.

It started by the manufacturing of [[flat glass]], later [[pressed glass]] under Kaiserkristall brand that the company established as the first in [[Austria-Hungary]]. This was popular at the turn of the century for price and the fact that it imitated products of luxury cut [[lead glass]]. The goods were sold under the name ’’Imperial Crystal’’.&lt;ref name="history SME"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the pressed glass was manufactured hand blown glass under RONA Crystal brand focused on drinking glass and sets for hotels, medical institutions, cafes… as well as domestic glass for a household.

Besides clear glass, the glassworks is known for its decoration techniques such as cutting, engraving, [[guilloche]], painting, spraying, screen printing, tampoprint (an automatic calibration by laser), and pantograph technology. The company in Lednické Rovne established pantographs of English production as the first in Europe in 1896.&lt;ref name="history SME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history HN"/&gt; In the 1940s, the company cooperated in the development of decors with professional designers [[Vincent Hložník]] and [[Martin Benka]].

Archived collections show products from the beginning that were decorated, full-colour pieces, along with functional designs of clear, plain glass. These lines were developed by patenting of a new handmade technology. [[Pulled stem]], even more in 1956 than currently, is an indicator of glass products from Lednické Rovne.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Calendar  of  innovations ===
The development of glass production in Lednické Rovne went through many organizational changes, the company overcame many crisis periods of that time and the great program and focused production such as pressed glass, cylinders for lamps, technique and laboratory glass, light bulbs, feeding bottles… changed quite often and it gained the recognition as a producer mostly quality drinking glass at the beginning of 20th century. This program is a representative article of the company to the present when the proportion of hand made and machine production was changed as well as decoration glass. From the half of 60’s of the 20th century, the company focused mainly on a gradual introduction of machinery and automatic production of glass.

[[Image:Sansewer.jpg|thumb|PVC sanitary sewer installation. Sanitary sewers are sized to carry the amount of sewage generated by the collection area. Sanitary sewers are much smaller than combined sewers designed to also carry [[surface runoff]].]]

A '''sanitary sewer''' or '''foul sewer''' is an underground pipe or tunnel system for transporting [[sewage]] from houses and [[Commercial building|commercial buildings]] (but not [[stormwater]]) to [[sewage treatment|treatment]] facilities or disposal. Sanitary sewers are part of an overall system called a sewage system or [[sewerage]].

Sewage may be treated to control [[water pollution]] before discharge to [[surface water]]s.&lt;ref name="Metcalf1922"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4ybw1sOIk8C|title=Sewerage and Sewage Disposal: A Textbook|last2=Eddy|first2=Harrison P.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1922|isbn=|location=New York|page=|pages=|last1=Metcalf|first1=Leonard|authorlink=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staley1899"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jT81AAAAMAAJ|title=The Separate System of Sewerage, Its Theory and Construction|last2=Pierson|first2=George S.|publisher=Van Nostrand|year=1899|isbn=|location=New York|page=|pages=|last1=Staley|first1=Cady|authorlink=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitary sewers serving industrial areas also carry [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]].

Separate sanitary sewer systems are designed to transport sewage alone. In municipalities served by sanitary sewers, separate [[storm drain]]s may convey [[surface runoff]] directly to surface waters. Sanitary sewers are distinguished from [[combined sewer]]s, which combine sewage with [[stormwater]] runoff in one pipe. Sanitary sewer systems are beneficial because they avoid [[Combined sewer#Combined sewer overflows (CSOs)|combined sewer overflows]].

== Background ==
[[Sewage treatment]] is less effective when sanitary waste is diluted with stormwater, and combined sewer overflows occur when runoff from heavy rainfall or [[snowmelt]] exceeds the hydraulic capacity of [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plants]].&lt;ref name="EPARTC"&gt;
{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress: Impacts and Control of CSOs and SSOs |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-833-R-04-001 |page=ES-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome these disadvantages, some cities built separate sanitary sewers to collect only municipal wastewater and exclude stormwater runoff collected in separate storm drains. The decision between a combined sewer system or two separate systems is mainly based on need for sewage treatment and cost of providing treatment during heavy rain events. Many cities with combined sewer systems built prior to installing sewage treatment have not replaced those sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |date=1972 |title=Wastewater Engineering: collection, treatment, disposal |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Wastewater_engineering_collection_treatm.html?id=fhpSAAAAMAAJ |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Orfice.jpg|thumb|Interior of a large sanitary sewer viewed from an access manhole.]]

In the developed world, sewers are [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] from buildings to one or more levels of larger underground trunk mains, which transport the sewage to [[sewage treatment]] facilities. Vertical pipes, usually made of [[precast concrete]], called [[manhole]]s, connect the mains to the surface. Depending upon site application and use, these vertical pipes can be [[Cylinder|cylindrical]], [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentric]], or [[Concentric objects|concentric]]. The manholes are used for access to the sewer pipes for inspection and maintenance, and as a means to vent sewer gases. They also facilitate vertical and horizontal angles in otherwise straight pipelines. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acu-tech.com.au/systems/acu-sewer/|title=Acu-Sewer Pressure Pipe for Sewer Mains {{!}} Acu-Tech Piping Systems|work=Acu-Tech Piping Systems|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes conveying sewage from an individual building to a common gravity sewer line are called laterals. Branch sewers typically run under streets receiving laterals from buildings along that street and discharge by gravity into trunk sewers at manholes. Larger cities may have sewers called '''interceptors''', receiving flow from multiple trunk sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |editor1-last=Lee |editor1-first=C.C. |title=Environmental Engineering Dictionary |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1lnQwrvOSEC&amp;lpg=PA707&amp;dq=%22interceptor%20sewer%22%20glossary&amp;pg=PA423#v=onepage&amp;q=interceptor%20sewer&amp;f=false |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Government Institutes |page=423 |date=2005 |isbn=9780865878488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asce"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers |url= |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers and Water Pollution Control Federation |location=New York |pages=2, 288 |date=1969 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design and sizing of sanitary sewers considers the population to be served over the anticipated life of the sewer, per capita wastewater production, and flow peaking from timing of daily routines. Minimum sewer diameters are often specified to prevent blockage by solid materials flushed down toilets; and gradients may be selected to maintain flow velocities generating sufficient turbulence to minimize solids deposition within the sewer. Commercial and industrial wastewater flows are also considered, but diversion of surface runoff to storm drains eliminates wet weather flow peaks of inefficient combined sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tyler |first=Richard G. |authorlink = |title =Civil Engineering Handbook |publisher =McGraw-Hill |volume =Section 9 |edition =Fourth |date =1959 |location =New York |pages =1–24 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Force mains === 
Pumps may be necessary where gravity sewers serve areas at lower elevations than the sewage treatment plant, or distant areas at similar elevations. A lift station is a sewer sump that lifts accumulated sewage to a higher elevation. The pump may discharge to another gravity sewer at that location or may discharge through a pressurized force main to some distant location.&lt;ref name="asce" /&gt;

Effluent sewer systems, also called septic tank effluent drainage (STED) or solids-free sewer (SFS) systems, have [[septic tank]]s that collect [[sewage]] from residences and businesses, and the effluent that comes out of the tank is sent to either a centralized [[sewage treatment]] plant or a distributed treatment system for further treatment. Most of the solids are removed by the septic tanks, so the treatment plant can be much smaller than a typical plant. In addition, because of the vast reduction in solid waste, a pumping system can be used to move the wastewater rather than a gravity system. The pipes have small diameters, typically {{convert|1.5|to|4|in|cm|0}}. Because the waste stream is pressurized, they can be laid just below the ground surface along the land's contour.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Simplified sewer ===
{{see also|Simplified sewerage}}
Simplified sanitary sewers consist of small-diameter pipes, typically around {{convert|100|mm|in|0}}, often laid at fairly flat gradients (1 in 200). Although the investment cost for simplified sanitary sewers can be about half the cost of conventional sewers, the requirements for operation and maintenance are usually higher. Simplified sewers are most common in [[Brazil]] and are also used in a number of other{{which|date=May 2018}} developing countries.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Vacuum sewer ===
{{Main|Vacuum sewer}}
In low-lying communities, wastewater is often conveyed by [[vacuum sewer]]. Pipelines range in size from pipes of {{convert|6|in|mm}} in diameter to concrete-lined tunnels of up to {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} in diameter. A low pressure system uses a small [[grinder pump]] located at each point of connection, typically a house or business. Vacuum sewer systems use differential [[atmospheric pressure]] to move the liquid to a central vacuum station.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Maintenance==
[[Sanitary sewer overflow]] can occur due to blocked or broken sewer lines, infiltration of excessive [[stormwater]] or malfunction of pumps. In these cases untreated [[sewage]] is discharged from a sanitary sewer into the environment prior to reaching [[sewage treatment]] facilities. To avoid this, maintenance is required.

The maintenance requirements vary with the type of sanitary sewer. In general, all sewers deteriorate with age, but [[Infiltration/Inflow|infiltration and inflow]] are problems unique to sanitary sewers, since both combined sewers and storm drains are sized to carry these contributions. Holding infiltration to acceptable levels requires a higher standard of maintenance than necessary for structural integrity considerations of combined sewers.&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;Hammer, Mark J. ''Water and Waste-Water Technology'' (1975) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-34726-4}} p.442&lt;/ref&gt;  A comprehensive construction inspection program is required to prevent inappropriate connection of cellar, yard, and roof drains to sanitary sewers.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;Steel, E.W. and McGhee, Terence J. ''Water Supply and Sewerage'' (1979) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-060929-2}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  The probability of inappropriate connections is higher where combined sewers and sanitary sewers are found in close proximity, because construction personnel may not recognize the difference.  Many older cities still use combined sewers while adjacent suburbs were built with separate sanitary sewers.

For decades, when sanitary sewer pipes cracked or experienced other damage, the only option was an expensive excavation, removal and replacement of the damaged pipe, typically requiring street repavement afterwards.  In the mid-1950s a unit was invented where two units at each end with a special [[cement]] mixture in between was pulled from one manhole cover to the next, coating the pipe with the cement under high pressure, which then [[Accelerated curing|cured rapidly]], sealing all cracks and breaks in the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qsgcX3mC0k&amp;sig=5uzq7dFzwBL4NlAn6jl810wzujk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DPAdUMLcFabRyAGC94D4CQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&amp;f=true "Sewer Sealing Machine Patches Cracks Underground."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1956, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a similar method using epoxy resin is used by some municipalities to re-line aging or damaged pipes, effectively creating a "pipe in a pipe". These methods may be unsuitable for locations where the full diameter of the original pipe is required to carry expected flows, and may be an unwise investment if greater wastewater flows may be anticipated from population growth, increased water use, or new service connections within the expected service life of the repair.

Another popular method for replacing aged or damaged lines is called [[pipe bursting]], where a new pipe, typically PVC or ABS plastic, is drawn through the old pipe behind an "expander head" that breaks apart the old pipe as the new one is drawn through behind it.

These methods are most suitable for trunk sewers, since repair of lines with lateral connections is complicated by making provisions to receive lateral flows without accepting undesirable infiltration from inadequately sealed junctions.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Sanitary sewers evolved from combined sewers built where water was plentiful. Animal [[feces]] accumulated on city streets while [[Outline of animal-powered transport|animal-powered transport]] moved people and goods. Accumulations of animal feces encouraged dumping [[chamber pot]]s into streets where [[night soil]] collection was impractical.&lt;ref name="bellis2018"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/Plumbing_3.htm|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-plumbing-1992310|title=The History of Plumbing|author=Bellis, Mary|archivedate=2013-12-16|date=2018-03-31|accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined sewers were built to use surface runoff to flush waste off streets and move it underground to places distant from populated areas. Sewage treatment became necessary as population expanded, but increased volumes and pumping capacity required for treatment of diluted waste from combined sewers is more expensive than treating undiluted sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steel |first1=E.W. |last2=McGhee |first2=Terence J. |authorlink = |title =Water Supply and Sewerage |publisher =McGraw-Hill |volume = |edition =5th |date =1979 |location =New York |page =318 |isbn =0-07-060929-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tip growth''' is an extreme form of polarised growth of living cells that results in an elongated cylindrical cell morphology with a rounded tip at which the growth activity takes place. Tip growth occurs in algae (e.g., ''[[Acetabularia acetabulum]]''), fungi ([[hypha]]e) and plants (e.g. [[Trichome|root hairs]] and [[pollen tubes]]).

Tip growth is a process that has many similarities in diverse walled cells such as pollen tubes, root hairs, and hyphae.

== Fungal tip growth and hyphal tropisms==

Fungal hyphae extend continuously at their extreme tips, where enzymes are released into the environment and where new wall materials are synthesised. The rate of tip extension can be extremely rapid - up to 40 micrometres per minute. It is supported by the continuous movement of materials into the tip from older regions of the hyphae. So, in effect, a fungal hypha is a continuously moving mass of protoplasm in a continuously extending tube. This unique mode of growth - apical growth - is the hallmark of fungi, and it accounts for much of their environmental and economic significance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/groups/jdeacon/microbes/apical.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2018}}

'''Urban informatics''' refers to the study of people creating, applying and using [[information and communication technology]] and [[data]] in the context of [[cities]] and [[urban environments]]. Various definitions are available, some provided in the [[#Definitions|Definitions]] section. Urban informatics is a trans-disciplinary field of research and practice that draws on three broad domains: people, place and technology.&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011" /&gt;

* People can refer to city residents, [[citizens]], [[community groups]], from various socio-cultural backgrounds, as well as the social dimensions of non-profit organisations and businesses. The social research domains that urban informatics draws from include [[urban sociology]], [[media studies]], [[communication studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[city planning]] and others.
* Place can refer to distinct urban sites, [[Locale (geographic)|locales]] and [[habitats]], as well as to larger scale geographic entities such as [[neighbourhoods]], [[public space]], [[suburbs]], [[regions]], or peri-urban areas. The place or spatial research domains entail [[urban studies]], [[architecture]], [[urban design]], [[urban planning]], [[geography]], and others.
* Technology can refer to various types of [[information and communication technology]] and [[ubiquitous computing]] / [[urban computing]] technology such as [[mobile phones]], [[wearable devices]], urban screens, media façades, [[sensors]], and other [[Internet of Things]] devices. The technology research domains span [[informatics]], [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], [[human-computer interaction]], and others.

In addition to [[geographic data]] / [[spatial data]], most common sources of data relevant to urban informatics can be divided into three broad categories: government data ([[census]] data, [[open data]], etc.); personal data ([[social media]], [[quantified self]] data, etc.), and; sensor data ([[transport]], [[surveillance]], [[CCTV]], Internet of Things devices, etc.).&lt;ref name="kitchin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Street Computing 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Ricky|last2=Rittenbruch|first2=Markus|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Filonik|first4=Daniel|last5=Viller|first5=Stephen|title=Street Computing: Towards an Integrated Open Data Application Programming Interface (API) for Cities|journal=Journal of Urban Technology|date=April 2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/10630732.2012.698064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although first mentions of the term date back as early as 1987, urban informatics did not emerge as a notable field of research and practice until 2006 (see [[#History|History]] section). Since then, the emergence and growing popularity of ubiquitous computing, open data and [[big data analytics]], as well as [[smart cities]] contributed to a surge in interest in urban informatics, not just from academics but also from industry and city governments seeking to explore and apply the possibilities and opportunities of urban informatics.

== Definitions ==

Many definitions of urban informatics have been published and can be found online. The descriptions provided by Townsend in his foreword and by Foth in his preface to the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics"&lt;ref name="foth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|title=Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics: The Practice and Promise of the Real-Time City|date=2009|publisher=Information Science Reference|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-60566-152-0|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/13308/}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize two key aspects: (1) the new possibilities (including real-time data) for both citizens and city administrations afforded by [[ubiquitous computing]], and (2) the convergence of physical and digital aspects of the city.

{{Quotation|"Urban informatics is the study, design, and practice of urban experiences across different urban contexts that are created by new opportunities of real-time, ubiquitous technology and the augmentation that mediates the physical and digital layers of people networks and urban infrastructures."|Foth, Choi, Satchell, 2011|Urban Informatics&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Marcus|last1=Foth|first2=Jaz Hee-jeong|last2=Choi|first3=Christine|last3=Satchell|title=Urban Informatics|conference=Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|pages=1–8|date=2011|location=Hangzhou, China|doi=10.1145/1958824.1958826}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although closely related, Foth differentiates urban informatics from the field of [[urban computing]] by suggesting that the former focusses more on the social and human implications of technology in cities (similar to the community and social emphases of how [[community informatics]] and [[social informatics]] are defined), and the latter focusses more on technology and computing.&lt;ref name="foth2009" /&gt; Urban informatics emphasises the relationship between urbanity, as expressed through the many dimensions of urban life, and technology.

Later, with the increasing popularity of commercial opportunities under the label of [[smart city]] and [[big data]], subsequent definitions became narrow and limited in defining urban informatics mainly as [[big data analytics]] for efficiency and productivity gains in city contexts – unless the arts and social sciences are added to the interdisciplinary mix.&lt;ref name="thrift"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrift|first1=Nigel|title=The Promise of Urban Informatics: Some Speculations|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2014|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1263–1266|doi=10.1068/a472c}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specialisation within urban informatics is sometimes referred to as 'data-driven, [[Urbanism#Network-based theories|networked urbanism]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|title=Data-Driven, Networked Urbanism|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2015|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2641802|ssrn=2641802}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[urban science]].&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batty|first1=Michael|title=The New Science of Cities|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262019521|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-science-cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

One of the first occurrences of the term can be found in Mark E. Hepworth's 1987 article "The Information City",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepworth|first1=Mark E.|title=The Information City|journal=Cities|date=August 1987|volume=4|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1016/0264-2751(87)90033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mentions the term "urban informatics" on page 261, however, Hepworth's overall discussion is more concerned with the broader notion of "informatics planning." Considering the article pre-dates the advent of ubiquitous computing and urban computing, it does contain some visionary thoughts about major changes on the horizon brought about by [[information and communication technology]] and the impact on cities.

The Urban Informatics Research Lab was founded at [[Queensland University of Technology]] in 2006, the first research group explicitly named to reflect its dedication to the study of urban informatics.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The first edited book on the topic, the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics", published in 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, brought together researchers and scholars from three broad domains: people, place, and technology, or; the social, the spatial, and the technical.

There were many precursors to this [[transdisciplinarity]] of "people, place, and technology."&lt;ref name="FothChoi2011" /&gt; From an [[architecture]], [[planning]] and [[design]] background, there is the work of the late [[William J. Mitchell]], Dean of the [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning]], and author of the 1995 book "City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=William J.|title=City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-13309-8|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/city-bits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell was influential in suggesting a profound relationship between place and technology at a time when mainstream interest was focused on the promise of the [[Information Superhighway]] and what [[Frances Cairncross]] called the "Death of Distance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cairncross|first1=Frances|title=The Death of Distance: How the Communications Revolution will Change our Lives|date=1997|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87584-806-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a decline in the significance of place through services such as [[telecommuting]], [[distance education]], [[e-commerce]], the physical / tangible layers of the city started to mix with the digital layers of the internet and online communications. Aspects of this trend have been studied under the terms community informatics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gurstein|first1=Michael|title=Community Informatics: Enabling Communities with Information and Communications Technologies|date=2000|publisher=Idea Group Publishing|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-878289-69-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[community network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuler|first1=Douglas|title=Community Networks: New Community Networks: Wired for Change|date=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.|isbn=978-0-201-59553-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first texts that systematically examined the impact of information technologies on the spatial and social evolution of cities is Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|last2=Marvin|first2=Simon|title=Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places.|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Stephen Graham and Simon Marvin. The relationship between cities and the internet was further expanded upon in a volume edited by Stephen Graham entitled "Cybercities Reader"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|title=The Cybercities Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-27956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by various authors in the 2006 book "Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Patrick|title=Networked Neighbourhoods: The Connected Community in Context|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=978-1-84628-267-6|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846282676}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Patrick Purcell. Additionally, contributions from architecture, design and planning scholars are contained in the 2007 journal special issue on "Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dave|first1=Bharat|title=Space, Sociality, and Pervasive Computing|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|date=2007|volume=34|issue=3|pages=381–382|doi=10.1068/b3403ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 34(3), guest edited by the late Bharat Dave, as well as in the 2008 book "Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City"&lt;ref name="aurigi2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aurigi|first1=Alessandro|last2=De Cindio|first2=Fiorella|title=Augmented Urban Spaces: Articulating the Physical and Electronic City|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=978-0-7546-7149-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Alessandro Aurigi and Fiorella De Cindio, based on contributions to the Digital Cities 4 workshop held in conjunction with the Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T) conference 2005 in Milan, Italy.

The first prominent and explicit use of the term urban informatics in the [[sociology]] and [[media studies]] literature appears in the 2007 special issue "Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellison|first1=Nick|last2=Burrows|first2=Roger|last3=Parker|first3=Simon|title=Urban Informatics: Software, Cities and the New Cartographies of Knowing Capitalism|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=December 2007|volume=10|issue=6|pages=785–788|doi=10.1080/13691180701750975}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal Information, Communication &amp; Society, 10(6), guest edited by Ellison, Burrows, &amp; Parker. Later on, in 2013, Burrows and Beer argued that the socio-technical transformations described by research studies conducted in the field of urban informatics give reason for sociologists more broadly to not only question epistemological and methodological norms and practices but also to rethink spatial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Roger|last2=Beer|first2=David|editor1-last=Orton-Johnson|editor1-first=Kate|editor2-last=Prior|editor2-first=Nick|title=Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives|chapter=Rethinking Space: Urban Informatics and the Sociological Imagination|date=2013| pages=61–78|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-230-22283-0|doi=10.1057/9781137297792_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], the sub-domains of [[human-computer interaction]], ubiquitous computing, and urban computing, provided early contributions that influenced the emerging field of urban informatics. Examples include the Digital Cities workshop series (see below), Greenfield’s 2006 book "Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing|last=Greenfield|first=Adam|publisher=New Riders|year=2006|isbn=0321384016|location=San Francisco, US|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2006 special issue "Urban Computing: Navigating Space and Context"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shklovski|first1=Irina|last2=Chang|first2=M. F.|title=Urban Computing: Navigating Space and Context|journal=Computer|date=September 2006|volume=39|issue=9|pages=36–37|doi=10.1109/MC.2006.308}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the IEEE journal Computer, 39(9), guest edited by Shklovski &amp; Chang, and the 2007 special issue "Urban Computing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kindberg|first1=Tim|last2=Chalmers|first2=Matthew|last3=Paulos|first3=Eric|title=Urban Computing|journal=IEEE Pervasive Computing|date=July 2007|volume=6|issue=3|pages=18–20|doi=10.1109/MPRV.2007.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the IEEE journal Pervasive Computing, 6(3), guest edited by Kindberg, Chalmers, &amp; Paulos.

== Digital Cities Workshop Series ==

The Digital Cities Workshop Series started in 1999&lt;ref name="dc1" /&gt; and is the longest running academic workshop series that has focused on, and profoundly influenced the field of urban informatics.&lt;ref name="foth2015" /&gt; The first two workshops in 1999 and 2001 were both held in Kyoto, Japan, with subsequent workshops since 2003 held in conjunction with the biennial International Conference on Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T).

Each Digital Cities workshop proceedings have become the basis for key anthologies listed below, which in turn have also been formative to a diverse set of emerging fields, including urban informatics, urban computing, smart cities, [[pervasive computing]], [[internet of things]], media architecture, urban [[interaction design]], and urban science.

== Methods ==

The diverse range of people, groups and organisations involved in urban informatics is reflective of the diversity of methods being used in its pursuit and practice. As a result, urban informatics borrows from a wide range of methodologies across the [[social sciences]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[design]], [[architecture]], [[planning]] (including [[geographic information systems]]), and [[technology]] (in particular [[computer science]], pervasive computing, and ubiquitous computing), and applies those to the urban domain. Examples include:

* [[action research]] and [[participatory action research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearn|first1=Greg|last2=Tacchi|first2=Jo|last3=Foth|first3=Marcus|last4=Lennie|first4=June|title=Action Research and New Media: Concepts, Methods, and Cases|date=2009|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1-57273-866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foth|first1=Marcus|last2=Brynskov|first2=Martin|editor1-last=Gordon|editor1-first=Eric|editor2-last=Mihailidis|editor2-first=Paul|title=Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice|chapter=Participatory Action Research for Civic Engagement|date=2016|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-03427-2|pages=563–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Foth's 2009 "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics",&lt;ref name="foth2009" /&gt; a number of books and special issues of academic journals have been published on the topic, which further demonstrate the increasing significance and notability of the field of urban informatics.
