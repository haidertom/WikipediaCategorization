'''''A Colossal Failure of Common Sense: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Lehman Brothers''''' is a 2009 [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Lawrence G. McDonald]] and [[Patrick Robinson (author)|Patrick Robinson]] which chronicles the events surrounding the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] in the context of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. The work is divided into a [[prologue]], an [[epilogue]], and twelve chapters.

As of August 9, 2009, the book was 7th on the [[New York Times Best Seller]] list for hardcover nonfiction.

''A Colossal Failure of Common Sense'' is translated into 12 different languages.

==Summary==
The book is highly critical of [[Richard Fuld]], [[Henry Paulson]], and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]], a 1999 act of Congress signed by former [[United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] that repealed portions of the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] of 1933.

The book contains an account of how McDonald, after attending the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]], selling pork chops, and self-teaching himself the material required to pass the [[General Securities Representative Exam]], went on to develop the website ConvertBond.com, which was later purchased by [[Morgan Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, pp. 14, 25, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author's stated expertise, in the [[convertible bond]] market, was what allowed him to create the website ConvertBond.com during the [[dot-com bubble]], and successfully sell it to Morgan Stanley before the Internet bubble burst. It was while he was working at Morgan Stanley that McDonald was offered a job as vice-president at [[Lehman Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The book characterizes Richard Fuld as being out of touch, smug, and a ruthless CEO with a short temper and a penchant for rage.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, pp. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The book sarcastically refers to Fuld as "his majesty," "god-like," and a "spiritual leader."&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lawrence and Patrick Robinson, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald believes that the United States government should have saved Lehman Brothers, and that Dick Fuld falsely believed that the United States government would save the company after having a meeting with [[Henry Paulson]] in the spring of 2008, which led him to engage in unnecessarily risky behavior and reject an offer of $18 per share from the [[Korea Development Bank]] as late as August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/book-review-a-colossal-failure-of-common-sense/ "Book Review: A Colossal Failure of Common Sense" - Canadian Capitalist] Retrieved December 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106760200 "Ex-Insider's Book Details Lehman Brothers Collapse" - NPR.org] Retrieved December 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''American Club'''|アメリカンクラブ株式会社}} is a company based in the Hiramatsuhonchō (平松本町) district of [[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]], Japan which has been involved in the "[[eikaiwa]]" (English conversation) business.

Though the company primarily operated as an English school in the 1980s and '90s, according to its business registration it is also involved in numerous other business activities such as restaurants and bars, athletic clubs, hotels, printing/publishing, video and software rental and employment services.&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"&gt;[http://moriosugimoto.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20110516114404 アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記] (American Club Business Registration), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Feb. 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
The American Club began operating on July 15, 1986,&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts"&gt;[http://isaokonno.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20110516115155 「英会話教室の外国人講師ら」'''賃金支払い求め訴訟'''経営者不在のまま閉鎖」]''朝日新聞''　(''Asahi Shimbun''), Utsunomiya edition, Utsunomiya, Jan. 25, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and recruited students for English classes during the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] economy of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The classes were mainly taught by native English-speaking teachers from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. At its peak, it had a main school in [[Utsunomiya]], and six branch schools in [[Mibu]], [[Mooka, Tochigi|Mooka]], [[Oyama, Tochigi|Oyama]], [[Tochigi, Tochigi|Tochigi]] City (all in [[Tochigi Prefecture]]), [[Koga, Ibaraki|Koga]] (in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]) and [[Sendai]] (in [[Miyagi Prefecture]]).

== Financial problems and first lawsuit over unpaid wages ==
After the burst of Japan's [[bubble economy]] in the early 1990s, the American Club began to suffer.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"&gt;和解書　(Court agreement), Dec. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.donmaclaren.com/networking_-_page_1.html?r=20130828100811 "The fall of American Club"] ''Networking'', Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan, Feb. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1994, employees' wages were late.&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; By October of that year, the school had stopped paying wages at all.&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;  A group of employees, led by Don MacLaren, subsequently organized, formed a branch union through Japan's [[National Union of General Workers]] and took the company's president, Hiroaki (aka "Morio") Sugimoto, and director, Isao (aka "Yasuaki") Konno, to court.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;National Union of General Workers Japan, Utsunomiya branch records, 1994-96&lt;/ref&gt;  These employees received three months in back wages on December 26, 1994, with a stipulation insisted on by Sugimoto that "teachers will refrain from damaging the company's reputation".&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Though the school had serious problems making its payroll between 1994 and 1996,&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; it continued to recruit and hire new employees (both before the December 1994 lawsuit and after it) from overseas through a broker in Vancouver, Canada, as well as from within Japan, through  ''[[The Japan Times]]'' "help wanted" ads.&lt;ref&gt;American Club teachers' contracts, 1994-1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheJapan"&gt;''The Japan Times'' help wanted ads, 1994-1995&lt;/ref&gt; Many of ''The Japan Times''' ads were for positions at an affiliated school Sugimoto ran - International Business and Language [[Vocational School#Japan|Senmon Gakkou]] (aka IBL, which according to its business registration is, like American Club, still a legally functioning entity).&lt;ref name="TheJapan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 IBL Registration"&gt;IBL Business Registration, Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Feb. 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugimoto was the landlord of the American Club spaces in Utsunomiya, and collected rent from the American Club through another company he owns, Mimasu Shoji, when the schools' teachers and secretaries were not being paid.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;登記　(Business Registrations for real estate in Motoimaizumi, Utsunomiya), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Mar. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1995 the school was again three months late paying employees' wages.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;  By this time Sugimoto had legally resigned his position as president of the company, and Konno became its president.&lt;ref name="Jan. 1996 Business Registration"&gt;アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記 (American Club Business Registration), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Jan. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the business registrations for the Oyama and Mooka schools, Sugimoto's name was the only one listed as being responsible for the school.&lt;ref&gt;アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記 (American Club Business Registration), Oyama Legal Records Office, November. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記 (American Club Business Registration), Mooka Legal Records Office, Nov. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1996 New Year's holidays, Konno fled.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In a letter to an American Club employee he claimed Sugimoto had threatened him and his (Konno's) wife with harassment from [[sound trucks in Japan|sound trucks]] operated by [[Uyoku dantai|right wing]] organizations if Konno tried to declare bankruptcy for the American Club.  In the letter Konno explained that because Sugimoto relied on the financial solvency of the American Club in order to obtain business loans, he (Sugimoto) could not afford to have the American Club be declared bankrupt by its own president.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konno, Isao, Letter to American Club, Feb. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yasukiyamauchi.webstarts"&gt;[http://yasukiyamauchi.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20111027071802 "AC Update: Threat"] ''Networking'', Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan, Mar. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Yasuki Yamauchi of [[Fukuoka City]], more than 1,000 kilometers from Utsunomiya, assumed legal responsibility for the school.&lt;ref name="Jan. 1996 Business Registration" /&gt;  According to a January 25, 1996 article on the American Club in the ''[[Asahi Shinbun]]'', a reporter from the newspaper made a call to the company's phone number in Fukuoka, but the person who answered the phone hung up on the reporter.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt; None of the teachers met Yamauchi, and with no one coming forward to take charge of the company, the teachers eventually stopped working for it. However, after the American Club stopped holding English classes in 1996, Sugimoto continued to run IBL (which was government-supported).&lt;ref&gt;インタナショナルビジネスランゲージ専門学校登記 (International Business and Language Senmon Gakkou Business Registration), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Dec. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second lawsuit over unpaid wages ==
A second lawsuit was filed by employees for three months in unpaid wages in January 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Court ruling, 宇都宮裁判所 (Utsunomiya Courthouse), Jan. 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; but none of the company's directors showed up in court and they ignored the subsequent court order to pay.  Eventually the employees received 80% of their back wages through the Labor Standards Office of the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;Payments through Labor Standards Office, Utsunomiya, Feb. 1996-Sep. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

With no income received after three months, many teachers returned to their home countries.  The total amount of delinquent wages owed all employees during the lawsuits totaled the equivalent of more than US$100,000. Also, students, who had paid in advance for as much as a year's worth of classes, lost an undetermined amount of money.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Court ruling, 宇都宮裁判所 (Utsunomiya courthouse), Jan. 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rent on the company’s spaces in branch schools, as well as rent on the teachers’ apartments (which had been deducted by the company from teachers’ pay) was as much as a year in arrears by the time of the second lawsuit.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;

== News reports ==
During the course of the second lawsuit, in January 1996, articles were run in the local edition of Japanese language newspapers: The [[Asahi Shinbun]]&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt; and the [[Shimotsuke Shinbun]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://acaux1.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20111027070101 「'''賃金支払い求め英会話学校訴え'''宇都宮地裁に講師ら」]''下野新聞'' (''Shimotsuke Shinbun''), Utsunomiya, Jan. 26, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acaux1.webstarts" /&gt;  Articles were also run by a local English language newspaper: Networking&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yasukiyamauchi.webstarts" /&gt; (now defunct).  The Networking articles outlined the root causes of the lawsuits (specifically the events leading up to the first lawsuit) and focused on the immigrant employees involved.  Later, several letters and essays MacLaren wrote were published in journals such as [[BusinessWeek]] and [[The Japan Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-12-07/corruption-is-de-rigueur-in-corporate-japan |title=Corruption is de rigueur in corporate Japan |publisher=''BusinessWeek'' |date=1998-12-07 |accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laborscofflaws.webstarts.com/human_rights.html "Labor scofflaws often go unpunished"] ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo, December 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Labor scofflaws still running amok," ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo, April 4, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/rc20111201a2.html |title=Don't count on a reformation |publisher=''The Japan Times''  |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whlreview.com/no-5.2/essay/DonMacLaren.pdf "The American Club and the Vermin of the Wilderness"] ''Wilderness House Literary Review'', summer, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pros and cons of Japan bashing," ''Mainichi Daily News'', Tokyo, October 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbash.webstarts.com/the_back_wages_of_sin.html "The back-wages of sin"] ''Mainichi Daily News'', Tokyo, April 19, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; MacLaren also provided The Japan Times with a list of organizations he had contacted in order to help resolve the pay problems, which the newspaper subsequently published on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;"Useful telephone numbers," ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo, 1997-2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
Though published news reports indicated the American Club was closed,&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Networking'', Utsunomiya, Feb. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and its directors ignored a court summons and subsequent court order to pay wages in the second lawsuit, its business registration indicates the company is still a legally operating entity, with 30 million yen in equity.&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"/&gt;

The business registration indicates that the [[Shimotsuke Shinbun]], a newspaper that ran stories on the lawsuits,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acaux1.webstarts"&gt;[http://acaux1.webstarts.com/shimotsuke_shinbun_23_feb_1996.html?r=20111027065015 「'''講師の賃金支払い命令'''英会話学校へ宇地裁」]''下野新聞'' (''Shimotsuke Shinbun''), Utsunomiya, Feb. 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; advertises American Club's services in its pages.&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"/&gt;

'''Aras Iskenderovich Agalarov''' ({{lang-az|Araz İsgəndər oğlu Ağalarov}}; {{lang-ru|link=no|Ара́з Исканде́рович Агала́ров}}; born 8 November 1955) is an Azerbaijani-Russian [[billionaire]] businessman, property developer, public figure, and author.

==Early life==
Born in [[Baku]], Agalarov was educated at the [[Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute]]. There, he studied computer engineering and was a member of the [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]] and Baku City Committee.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17&gt;{{cite news |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Neil |authorlink1=Neil MacFarquhar |title=A Developer and Kremlin Fixer With a Web of Trump Contacts |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/16/world/europe/aras-agalarov-trump-kremlin.html |accessdate=18 July 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 July 2017 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his family to Moscow in 1998, where he co-founded [[Crocus International]] alongside his father-in-law, [[Iosif Yevgenevich]], which specializes in [[trade fair]]s, where he still makes most of his money.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

==Career==
Agalarov then opened the first Crocus Inter store, which became a retail business that includes malls offering housewares.&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt; This moved him into [[property development]], where he built the [[Crocus City Mall]], the largest shopping centre in Moscow. Adjacent to this he then built the largest trade center in Russia on the outskirts of Moscow, [[Crocus Expo]], and has since developed a luxury housing development.  He has partnered with [[Robert De Niro]] in [[Nobu Matsuhisa]]'s two Moscow restaurants.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt;

In 2012, the {{ill|Crocus Group|ru}} built a new campus for the [[Far Eastern Federal University]] outside [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref name=NYT11july17 /&gt; Agalarov says he had to buy a larger Gulfstream jet to visit the site, where he spent $100&amp;nbsp;million of his own money on cost overruns on the $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion campus of 70 new building on [[Russky Island]] overlooking the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=NYT17july17 /&gt; He then won projects for a Moscow superhighway and two stadiums for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name=NYT17july17 /&gt;

In January 2013, Agalarov and his son visited [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, after [[Donald Trump]], the beauty pageant's owner, announced at [[Miss Universe 2012]] that the next competition would be hosted by Agalarov in Moscow.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17&gt;{{cite news |last1=Twohey |first1=Megan |last2=Eder |first2=Steve |title=How a Pageant Led to a Trump Son's Meeting With a Russian Lawyer |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/rob-goldstone-russia-trump.html |accessdate=11 July 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 July 2017 |page=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid Trump $20&amp;nbsp;million to host the pageant.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt; In November 2013, President [[Vladimir Putin]] awarded Agalarov the Russian [[Order of Honour (Russia)|Order of Honor]].&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; That month, Agalarov hosted [[Miss Universe 2013]] at his [[Crocus City Hall]].&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt;&lt;ref name="buzz"/&gt; Moreover, Agalarov's wife acted as a judge on the panel while his son was one of the performers.&lt;ref name="snyder103"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Timothy|authorlink=Timothy Snyder|title=[[The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America]]|date=2018|publisher=The Bodley Head|location=London, U.K.|isbn=978-1-847-92526-8|page=103|quote=He did the work for the Miss Universe pageant: it was hosted on his property, his wife was a judge, his son sang.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Gref]], who runs [[Sberbank of Russia]], Agalarov and his son hosted a dinner for Trump on the night of the pageant.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; While in Moscow, [[Phil Ruffin]], who is a partner in [[Trump International Hotel Las Vegas]], and Trump met with the Agalarov and his son at the Ritz-Carlton.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; Trump then appeared in a music video with Agalarov's son alongside many of the contestants.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; Trump and Agalarov planned on a $3&amp;nbsp;billion project, with state-owned Sberbank agreeing to provide 70% of the financing.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt;

Agalarov has served as a liaison between Trump and Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 June 2016 |title=Inside Trump's financial ties to Russia and his unusual flattery of Vladimir Putin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview, they once discussed the construction of [[business projects of Donald Trump in Russia|a Trump Tower in Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pismennaya |last2=Kravchenko |last3=Baker |first1=Evgenia |first2=Stepan |first3=Stephanie |title=The Day Trump Came to Moscow: Oligarchs, Miss Universe and Nobu |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-21/the-day-trump-came-to-moscow-oligarchs-miss-universe-and-nobu |website=[[Bloomberg LP]] |accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agalarov had also reportedly tried to set up a meeting between the two, but this was canceled due to Putin having to meet the Dutch royal couple at the time. Putin instead sent Trump a [[fedoskino miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/03/21/donald-trumps-kremlin-connecties-7466490-a1551176 |title=Interactief: zo lopen de lijnen van Trump naar Poetin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Kyrgyzstan]] signed a treaty with Russia that named Crocus Group as the single supplier of services to integrate into the [[Eurasian Economic Union]], avoiding competitive bidding on the $127&amp;nbsp;million deal.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt;

Agalarov's son, [[Emin Agalarov|Emin]], helped arrange Russian lawyer [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]]'s [[Trump campaign–Russian meeting|June 9, 2016 meeting]] with [[Donald Trump Jr.]], [[Jared Kushner]], and [[Paul Manafort]] in [[Trump Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Apuzzo |first1=Matt |last2=Becker |first2=Jo |last3=Goldman |first3=Adam |last4=Haberman |first4=Maggie |date=10 July 2017 |title=Trump Jr. Was Told in Email of Russian Effort to Aid Campaign |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=11 July 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/ct-russia-lawyer-donald-trump-jr-20170711-story.html |title=Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr., defends herself |first=Amanda |last=Erickson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the meeting, Agalarov wired $1.2 million to a bank in [[New Jersey]] controlled by Emin, a transfer which is being investigated by American law enforcement.&lt;ref name="buzz"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov |title=A Series Of Suspicious Money Transfers Followed The Trump Tower Meeting |first=Anthony |last=Cormier |first2=Jason |last2=Leopold |date=September 12, 2018 |publisher=[[BuzzFeed News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin said that after Trump won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election in 2016]], Trump sent them a handwritten note, saying he does not forget his friends.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt;

As of June 2017, he had an estimated net worth of US$1.91&amp;nbsp;billion, most of which is derived from his real estate ventures.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; In January 2017, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed him as the 51st [[List of Russian people by net worth|richest Russian]].&lt;ref name=forbesRU&gt;{{cite news |title=Араз Агаларов |url=http://www.forbes.ru/profile/aras-agalarov |accessdate=10 June 2017 |work=[[Forbes]] |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Agalarov is married and has two children. His son [[Emin Agalarov]] is a businessman and singer/songwriter. Emin was married to [[Leyla Aliyeva]], the daughter of the current [[President of Azerbaijan]], [[Ilham Aliyev]], until they divorced in May 2015. Agalarov has twin grandsons from his son's marriage. In July 2017, Agalarov put his mansion in [[Alpine, New Jersey]] up for sale for $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russian Oligarch With Ties to Trump Meeting Is Selling New Jersey Mansion |url=https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/aras-agalarov-selling-new-jersey-mansion/ |website=realtor.com News |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion eventually sold in November 2017 for $5.8 million.

The '''Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry''' (ABPI) is the [[trade association]] for over 120 companies in the UK producing prescription medicines for humans, founded in 1891. It is the British equivalent of America's [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America|PhRMA]], however the member companies research, develop, manufacture and supply 80% of the medicines [[Prescription Only Medicines|prescribed]] through the [[National Health Service]].

==History==
The organisation was founded in London in 1891 and originally known as the "Drug Club". A rival institution to represent wholesalers, the "Northern Wholesale Druggists' Association", was formed in 1902 and lasted until 1966.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Management and offices==
A board of management of members oversee the ABPI. The Board is made up of individuals who are elected by members to represent the industry and up to five people who are co-opted by the Board. Elections commence every January for elected seats to ensure that the Board is fully representative and has access to the broadest range of skills and expertise possible.

{{As of|2014}}, the Association's research director was Bina Rawal.&lt;ref name=piesing2014&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/23/tech-end-animals-drugs-testing | title=How tech could spell the end of animals in drugs testing | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=August 23, 2014 | author=Piesing, Mark | location=London | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABPI's head office is in London with three regional offices in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh.

==Membership==
ABPI membership is not open to individuals, only companies. Members fall into three categories:

* Full members who hold [[marketing authorization]] for, manufacture or supply [[prescription medicine]] for human use and undertake business in the UK
* Research affiliate members who carry out business in the UK and are involved in research and/or development of medicines for human use, but do not have a UK sales operation, for example [[Contract Research Organisation]]s (CROs) or [[Contract manufacturing organization]]s
* General affiliate members, who operate in the UK, have a business interest in the industry and will typically provide products or services to the industry, although not producing prescription medicines, for example law firms

==Functions==
The ABPI represents the views of the pharmaceutical industry to government and decision makers in the UK, i.e. is a [[lobbying organization]].

The organisation has six departments:
* Commercial
* Communications
* Legal
* Membership services
* [[NHS]] partnerships
* Research, medical and innovation

The medical and innovation department oversees complimentary resources for schools in UK to promote links between school science subjects and their applications in industrial research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpischools.org.uk/ ABPI resources for schools] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The department also runs a careers website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpicareers.org.uk ABPI Careers in the Pharmaceutical Industry] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The association sponsors booklets on a range of conditions, aimed at patients, carers and healthcare professionals.

The association has lobbied{{when|date=July 2017}} for the UK government to adopt the [[Directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions|European Union directive on biotechnology research]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Code of Practice==
The Code of Practice of the ABPI covers the promotion of medicines for prescribing to health professionals and administrative staff as well as the provision of information to the public about prescription only medicines in the UK. All ABPI member companies are obliged to comply with both the spirit and letter of the Code. The Code was first published in 1958 and undergoes revisions at least every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/thecode/InteractiveCode2016/Pages/default.aspx The Code of Practice of the ABPI] 2016 ABPI&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by the  Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority(PMCPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority] ABPI, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Criticism==
[[Ben Goldacre]] criticised the pharmaceutical industry in his 2012 book ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' as testing itself what it manufactures in "poorly designed trials, on hoplessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques that are flawed by design, in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments".&lt;ref name=statesman&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/sci-tech/2012/10/ben-goldacre-v-association-british-pharmaceutical-industry "Dr Ben Goldacre vs the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry"], The ABPI responds to Ben Goldacre's book Bad Pharma.''New Statesman'', 19 October 2012. accessed 4 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  
The ABPI responded that medicines were "tested against the most effective comparator where possible unless there is no current standard of care." 
Regarding "results that companies don’t like, [which] they are perfectly entitled to hide [..] from doctors and patients . . . academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure." the ABPI responded that it  did "... not seek to “hide” trial data" and was recognising there was "still work to be done in ensuring the publication of negative trial data within journals, and in ensuring greater transparency all round within the industry".&lt;ref name=statesman/&gt;

'''BP Studio''' is a [[Florence|Florentine]] fashion house that produces women's knitwear.

==History==
BP Studio was founded in 1959 as Creazioni BP Maglificio SpA by Carla Bandocci and changed its name to BP Studio Compagnia della Lana e del Cotone S.P.A. under the direction of Fernando Barontini (Ms. Bandocci's husband) in 1988. The company began in central Florence as a small producer of private label knits for department stores in the USA and Germany. They moved to the city's industrial periphery in the early 1980s to accommodate larger machinery and staff. At this time, they launched their own line of women's knitwear. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, BP Studio produced knits for [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]], [[Gucci]], [[Ferragamo]], [[Givenchy]], [[Proenza Schouler]] and The Row (couture label by [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]]). In 2007 the company chose to concentrate solely on its own label and scale back production to prototypes only. Production of BP Studio label clothing is carried out exclusively in Italy.

==Stores==
Company headquarters and factory outlet are located in Sesto Fiorentino. A boutique open to the public is located in central Florence on via della Vigna Nuova. Showrooms (for buyers only) are located in Milan, Rome, Torino, Treviso, Düsseldorf, Brussels, Barcelona and New York. BP Studio is carried by multi-label boutiques worldwide.

[[File:L-Biegemaschine.png|thumb|Manually driven bending brake]]
[[Image:Swing-folding-ani.gif|thumb|Cornice brake]]
[[File:Persen.JPG|thumb|Hydraulic press - 400T]]

A '''brake''' is a metalworking [[machine]] that allows the [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]] of [[sheet metal]]. A cornice brake only allows for simple bends and creases, while a box-and-pan brake also allows one to form box and pan shapes. It is also known as a '''bending machine''' or '''bending brake''' or in Britain as a '''sheet metal folder''' or just a '''folder'''.

==Description==
The brake consists of a flat surface onto which the material is placed, and a [[Clamp (tool)|clamping bar]] which will come down and hold the material firmly during the bend. This clamping action may be manual, automatic or operated using a foot pedal. The front, gate-like, plate of the machine is hinged and may be lifted, forcing the material extended over a straight edge to bend to follow the plate. 

The bends can be to any [[angle]] up to a practical limit of about 120 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, somewhat more in the case of a bar folder. If the area to be bent is narrow enough, a sharper bend (e.g., for a hem) can be made by inserting the bend under the clamping bar and lowering it.

===Box-and-pan brake===
In a box-and-pan brake (also known as a finger brake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation Structural Mechanic (H&amp;S) 3&amp;2 - How airplanes are built and how to maintain them|url=http://navyaviation.tpub.com/14018/css/Box-And-Pan-Brake-536.htm|page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the clamping bar includes several removable blocks, which may be removed and rearranged to permit bending of restricted areas of a piece of sheet metal or of already partially formed pieces.

After bending, a box or pan form is then completed by [[screw]], [[solder]], [[welding|weld]], [[rivet]], or other metal fixing process.

===Bar folder===
This is a simplified brake, usually much smaller than cornice or box-and-pan brakes. Typically, a single handle both clamps the workpiece and makes the bend, in a single motion, but the depth is usually much less than what a cornice or box-and-pan brake can handle.

===Press brake===
{{Main|Press brake}}

This is a more complex tool that forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching punch and die.

==Sizes==
Brakes come in sizes suitable for light [[aluminum]] or [[brass]] for small boxes and operated by hand, up to industrial sized and counterweighted hand operated or [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic machines]] suitable for large sheets of [[steel]].

'''Carlos Velasco Badion''' (August 16, 1935 – June 20, 2002) is a former [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[basketball]] player.&lt;ref name="SportsRef"&gt;{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ba/carlos-badion-1.html |title=Carlos Badion Olympic Results |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although born in [[Pampanga]], he grew up in [[Tondo, Manila]] where he started his checkered career playing in sandlot tournaments and for Abad Santos High School in Manila. At 5'10½" tall, he was first spotted in an interscholastic tournament by Valerio Lopez of [[Mapúa Institute of Technology|Mapua]] where he subsequently enrolled. He eventually shone in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]] and the [[Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association|MICAA]], playing for such teams as the Jacinto Rubber Shoes, [[Crispa Redmanizers|Crispa]] (where he became one of the pioneering members of that team) and YCO.

Known as the "Bad Boy" of [[Basketball in the Philippines|Philippine basketball]] because of his unforgiving and physical defense, Badion popularized the moves that came to be known as the "bicycle drive" and the "jackknife layup," moves which young players tried to imitate during the 1950s. In the commercial leagues, Badion played for the original batch of the [[Crispa Redmanizers]] in the Businessman's Athletic Association (BAA) and the [[YCO Painters]] in the [[Manila Industrial Commercial Athletic Association]] (MICAA).

He starred for the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine national team]] in two [[Summer Olympics|Olympic tournaments]] and the [[1958 Asian Games]] where he and his teammates won the gold medal. He was also a vital cog of the national team that finished seventh in a 15-nation men's basketball tournament in the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]],&lt;ref name="SportsRef"/&gt; playing alongside the likes of [[Carlos Loyzaga]], [[Antonio Genato]], [[Ramon Campos Jr.]], [[Ramon Manulat]], [[Martin Urra]] and [[Mariano Tolentino]]. Voted Mr. Basketball by the [[Philippine Sportswriters Association]] eventually made a movie with the same title together with actor Bob Soler in 1957, Badion was also a mainstay of the team that won the inaugural staging of the [[Asian Basketball Confederation Championship]] held in [[Manila]] in 1960 together with Loyzaga, [[Kurt Bachmann]], [[Loreto Carbonell]], and [[Eduardo Lim]]. He was named to the All-Star team with Loyzaga and [[FIBA Asia Cup MVP|Most Valuable Player of the said tournament]].

Unfortunately, Badion suffered a serious knee injury during the Philippines' first-round game against [[Uruguay national basketball team|Uruguay]] in the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]]&lt;ref name="SportsRef"/&gt; which ultimately forced him into early retirement. He then went into a number of business ventures after retiring and even once became the [[customs]] coordinator for Elizalde and Company, Inc. He started his coaching in 1975, leading the [[Mapúa Cardinals]] to the NCAA title and the [[University of Santo Tomas|UST]] women’s basketball team to the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines|UAAP]] title. He also handled the [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Glowing Goldies]] in the UAAP and the Army Jungle Fighters in the [[Philippine Basketball League]].

Badion died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on June 20, 2002.

'''Cash cow''' is business [[jargon]] for a business venture that generates a steady return of profits that far exceed the outlay of cash required to acquire or start it. Many businesses attempt to create or acquire such ventures, since they can be used to boost a company's overall income and to support less profitable endeavors.

==Origins==
The term cash cow is a metaphor for a "dairy cow" used on farms to produce milk, offering a steady stream of income with little maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/milch%20cow)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Cash cows are products or services that have achieved market leader status, provide positive cash flows and a [[return on assets]] (ROA) that exceeds the market growth rate. The idea is that such products produce profits long after the initial investment has been recouped. By generating steady streams of income, cash cows help fund the overall growth of a company, their positive effects spilling over to other business units. Furthermore, companies can use them as leverage for future expansions, as lenders are more willing to lend money knowing that the debt will be serviced.

Cash cows can be also used to buy back shares already on the market or increase the [[dividend]]s paid to shareholders.

They usually bring in cash for years, until new technology or shifting market preferences renders them obsolete.

=== Disadvantages ===
Cash cows can act as [[barriers to entry]] to the market for new products, as entrants need to invest heavily in order to achieve the [[brand awareness]] required to capture a significant share of the market away from the dominant players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/cash-cow-in-marketing-definition-matrix-examples.html#lesson|title=Cash Cow in Marketing: Definition, Matrix &amp; Examples|work=Study.com|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A higher pay out rate of earning in the form of [[share repurchase]] or cash/share dividend might also increase the risk of future dividend cut and is an indication of lack of growth opportunity.

Since the business unit can maintain profits with little maintenance or investment, a cash cow can also be used to describe a profitable but complacent company or business unit.

In his book ''[[The Innovator's Dilemma]]'', [[Clayton M. Christensen]] argues that listening to existing customers' concerns can prevent a highly successful business from innovating, resulting in smaller competitors eventually producing [[disruptive innovation]]s.  This sentiment is expressed in the business aphorism "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses", which is misattributed to [[Henry Ford]], a pioneering manufacturer of the [[automobile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast Henry Ford, Innovation, and That “Faster Horse” Quote]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Successful products that satisfy the criteria for cash cows include: the [[Ford Transit]] and Pickup Trucks, [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]], [[Coca-Cola]], the [[iPod]] and [[iPhone]] lines. Airport hangars that have reverted to airport ownership are often referred to as cash cows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free-management-ebooks.com/faqst/boston-05.htm|title=Boston Matrix - Cash Cows|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cashin' In''''' is an American [[business]] analysis program, the fourth and last show of ''[[The Cost of Freedom]]'' business block, on Saturdays at 11:30 am ET on the [[Fox News Channel]]. [[Eric Bolling]] hosted from January 2013 until August 2017.  The show was originally hosted by FNC senior business correspondent [[Terry Keenan]] until her departure from the network September 2009. [[Cheryl Casone]] hosted from September 2009 until January 2013.

After taking over the hosting duties, Bolling announced a new direction for ''Cashin' In'': "While we work hard, pay our taxes and just try to make ends meet, law makers from DC to state houses across America are "Cashin' In". We will use this show as a megaphone, calling out Washington for the waste, fraud and abuse of our tax dollars." Bolling delivered this new message at the end of the January 26, 2013 episode. On September 8, 2017, Eric Bolling was fired by Fox News Channel.

In December 2017, it was announced that the ''Cost of Freedom'' block will be replaced by a new two-hour show, ''[[Cavuto Live]]'', hosted by [[Neil Cavuto]], beginning on January 20, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Fox News Channel Taps Neil Cavuto to Anchor Live Two-Hour Saturday News Program|url=http://press.foxnews.com/2017/12/fox-news-channel-taps-neil-cavuto-to-anchor-live-two-hour-saturday-news-program/|agency=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=December 13, 2017|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/neil-cavuto-anchor-saturday-morning-two-hours-fox-news-channel-1202226128/ |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=Neil Cavuto To Anchor Two Hour ‘Cavuto Live’ On Fox News Channel’s Saturdays |date=December 13, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Segments==
* Stock Smarts: The opening of the show starts with a debate over what is going to possibly happen in the next week in the stock market, based on headlines and history, and how it will affect one's bottom line.
* Best Bets: "Best Bets" opens the floor to the panelists to choose any number of stocks which they believe could go up and "make you money".
* Stock of the Week: The "Stock of the Week" is the choice that the panel believes will "take off in the next five trading days."
* Money Mail: The closing of the show usually ends with a segment dedicated to the e-mails sent into the show, asking about stocks people own or if a specific stock is worth buying or avoiding.

==''Cashin' In'' Challenge==
Every year the show has been on the air, a "''Cashin' In'' Challenge" between the regular panelists has been held. The Challenge's rules are:
* Each player has $10,000 in play money
* Each player can hold as much cash as they like
* Each portfolio can have up to five different securities
* Each stock and bond transaction will carry a $15 brokerage fee
* There will be no transaction fee for funds, but loads and expenses will apply

For the last three years of the contest, [[Dagen McDowell]] (who is not a professional money manager, unlike her counterparts) has come up on top of all the others in the end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">A '''channel partner''' is a company that partners with a manufacturer or producer to market and sell the manufacturer's products, services, or technologies. This is usually done through a [[co-branding]] relationship. Channel partners may be distributors, vendors, retailers, consultants, systems integrators (SI), technology deployment consultancies, and [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs) and other such organizations.

== Managed services channel partner ==
The [[Managed services|Managed Services]] Channel Program (MSCP) defines managed services based on market and industry [[best practice]]s, validates a provider’s managed service against those standards, and offers escalating rewards tied to the value delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Channel partner programs|url=https://www.channelinstitute.com/successful-channel-partner-programs |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outsourcing channel partner ==
The Outsourcing Channel Program is designed for partners who are taking over management of customer assets for multiple years across multiple technologies, either at the customer site or at another location like a remote [[data center]].

== Referral partner ==
The referral partner is any individual, usually a professional consultant, existing customer, or sales professional, who can refer new customers to the manufacturer in any number of ways.  Increasingly, companies are taking advantage of this type of partner as more and more individuals find work independently consulting and referring manufacturer solutions to their clients—which in essence provides a low cost way for manufacturers to manage their sales efforts.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Partner relationship management (PRM) software ==
With the increased reliance on the channel to drive sales efforts, technology has emerged to help support these efforts. [[Partner relationship management]] (PRM) is the term most widely used to refer to this type of technology.

'''Charles L. Andes''' or '''Chuck Andes''' (1930 – August 17, 2006) was an American businessman who later in his career made contributions to [[civic service]], most notably as chairman of the [[Franklin Institute]] science museum in [[Philadelphia]]. He received the [[William Penn Award]], Philadelphia’s highest honor for business leaders contributing to civic service. Andes was born and raised in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania|Swarthmore]], Pennsylvania where his father was a prominent home builder. He attended [[Swarthmore College]] and earned a bachelor's degree from [[Syracuse University]].

==Background==
In 1952, he joined [[Adtech Industries]], a direct marketing distributor of specialty advertising products, then became national sales manager of that company in 1956 and its president in 1961.

Andes joined his friend [[Joseph Segel]] at The [[Franklin Mint]] (a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] producing coinage) in 1967, becoming its first executive vice-president. In 1970, he was named president of its US division, and Franklin Mint stock began to be actively traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. When Segel retired in 1973, Andes became CEO and chairman of Franklin Mint Corporation, which by then had expanded internationally and was also producing coin-of-the-realm for several foreign countries.

Under Andes’ direction, sales at The Franklin Mint grew steadily, due largely to a program of product diversification from [[coin]]s and [[medal]]s to [[porcelain]], [[crystal]], die-cast collectibles and leather-bound books, while still maintaining its status as the world’s largest [[private mint]].

In 1981, Franklin Mint Corporation was acquired by [[Warner Communications]] (the predecessor of [[Time Warner Corporation]]). Andes continued as CEO of Franklin Mint Corporation until 1986.

In 1986, The Franklin Institute, America’s oldest science museum, was experiencing attendance and financial problems. Andes, who had previously served on its board, agreed to become its full-time CEO and chairman on a pro bono basis, and he promptly launched the $70 million  "Futures Center" expansion program for the institute. Largely through his efforts the necessary funding was raised and the Futures Center was completed in the spring of 1990. Attendance increased from 500,000 to over a million annually, and the Futures Center received outstanding reviews from around the world. Andes also initiated the [[Bower Awards]] at The Franklin Institute, which are considered by many to be America’s most prestigious awards for achievements in science.

From 1992 to 1994, Andes served as Ranking Republican Member of The [[Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority]] (PICA), the state agency that was charged with financial oversight of the City of Philadelphia and with selling $2 billion of bonds to finance operations in support of Mayor [[Ed Rendell]]’s program to bail out the City.&lt;ref&gt;
Biography, Charles L. Andes, p2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, after he retired as chairman emeritus of the Franklin Institute, Andes was asked to serve as CEO and Chairman of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], an acclaimed art museum and America’s oldest and most distinguished art school. Andes served for two years in that position.

In 1994, Andes also became the first president of the [[Eastern Technology Council]], an association developed to assist technology companies to develop business opportunities and raise capital. Andes grew the Council from 150 companies to over 1,000 in three years. From 1993 to 1996, Andes participated in venture capital activities with [[Safeguard Scientifics]], founding several companies and serving as a member of the [[Executive Committee of Technology Leaders]] Venture Capital Funds I and II

After 1997, Andes assisted many aspiring entrepreneurs and became an investor in seven new enterprises, serving as chairman of two them, [[Network Direct]] and [[Eagle Email]].

During his career Andes served on a number of corporate boards, including [[Fidelity Trust Company|Fidelity Bank]] and [[National Media Corporation]], and non-profit boards including the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]], [[American Music Theater Festival]], [[National Constitution Center]], [[National Epilepsy Foundation]], [[United Nations Association of the USA]], the [[Pennsylvania Ballet]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], the [[Union League]], [[WHYY-TV]]/[[WHYY-FM]] and the [[Wistar Institute]].

==Death==
Andes is remembered by his family and friends for his keen sense of humor. In talking about the success he realized at the Franklin Mint and the Franklin Institute, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a sense of mission and excitement at the Mint, and it was the same thing here at the Institute. We were banded together by a common purpose—and by the sheer terror of it all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He died on August 17, 2006 in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]]. He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Dorothea ("Dottebob"), four daughters, Elizabeth Bell, Susan Frost, Karen Andes and Page Morocco, and five grandchildren.

==Awards==
Over the years, Andes received recognition and awards from many organizations including Man of the Year from [[Advertising Specialty Guild of America]], Annual Entrepreneurs Award from the [[Area Council for Economic Education]], CEO of the year from ''[[Financial World]]'' Magazine, Exemplar Award from the [[NAACP]], Civic Achievement Award from the [[American Jewish Committee]], Annual Achievers Award from [[Wheels, Inc.]], Citations of Merit from The City of Philadelphia and the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]], [[Good Scout Award]] from [[Boy Scouts of America]], Entrepreneur of the Year from [[Ernst and Young]] and [[Merrill Lynch]], Ten Most Influential Philadelphians Award from ''[[Philadelphia Magazine]]'', and the William Penn Award from the [[Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce]].

'''Jan Christer Ericsson''' (27 March 1942 – 28 June 2016) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] businessman. He developed a method for loading of containers, in which he tried unsuccessfully to interest his then-bosses at Stena Line.&lt;ref name="expressen.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/gt/sa-blev-christer-ericsson-miljardar/|title=Så blev Christer Ericsson miljardär|language=Swedish|publisher=expressen.se|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his own business, Container Safe J C Ericsson AB, later known as Consafe, he developed his own ideas and was initially successful in [[Ship transport|sea transportation]].&lt;ref name="expressen.se"/&gt; In 1987, he published a book entitled ''Utan omsvep: mitt berikande liv med Consafe''.&lt;!-- A link is found under the Bibliography headline --&gt;

In the late 1970s, Consafe started to manufacture houses and service platforms for offshore businesses in co-operation with Svenska Varv. The business expanded, but went into [[bankruptcy]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="expressen.se"/&gt;

Ericsson had already, before the bankruptcy, started to invest in other businesses. He was a major shareholder in the car dealership Philipson Bil and also invested in the oil and gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/1442384/ex-prosafe-investor-found-dead|title=Ex-Prosafe investor 'found dead' |last=Marshall |first=Steve |publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003145912/http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/1442384/ex-prosafe-investor-found-dead|archivedate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ericsson presented an episode of the [[Sveriges Radio]] show ''[[Sommar (radio program)|Sommar i P1]]'' on the 6 July 2006,&lt;ref name="aftonbladet.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article23082193.ab|title=Svensk miljardär saknad till havs|publisher=aftonbladet.se|language=Swedish|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he spoke about his life and business career.&lt;ref name="aftonbladet.se"/&gt;

==Disappearance==

&lt;!-- needs more exmaples, should cover Wallenberg,  Maxwell etc, fraud, loss of control, breaking the connection between ownership and management --&gt;
'''Cross ownership''' is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Heavy cross ownership is referred to as circular ownership.

In the US, "cross ownership" also refers to a type of investment in different mass-media properties in one market.

==Cross ownership of stock==
Some countries where cross ownership of shares is a major part of the business culture are:
* [[Japan]]
* [[Germany]]

Positives of cross ownership:
* Closely ties each business to the economic destiny of its business partners
* Promotes a slow rate of economic change

Cross ownership of shares is criticized for:
* Stagnating the economy
* Wasting capital that could be used to improve productivity
* Expanding economic downturns by preventing reallocation of capital

A major factor in perpetuating cross ownership of shares is a high [[capital gains tax]] rate.  A company has less incentive to sell cross owned shares if taxes are high because of the immediate reduction in the value of the assets.

For example, a company owns $1000 of stock in another company that was originally purchased for $200.  If the capital gains tax rate is 25% (like Germany) and the company sells the stock,
the company has $800 which is 20 percent less than before it sold the stock.

Long term cross ownership of shares combined with a high capital tax rate greatly increases periods of asset deflation both in time and in severity.

==Media cross ownership==
{{main|Media cross-ownership in the United States}}

Cross ownership also refers to a type of media ownership in which one type of communications (say a newspaper) owns or is the sister company of another type of medium (such as a radio or TV station). One example is ''[[The New York Times]]'' 's former ownership of [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] Radio and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s similar relationship with WGN Radio ([[WGN-AM]]) and Television ([[WGN-TV]]).

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] generally does not allow cross ownership, to keep from one license holder having too much local media ownership, unless the license holder obtains a waiver, such as [[News Corporation]] and the [[Tribune Company]] have in New York.

The mid-1970s cross-ownership guidelines grandfathered already-existing crossownerships, such as ''Tribune''-WGN, ''New York Times''-WQXR and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' ownership of [[WPIX]] Television and Radio.

'''Doron Shmueli''' ({{lang-he|דורון שמואלי}}, born 5 October 1954) is a former [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for Likud between November 1998 and June 1999.

==Biography==
Shmueli attended [[Meir Shfeya]] agricultural high school, before gaining an LLB at university.

Between 1974 and 1977 he was a member of the [[Golan Heights|Golan]] [[Israeli settlement|Settlements]] Committee, before serving as treasurer and co-ordinator of [[Ein Vered]] moshav between 1977 and 1984. He has also served as treasurer of [[Eliad, Golan Heights|Eliad]] moshav.

From 1984 until 1992 he owned a company importing and exporting agricultural supplies, before becoming director-general of [[Tzomet]] in 1992, a position he held until 1996. Between 1996 and 1998 he worked as chairman of the Citrus Fruit Marketing Board.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|1996 Knesset elections]] he missed out on a seat, but entered the Knesset on 30 November 1998 as a replacement for [[Pini Badash]], who following a new law, had to resign in order to remain head of [[Omer, Israel|Omer]] local council. Following the split of the [[Likud]]-[[Gesher (political party)|Gesher]]-Tzomet alliance, Shmueli represented Likud. He was placed thirty-second on the Likud list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|1999 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.jpost.com/1999/Supplements/Elections99/politicalblocs/partylists.shtml Parties and Lists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418024116/http://info.jpost.com/1999/Supplements/Elections99/politicalblocs/partylists.shtml |date=April 18, 2001 }} The Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt; but the party won only 19 seats and Shmueli lost his seat.

In 2001 he was appointed agricultural advisor to Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]].

== Early life ==
Tiu was born in [[Iloilo City]], [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]] to Luz Tiu (née Hupan) and Fernando Tiu, a wealthy family of Chinese descent, who were successful, self-made traders who operated a candy store in Iloilo, throughout the 1950s'''.''' Felix's grandparents were Chinese immigrants, with ancestral ties from the Fujian province, who migrated to the Philippines due to business opportunities in the 1900s.

Tiu's father's business shut down because of mismanagement due to [[overexpansion]], resulting in Felix, the eldest of four, to drop out of private school in 1974 to assist in the re-enterprising of his father's business.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/592238/eon-groups-felix-tiu-dont-work-money-let-money-work-you|title=Eon Group's Felix Tiu: 'Don't work for money, let money work for you'|last=|first=|date=|work=philstar.com|access-date=2017-03-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, at 23, he married Bernadette Tiu, (née Chavez) and a fast growing family did not come far after: by 1987, Felix and Bernadette already had 4 children. During the early years of assistance in the restoration of his father's business, Felix and his wife, Bernadette, having to provide for their young family, sold homemade [[Tamarind|tamarind balls]], [[Halo-halo|halo halo]] and other local sweets on the streets of Iloilo City&lt;!-- cite needed --&gt;, to cope with financial struggles after the disperse of his father's fortune.

== Career ==

=== 1980s-2000s: Early Career ===
Upon the aftermath of the failed reestablishment of his father's confectionery business, Tiu and his wife founded their own trading company, in 1985, [http://www.yellow-pages.ph/business/goldstar-phil-traders-bakery-supplies Goldstar Philippine Traders], selling oil, flour, [[margarine]], and other baking goods using his savings of 10,000₱ from previous business ventures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Felix opened [https://www.emis.com/php/company-profile/PH/Eon_Philippines_Industries_Corp__2341988.html Eon Philippines Industries Corporation], in 1995, which manufactured various local staples like [[bihon]] and [[sotanghon]] as well as flavoured juices, with [[lollipop]]s being the main product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This venture was established as a reminiscent to Felix's father's business&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, then in 1998, Felix opened a travel and tourism agency called [http://eontraveltours.com/ Eon Travel and Tours] in SM City Iloilo.

In 1991, with a vision to provide "market vendors a chance at their businesses"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to support other local businesses, Tiu ventured into low interest lending and in 5 years has created a "very modest lending portfolio".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 2000s-2010s: ''Eon Group of Companies'' and Local Ventures ===
At the turn of the millennium, in 2000, Tiu purchased a property and constructed the [https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-s1-g298466-d1603495-Reviews-Eon_Centennial_Plaza_Hotel-Iloilo_City_Iloilo_Province_Panay_Island_Visayas.html Eon Centennial Plaza Hotel], which is now known as "one of the leading business hotels in the heart of Iloilo"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, accommodating restaurants such as Frances.

Eon Realty Development Corporation started in 2001 and has built over 3,000 homes to date, with families in the low-medium income bracket as their target market. As of 2017, they encompass over 12 housing and [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] projects and became the first company to build on [[townhouses]] in Iloilo&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

In 2004, Eon Group of Companies branched out into developing neighboring islands, launching Guimaras Memorial Park in [[Guimaras]], Philippines.

In 2006, Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center was erected in [[Jaro, Iloilo City]], which housed a convention center to hold up to 3,000 people&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.exploreiloilo.com/stay/info/centennial-resort-hotel-and-convention-center/|title=Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center|work=Explore Iloilo|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [http://www.exploreiloilo.com/ Exploreiloilo.com] has named Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center "a first class year-round family destination"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The announcement of Waterworld Iloilo resulted in the revision of the convention center, leading the enterprise to change its name to Centennial Resort Hotel and Waterpark. 

=== 2010s-present: ''Waterworld'' Franchise and Nation-wide Ventures ===
In 2013, Felix opened the first ''paninda and paluto'' style restaurant in Iloilo, Merkado Seafood Restaurant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iloilometropolitantimes.com/merkado-the-dampa-of-iloilo/|title=Merkado, the dampa of Iloilo {{!}} Iloilo Metropolitan Times|last=Khariza|first=Sofia Joy|date=November 10, 2013|website=www.iloilometropolitantimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' where an inclusive wet market allows fresh seafood, meat and vegetables to be purchased, with the customer deciding how it is to be cooked. Due to [[Typhoon Yolanda]]'s impact on [[Panay|Panay']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s fresh seafood supply, infection led to the restaurant closing its doors on November that year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iloilometropolitantimes.com/frances-tiu-and-waterworld-keeping-the-family-business-on-track/|title=Frances Tiu and Waterworld: Keeping the family business on track {{!}} Iloilo Metropolitan Times|website=www.iloilometropolitantimes.com|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Waterworld Iloilo was announced in 2015, to replace the convention center constructed under the then-named, Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center in [[Jaro, Iloilo City]]. It opened on December 16, 2017 and became Philippines' first solar-powered waterpark&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; . It comprises over 20 different slides and rides, 2 pools, 8 luxury cabanas, 3 restaurants, a [[Gift shop|souvenir and novelty shop]], and a [[lazy river]] which surrounds the perimeter of the park. Waterworld Iloilo has been featured in various media outlets such as Panay News, The Guardian, The Iloilo Metropolitan Times, Island Living and Hugging Horizons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hugginghorizons.com/travel-2/waterworld-iloilo-grown-ups-playground-rates-virtual-tour/|title=WATERWORLD ILOILO: a Grown ups Playground (Rates + Virtual Tour)|date=2016-12-04|work=Hugging Horizons|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Due to the overwhelming success of Waterworld Iloilo&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, Felix Tiu announced that the Eon Group of Companies will expand the Waterworld franchise into Mandaue, Cebu. The project, known as Waterworld Cebu, will be valued at over 350 million pesos, making it one of the most expensive waterparks in the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripzilla.ph/waterworld-cebu-complex/3839|title=A New Exciting Waterworld Complex Set to Open in Cebu Soon|website=www.tripzilla.ph|language=en-PH|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only will it be one of the largest waterparks in the Philippines, the 3-hectare project will boast as a major entertainment complex, housing a large amusement park, and resort. It is set to open late 2019.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''German company law''' (''Gesellschaftsrecht'') is an influential legal regime for companies in Germany. The primary form of company is the public company or ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]'' (AG). A private company with limited liability is known as a ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' (GmbH). A partnership is called a ''[[Kommanditgesellschaft]]'' (KG).

==History==
In Germany, through most of the 19th century the ''[[Kommanditgesellschaft]]'' (''société en commandite'' in France) was the typical form of business organisation. A "KG" had at least one member with unlimited liability, but other investors' liability was limited to their contribution. A special concession was not required for setting up this company. The first German public company statute was the Prussian Act of 1794. In 1861 the ''Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch'' or the General Commercial Code for all of Germany, as well as Austria, was enacted, which devoted a section to joint stock companies. This allowed incorporation with limited liability. Companies would be constituted with a single [[board of directors]], though they had the option of a two-tiered board system, involving shareholders appointing a supervisory board, which could in turn elect the management board.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch]] §225&lt;/ref&gt;

There were updates to the ''Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch'' in the ''Aktiennovelle von 1870'' (New Company Act 1870)&lt;ref&gt;C Windbichler, ''Gesellschaftsrecht'' (22nd ed. Beck 2009) 298, stating the law was concerned mostly with formal requirements for company structures. The following "Gründerzeit" (period of company foundations) saw a lot of abuse since there were few protections for shareholders or creditors over how their money was used.&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;On the latter, see ''Gesetz betreffend die Kommenditgesellschaften auf Aktien und die Aktiengesellschaften'' (AktG) v. 31.7.1884 (RGBl. S. 123-70), which served as a model in Japan&lt;/ref&gt; The 1884 reform mandated that companies have a two-tier board, with the justification that free registration rather than a system of state concession meant a supervisory board was needed to take over the state's monitoring role.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Handelsgesetzbuch]] §209; and see P Hommelhoff and W Schubert, ''Hundert Jahre Modernes Aktienrecht'' (1985); KJ Hopt, 'Zur Funktion des Aufsichtsrats im Verhältnis von Industrie und Bankensystem' or 'Law and the Formation of the Big Enterprises in the 19th and 20th Centuries' in N Horn &amp; J Kocka (eds) (1979) 227&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the supervisory board were not allowed to serve on the management board. However, shareholders could still directly elect management board members if they so wished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Handelsgesetzbuch]] § 236&lt;/ref&gt; Further reforms led to the ''Handelsgesetzbuch'' of 1897, but without changing the basic structure.&lt;ref&gt;C Windbichler, ''Gesellschaftsrecht'' (22nd ed. Beck 2009) 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aktiengesellschaft==
{{Main|Aktiengesetz}}

===Shareholder rights===
Shareholders have a list of specific rights allocated to them by the [[Aktiengesetz]], although this is circumscribed by the general principle in AktG §119(2) that issues concerning ‘business leadership’ can only be determined by the executive directors. The voting rights of shareholders are heavily influenced by the banks. Banks appropriate the votes of people who must deposit their share certificates in banks’ accounts. The notable rights for shareholders are as follows

*the right to vote, with one share one vote. Preferential shares without voting rights can, however, be issued.
*to call a meeting with 20% of the votes, AktG §122
*a non-binding say on pay, AktG §120
*changes to the constitution by a three quarter majority, AktG §179
*the right to vote or veto ‘substantial’ property transactions. There is no fixed percentage for this doctrine, which was developed by the courts, but it will be triggered if the management attempts to sell off assets that compose a large or important part of the business, ''Holzmüller'' (1982) BGHZ 83, 122.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Bundesgerichtshof]]'' held that shareholders must approve a sale of assets amounting to 80% of the company's value.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the use of profits from the accounts, AktG §119(1)(ii)
*appointment of auditors, AktG §119(1)(iv and vii)
*raising or reducing capital, AktG §119(1)(vi)
*winding up, AktG §119(1)(viii)

There is no right to control political donations (cf AktG §58).

===Directors’ duties===
German directors have similar duties to most jurisdictions, primarily a duty of loyalty, and a duty to exercise competent judgment. First, the duty of loyalty, or Treuepflicht, derives from the good faith provision in the civil code ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] §242).

Second, there is a particular prohibition on taking corporate opportunities and a duty of secrecy, AktG §93(1).

Third, there is a specific prohibition on competing with the company, AktG §88.

Fourth, recently introduced was a ‘business judgment rule’. A new provision, AktG §93(1) says, ‘executive members have to exercise the care of an ordinary and conscientious business leader’.

===Derivative litigation===
While German corporate theory posits that the supervisory board should do the work of protecting minority shareholders, and is expected to do the litigating against the executive (AktG §111), minority shareholders may also bring claims against directors. Under AktG §147, ten per cent of shareholders, or those with over €1,000,000 may bring a claim against a director for breach of duty. They will have a special representative appointed to carry out the litigation and the company will pay the costs. There is also a procedure for one per cent of shareholders, or those with an interest over €100,000 to bring a claim (AktG §148). Here the court is more stringent, and like the derivative claim in the UK can strike out an application if it finds reasons for it are lacking. There have been cases where the courts have held that majority shareholders owe a duty of good faith to minority shareholders, but also that minorities who can block actions by the company owe duties to the majority.

===Corporate governance===
Analogous to the [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], which is also a ‘comply or explain’ law, is the Deutsche Corporate Governance Kodex (AktG §161). It replicates a lot of rules already found in the Aktiengesetz.

*AktG §87, requires that pay for the executive is set by the supervisory board. In 2009, this was amended  so that (1) pay could not exceed the normal level without special justifications, and (2) if performance had deteriorated, executive pay could be reduced to an equitable level.
*AtkG §120(4) was added so that the general meeting of shareholders (not employees!) have a non-binding say on pay.
*AktG §113 says that the pay for supervisory board members can either be fixed by the company constitution, and changed by ordinary majority vote, or be determined on a resolution of the shareholders.
*AktG §119(1)(iv and vii) auditors are appointed by the shareholders. Apart from that the supervisory board should also have an audit committee, which handles the audit business.

===Employees===
{{main|Codetermination}}
Under the [[Mitbestimmungsgesetz]], in companies with over 2000 workers just under half the seats on a supervisory board are selected by the workers. In companies with over 500 staff one third of the supervisory must be composed of employee directors under the ''[[Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz]]''. With under 500 staff, there is no automatic right of employees to board representation. However, any workplace with over five people allow workers various rights through elected [[works councils]], and if the business has over 20 staff, employees may force the management into arbitration over redundancies.

===Directors===
{{Main|Vorstand|Aufsichtsrat}}
A large German company is required to have a two tier board system. The basic difference to the law, for instance, in the [[UK]], [[Sweden]] or the [[US]], is that an executive directors cannot be removed directly by the members of the company (i.e. shareholders typically, and sometimes employees) but only by a second tier "supervisory" board. The [[Aktiengesetz]] §76 the executive's primary role is to manage the company, or look after its day-to-day affairs. By contrast under [[Aktiengesetz]] §111 the supervisory board's role is stated to be to "supervise" (''überwachen''). Originally a supervisory board was a default requirement, so companies could choose whether to have one or not. The practice became utilised in most companies by the 1920s, however in the [[Aktiengesetz 1937]], German law made it a requirement to have a supervisory board. This remained in the post-war reforms.
 
Members of the executive ("Vorstand", often translated as ‘management board’) are generally appointed for five years. They can be removed by the supervisory board, but only for a "good reason" (AktG §84(3) ''ein wichtiger Grund''). This includes a vote of no confidence by the shareholders. However, the supervisory board is not bound to act upon a shareholder vote. Within the executive although all members will generally be appointed by the supervisory board, in companies with over 2000 people there must be one ‘staff director’, Arbeitsdirektor,  on the executive who is intended to hold the confidence of the employees, under [[Mitbestimmungsgesetz 1976]] §33. Typically this will mean that staff director is nominated by the unions, though no formal procedure is prescribed.

In companies with over 2000 employees, the supervisory board ("Aufsichtsrat") is composed of half shareholder appointees (Aktiengesetz §§102 and 119) who can only remove the supervisory board members on a 75% vote (AktG §§102-103). The other half is elected by the employees, though in companies with over 8000 employees the employees can let the unions vote on their behalf (Mitbestimmungsgesetz §§7 and 9). However, one chairperson with the casting vote invariably is chosen by shareholders. Initially both the shareholder and employee sides are meant to reach a consensus on the chair. If they cannot reach consensus, it will go to arbitration, and if a solution is still not reached, the shareholders get to choose (Mitbestimmungsgesetz §27).

'''Gerry Gannon'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/riches-of-the-nama-wives-who-hold-the-purse-strings-2474212.html |title=Riches of the Nama wives who hold the purse strings |website=Independent.ie |date=2010-12-26 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Irish builder and property developer since the 1980s. Gannon played a significant and leading role in the build-up and demise of the [[Irish property bubble]].{{Fact|date=October 2011}} Gannon was at the centre{{Fact|date=October 2011}} of the [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy]], which was a contributing element in the development of the [[post-2008 Irish banking crisis]].

==Early and personal life==
Gannon is a native of [[County Roscommon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/gannons-wife-faces-forced-move-of-property-to-nama-2470024.html |title=Gannon's wife faces forced move of property to NAMA |website=Independent.ie |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married to Margaret, the couple had one son and four daughters. Their daughter Emma died aged 6, whilst their adult son Peter died on 8 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/developers-shock-at-sons-sudden-death-29402456.html |title=Developer's shock at son's sudden death |website=Independent.ie |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannon started his builder activities in the 1980s in [[London]] while working for his father's construction firm. Gannon and [[Michael Smurfit]] jointly owned the Kildare Hotel and Golf Club, known as the [[K Club]], until Smurfit purchased Gannon's 49% stake for €40 million in 2012 via NAMA.

==Building activity==
In 1986, through the firm Structural Developments Ltd build at Castle Village in Celbridge.{{What|date=October 2011}} In 1988 through another firm – Noteworthy Limited – with partner Michael Anglim, Gannon planned to build 710 houses at Brackenstown close to Swords. At the time it was one of the largest schemes submitted to Dublin County Council. Permission was granted for the scheme in October 1988. The scheme at the time was said to be worth upwards of £40 million. The site on which the houses were built was bought by Noteworthy Ltd as a parcel of land in 1987. The land was zoned for residential purposes in 1983 against the recommendation of the Council’s planning officials. In April 1990, Gannon, now trading through Gannon Homes, sought permission for a £70 m residential scheme and a shopping centre on a 110-acre site on the Malahide road. The scheme involved 915 houses on a 95-acre site fronting the Malahide Road and the Hole in the Wall road at Ayrfield. They also lodged planning applications for a drive-in restaurant, a pub and a library. The firm bought the land from two sites. The 95 acres were bought from Abbey Group and the 15-acre site was the site of the former Clare Manor Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin Sheridan |url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/2009/02/25/gerry-gannon/ |title=Gerry Gannon – |website=Gavinsblog.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannon has owned Ericsson R&amp;D facility in [[Athlone]], [[County Westmeath]] for several years. In 2017 it was reported that it would be offered for sale for more than €19m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/19m-ericsson-facility-in-athlone-promises-net-initial-yield-of-10pc-35482489.html|title=€19m Ericsson facility in Athlone promises net initial yield of 10pc – Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maple 10, Anglo 10 or the Golden Circle==
The 'Maple 10', also known as the Anglo 10 or the Golden Circle, was a group of Irish investors. The Maple 10 besides Gerry Gannon include Jackson O'Sullivan, John McCabe, Paddy McKillen, Jerry Conlan, Joe O’Reilly, Patrick Kearney, Brian O’Farrell, Gerry Maguire and Sean Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/gardai-to-interview-key-figures-in-bank-for-second-time-2423839.html |title=Gardai to interview key figures in bank for second time |website=Independent.ie |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin Sheridan |url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/2009/02/18/the-anglo-irish-10/ |title=The Anglo Irish 10 – |website=Gavinsblog.com |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish [[Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) examines the file on Anglo's "Maple 10" deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dpp-to-examine-file-on-anglos-maple-10-deals-2464683.html |title=DPP to examine file on Anglo's 'Maple 10' deals |website=Independent.ie |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Grey market}}
A '''grey''' or '''gray market''' (sometimes confused with the similar term [[parallel import|parallel market]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espinosaiplaw.com/wordpress/?page_id=5 |title=What is the Parallel Market? &amp;#124; The Gray Blog |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311222807/http://espinosaiplaw.com/wordpress/?page_id=5 |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onelook.com/?w=parallel+market&amp;ls=a|title=Definitions of parallel market - OneLook Dictionary Search|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the trade of a commodity through distribution channels that are legal but unintended by the original manufacturer or [[trade mark]] proprietor. Grey market products (grey goods) are products sold by a manufacturer or their authorized agent outside the terms of the agreement between the reseller and the manufacturer.

== History of term ==
Manufacturers that produce products including computer, telecom, and technology equipment very often sell those products through distributors. Most distribution agreements require the distributor to resell the products strictly to end users. However, some distributors choose to resell those products to other resellers. In the late 1980s, manufacturers labeled the resold products as "grey market".

There is nothing illegal about buying "grey market" products. In fact, the [[US Supreme Court]] has upheld the idea that grey market products are legal for resale in the [[United States]] regardless of where they were produced or originally sold. The EU Supreme Court has similarly ruled that grey market products are legal for resale in the EU, provided that the equipment was originally sold by the manufacturer inside the EU.

Manufacturers created the term "grey market" in an effort to instill fear in customers that buying such equipment was somehow illegal in an effort to assure manufacturers that customers would only buy directly from them.

The term "grey market" was chosen because of its similarity to the old term "black market" which refers to stolen and illegal products.

In November 2016 the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] confirmed a ruling in the case of R v C and Others that the sale of grey goods can be met by [[Criminal law|criminal sanctions]] under section 92 of the UK [[Trade Marks Act 1994]], with a potential penalty of up to 10 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2016/1617.html R v C &amp; Others &amp;#91;2016&amp;#93; EWCA Crim 1617 (01 November 2016)], accessed 21 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Grey market goods are legal, non-[[counterfeit]] goods sold outside normal distribution channels by entities which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods. This form of [[parallel import]] frequently occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/03/19/174757355/supreme-court-oks-discounted-resale-of-gray-market-goods|title=Supreme Court OKs Discounted Resale Of 'Gray Market' Goods|last=|first=|date=|work=NPR|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commonly takes place with electronic equipment such as [[camera]]s. [[Entrepreneurs]] buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, and import it legally to the target market. They then sell it at a price high enough to provide a profit but below the normal market price.

International efforts to promote [[free trade]], including reduced [[tariff]]s and harmonised national standards, facilitate this form of [[arbitrage]] whenever manufacturers attempt to preserve highly disparate pricing. Because of the nature of grey markets, it is difficult or impossible to track the precise numbers of grey market sales. Grey market goods are often new, but some grey market goods are [[used goods]].  A market in used goods is sometimes nicknamed a [[green market]].

The two main types of grey markets are those of imported manufactured goods that would normally be unavailable or more expensive in a certain country and unissued securities that are not yet traded in official markets. Sometimes the term '''dark market''' is used to describe secretive, unregulated (though often technically legal) trading in [[commodity futures]], notably crude oil in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Victory: "Close the ENRON Loophole" Bill is Small Step In Right Direction|url=http://www.nefi.com/NEON/NEON_issues/NEON_May_22_2008.html|dead-url=yes|journal=NEON: NEFI Energy Online News|volume=3|issue=19|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107043624/http://www.nefi.com/NEON/NEON_issues/NEON_May_22_2008.html|archive-date=January 7, 2009|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be considered a third type of "grey market" since it is legal, yet unregulated, and probably not intended or explicitly authorised by oil producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=363821043X |title=Crime in Business - grey market products and EU-legislation |isbn=363821043X |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The import of legally restricted or prohibited items such as prescription drugs or firearms, on the other hand, is considered [[black market]], as is the smuggling of goods into a target country to avoid import duties. A related concept is [[Rum-running|bootleg]]ging; the smuggling or transport of highly regulated goods, especially [[alcoholic beverage]]s. The term "bootlegging" is also often applied to the production or distribution of [[counterfeit]] or otherwise [[copyright infringement|infringing]] goods.

Grey markets sometimes develop for [[video game]] consoles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=China has finally lifted its 14-year ban on video games | website=Business Insider | date=July 27, 2015 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-lifts-14-year-ban-on-gaming-consoles-2015-7 | accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and titles whose demand temporarily exceeds their supply causing authorised local suppliers to run out of stock. This happens especially during the [[holiday season]]. Other popular items, such as [[doll]]s, can also be affected. In such situations, the grey market price may be considerably higher than the [[manufacturer's suggested retail price]], with unscrupulous sellers buying items in bulk for the express purpose of inflating the prices during resale, a practice called [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]]. Online auction sites such as [[eBay]] have contributed to the emergence of the video-game grey market.

===Arcade games===
Certain [[arcade games]] (with the same gameplay) are marketed under different titles (especially titles from Japanese companies), such as [[Carrier Air Wing (video game)|Carrier Air Wing]]/US Navy, [[Mega Man]]/Rockman, and [[Police 911]]/[[Police 24/7]].
When certain arcade games (especially titles for Japan) are first powered on, a warning message is shown such as “[t]his game is intended only for sale and use in (country/region)” and often, such a message is occasionally displayed when the game is idle, this also goes to most of the games released by Konami, with its games from the late 90s until the present time.

One reason for regional variations for the game title despite the same gameplay is trademark issues in different regions e.g. someone else could already own the rights a particular trademark in a particular country or region even though the particular game company owns the rights to the same trademark in their home country.

Another reason for regional variations for the game title is to help combat bootleg arcade games at one time, including those from Japanese versions.

===Automobiles===
{{Main|Grey import vehicle}}
Automobile manufacturers segment world markets by territory and price, thus creating a demand for [[grey import vehicles]].

Although some grey imports are a bargain, some buyers have discovered that their vehicles do not meet local regulations, or that parts and services are difficult to obtain because these cars are different from the versions sold through the new car dealer network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.com/b2b/Support/Glossary.aspx|title=NADA - Glossary|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, ensuring service history and mechanical condition for a vehicle purchased at a distance can be a problem. {{citation needed span|text=Cars also may have different corrosion protection standards between grey market vehicles and official exports.|date=October 2015}}

Many used cars come from [[Singapore]] or [[Japan]], and are sold in other countries around the world, including [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Japan and Singapore both have strict laws against older cars. The Japanese [[Motor-vehicle inspection (Japan)|"Shaken"]] road-worthiness testing regime, requires progressively more expensive maintenance, involving the replacement of entire vehicle systems, that are unnecessary for safety, year on year, to devalue older cars and promote new cars on their home market that were available for low prices. This makes these well running cars seem reasonably priced, even after transport expenses. There are very few cars in Japan more than five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/12/world/why-the-cars-in-japan-look-just-like-new.html|title=Why the Cars In Japan Look Just Like New|date=12 September 1993|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New car arbitrage has become an issue in the US as well, especially when the US price is lower in the US than in countries like [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/exporting-new-luxury-cars-lucrative-legally-questionable|title=Exporting new luxury cars is lucrative legally questionable - Autoweek|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond cost issues, grey market cars provide [[consumer]] access to models never officially released. Before 1987, the [[Range Rover]] and [[Lamborghini Countach]], both revolutionary designs, were [[grey import vehicles]] in the [[United States]]. The grey market provided a clear signal to these manufacturers that the [[United States]] had significant demand for these cars, and their present-day US model descendants remain popular. Years later, Nissan similarly decided to sell the [[Nissan GT-R|GT-R]] in North America after seeing how many people were importing older [[Nissan Skyline|Skylines]]. Although [[Mercedes-Benz]] was also a beneficiary of the signals to US consumer demand that the grey market provided, their lobbying in Washington succeeded in virtually ending the US grey market in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/how-to-win-the-car-importing-game/|title=How To: Win the Car-Importing Game|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, some [[Japanese domestic market]] models fetch a high price in the UK because of their performance, novelty or status, assisted by the fact that the Japanese drive on the left, in common with the UK, so vehicles are right hand drive. Popular types include - off-road vehicles, people carriers, affordable sports cars like the [[Mazda Miata|Mazda MX-5 / Roadster]], very high performance sports cars like the, rally [[homologation]] based cars like the [[Subaru Impreza]] and [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]], ultra compact [[kei car]]s, and limited edition Japanese market designer cars like the [[Nissan Figaro]].

In Japan, due to strict and differing car classifications and emission regulations, or lack of main consumer demand, some international models or certain regional models aren't sold in Japanese Domestic Market. Grey importers are trying to import some of these models into Japan but it is permitted due to lack of restrictions imposed on them, unlike in other countries. Among the grey-imported vehicles in Japan are pickup trucks like [[Toyota Tundra]], [[Nissan Navara]] and [[Subaru BRAT]], which aren't officially sold in Japan.

===Broadcasting===
{{Main|Pirate decryption}}
In television and radio broadcasting, grey markets primarily exist in relation to [[satellite radio]] and [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite television]] delivery.
The most common form is companies reselling the equipment and services of a provider not licensed to operate in the market. For instance, a [[Canadians|Canadian]] consumer who wants access to [[United States|American]] television and radio services that are not available in Canada may approach a grey market reseller of [[Dish Network]] or [[DirecTV]]. There is also a grey market in the United States (especially from Canadian citizens with winter homes in the U.S.) for Canadian satellite services such as [[Bell TV]] or [[Shaw Direct]].

In [[Europe]] some satellite TV services are encrypted since they have only been authorised by content suppliers to broadcast films, sporting events and US entertainment programming in a certain country or countries, hence only residents of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] may subscribe to [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital]]. In other European countries with large British [[expatriate]] populations, such as [[Spain]], Sky is widely available through the grey market. Although Sky discourages the use of its viewing cards outside the UK or Ireland, and has the technology to render them invalid, many people continue to use them.

Parallel importing of "[[free-to-view]]" Sky cards from the UK to Ireland is often done so that Irish Sky customers can receive [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and some of the other channels not generally available via Sky in the Republic because of trademark and other licensing issues. Conversely, Sky viewing cards from the Republic of Ireland, which allow viewing of Irish terrestrial channels, are imported into the UK. [[Northern Ireland]] residents subscribing to Sky can watch [[RTÉ One]] and [[RTÉ Two|Two]] and [[TG4]], although not [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], which carries many of the same programs as [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], a lot of the programs airing before ITV can show them.

It is also becoming increasingly common in the UK for some [[Public house|pub]]s to use satellite decoder cards from [[Greece]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]] or the [[Arab world]] to receive satellite TV broadcasting live English football matches from those countries. Alternatively, they may use cards which allow [[pirate decryption]] of scrambled signals. Such cards are typically much cheaper than the cards available in the UK from Sky (who charge extra fees for public showing licences). However, Sky has taken civil and criminal action against some who do this. Two recent cases involving grey cards have been referred to the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;numaff=C-403%2F08|title=C-403/08 - Football Association Premier League and Others|website=Curia.europa.eu|accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;numaff=C-429%2F08|title=C-429/08 - Murphy|website=Curia.europa.eu|accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppliers of grey cards and Karen Murphy have won their cases at the European Court of Justice. The judges have ruled that right holders cannot license their content on an exclusive territorial basis as it breaches EU Law on competition and free movement of goods and services. However, whilst this ruling allows domestic viewers to subscribe to foreign satellite services, pubs may still need permission from right holders such as the Premier League to broadcast content. This is because certain elements of the broadcast such as branding are copyrighted. The matter now rests on the High Court to incorporate the ruling into UK Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-403/08|title=C-403/08 - Football Association Premier League and Others|website=Curia.europa.eu|accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two High Court judgements on this matter now. Mr. Justice Kitchin has ruled that QC Leisure and other suppliers of foreign satellite systems can carry on with their businesses if they can prevent copyright elements such as branding of football matches from being shown in a public place. The Premier League can pursue prosecutions of licensees who show branding of matches via foreign satellite systems. Karen Murphy has won her case in the High Court following the ruling from the European Court of Justice. The ruling from Justice Stanley Burnton allows Ms Murphy to shop for the cheapest foreign satellite provider. However the ruling from Justice Kitchin prevents Ms Murphy from showing matches in her pub via foreign satellite systems because branding are copyrighted. It is no longer illegal though for a customer to purchase a foreign viewing card from an EU country and use it outside the territory.

===Cell phones===
The emergence of the [[GSM]] international standard for cell phones in 1990 prompted the beginning of the grey market in the cell phone industry. As global demand for mobile phones grew, so did the size of the parallel market. Today, it is estimated that over 30% of all mobile phones traded will pass through the grey market and that statistic continues to grow. It is impossible to quantify an exact figure, but sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmexchange.com |title=gsmExchange |website=GsmExchange.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that as many as 500,000 mobile phones are bought and sold outside official distribution channels through their trading platforms every day.

The driving forces behind a heavily active mobile phone grey market include currency fluctuations, customers demands, manufacturers policies and price variations. It is not uncommon for grey market traders to introduce a product into a market months in advance of the official launch. This was evident with the launch of the iPhone 4, where international grey market traders bought large quantities at Apple’s retail price then shipped to countries where the product was not available adding a substantial margin to the resale price.

===Computer Games===
Purchasing some games from online content distribution systems, such as [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s [[Steam (software)|Steam]], simply requires entering a valid CD key to associate with an account.  In 2007, after the release of ''[[The Orange Box]]'', Valve deactivated accounts with [[Product key|CD keys]] that were purchased outside the consumer's territory in order to maintain the integrity of region-specific licensing. This generated complaints from North American customers who had circumvented their Steam [[end-user licence agreement]] by purchasing ''The Orange Box'' through cheaper, market retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Steam Error: Game not available in your territory | publisher=[[Valve Corporation]] | date=2007-10-23 | url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?p_faqid=461 | accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/10/25/valve-locking-out-user-accounts-for-incorrect-territory |title=Valve locking out user accounts for "incorrect territory" | accessdate=2007-10-25 | publisher=Ars Technica | last=Caron | first=Frank | date=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[regional lockout]], [[videogame consoles]] and their games are often subjected to grey market trade and are chosen as the alternative to [[Modchip|modding]] by some gamers. The reasons for this may range from the console being crippled in some markets to that of the desired game not being released for the market the potential consumer of the game is in.

PC Code Stripping is a process by which boxed PC product is bought in large quantities at cheap rates. Manual labor is then used to open the box, retrieve the activation code from the box and enter the code into a database. The activation code is then sold online as a download key and the physical product is discarded.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Code Stripping? | publisher=Savemi | date=2015-11-10 | url=https://savemidownload.com/what-is-code-stripping/| accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
There is a grey market in electronics in which retailers import merchandise from regions where the prices are cheaper or where regional design differences are more favourable to consumers, and subsequently sell merchandise in regions where the manufacturer's selling price is more expensive. Online retailers are often able to exploit pricing disparities in various countries by using grey-market imports from regions where the product is sold at lower costs and reselling them without regional buyer restrictions. Websites such as [[Taobao]] and [[Ebay]] enable customers to buy products designed for foreign regions with different features or at cheaper costs, using parallel importation.

The grey market for photographic equipment and other such electronics is thriving in heavily taxed states like [[Singapore]] with dealers importing directly from lower taxed states and selling at lower prices, creating competition against local [[distributor]]s recognised by the products' manufacturers. "Grey sets", as colloquially called, are often comparable to products purchased from the manufacturer's preferred retailer. [[Photographic lens|Lenses]] or [[flash (photography)|flash]] units of parallel imports often only differ by the warranty provided, and since the grey sets were manufactured for another state, photographic equipment manufacturers often offer local [[warranty]], instead of international warranty, which will render grey sets ineligible for warranty claims with the [[manufacturer]].

Because of the nature of local warranties, importers of grey sets usually offer their own warranty schemes to compensate for the manufacturers' refusal of service. Grey sets do not differ particularly from official imports. They look and function identically. In the early days of camera sales during the 60s and 70s, when lenses had amber coating, the bargain basements for Japanese equipment were Hong Kong and Singapore, through which goods were channeled to European shop windows bypassing the often substantial levy of the official importers. World-market pricing and the Internet have largely eliminated this. [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] gives their hard-selling DSLR cameras names like "Rebel" in the USA and "EOS xx0/xx00" outside it, aimed at preventing the competitively priced US-merchandise reaching Europe where sales are slower but achieve a higher profit.

===Frequent-flyer miles===
Trade or bartering of [[frequent-flyer miles]] is prohibited by nearly all major airlines, although an authorised medium exists for specific frequent flyer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Points.com|url=https://www.points.com/|work=Points International Ltd.|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unauthorised exchanges of frequent flyer miles&amp;nbsp;– of which several exist&amp;nbsp;– are also major examples of grey markets.

===Infant formula===
[[File:Parallel goods traders queuing outside SHS Exit C.JPG|thumb|right|Milk powder runners queuing outside [[Sheung Shui Station]], near the [[Hong Kong]] border.]]
Following the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]], parents in China lost confidence in locally produced [[infant formula]], creating a demand for European, Japanese and American produced formula. Import restrictions on formula from these sources has led to parents willing to pay a premium for foreign brands leading to the emergence of milk powder runners, who buy formula at ticket price over the counter in Hong Kong, carry the tins over the border to [[Shenzhen]] before returning to Hong Kong to repeat the process. The effect of the runners led to a shortage of infant formula in Hong Kong forcing the government to impose an export restriction of two tins per person per trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customs.gov.hk/en/whats_new/API/|title=Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department - Import and Export (General)(Amendment) Regulation 2013 ( with effect from 1 March 2013 ) - Quantity of Powdered Formula for Persons Departing from Hong Kong|date=3 June 2010|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese then turned to Australia, subsequently also caused shortages there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese buyers trigger Australian baby milk run|accessdate=April 4, 2013|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1119150/chinese-buyers-trigger-australian-baby-milk-run|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for milk formula producers to ask retailers in the United Kingdom to restrict purchasers to two tins, as there was evidence that milk formula is being purchased for onward shipment to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hui|first=Sylvia|title=Chinese demand for baby milk causes 'ration' in UK|url=https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-demand-baby-milk-causes-ration-uk-145052396.html|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=Associated Press|date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
Some prescription medications, most notably popular and branded drugs, can have very high prices in comparison to their cost of transport. In addition, pharmaceutical prices can vary significantly between countries, particularly as a result of government intervention in prices. As a consequence, the grey market for pharmaceuticals flourishes, particularly in Europe and along the US–Canada border where Canadians often pay significantly lower prices for US-made pharmaceuticals than Americans do.

===Stock market securities===
[[Public company]] securities that are not listed, traded or quoted on any U.S. [[stock exchange]] or the OTC markets are sometimes purchased or sold over the counter (OTC) via the grey market. Grey market securities have no market makers quoting the stock. Since grey market securities are not traded or quoted on an exchange or interdealer quotation system, investors' bids and offers are not collected in a central spot so market transparency is diminished and effective execution of orders is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otcmarkets.com/otc-101/otc-market-tiers|title=Explanation of grey market securities|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=OTCMarkets|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209051200/http://www.otcmarkets.com/otc-101/otc-market-tiers|archive-date=9 February 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the unofficial grey market trades are very common for the Initial public offering (IPOs). The people put their money in the unregulated and unofficial grey market before the listing of the IPOs. Company promoters along with the Market Operators buy and sell the shares before the listing. This is the easiest way to manipulate the share price before IPO listing.

===Textbooks===
College level [[textbooks]] have a grey market, with publishers offering them for lower prices in developing countries or sometimes the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html | work=The New York Times | title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas | first=Tamar | last=Lewin | date=2003-10-21 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These books typically contain a disclaimer stating that importation is not permitted. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions ''[[Quality King v. L'anza]]'' (1998) and especially ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' (2013, involving textbooks imported from Thailand by an [[eBay]] seller) protect the importation of copyrighted materials under the first-sale doctrine.

==Action taken by corporations==
The parties most opposed to the grey market are usually the authorised agents or importers, or the retailers of the item in the target market. Often this is the national subsidiary of the manufacturer, or a related company. In response to the resultant damage to their profits and reputation, manufacturers and their official distribution chain will often seek to restrict the grey market. Such responses can breach [[competition law]], particularly in the European Union. Manufacturers or their licensees often seek to enforce [[trademark]] or other [[intellectual property|intellectual-property]] laws against the grey market. Such rights may be exercised against the import, sale and/or advertisement of grey imports. In 2002, [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi Strauss]], after a 4-year legal case, prevented the UK supermarket [[Tesco]] from selling grey market jeans.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2163561.stm Tesco defeated in cheap jeans battle; Case T-415/99 Levi Strauss v Tesco Stores&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;numaff=C-415%2F99 |title=InfoCuria |publisher=Curia.europa.eu |date=2001-11-20 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such rights can be limited.  Examples of such limitations include the [[first-sale doctrine]] in the United States and the doctrine of the [[exhaustion of rights]] in the European Union.

When grey-market products are advertised on [[Google]], eBay or other legitimate web sites, it is possible to petition for removal of any advertisements that violate trademark or copyright laws. This can be done directly, without the involvement of legal professionals. For example, eBay will remove listings of such products even in countries where their purchase and use is not against the law. Manufacturers may refuse to supply distributors and retailers (and with commercial products, customers) that trade in grey market goods. They may also more broadly limit supplies in markets where prices are low. Manufacturers may refuse to honor the warranty of an item purchased from grey market sources, on the grounds that the higher price on the non-grey market reflects a higher level of service even though the manufacturer does of course control their own prices to distributors. Alternatively, they may provide the warranty service only from the manufacturer's subsidiary in the intended country of import, not the diverted third country where the grey-market goods are ultimately sold by the distributor or retailer. This response to the grey market is especially evident in electronics goods. Local laws (or customer demand) concerning distribution and packaging (for example, the language on labels, units of measurement, and nutritional disclosure on foodstuffs) can be brought into play, as can national standards certifications for certain goods.

Manufacturers may give the same item different model numbers in different countries, even though the functions of the item are identical, so that they can identify grey imports. Manufacturers can also use supplier codes to enable similar tracing of grey imports. Parallel market importers often decode the product in order to avoid the identification of the supplier. In the United States, courts have ruled decoding is legal, however manufacturers and brand owners may have rights if they can prove that the decoding has materially altered the product where certain trademarks have been defaced or the decoding has removed the ability of the manufacturer from enforcing quality-control measures. For example, if the decoding defaces the logo of the product or brand or if the batch code is removed preventing the manufacturer from re-calling defective batches.

The development of [[DVD region code]]s, and equivalent [[regional lockout|regional-lockout]] techniques in other media, are examples of technological features designed to limit the flow of goods between national markets, effectively fighting the grey market that would otherwise develop. This enables movie studios and other content creators to charge more for the same product in one market than in another, or alternatively withhold the product from some markets for a particular time.

===Canon===
{{update|section|date=April 2018}}The lawsuits started by Canon U.S.A. Inc. v. a number of retailers on October 25, 2015 in the New York Eastern District Court (Case No. 2:15-cv-6019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nyedce/2:2015cv06019/376749 |title=Dockets and Filings |date=October 2015 |website=Justia |publisher=Justia |access-date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and No. 2:15-cv-6015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nyedce/2:2015cv06015/376745 |title=Dockets and Filings |date=October 2015 |website=Justia |publisher=Justia |access-date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), will not be tried until 2016 at the earliest, but are based on a Trademark violation. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant retailers applied counterfeit serial numbers to Canon digital SLR cameras and sold kits with inferior (non-Canon) warranties as well as counterfeit batteries and chargers that did not comply with U.S. certification regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photographybay.com/2015/11/22/canon-is-suing-get-it-digital-and-others-to-stop-gray-market-dslr-sales/?awt_l=5V4kB&amp;awt_m=JJvnI5iIHf62xu |title=Canon is Suing "Get It Digital" and Others to Stop Gray Market DSLR Sales

Inc. also reserves the right to claim damages for "further violations of CUSA’s intellectual property and other rights [that] will come to light as this litigation progresses".

===Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement===
{{main|Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement}}
The Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement (AGMA) is a [[California]]-based non-profit organization of [[information technology]] (IT) companies that works to educate and raise awareness on counterfeiting; digital IP protection; service and warranty abuse; and the gray market.

==Support for gray markets==
{{further|Democracy|Socialism|Criticism of Copyright|Criticism of Capitalism}}
{{See also|first-sale doctrine}}

Consumer advocacy groups argue that discrimination against consumers—the charging of higher prices on the same object simply because of where they happen to live—is unjust and monopolistic behaviour on the part of corporations towards the [[proletariat|public]]. Since it requires governments to legislate to prevent their citizens from purchasing goods at cheaper prices from other markets, and because this is clearly not in their citizens' interests, many governments in [[Democracy|democratic]] countries have chosen not to protect anti-competitive technologies such as DVD region-coding.

Unlike the [[black market]], the grey market does not contribute to the distribution of illegal items. Correspondingly, the grey market has found support from most ideological tendencies. [[Anarchism|Radical liberal]] opponents of [[social hierarchy|class]] [[discrimination]] argue that [[private property]] in general leads to the oppression of much of society and are therefore against the very idea of [[intellectual property]], which forms the basis of arguments against the grey market. [[Capitalism|Proponents]] of the [[corporation|corporate financial system]], in agreement, assert that the enforcement of intellectual property can lead to a 'lessening of composing effort'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Scherer | first = F.M. | title=Quarter Notes and Bank Notes. The Economics of Music Composition in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries  | publisher=Princeton University Press | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grey market has been a constant source of litigation and appeals in the United States.  The same fundamental question arises under patent law and copyright law, namely whether or not a good sold abroad lawfully is still protected by United States intellectual property law for the purposes of resale.  When purchased domestically, a copyrighted good may be resold by the purchaser under the [[first sale doctrine]] contained at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109 17 U.S.C. §109(c)].  Similarly, a patented good may be re-sold under the [[patent exhaustion]] doctrine.  In 2013, the United States Supreme Court largely affirmed the legality of the grey market when it decided [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] where it held that a sale abroad of a copyrighted good triggers the first sale doctrine.  The decision is largely understood to apply to patented goods as well.

'''''Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board''''', 535 U.S. 137 (2002), is a [[US labor law]] decision, by 5 to 4, of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which denied an award of back pay to an undocumented worker, Jose Castro, who had been [[Layoff|laid off]] for participating in a [[union organizing]] campaign at Hoffman Plastics Compounds plant along with several other employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cornell Law School|title=Hoffman Plastic Compounds, INC. v. National Labor Relations Board|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-1595.ZO.html|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was originally filed against Hoffman by Dionisio Gonzalez, an organizer with the United Steelworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Employers Test Ruling on Immigrants| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/apr/22/business/fi-workers22/2| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=2002-04-22| last1=Cleeland| first1=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) found that the layoff of Castro violated [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA) section 8(a)(3)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Labor Relations Act|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the unlawful firing of union supporters. Castro had  [[Illegal immigration to the United States|entered the United States illegally]] and had also used another person's identity (a friend's [[birth certificate]]) to gain employment at Hoffman Plastics.

In a 5-4 decision with the justices divided along ideological lines, the Supreme Court interpreted the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] (IRCA), which penalizes the acts of undocumented workers and provides for significant penalties to companies that knowingly employ illegal immigrants, to disallow the use of the punitive provisions of the NLRA against an employer which would benefit any person who knowingly broke  [[immigration law]]. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by Justices [[Sandra O'Connor]], [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and [[Clarence Thomas]].

Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] wrote a [[dissenting opinion|dissent]], joined by Justices [[John Paul Stevens]], [[David Souter]], and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The dissent expressed concern that employers would use the lack of immigration status of an employee to relieve themselves of responsibility under the NLRA.

==Facts==
Hoffman Plastics is a small business based in [[Paramount, California]] which manufactures [[polyvinyl resin]]s and [[plastic pipework]]. In 1988 Hoffman Plastics hired Castro. At the time of hiring, Castro presented to Hoffman what seemed to be an authentic U.S. birth certificate, as verification of his legal right to work in the United States.

Approximately seven months after Castro was hired, the [[United Rubber Workers|United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum and Plastic Workers of America]], [[AFL–CIO|AFL-CIO]] started an organizing campaign at Hoffman Plastics. Castro, along with several other employees, showed their support for unionization by participating in the handing out of fliers and union authorization cards.

In retaliation, Hoffman laid off Castro and the other pro-union employees.  Three years later, the NLRB found Hoffman Plastics to be in violation of section 8(a)(3)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See National Labor Relations Act  Here|url=https://www.nlrb.gov|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NLRA and awarded Castro back pay and reinstatement at Hoffman Plastics.  But at an [[administrative law judge]] hearing to decide how much back pay should be awarded to the parties involved, Castro admitted that he had entered the country illegally and used a friend's birth certificate to obtain documents needed to gain employment.

After two unsuccessful attempts by Hoffman to reverse the decision to pay Castro, the Court granted [[certiorari]].

===National Labor Relations Act===
The National Labor Relations Act was first instituted by [[Robert F. Wagner|Senator Robert Wagner]] (D) of the state of New York in 1935. Senator Wagner submitted a bill to congress to eliminate unfair labor practices of businesses. The NLRA outlines benefits and rights of employees.  One of the most important sections of the NLRA is section 7 which gives employees rights to organize labor unions without the fear of retaliation from their employer. Section 7 states, "Employees shall the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Wagner Act Section 7|title=NLRA|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1612.html|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wagner Act or National Labor Relations Act was used for the  Nation Labor Relations Board, NLRB to bring the case to The Supreme Court with their determination based on the Wagner act was violated by Hoffman Plastics for firing Castro and others for contributing to the Union organizing at the plant. Section 7 entitles workers to organize, or join a Union if they are so desired. It is also protected under the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the United States Of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Amendment|url=http://archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html|date=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous cases brought to the courts by violators such as Walmart for firing employees for threats of employees organizing labor forces to better job benefits such as pay, medical insurance and  [[paid time off]]. In 2002, the NLRB brought more than 40 cases to court regarding violations of section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act against Walmart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Walmart Case Violations|title=Labor opens a Drive to Organize Wal Mart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/08/national/08WALM.html?todaysheadlines|accessdate=25 March 2012|work=The New York Times|date=8 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration Reform And Control Act===
The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform And Control Act]] (IRCA) was originally the Immigration and Nationality Act. This article adopted by the 99th congress was signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. The act added many new provisions for the purpose of requirements and punishments of the immigrant work force in the United States. In reference to ''Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB'' it served for the illegal documentation of the worker Jose Castro when he used a friends birth certificate for identification. The law states under section 101 titled, "Control of Unlawful Employment of Aliens" that it is required under subsection 101 B&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRCA Law|url=http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/PUBLAW/HTML/PUBLAW/0-0-0-15.html|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide proper documents such as a passport, certificate of United States citizenship, unexpired foreign passport, naturalization card, certificate of birth in the United States or one that establishes United States nationality at birth with a stamp from the Attorney General. All documents must be verified to be confirmed as legal.

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that Jose Castro had illegally worked at Hoffman Plastics due to his illegal immigration status. ''[[Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|467|883|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the major cases used in finding its decision. ''Sure-Tan'' was a very similar case about the firing of illegal immigrants. The Court did not refer to the Immigration Control &amp; Reform Act in its findings. It applied only one federal law, the National Labor Relations Act of 1938, since the issue was whether or not to pay the back pay, not the illegal hiring decision of Hoffman. The NLRB was searching for back pay that could have been earned if Castro was not let go. Under the IRCA, Castro was not a documented worker and was thus ineligible to work. Therefore, no back pay could be awarded.

In dissent, [[Justice Breyer]] wrote

{{quote|I cannot agree that the backpay award before us "runs counter to," or "trenches upon," national immigration policy. Ante, at 147,149 (citing the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] (IRCA)). As all the relevant agencies (including the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]) have told us, the [[National Labor Relations Board]]'s limited backpay order will not interfere with the implementation of immigration policy. Rather, it reasonably helps to deter unlawful activity that both labor laws and immigration laws seek to prevent. Consequently, the order is lawful.

...

Nor can the Court comfortably rest its conclusion upon the immigration laws' purposes. For one thing, the general purpose of the immigration statute's employment prohibition is to diminish the attractive force of employment, which like a "magnet" pulls illegal immigrants toward the United States. H. R. Rep. No. 99-682, pt. 1, p. 45 (1986). To permit the Board to award backpay could not significantly increase the strength of this magnetic force, for so speculative a future possibility could not realistically influence an individual's decision to migrate illegally.

To ''deny'' the Board the power to award backpay, however, might very well increase the strength of this magnetic force. That denial lowers the cost to the employer of an initial labor law violation (provided, of course, that the only victims are illegal aliens). It thereby increases the employer's incentive to find and to hire illegal-alien employees. Were the Board forbidden to assess backpay against a knowing employer-a circumstance not before us today, see 237 F.3d 639, 648 (CADC 2001)-this perverse economic incentive, which runs directly contrary to the immigration statute's basic objective, would be obvious and serious. But even if limited to cases where the employer did not know of the employee's status, the incentive may prove significant-for, as the Board has told us, the Court's rule offers employers immunity in borderline cases, thereby encouraging them to take risks, i. e., to hire with a wink and a nod those potentially unlawful aliens whose unlawful employment (given the Court's views) ultimately will lower the costs of labor law violations. See Brief for Respondent 30-32; Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 47; cf. also General Accounting Office, Garment Industry: Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops 8 (GAOl HEHS-95-29, Nov. 1994) (noting a higher incidence of labor violations in areas with large populations of undocumented aliens). The Court has recognized these considerations in stating that the labor laws must apply to illegal aliens in order to ensure that "there will be no advantage under the NLRA in preferring illegal aliens" and therefore there will be "fewer incentives for aliens themselves to enter." SureTan, supra, at 893-894. The Court today accomplishes the precise opposite.}}

==Significance==
The decision according to the [[United States Department of Labor]], "does not mean that undocumented workers do not have rights under the U.S. labor laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs48.htm|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts ruling finds that workers must have authorization to be working in the United States in order to be protected under all labor laws. Knowingly committing fraud by using false identification to gain employment is a crime as much as it is a crime to hire illegal undocumented workers. The decision that the NLRB had made to award back pay to Castro was overturned by the Supreme Court. The court found that Castro was not eligible for the back pay due to the fact that he was an undocumented worker and was working in the United States illegally. When the court ruled on ''Sure-Tan'', it would have rewarded Castro the back pay he was entitled to because he was protected under the law. Since the ruling on ''Sure-Tan'', the IRCA introduced new laws to help curb undocumented workers. These new laws do not protect undocumented workers by allowing them the six month time frame to become a citizen or obtain a work visa.

In [[New Zealand]] an '''incorporated society''' is a group of at least 15 people who have applied for registration under the ''Incorporated Societies Act 1908''.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|last1=New Zealand Companies Office|website=Societies and Trusts online|title=An overview|url=http://www.societies.govt.nz/cms/incorporated-societies/starting-an-incorporated-society/an-overview|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web|last1=New Zealand Companies Office|website=Societies and Trusts online|title=Rules of incorporated societies|url=http://www.societies.govt.nz/cms/incorporated-societies/rules-of-incorporated-societies|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once registered the [[Society]] constitutes a distinct [[Legal person|legal entity]] which provides protection to members from debts, contracts etc.  In return, members do not have a personal [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules|financial interest]] in the property or assets (if any) owned by the society.

To maintain registration, annual returns must be made to the Registrar of Incorporated Societies [http://www.societies.govt.nz/pls/web/dbssiten.main].  At any stage the Society may be wound up by members' resolution, creditors or the Registrar (if compliance is not maintained).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4495">The '''International Conference on African Children''' or Conference on the African Child was an international conference held in Geneva in June 1931.

Organised by the [[International Save the Children Union]], it followed on from the adoption by the [[League of Nations]] in 1924 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]], drafted by the Union in 1923. It focused on the conditions of children in Africa, specifically in the areas of infant mortality, child labour and education. &lt;ref&gt;Hilde Nielssen, Inger Marie Okkenhaug, Karina Hestad-Skeie, ''Protestant Missions and Local Encounters in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: Unto the Ends of the World'' (BRILL, 2011) page 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference met in Geneva in the summer of 1931, between 22 and 25 June. It is considered a turning point in western attitudes to childhood in Africa: "this conference reconstructed the images of childhood in Africa among missionaries, child welfare humanitarians and social scientists".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kwame Ame, DeBrenna LaFa Agbényiga, Nana Araba Apt, ''Children's Rights in Ghana: Reality or Rhetoric?'' (Lexington Books, 2011) page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; There were only five Africans among the participants, although even this level of participation was unusual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kwame Ame, DeBrenna LaFa Agbényiga, Nana Araba Apt, ''Children's Rights in Ghana: Reality or Rhetoric?'' (Lexington Books, 2011) page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was [[Jomo Kenyatta]] of the Kikuyu Central Association.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Holton, ''Global Networks'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007) page 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyatta wrote about the conference later, on the subject of [[circumcision]] and [[female genital mutilation]], which he defended as a cultural practice among the Kikuyu:

"In this conference several European delegates urged that the time was ripe when this "barbarous custom" should be abolished, and that, like all other "heathen" customs, it should be abolished at once by law."&lt;ref&gt;Jomo Kenyatta, ''Facing Mount Kenya, the Tribal Life of the Gikuyu'', (Secker and Warburg, 1938) page 131, cited in Richard A. Shweder, ''Why Do Men Barbecue?: Recipes for Cultural Psychology'' (Harvard University Press, 2003) page 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other African representatives were teacher and writer Gladys Casely-Hayford, daughter of the Ghanaian politician [[J. E. Casely Hayford]], and Nigerian educator [[Henry Rawlingson Carr|Henry Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;Abosede A. George, ''Making Modern Girls: A History of Girlhood, Labor, and Social Development in Colonial Lagos'' (Ohio University Press, 2014) page 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Another black speaker was the American activist [[James W. Ford]] of the [[League Against Imperialism]], who gave a speech criticising the conference for merely supporting the colonial order.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Weiss, ''Framing a Radical African Atlantic: African American Agency, West African Intellectuals and the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers'' (BRILL, 2013) page 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference secretary was writer [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]], who wrote a book about it called ''The African Child''. Another contributor was a missionary, Dora Earthy.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Harries, David Maxwell, ''The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa'' (Eerdmans, 2012) page 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korkmaz Yiğit'''  (born 1943, [[Erzincan]]) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[businessman]]. He made his fortune in construction, and expanded into finance and media, but fell rapidly from grace in 1998 when apparent connections with mob figure [[Alaattin Çakıcı]] were revealed. 

==Career==
After making his fortune in construction, Yiğit sought to move into finance in the mid-1990s. He bid in the privatization tender for [[Etibank]], and after this was unsuccessful bought [[Bankekspres]] from [[Doğuş Holding]] for $100m in March 1997.&lt;ref name=bankexspres/&gt;

In 1998 he acquired private television stations [[Kanal E]] and [[Tele 4]], and then [[Kanal 6]] (the latter for $110m). In August 1998 he bought the ''[[Ateş (newspaper)|Ateş]]'' and ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'' newspapers  ($75m),&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn2"/&gt; and in early October he acquired control of ''[[Milliyet]]'' ($300m).&lt;ref name="hdn3"/&gt;

In August 1998, he had won the privatization tender for the majority of [[Türk Ticaret Bankası]], with a $600m bid,&lt;ref name="hdn4"/&gt; but after apparent connections with mob figure [[Alaattin Çakıcı]] were revealed in October, known as the "[[Türkbank scandal]]", the deal was put on hold on 14 October pending a parliamentary inquiry.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt; The [[Doğan Media Group]] bought back ''Milliyet'' on 22 October.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt; [[Bankekspres]] was seized by the government for a symbolic TL1bn.&lt;ref name=bankexspres/&gt; Yiğit was jailed pending trial, accused of conspiracy in the Turkbank privatization and of defrauding Bankekspres.&lt;ref name="hdn5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn6"/&gt;

In 2007 the government's [[TMSF]] took some of Yiğit's companies in part-payment of debts owed.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;

'''MAKS''' ({{lang-ru|МАКС}}, {{lang-ru|label=short for|Международный авиационно-космический салон|Mezhdunarodnyj aviatsionno-kosmicheskij salon|"International Aviation and Space Show"}}) is an international [[air show]] held at [[Zhukovsky International Airport]], the home of the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] in [[Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast|Zhukovsky]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Moscow, Russia. The event was organized by the Russian [[Ministry of Industry and Trade (Russia)|Ministry of Industry and Trade]] until 2009, more recently by the Government of Moscow and Aviasalon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The first show, '''Mosaeroshow-92''', was held in 1992. Since 1993, the air show was renamed as MAKS and is held biennially on odd years.

MAKS is an important event for the Russian aviation industry and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Although it started mainly as an entertainment event, the show soon became a marketplace where Russian aerospace companies could negotiate export contracts and Russian air carriers could make foreign contacts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Background and history==
[[File:MAKS Airshow 2013 (Ramenskoye Airport, Russia) (526-04).jpg|thumb|[[Sukhoi Su-57]] prototype at MAKS-2013.]]
[[File:'Большая девятка' на МАКС-2007 (03).jpg|thumb|Aerobatic teams [[Russian Knights]] (Su-27s) and [[Swifts (aerobatic team)|Swifts]] (MiG-29s) flying together at MAKS-2007.]]

[[File:Buran.2.jpg|thumb|[[OK-GLI|Buran aerodynamic analogue BST-02 OK-GLI]] at MAKS-1999.]]
The air show's history traces back to 1911, when one was held in Mikhailovskiy Square in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The Soviet Union held annual air shows on the [[Tushino Airfield]] in Moscow 22 years later.&lt;ref name="Ямбаева 74"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/608026|title=Кассовые асы|last=Ямбаева|first=Рената|date=2005-12-09|last2=Ямбаева|first2=Рената|newspaper=Журнал "Коммерсантъ Деньги"|issue=36|pages=74|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its history in Zhukovskiy, however, began much later with the Engineering Show by the [[TsAGI|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute]] (TsAGI) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/14885/|title=ОНИ УЧАТ ЛЕТАТЬ САМОЛЁТЫ|last=жизнь|first=Редакция журнала Наука и|language=ru|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the MAKS air show is to demonstrate leading technologies and to open up the Russian aerospace industry to the international market. A large portion of the show is dedicated to holding scientific conferences and symposia, under the auspices of Russia's Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute.&lt;ref name="MAKS About Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=MAKS General Information|url=http://www.aviasalon.com/en/static/page/maks_2015_en_general_info.htm|website=Official Web site of the International Aviation and Space Salon МAKS|accessdate=15 January 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air show is held in the city of [[Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast|Zhukovsky]], at [[Zhukovsky International Airport]], which is the home of the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], many aviation companies eventually moved to Zhukovsky, using the Gromov Flight Research Institute's airfield for MosAeroShow-92 held on 11–16 August 1992.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviasalon.com/en/static/page/maks_2015_en_archive_1992.htm|title=Official Web site of the International Aviation and Space Salon МAKS :: MOSAEROSHOW-92|website=www.aviasalon.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second show was held in 1993, now renamed MAKS. Since then the air show has been held biannually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviasalon.com/en/static/page/maks_2015_en_archive_1993_2013.htm|title=Official Web site of the International Aviation and Space Salon МAKS :: MAKS 1993-2013|website=www.aviasalon.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasts for six days, three of which are open to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviasalon.com/en/static/page/maks_2015_en_results.htm|title=Official Web site of the International Aviation and Space Salon МAKS :: MAKS-2015 sums up|website=www.aviasalon.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of previous MAKS air shows were systematic: it usually opens with the attendance of the President of Russia, followed by company talks, and concludes with aircraft demonstrations by aerobatic teams such as the [[Russian Knights]], [[Swifts (aerobatic team)|Swifts]], and the foreign [[Patrouille de France]] as well as [[Frecce Tricolori]].

Some highlights include:
* The first public unveiling of the forward-swept-wing S-37 (later Su-47) ''Berkut'' at MAKS-1999.
* The scandal of implementing corporate programs in order to reduce over all costs which made EADS (later Airbus) refuse to attend the same airshow, damaging the image of the airshow substantially.&lt;ref name="Ямбаева 74"/&gt; 
* The first inclusion of American aircraft at MAKS-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviashow.info/airshowhistory.html |title=Авиасалоны мира. {{!}} История авиасалона МАКС {{!}} Журнал новостей и событий крупнейщих авиационных форумов мира. |date=2009-08-20 |access-date=2017-01-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820165858/http://www.aviashow.info/airshowhistory.html |archivedate=2009-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior criticism==
A main criticism of the airshow is the large influx of visitors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lenta.ru/articles/2009/08/20/open/|title=Техника безопасности|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (up to 300,000 people per day). According to some sources, the administration is not doing enough to withstand such a massive number of visitors, which, together with tight security, caused problems such as long queues, congestion and transportation problems. The high cost of public electricity and the lack of air conditioning in the exhibition halls are also subject to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2007/08/21/how/|title=МАКС изнутри: открытие|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1756286|title=The Wall Street Journal не довольна МАКСом|last=Джоджуа|first=Тамила|date=2011-08-22|last2=Джоджуа|first2=Тамила|newspaper=Коммерсантъ|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics accused the organizers for still showing outdated Soviet-era aircraft.

Critics believe that MAKS is still inferior to other leading airshows of the world, and do not agree with other parts of Russian and western press. Conversely, the Danish daily newspaper ''[[Dagbladet Børsen|Børsen]]'' has commented that MAKS is not worse than the Le Bourget and the Farnborough shows.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denmark.mid.ru/inftp_61.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a number of authoritative international organizations such as the Union of Aerospace Industry in Germany and the Chamber of Commerce in France noted the high quality of the event in the official review for MAKS-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviasalon.com/ru/static/page/feedback_1.htm|title=Официальный сайт международного авиационно-космического салона - МАКС :: ОТЗЫВЫ О МАКС-2009 / FEEDBACKS ABOUT MAKS 2009|website=www.aviasalon.com|language=ru|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airshow administration argues that the airshows are conducted in a highly organized fashion, and are a hallmark of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviasalon.com/ru/static/page/aviasalon.htm|title=Официальный сайт международного авиационно-космического салона - МАКС :: О компании|website=www.aviasalon.com|language=ru|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a financial perspective, the head of the state corporation "Rostekhnologia", Sergey Chemezov, has stated the price of participation in MAKS-2009 was quite acceptable as the rented space was about 10% lower than that at the Le Bourget airshow and 1.1 to 1.8 times lower than that at Farnborough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arms-expo.ru/site.xp/049051124049048051054051.html|title=Глава ГК "Ростехнологии": цены на МАКС-2009 ниже, чем на зарубежных салонах аналогичного уровня|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other facts==
* The educational "MAKSyata" club for teenagers was established in 2001, bringing children born in Zhukovskiy in the days of the air show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maksyata.ru/statistics5.html|title=Максята.ru|website=www.maksyata.ru|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At MAKS-2009, employees from the Moscow department of the Federal Bailiff Service(FSSP) of the Russian Federation, in coordination with the staff of the Internal Affairs Directorate carried out a raid on debtors hiding among the visitors of the airshow. Bailiffs stationed near the Vereya village of the Ramenskoye village and intercepted debtors, with a poster that read: "Debtor, do you want to experience the feeling of flying?! Pay your debts and fly!". A total of more than 12 million rubles was recovered from debtors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rian.ru/society/20090824/182204740.html|title=Рейд судебных приставов на МАКС-2009 принес более 12 млн рублей|newspaper=РИА Новости|language=ru|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents==
* The prototype [[Beriev Be-103]] amphibious aircraft crashed on the day before the opening of MAKS-1997. After takeoff at 11:14 local time, at an altitude of about 100 meters, the pilot attempted to stay in his designated flight zone by a steep turn, which unintentionally set the aircraft into a steep climb, causing a stall at a supercritical angle of attack without adequate altitude to recover. The pilot was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://testpilot.ru/base/2009/01/ulyanov-v-n/|title=Ульянов Владимир Николаевич {{!}} Энциклопедия испытателей|website=testpilot.ru|language=ru-RU|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 16, 2009, while preparing for the MAKS-2009, two [[Sukhoi Su-27]]s of the [[Russian Knights]] aerobatic team crashed into each other, killing the commander of the team and injuring several other people, including residents at "Belozyorikha" garden community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2009/08/16/crash/|title=Фальстарт МАКСа|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of the pilot was paid tribute to by a minute of silence at the opening of the airshow.

'''Mutual Gains Bargaining''' (MGB) is an approach to [[collective bargaining]] intended to reach ''[[win-win]]'' outcomes for the negotiating parties.

Instead of the traditional adversarial (i.e., "win/lose") approach (also known as "positional bargaining"), the mutual gains approach is quite similar to [[principled negotiation]] (first described by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] in his book ''[[Getting to YES]]''), where the goal is to reach a sustainable (i.e., lasting) agreement that both parties (or all parties in a multi-party negotiation) can live with and support.

Mutual gains bargaining has been used successfully in such areas as labor–management relations and environmental negotiations.

==Some principles of MGB==
* Both sides have legitimate interests to be recognized and advanced
* Approach the issues as problems to be solved
* Listening builds trust
* Enlarge the pie
* Seek sustainable alternatives

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19179">A '''business proposal''' is a written offer from a seller to a prospective buyer.
Business proposals are often a key step in the [[complex sales]] process—i.e., whenever a buyer considers more than price in a purchase.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Newman, Larry. Shipley Associates Proposal Guide, ([http://www.shipleywins.com/myaccount-products.php Proposal Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111033643/https://www.shipleywins.com/myaccount-products.php |date=2008-11-11 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal puts the buyer's requirements in a context that favors the seller's products and services, and educates the buyer about the capabilities of the seller in satisfying their needs.&lt;ref name=Ricci&gt;Ricci, Laura; (1996–2007), The Magic of Winning Proposals (publisher R³) {{ISBN|0-9657399-1-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of proposals==
There are three distinct categories of business proposals:
* Formally solicited 
* Informally solicited
* Unsolicited

Solicited proposals are written in response to published requirements, contained in a [[request for proposal]] (RFP), [[request for quotation]] (RFQ), [[invitation for bid]] (IFB), or a [[request for information]] (RFI).

'''Request for proposal (RFP)'''

RFPs provide detailed specifications of what the customer wants to buy and sometimes include directions for preparing the proposal, as well as evaluation criteria the customer will use to evaluate offers. Customers issue RFPs when their needs cannot be met with generally available products or services. RFIs are issued to qualify the vendors who are interested in providing service/products for specific requirements. Based on the response to RFI, detailed RFP is issued to qualified vendors who the organization believes can provide desired services. Proposals in response to RFPs are seldom less than 10 pages and sometimes reach 1,000's of pages, without cost data.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;
 
'''Request for quotation (RFQ)'''

Customers issue RFQs when they want to buy large amounts of a commodity and price is not the only issue—for example, when availability or delivering or service are considerations. RFQs can be very detailed, so proposals written to RFQs can be lengthy but are generally much shorter than an RFP-proposal.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; RFQ proposals consist primarily of cost data, with brief narratives addressing customer issues, such as quality control.
 
'''Invitation for bid (IFB)'''

Customers issue IFBs when they are buying some service, such as construction. The requirements are detailed, but the primary consideration is price. For example, a customer provides architectural blueprints for contractors to bid on. These proposals can be lengthy but most of the length comes from cost-estimating data and detailed schedules.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

'''Request for information (RFI)'''

Sometimes before a customer issues an RFP or RFQ or IFB, the customer will issue a [[Request for Information]] (RFI). The purpose of the RFI is to gain "marketing intelligence" about what products, services, and vendors are available. RFIs are used to shape final RFPs, RFQs, and IFBs, so potential vendors take great care in responding to these requests, hoping to shape the eventual formal solicitation toward their products or services.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

===Informally solicited proposal===
Informally solicited proposals are typically the result of conversations held between a vendor and a prospective customer. The customer is interested enough in a product or service to ask for a proposal. Typically, the customer does not ask for competing proposals from other vendors. This type of proposal is known as a sole-source proposal. There are no formal requirements to respond. But they choose good quality of product."

===Unsolicited proposal===
Unsolicited proposals are marketing brochures. They are always generic, with no direct connection between customer needs or specified requirements. Vendors use them to introduce a product or service to a prospective customer. They are often used as "leave-behinds" at the end of initial meetings with or customers or "give-aways" at trade shows or other public meetings. They are not designed to close a sale, just introduce the possibility of a sale.&lt;ref&gt;Khalsa,Mahan. Franklin Covey, [http://www.franklincovey.com/saletraininggroup.php-Let's Get Real]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

===Formally solicited proposals===
# Requirements Matrix, which matches customer requirements with the paragraph and page numbers of where those requirements are addressed in the proposal
# Executive Summary, which outlines the primary benefits of the vendors's solutions to the customer's requirements
# Technical Volume, which demonstrates how each requirement will be met
# Management Volume, which describes how the program will be managed
# Cost Volume, which provides all costing data, as well as implementation plans and schedules&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

=== Informally solicited business proposal ===
# A description of the seller's capabilities or products
# A discussion of key issues
# A description of the buyer's specifications and how they will be met
# The cost of the offering
# A schedule for delivery of the products or services
# Proof of prior experience i.e. Testimonials from previous customers, Descriptions of previous projects&lt;ref name=Ricci/&gt;

==Managing business proposals==

Managing proposals presents an enormous challenge for sales and marketing teams. Many established management methods are ill-suited to deal with the broader issues associated with the production and delivery of proposals. In these cases, organizations often rely on outsourcing by identifying a proposal manager to support their proposal development needs.  

===The process of proposal management===
Proposal management is an inherently collaborative process. It often consists of the following basic roles and responsibilities:
* '''Creator''' – responsible for creating and editing content.
* '''Editor''' – responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.
* '''Publisher''' – responsible for releasing the content for use.
* '''Administrator''' – responsible for managing access permissions to documents and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles.
* '''Consumer''' or viewer – the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.

Increasingly, the term proposal management is being used to suggest that engagement with the proposal process is important to more than just the sales team, and should also affect those working in marketing, legal, and sales.

There is also a trend towards using [[proposal software|proposal management software]] that allows users to quickly and easily create proposals, collaborate with team members, track and analyze [[customer engagement]].

Writing a successful proposal can be made easier through the development of a proposal checklist that contains the necessary standardized information that is typically contained in 80% of all of your sales proposals. This makes it much easier for the proposal writer to build a shell and then research the roughly missing 20%. For example, the Company Name, Mission Statement, History, Qualifications should remain the same for most proposals leaving the Pricing section and specific Product and Service options specific to the customer to be customized for the current target customer. At times, the process can be tedious, but the steps are pretty basic. Besides solicited and unsolicited proposals, the others that exist include internal proposals and sole-source contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Hamper, Robert J,. and L. Sue Baugh. Handbook for Writing Proposals. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. eBook Collection/(EBSCOhost). Wed. 15 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal proposals===
Internal proposals are ideas or projects that are presented to whomever holds the position of top management in a company. These types of proposals can be written by a particular individual, group, department, or division of a particular company. One example of this is when the manager of a product line writes a proposal suggesting that the company should robotize the production process. Some advantages to this includes easier communication, knowing the client's needs and making fast decisions. Some advantages to this may include competition from other companies and the loss of management champions.&lt;ref&gt;Hamper, Robert J,. and L. Sue Baugh. Handbook for Writing Proposals. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. eBook Collection/(EBSCOhost). Web. 15 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sole-source contract===
These types of proposals are made when a private firm, government agency, or association negotiates to supply a service or product to a single company and when a company has excellent credibility and a track record of achievements. The standard format for this type of proposal consists of information about a specific product, including the price and delivery schedules. Some advantages to this include not having to have resources to win a contract and the firm or client knows what time the work will be coming.

===Format===
Proposals are based on research, making it important for the researcher of the proposal to know about their client. The researcher must know the background of the idea that is being presented and show that he or she is well prepared to deal with a problem or situation their client has. The research for a company, institute, firm, etc. is done in advance, thereby increasing the chances of a well done proposal and the reader of the proposal will have a good idea of the outcome from the research that has been done. A general format for proposals includes the title page, abstract, scholarly statement of the problem and the method to solve it, the budget, and biographical information.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” Journal of Business Communication. 5.1 (1967): 13-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 Apr. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title===
As small as it may seem, it is important that the title page be curt and definite. It would be a good idea to use key words for the purpose of indexing as long as it written in a relevant pattern.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Abstract===
This part of the proposal should state the situation, method, goal, scope, and the expected outcome. It usually consists of 200 words. Carl B. Palmer, Chief of Sponsored Research, Grants and Research Contracts, Office Space Science, and NASA says that the summary of an abstract has to be “short, lean, and all muscle.” He also points out that managers usually take a short glance at the abstract and will only concentrate on the proposal itself if a message comes through.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Statement and method===
It is important to highlight the main idea that is being presented. First the writer of the proposal should state what the idea is and do something to make it unique. Next, the writer should explain what to do with the idea. Be sure to avoid phrases such as: “No one has thought of doing this before” or “This is entirely original.” Doing so, will make the writer seem dull and inattentive.&lt;ref name="Porte, Michael 1967"/&gt;

===Budget===
The writer of the proposal includes the grant and the total amounts of money it is going to be paid by it. It is stressed that the pay scale must be compatible with the company's scale. The money of researchers is part of a single person's company salary and because of this, a business is required to take away some of the duties of a researcher. The writer includes the estimated costs of disposable materials, equipment, and supplies. This part of the proposal would also consist of travel, publication costs, and direct costs.&lt;ref&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” ''Journal of Business Communication''. 5.1 (1967): 13–20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical information===
This part of the proposal basically deals with proving to the client that the person writing and submitting the proposal is capable of doing the job. Everyone that contributed to the making of the proposal is mentioned, including their achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Porte, Michael. “Writing Effective Research Proposals” ''Journal of Business Communication''. 5.1 (1967): 13-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, a proposal uses persuasion to get its audience to buy into their idea. One example is when a proposal tries to persuade one or more sponsors to invest in a project. Another example of using a proposal to persuade a client is when the company writing the proposal is asking for a grant.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. Proposal Planning &amp; Writing. 3rd edition. Connecticut. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; The categories that can involve grants include social services, health care, religions, philanthropy, economic development, government, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. ''Proposal Planning &amp; Writing''. 3rd edition. Connecticut. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Persuasion can only work when these components are involved; sponsor values, applicant credibility, proposal logics, and proposal psychologics. Another way to make proposals persuasive is to connect the ideas of a project to the sponsor's values or problems of interest.

===Sponsor values===
Sponsors or grantmakers main focuses include any specific dilemma, inequities or injustices. Their mission is to fill in the space between the categories of  “what is” and “what ought to be.” One example is an organization trying to prevent child abuse called The Prevent Abuse Foundation. Their activities include giving support to families and children and teaching about the abuse and how to eliminate it. In addition to this, the foundation serves grass roots, community-based groups with technical and professional assistance, sharing the best program practices and evaluation techniques.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"&gt;Miner, Jeremy T. and Miner, Lynn. Models of Proposal Planning &amp;Writing. Connecticut. Praeger Publishers. 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applicant credibility===
An applicant's job is to authorize organizational, individual, and project credibility. When an organization is proposing an idea to be presented by a project director, it is important for them to have credibility. Being persuasive is also one of the keys to success. An organization would try to convince its target of how different and unique it is from any other company. One example is a biology department at a university asking for money to do research in genetics. The department may go on to say that it has had 30 years of medical studies in biology and that their research inspects both hormonal and genetic elements that causes gene regulation.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

===Proposal logics===
This basically deals with the making of proposal elements that illustrates an identified gap, an improved situation, and resulting benefits to the intended population. Benefits serve as the good things that will happen by completing the objectives that are presented. The components must reflect a relationship between the sponsor values and the project that is being proposed. An exact description of the problem or need is required along with the purpose of the organization, funds and how to complete the objections. It also includes a timeline and a summarization of  the intended audience.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

===Proposal psychologies===
Sponsors would usually provide money for both psychological and logical reasons. Proposal psychologics tend to the emotional needs of the sponsor. The components that can be found in a successful proposal include passion, ownership, energy, trust, and commitment. Sponsors use grants as investments. Sponsors need to feel that you are serious about helping them with their problems. One example can be a proposal to a federal agency and a private college that describes its long history of achievement by working with community partners, controlling national programs that helps the intended population, and institutionalizing project activities. The project partners have worked with grant related initiatives which includes a six-year joint teacher education program among the Midwestern Regional College and the College of Native Americans. The ideas the project director has for Native American middle school kids includes Achievement in Math, Math and Science Immersion and Kids Math Camp.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;
As long as a proposal expresses interest and concern for the values and ideal of the sponsor, there is a good chance for success.&lt;ref name="Miner, Jeremy T 2005"/&gt;

'''Ray Evans''' (10 September 1939 – 17 June 2014) was an Australian business leader, a conservative, and campaigner against [[climate change mitigation]] efforts.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Ray Evans was educated at [[Melbourne High School]]. He attended the [[University of Melbourne]], from which he graduated in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. During his years at university, he served as President of the Melbourne University ALP Club and as a delegate from the Federated Fodder and Fuel Trades Union to Victorian [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] State Conferences.

He resigned from the ALP to act as campaign manager for [[Sam Benson]] in the latter's successful campaign to retain the federal seat of [[Division of Batman|Batman]] as an independent in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Search of the Magic Pudding: Contributors |url=http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/nicholls/nichvol5/vol5prof.htm |publisher=H.R. Nicholls Society |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202080718/http://www.hrnicholls.com.au/nicholls/nichvol5/vol5prof.htm |archivedate=2 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Evans worked as a young engineer in the [[Production Planning]] Section of the [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria]].

===Career===
He taught electrical engineering at [[Deakin University]], Victoria. From 1982 until 2001, he was Executive Officer at the major Australian mining company, [[Western Mining Corporation]], (WMC Ltd), under [[Hugh Morgan (Australian businessman)|Hugh Morgan]]. From July 2001 to June 2014, he was the [[Board of directors|Director]] of Ray Evans &amp; Associates, a consultancy specialising in political and economic advice.&lt;ref name=olo&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political advocacy===
In January 1986, Evans, along with former [[Treasurer of Australia|federal Treasurer]] [[Peter Costello]] and two others, founded the [[H R Nicholls Society]], a [[think tank]] of the [[New Right]], of which he became president. The Society has had considerable influence over [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] policies. The initial motivation for founding the Society was [[industrial relations]] – a commitment to "freedom in the labour market", and opposition to the Australian industrial relations mechanism, represented by the establishment of the [[minimum wage]] by Justice [[H. B. Higgins|Henry Bourne Higgins]] in the 1905 [[Ex parte H.V. McKay|"Harvester Judgement"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Bachelard | first=Michael | title=Right-wing warriors who changed the workplace | newspaper=The Age (Melbourne) | date=15 December 2007 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global warming skepticism====
He was also a founder of the [[Lavoisier Group]], which opposed the ratification of the Kyoto treaty, believing that the science associated with global warming is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title= About Lavoisier 
|publisher=The Lavoisier Group 
|url=http://www.lavoisier.com.au
|accessdate=4 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he was instrumental in establishing a number of other right-wing organisations, such as the [[Bennelong Society]], and the [[Samuel Griffith Society]], for all of which he was either president or treasurer.&lt;ref name="hamil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/saturdayextra/stories/2007/1901158.htm |title=Clive Hamilton – Saturday Breakfast RN – 21 April 2007 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Clive Hamilton]], many of these groups "shared the same post office box".&lt;ref name="hamil"/&gt;

A supporter of the "[[Greenhouse Mafia]]", he remained a committed campaigner against [[climate change]] initiatives, dubbing [[global warming]] "the mother of environmental scares".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Evans | first=Ray | title = The politics behind Kyoto | journal = Australia &amp; World Affairs | date = Winter 1998 | issue = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[Hugh Morgan (Australian businessman)|Hugh Morgan]], Evans worked against the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and was central to the campaign to prevent the former Federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Government from taking actions to cut emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hamilton | first = Clive | title = Scorcher: the dirty politics of climate change | year = 2007 | publisher = Black Inc. Agenda | isbn = 978-0-9775949-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s discussion panel discussing ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]'', a documentary which questioned the science behind global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Ray Evans
|publisher=On Line Opinion
|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp?id=528

He was quoted in ''[[The Age]]'' as saying that [[Al Gore]]'s film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' is "bullshit from beginning to end", and that "the carbon-dioxide link [to global warming] is increasingly recognised as irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/greenhouse-sceptics-to-congregate/2007/02/27/1172338625822.html |title=Greenhouse sceptics to congregate – National |work=The Age |accessdate=3 November 2009 | location=Melbourne | date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Hiester Montgomery''' (September 21, 1872 – May 2, 1953) was an American accountant and educator, and co-founders of what is today the world's largest accounting firm, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].

Montgomery was a two-term president of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA). Montgomery was the author of numerous books on auditing and taxation including ''Auditing Theory and Practice'', a bestseller originally published in 1912 which is still in print. He was successful in three professions despite his lack of formal education, having not even completed high school.&lt;ref name="Accounting Hall of Fame"/&gt;

== Life and work ==
Montgomery quit school at the age of 14 and went to work in order to help out his family. In 1889 he got a job as an office boy at an accounting firm in Philadelphia. There he learned accounting and was made partner after seven years.&lt;ref name="Accounting Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fisher.osu.edu/node/1877 | title= Accounting Hall of Fame:  Robert Hiester Montgomery | accessdate= 7 March 2012 | publisher= Ohio State University; Fisher College of Business }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 1898, Montgomery and three of his colleagues, William M. Lybrand, Adam A. Ross Jr. and his brother T. Edward Ross, formed Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery. Two years later the firm opened an office in New York City under Montgomery's management. In his spare time Montgomery learned law. He was admitted to the [[New York Bar]] in 1904. Montgomery established his own law firm, Robert H. Montgomery, Attorney at Law, and worked on many difficult tax cases for clients. In 1905 Montgomery led a reorganization of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA). He created the ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' (then called the ''American Journal of Accounting''). The first issue contained his ''Professional Standards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Zuckerman| first = Bertram | title = The Montgomery Story | publisher = The Montgomery Foundation | year = 1997 | location = Miami | pages = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the AICPA for two two-year terms, first in 1912 and again in 1935.&lt;ref name="Accounting Hall of Fame"/&gt;

Next, Montgomery also got into the field of education by developing a curriculum in accounting for [[Columbia University]]. He was hired as Columbia's first accounting professor in 1910 and stayed there until 1939.&lt;ref name="Brand 2000"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Brand   | first = Ulrika  | url= http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/00/10/coopers.html | title= PricewaterhouseCoopers Donates Accounting Archives to Columbia | work =  | accessdate = 9 March 2012 | publisher=Columbia News  | date = 20 October 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatfield 1996. p. 422"&gt;{{Cite book   | last = Chatfield, editor | first = Michael   | authorlink = Michael Chatfield  | title = The History of Accounting An International Encyclopedia  | publisher = Garland Publishing  | year = 1996  | location = New York  | pages = 421–422     | url = http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Faah&amp;CISOPTR=726&amp;REC=0&amp;CISOBOX=Hiester   | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery saw the need for a book on auditing. In 1912 he wrote ''Auditing: Theory and Practice''. This was the first American book on auditing. For the seventh editions two other authors joined him and the book was retitled ''Montgomery's Auditing''. After Montgomery's death the eighth edition was published in 1957 by two other authors. It is still in print and is now in its 12th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book   | last = Gerson | first = James S.   | authorlink =    | coauthors =    | title = Montgomer's Auditing 12th edition   | publisher = John Wiley and Sons   | year = 1998   | location = New York   | page = vii    | url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471140635.html   | isbn = 978-0-471-14063-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioned as a Lieutenant Colonel (1918) during [[World War I]], he was generally referred to thereafter as Colonel Montgomery. He received the AICPA's Gold Medal Award in 1949.  In 1950, he was inducted into the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]], in the first year of that award.&lt;ref name="Accounting Hall of Fame"/&gt;

Montgomery was a highly respected leader of the profession of accountancy for over 60 years. His influence is still felt in the areas of auditing theory and practice, federal income taxation, professional accounting organizations, and accounting education.&lt;ref name="Chatfield 1996. p. 422"/&gt;

===Personal life===

Montgomery lived in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], and commuted to work in New York City. He established a winter home in north Florida in 1927. He sold it and moved to the suburbs of Miami, Florida in 1930 to be in a more tropic area. Here he decided to collect palm trees. He built an estate he called ''the Coconut Grove Palmetum'' on Old Cutler Drive about seven miles south of Coconut Grove. His love of tropical plants led him to establish a public garden. With the help of others he led the effort to establish [[Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden|Fairchild Tropical Garden]] in 1937, which opened to the public March 23, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book   | last = Zuckerman   | first = Bertram   | title = The Montgomery Story   | publisher = The Montgomery Foundation   | year = 1997   | location = Miami   | pages = 14    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1957 Cooper Brothers &amp; Co (UK), McDonald, Currie and Co (Canada) and Lybrand, Ross Brothers &amp; Montgomery (US) merged to form Coopers &amp; Lybrand. For the rest of the century Coopers &amp; Lybrand was known as one of the "Big Eight".&lt;ref name="Chronology"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/Company-history/Chronology-14.aspx | title=Chronology | accessdate=27 September 2010 | publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010183230/http://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/Company-history/Chronology-14.aspx | archivedate=10 October 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 1998 the worldwide merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand created the current [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt; PricewaterhouseCoopers is the world's largest professional services firm measured by revenues and one of the [[Big Four (audit firms)|"Big Four"]] accountancy firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/03/us-pwc-idUSTRE7920UJ20111003 | title= PWC | work = PWC reports record $29.2 billion revenue, regains lead | accessdate = 5 March 2012 | publisher=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery established a collection of pine trees at his home in Greenwich, CT. In 1953 he donated his estate to the town and it is now a 102-acre park in the center of Greenwich.

Montgomery collected manuscript account books and documents which illustrate and document the history of accounting and business procedures from the 14th century into the 20th century. He donated his collection to Columbia University in 1926. These books constitute the Montgomery Collection at the [[Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] in the [[Butler Library]] at Columbia University. The materials from his collection were featured in a 1987 Rare Book and Manuscript exhibit at Columbia entitled "The Origins of a Great Profession."&lt;ref name="Brand 2000"/&gt;

The [[Montgomery Botanical Center]] was established in 1959 by Nell Montgomery Jennings in memory of her husband, Colonel Robert H. Montgomery, and his love of palms and cycads. Located on 120 acres in Coral Gables it includes the largest and finest private collections of palms and cycads in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.montgomerybotanical.org/Pages/About.htm | title= About Montgomery | accessdate= 26 March 2012 | publisher= Montgomery Botanical Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.montgomerybotanical.org/Pages/history.htm | title= Montgomery's History | accessdate= 10 March 2012 | publisher= Montgomery Botanical Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 ranking by [[Forbes Magazine]] of the world's richest, Ongpin was named as the Philippines' twelfth wealthiest [[Filipino People|Filipino]] (up from sixteenth in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biznewsasia.net/filipino-billionaires/ |title=Filipino billionaires |access-date=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with a net worth US$ 1.22 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/roberto-ongpin/ |title=Forbes richest list |access-date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Early life and education==
Roberto Velayo Ongpin was born on January 6, 1937. He is the second of seven children by Luis Roa Ongpin and Lourdes Morales Velayo. He grew up in the neighborhood of Pinaglabanan in San Juan, which was then a suburb of the City of Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/749795/roberto-ongpin-anna-nicole-smith-lovi-poe-mike-arroyo-marcos-lee-kuan-yew |title=Stories about Roberto V. Ongpin |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Ongpin is the great grandson of [[Román Ongpin|Román T. Ongpin]], a Filipino-Chinese businessman and philanthropist who aided Filipino revolutionaries against the Spanish and American colonial administration in the Philippine islands. The Ongpins have been named as among the "most influential and enduring families of the Philippines" for their contributions to the nation's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Luis-Ongpin-y-Roa/6000000016207925354?through=6000000016208038677 |title=Roberto V.

After graduating from Ateneo High School, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (cum laude) from the Ateneo de Manila University in 1957. He became a  Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in 1958, after which he briefly joined Procter &amp; Gamble in Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V. Ongpin interview |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Ongpin earned his Masters of Business Administration from Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/86/philippines-10_Roberto-Ongpin_S3DA.html |title=Roberto V. Ongpin Forbes Magazine profile|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time in Harvard that he met and married his wife of 55 years, Monica Arellano of Valparaiso, Chile. They have two children together, Stephen Arellano Ongpin and Anna Arellano Ongpin. He also has two other children from different mothers, Michelle Schroer Ongpin and Julian Stone Ongpin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/-depth/09/22/11/ongpin-i-was-technocrat-not-crony|title=Ongpin: I was a technocrat, not crony|last=abs-cbnNEWS.com|first=by Judith Balea,|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V.

==1986 People Power Revolution==

In the early hours of February 22, 1986, as Roberto V. Ongpin was preparing to go to Malacañan Palace for a meeting with President Marcos, US Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, and Special Envoy Philip Habib, he noticed that his military escorts had been pulled out. Ongpin's subsequent calls to then-Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] inquiring about the whereabouts of his security detail inadvertently alerted Enrile that Marcos may have already been aware of his plans to stage a coup de'tat. This triggered Enrile's hasty break from the government, eventually leading to the [[People Power Revolution]] that installed [[Corazon C. Aquino]] as the new Philippine President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartxchange.org/DayOne.html |title=People Power Day one |access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/364429/us-set-5-conditions-to-save-marcos |title= US sets conditions to save Marcos. |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

===Sycip Gorres Velayo===
After moving back to the Philippines in 1963, Roberto V. Ongpin was recruited by his maternal uncle, Fred Velayo to work for "the Philippines' largest multidisciplinary professional services firm," [[Sycip Gorres Velayo &amp; Co.|Sycip Gorres Velayo &amp; Company (SGV).]] According to SGV Chairman Emeritus [[Washington SyCip|Washington Sycip]], Ongpin is "one of the most aggressive and effective managers" he has ever known. In 1966, two years after joining the firm, Ongpin - who was barely 30 years old at that time - was named a managing partner of SGV. He served the company from 1964 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V. Ongpin interview |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/ph/en/about-us/our-people-and-culture/our-history/sgv---co-history |title=History of SGV |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister of Trade and Industry===

In 1979, Roberto V. Ongpin became the Philippines' youngest Trade and Industry Minister at age 42 when he accepted the invitation of former Philippine President, [[Ferdinand E. Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos, Sr.]], to join his cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V. Ongpin interview |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his six-years as Minister, Ongpin grappled with the deteriorating economy as political instability made funding from international agencies and banks difficult for the government. On occasion, he personally had to negotiate financing for the Philippines with other world leaders, including Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/12827/lee-kuan-yew-on-philippines |title=Lee Kuan Yew Interview |access-date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/363947/roberto-v-ongpin-snake-pit-beckons |title=Roberto V.

In 1984, with "the Philippines facing a debt and foreign exchange crisis, the black market exchange rate soared to Php 30 per Dollar (versus the official rate of Php 14 per Dollar)." Ongpin is credited with stabilizing the Philippine Peso by establishing the "[[Binondo Central Bank]]," a dual exchange rate system that allowed the government to narrow the rate gap by directly intervening in black market currency prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c9053.pdf |title= Debt crisis and adjustment, R.S. Dohner, P.

He was also "instrumental in transforming the property into what it is today, one of the premier developments outside Metro Manila," and "the single largest - and most successful - upscale resort community in the Philippines to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/101002/ongpin-reacts-belles-charges |title=Ongpin on Belle Corp |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/211175/honoring-benito-tan-guat#ixzz4NypwX2zT |title=Benito Tan Guat profile |access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 1984, the stockholders authorized the change in the Company’s name to South Seas Natural Resources, Inc., which was approved by the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philweb.com.ph/about-us/history/ |title=Philweb Corporate History |accessdate=Nov 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2000, South Seas Natural Resources, Inc.  became [[PhilWeb|PhilWeb.Com, Inc.,]] an internet company, upon the stockholders’ approval of a restructuring plan which involved changes in the Company’s name, and primary purpose, among others.

At the annual stockholders’ meeting on May 31, 2002, the stockholders approved the change in corporate name from PhilWeb.com, Inc. to PhilWeb Corporation. The stockholders also approved the inclusion of the gaming business as an additional secondary purpose of the Company. The SEC approved these changes on November 5, 2002.

In August 2016, Ongpin resigned his post as chairman of [[PhilWeb Corporation]], after being tagged by [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Rodrigo Duterte]] as being part of the oligarchy, which was followed by a subsequent order to halt the online gambling industry, which was the core business of Philweb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/410-gaming/142268-philweb-roberto-ongpin-main-reason-resignation|title=PhilWeb reveals 'main reason' behind Ongpin resignation|publisher=[[Rappler]]|last=Dela Paz|first=Charisse|date=August 7, 2016|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongpin later clarified that Philweb is "not an online gaming company," but is merely the "software providers of e-Games, which is actually owned by (the [[Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation]])."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biznewsasia.net/alphaland-on-a-roll/|title=Alphaland on a roll|publisher=BizNews Asia|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unexpected singling out of Ongpin by the President has puzzled many observers, with some speculating that he may have just been a victim of the Philippines' "murky" politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/world/asia/philippines-duterte-marcos-burial.html?_r=0  |title=New York Times - Push to Give Marcos a Philippine Hero’s Burial Finds an Ally in Duterte |accessdate=Nov 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongpin however stresses that he 'bears no rancor' towards [[Duterte]]. "He is my President, and I will do all I can to support him and his policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2017/08/23/laps-of-luxury/#616974a45fe4 |title= Life in the fast lane|access-date=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongpin's decision to sell his shares in PhilWeb to former president Marcos' son-in-law, Gregorio Araneta III, has led to a lessening of the political pressure on himself and the company, allowing him to focus on his other business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/07/which-way-mr-president/ |title=Manila Bulletin - Which way Mr. President? |accessdate=Nov 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/134027/cocktales--ongpin-airline-flies-luxury-yacht-sails-past-thunderstorm-digong|title=Ongpin airline flies, luxury yacht sails past thunderstorm Digong |accessdate=Nov 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/araneta-group-acquires-ongpin-shares-in-philweb/|title=Araneta Group acquires Ongpin shares in PhilWeb |accessdate=Nov 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Hamilton was born in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=NST /&gt; He attended [[King George V School (Hong Kong)|King George V School]], prior to moving to [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=SouthChina /&gt;&lt;ref name=NST /&gt; In 1984, he attended [[Loretto School]] near [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and graduated from [[Cambridge University]] in 1989 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in Architecture.&lt;ref name=SouthChina /&gt;&lt;ref name=EconomicTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=NST /&gt;

== Career ==
In 1989, at age 21, Hamilton co-founded Footprints, a publishing company in London. The company pioneered pictorial maps in England, and grew to 42 cities before being sold to a national printing company in 1994.&lt;ref name=NST /&gt;

In 1995, Hamilton joined the two senior principals of [[Dell]] Inc to develop Hand Technologies, selling [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]] and [[HP Technology Services]] through a community network. Hand was one of the pioneers in early internet sales communities.&lt;ref name=SundayExpress /&gt;

In 1997, Hamilton launched Free Market Media in Singapore, and secured funding from [[venture capital]] firm 3i PLC.&lt;ref name=NST /&gt;&lt;ref name=SundayExpress /&gt; This was followed by ''[[Expat Living]]'' magazine, which has become the leading magazine for the expatiate community in Singapore.&lt;ref name=SundayExpress /&gt;

In 2002, Hamilton wrote the book ''Wink And Grow Rich'', which became an international best seller.&lt;ref name=EconomicTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=BangkokPost /&gt; He co-founded XL Group to serve and connect social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=EconomicTimes /&gt;

In 2009, XL Nation was established as one of the top international non-profit organisations of social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=EconomicTimes /&gt;

In 2014, Hamilton focused on Wealth Lighthouse, supporting the growth of XL Nation.

In 2015, GeniusU.com - Entrepreneur Education Platform

In 2017, Entrepreneur Resorts Limited, group of Entrepreneur Resorts and Beach Clubs around the world. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Wealth Dynamics ==
Hamilton developed the Wealth Dynamics profiling system in 2003. This system has since been used by over 250,000 entrepreneurs around the world and has been internationally acknowledged as a valuable tool for entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devanesan|first=Ruha|title=New mag targets businessmen with social conscience|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/today20040702-2.2.37.2.aspx|title=It's about the 'extraordinary lives' of entrepreneurs|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is a [[psychometric]] test based on the work of [[Carl Jung]], and linking his work to the ''[[I Ching]]'', which Jung studied and which influenced and relates to his published work ''Psychological Types'' published in 1921.  Jung wrote the foreword to the first published translation, by Richard Wilhelm, of the ''I Ching''. The system links back to the five Chinese elements, and the Chinese concepts of flow created from the alternating interlink of opposites.

The Wealth Dynamics system divides all success strategies into eight paths, detailed in Hamilton's book ''Your Life, Your Legacy: An Entrepreneur Guide to Finding Your Flow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Roger|title=Your Life Your Legacy: An Entrepreneur Guide to Finding Your Flow|year=2000|publisher=Achievers International|isbn=978-9810569679|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richestoftherich.com/eightprofiles/|title=Wealth Profile Square|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Wealth Dynamics system was supplemented with the Wealth Spectrum levels, which divides each profile into nine levels. It was also modified into the Talent Dynamics system for use in corporations. It is now being used in various organisations from the UK [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) to [[General Mills]].

In 2010, 30 leading entrepreneurs published a book on their use of Wealth Dynamics in their businesses, titled ''The Wealth Garden, Catching Butterflies Without a Net''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthew|first=Newnham|title=The Wealth Garden, Catching Butterflies Without a Net|year=2010|publisher=Achievers International|isbn=978-0981970844|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional books advocating the "Wealth Dynamics" model include John Williams' ''Screw Work Let's Play'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=John|title=Screw Work, Let's Play: How to Do What You Love and Get Paid for it|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall Business|isbn=0-273-73093-2|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Urichuck]]'s ''Disciplined for Life'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urichuck|first=Bob|title=Disciplined For Life You Are the Author of Your Future|year=2008|publisher=Creative Bound International Inc.|isbn=1-894439-43-0|pages=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Penny &amp; Thomas Power's ''A Friend in Every City''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Power|first=Penny and Thomas|title=A Friend in Every City|year=2006|publisher=Ecademy Press|isbn=0-9545093-7-4|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Train Fever''''' is a [[business simulation game]] by Urban Games, funded via the [[crowdfunding]] platform [[Gambitious]] on 20 March 2012 for a total budget of €300,000 and therefore published digitally by [[Gambitious Digital Entertainment]] and to retail by [[Astragon]].

Train Fever was made available for pre-order on 22 July 2014 and released on 4 September. On November 8, 2016 the successor, ''Transport Fever'', was released: it is based on the same engine and has new transport types and larger map sizes.

The game is heavily inspired from other transport simulation games, such as ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'', ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' and ''[[OpenTTD]]''; and, to a lesser extent, ''[[Cities in Motion]]''.

== Funding ==
On 22 June 2012, the ''Train Fever'' team announced that they would need to seek funding in order to be able to develop the final release of their game. It was decided to use a [[Crowd funding|crowd-funding platform]], although no name was given at that time. The first activities on ''Train Fever'''s [[Gambitious]] page were observed on 26 August. The crowd-funding campaign started officially on 1 September 2012. The original funding target was €300 000, split by €20 shares, with an initial [[Equity (finance)#Equity investments|equity]] of 60% for private investors. The deadline was fixed for 1 March 2013, for a total duration of six months.

On 14 October 2012, ''Train Fever'' lead developer announced that everyone investing €40 (2 shares) or more in the project will receive a copy of the final version of the game. On 27 October, a new gameplay video was released and announced on both the Gambitious project page and the official website.

Three months after the beginning of the campaign, on 12 December 2012, the campaign had reached 6.5% completion, with 70 investors and €20,000 invested. On 27 December 2012, ''Train Fever'' was accepted on Valve's [[Steam (software)#Steam Greenlight|Steam Greenlight]], in the "Concept" section. Reception was very positive, allowing ''Train Fever'' to reach the first page of Steam Greenlight "Top Rated All Time" at beginning of February. At that time, the project was supported by 200 investors on Gambitious.

On 18 February 2013, eleven days before the campaign deadline, the ''Train Fever'' team announced that an institutional investor backed the project for a total of €50,000. As a consequence, several decisions were made:
* The target funding on Gambitious campaign was lowered from €300,000 to €250,000
* The [[Equity (finance)#Equity investments|equity]] for private investors was lowered from 60% to 50%. However, the same ratio of "equity percentage / money invested" was kept (1% of equity for €5,000 invested).
* The campaign deadline was moved to 31 March 2013, in order not to surprise investors with last-minute changes.
* The start of the development was moved to May 2013, with a new expected release date in May 2014.

On 25 February 2013, the ''Train Fever'' team announced that the game will be available at release on [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]]. On 2 March 2013, €155,000 was invested, with €95,000 remaining to find, and 29 days to the deadline. Finally, on 20 March 2013, the crowd-funding campaign reached its target of €250,000, with 651 investors.

== Development ==
At the beginning of the crowdfunding campaign in September 2012, Train Fever was already in development at a prototype stage. The initial release date was set for May 2014, and pushed back to Q3 2014 at the end of February 2014.

Train Fever was originally developed by two people, Urban and Basil Weber, but the team grew to three developers with two additional artists.

On August 2013, an update explained the major gaming design decisions taken by the team:

* At the beginning, Train Fever was focusing on passenger transport only, but due to requests from the community, it was developed to allow to transport of several cargo goods (coal, iron ore, steel, wood, stock, grain, oil and goods);
* The size of the playable map was enlarged to 256 square kilometers;
* The maximum number of vehicles for the release was set at 30 trains, and more than 30 buses, trucks and streetcars.

Since November 2013, several more updates added content, such as procedurally generated terrain, in addition to improved road and rail systems.

On 22 January 2014, another developer update explained more precisely the in-game freight simulation functions, welcoming feedback on the current implementation from the community. This update listed only six transportable goods out of the nine explained in the "major design decisions" update (stock, grain and steel were no longer listed as goods). Developers explained that this number will likely be increased through downloadable content and community-developed modifications.

The beta test was announced 30 June 2014, and planned between 14 and 24 July. The number of beta testers was limited, and the total number will be split equally between Gambitious supporters and newcomers. The test was done on Windows only, and a [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]] signed by testers.

== Distribution ==
Train Fever is distributed online (on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com]]). In German speaking countries, the game is also sold on physical media (published by [[Gambitious]] and [[Astragon|Astragon Software GmbH]]).

== Gameplay ==
The game is a single-player game designed for 20 hours of gameplay in which the story-time runs from 1850 until 2050.

The game takes place in an environment comparable with Europe and the cities are procedurally generated and evolve accordingly. The player builds transport infrastructure like railroads and stations and has to maintain this infrastructure. The player also buys vehicles and creates routes. They need to develop their transport company, eventually becoming a transport empire.

=== Sound ===
The in-game soundtrack, totaling over 70 minutes, is entirely composed by [[Admiral James T.]], a Swiss solo musician from Winterthur.

== Successor ==
On 11 April 2016, Urban Games announced ''Transport Fever'' as a successor to ''Train Fever'', described as a "next generation transport simulation game coming to PC on the 8 November 2016. Players build up a thriving transport company and create complex rail-road-water-air networks. In addition to the genre-typical endless game mode, two historical campaigns offer real world challenges from more than 150 years of transportation history". A video trailer for ''Transport Fever'' was also released on the same day.

The new game was released on November 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/transport-fever|title=Transport Fever|website=Metacritic|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the same engine and has new transport types, larger map sizes and better [[gameplay]].

'''Wrexham Town Centre''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Wrexham]], in [[North Wales]] and is the area enclosed by the inner ring road of the town. It is the largest shopping area in north and mid [[Wales]], and the administrative centre of [[Wrexham County Borough]]. Many of its streets are pedestrianised.

== Geography ==
The area encompassed by the inner ring road is Grosvenor Road, Powell Road, Bodhyfryd, St. Georges Crescent (The Beast Market), Smithfield Road, Eagles Meadow, Salop Road, St. Giles Way, Pen-Y-Bryn, Ruthin Road, Bradley Road and Watery Road. It is primarily urban in nature, with the exception of the town centre's largest green space at [[Belle Vue Park, Wrexham|Belle-Vue Park]]. The area is predominately non-residential, notable exceptions being Eagles Meadow and around Parciau.

== History ==
{{main|History of Wrexham}}
The town centre is Wrexham's medieval core, and as such contains most of its history. The town centre expands outwards from the hill top [[St Giles' Church, Wrexham|St. Giles Church]], which itself is surrounded by a number of small medieval streets and alleyways.

== Areas ==
Whilst the term 'Town Centre' can be used quite liberally in Wrexham, it can be split into a number of smaller distinct areas, which have their own character and purpose within the town. Some of these are officially recognised by Wrexham Council, others are more a description of distinct areas.

=== The High Street and St. Giles ===
[[Image:Zzdti121085.jpg|thumb|250px|right|St. Giles Church Steeple - One of the Seven Wonders of Wales]]
This is Wrexham's original town centre, beginning at the church of St. Giles. This area was once the traditional High Street of the town containing most of its traditional shops and markets. It is now home to most of Wrexham's night-life including clubs, bars and restaurants. During the day the main attractions are the area's cafes and the historic 'Butchers Market' hall situated on High Street. The church of St. Giles is one of the [[Seven Wonders of Wales]] and often noted as the finest example of [[Gothic architecture]] in [[Wales]]. It is also home to the tomb of [[Elihu Yale]].

=== Eagles Meadow ===
{{main|Eagles Meadow}}
Eagle's Meadow is an open-air shopping centre in the south-east of the town centre. Opened in 2008, the complex is situated between Yorke Street and the inner ring road at Smithfield. The area incorporates a number of new buildings and public spaces, and includes a bridge to Yorke Street and an entrance in the style of the 'Spanish Steps' in Rome. Eagle's Meadow holds many top highstreet chain stores over two levels, alongside an 8-screen cinema and 24-lane [[10 pin bowling]] [[bowling alley|alley]]. It occupies the site of a former car-park and [[Asda]] superstore.

=== Civic Centre ===
Formerly known as the [[Civic Centre]] this quarter of the town centre can be thought of as everything north of Holt and Lampbit Street and east of Rhosddu Road. The area is bisected north to south by Chester Street. The area consists almost entirely of public services, arts and media centres. It is home to [[Wrexham County Borough]] Council HQ, [[North Wales Police]] (Eastern Division) HQ, [[BBC Wales]] (Wrexham) Studios, [[ITV Wales]] (Wrexham Bureau), Library and Arts Centre, Yale College of Wrexham, Wrexham Waterworld and a number of criminal and civil law courts. The area is also home to Llwyn Isaf, one of the town centre's largest green areas.

=== Island Green ===
Formerly an industrial area the location was home to the Island Green Brewery and [[Wrexham Central railway station]]. It is now a shopping area, developed in the late 1990s. The old oast houses used in the Brewery are now converted into apartments aside the [[River Gwenfro]], which cuts through the shopping area. During re-development the railway station was moved 500 yards west, and the station now sits inside the shopping area. Trains run from Wrexham Central to local suburban stations, [[Deeside]], the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] and [[Wrexham General railway station|Wrexham General]] for connections onto inter-city services.

=== Main Shopping Area ===
The main arteries of the town centre link all previous areas. Running in an easterly direction from Grosvenor Road, Regent Street and Hope Street are the main shopping streets within the town, terminating at the base of St. Giles' Church on High Street. Leading off these streets are a number of other streets, including Queen Street. The majority of this area is pedestrianised, and contains a number of notable landmarks including the thatched 'Horse &amp; Jockey' pub and mock Tudor architecture at Hope St/Queen St.

=== Queens Square ===
The square is the focal point in the town centre. It plays host to daily events, Christmas celebrations and weekly markets. The square merges with Llwyn Isaf.

=== Parciau (Including Pen-y-Bryn) ===
{{main|Belle Vue Park, Wrexham}}
Parciau is the name given to the southernmost area of the town centre. Much of the area is covered by [[Belle Vue Park, Wrexham]], a substantial [[Victorian era|Victorian]] park built to commemorate the Jubilee of Wrexham's charter. The park is known for its bowl, which holds many summer musical events. Bridge Street, Pen-y-Bryn and Ruthin road all come under the Parciau area.
