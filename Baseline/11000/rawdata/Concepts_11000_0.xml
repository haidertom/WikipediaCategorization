      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">"'''A Causal Theory of Knowing'''" is a philosophical essay written by [[Alvin Goldman]] in 1967, published in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]''. It is based on existing theories of knowledge in the realm of [[epistemology]], the study of philosophy through the scope of knowledge. The essay attempts to define knowledge by connecting facts, beliefs and knowledge through underlying and connective series called causal chains. It provides a '''causal theory of knowledge'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

A [[causal chain]] is repeatedly described as a sequence of events for which one event in a chain causes the next. According to Goldman, these chains can only exist with the presence of an accepted fact, a belief in the fact, and a cause for the subject to believe the fact.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay also explores the ideas of perception and memory through the use of the causal chains and the concept of knowledge.

==Background==
The essay is regarded as an improvement and rebuttal of [[Edmund Gettier|Edmund Gettier's]] "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", which is one of many attempts to explain the necessary conditions for knowledge to develop. Goldman implements the causal connection to reiterate his own theory of knowledge. Knowledge exists, says Goldman, if and only if the belief is justified by a reaction to the accepted fact.

Goldman's theory later counters that of Michael Clark, stating that his own theory including figures and diagrams is more appropriate than Clark's. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" uses figures which make explicit references to causal beliefs. Clark's model does not utilize these arrows, and Goldman states that the lack of these arrows deems Clark's model deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
[[Alvin Goldman]], currently a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Rutgers University]], wrote "A Causal Theory of Knowing" when he was in his late twenties. Goldman received his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]], and has taught at numerous universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|Professional Biography|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman's research deals mainly with epistemology and other cognitive sciences. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" was Goldman's first published paper explaining his own views of epistemology. Currently, Goldman has written more than ten essays focusing on knowledge and cognitive science.

==Contents==
The essay starts with a definition of Gettier's theory, followed by multiple reiterations of the idea of causal connections, figures to explain knowledge through a visual perspective, and references to [[perception]] and [[memory]] through causal chains.

The essay tends to focus on examples in which knowledge or other sensations do not exist, rather than proving a certain fact to be known.  Goldman also states on multiple occasions that he does not wish to explain the causal process in detail, instead pointing out counterexamples.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At numerous times in the essay, he also points out that he does not intend to give definitive answers to each of the propositions mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman also refocuses the idea of [[perception]], or knowledge through sensation (specifically sight) using his own theory of knowing. The concept of causal perception indicates that one observes something only if the object itself causes the sensation of sight to be accepted as known.  Thus, the object's existence must be factual and one must believe its existence. While all knowledge comes from facts, inferred knowledge emerges when physical object facts cause sense data which can be perceived as senses. The sense data can also be used to make conclusions, known as inferred knowledge, about certain physical object facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvin I. Goldman,|"A Causal Theory of Knowing"|1967|pp=358–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From "A Causal Theory of Knowing", Goldman constructs the idea that [[memory]] is also a causal process. Memory is explained as being an extension of knowledge into the future, and remembering is the act of recalling a fact that has already been known.  Further, the theory states that if knowledge is forgotten at one time, it cannot be considered a memory in the future. According to Goldman, if a fact is known at Time 1 but forgotten at Time 2, and then at Time 3 that the fact is perceived again but not known, at Time 3 the original fact is not a memory because there is no causal connection between the fact and the memory.

'''Art &amp; Language''' is a [[conceptual art|conceptual artists']] collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created in the late 1960s. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art. The first issue of the group's journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]], was published in November 1969 in [[Chipping Norton]] in England, and was an important influence on conceptual art in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/art-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Artists {{!}} Lisson Gallery|website=www.lissongallery.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First years==

The ''Art &amp; Language'' group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by [[Terry Atkinson]] (b. 1939), [[David Bainbridge (artist)|David Bainbridge]] (b. 1941), [[Michael Baldwin (artist)|Michael Baldwin]] (b. 1945) and [[Harold Hurrell]] (b. 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Neil Mulholland, ''The Cultural Devolution: art in Britain in the late twentieth century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p165. {{ISBN|0-7546-0392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These four artists began their collaboration around 1966 while they were art teachers in [[Coventry]]. The name of the group was derived from their journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]], originally created as a work conversation in 1966. The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created conceptual art as part of their discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/art-and-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1968 and 1982, the group grew to nearly fifty people. Among the first to join were critic and art historian, [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], and artist [[Mel Ramsden]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p47. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the early 1970s, individuals including [[Ian Burn]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Preston Heller]], [[Graham Howard]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Andrew Menard]], and [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] joined the group. Two collaborators from Coventry, [[Philip Pilkington]] and [[David Rushton]], followed.
The relative degree of anonymity held within the group continues to have historical significance in the art community. Due to an uncertainty of the exact member lists, it is hard to know unequivocally not only who all of the contributors were but also what their exact contributions were.

The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/artlanguage.html|title=Art &amp; Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Volume 1, Number 1, May 1969) is subtitled ''The Journal of Conceptual Art''.  By the second issue (Volume 1, Number 2, February 1970), it became clear that there were conceptual art pieces and conceptual artists for whom and to whom the journal did not speak. In order to better encompass the purpose of the journal, the title was abandoned. Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]] had, however, brought to light the beginning of a new art movement. It was the first [[wikt:imprint|imprint]] to identify a public entity called ''[[Conceptual art|Conceptual Art]].'' The journal was the first of its kind to serve the theoretical and conversational interests of a community of artists and critics, who were also its producers and users. While that community was far from a unanimous agreement as to how to define the nature of conceptual art, the editors and most of its historic contributors shared similar opinions about other art movements. Conceptual art was critical of [[modernism]] for its bureaucracy and its historicism, and of [[minimalism]] for its philosophical conservatism. The practice of conceptual art, especially in its early years of origin, was primarily based on theory, and its form, predominately textual.

As the distribution of the journal and the teaching practices of the editors and others contributors expanded, the conversation grew to include more people. In England, by 1971, artists and critics including [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], [[Philip Pilkington]], [[David Rushton]], [[Lynn Lemaster]], [[Sandra Harrison]], [[Graham Howard]] and [[Paul Wood (artist)|Paul Wood]] had joined. Around the same time in New York, [[Michael Corris]] joined, followed by [[Paula Ramsden]], [[Mayo Thompson]], [[Christine Kozlov]], Preston Heller, [[Andrew Menard]] and [[Kathryn Bigelow]].

The name ''Art &amp; Language'' remained precarious due to the various interpretations of both the many pieces of art and the purpose of the group. Its significance, or instrumentality, varied from person to person, alliance to alliance, discourse to discourse, and from those in New York who produced ''The Fox'' (1974–1976), for example, to those engaged in music projects and those who continued the Journal's edition. There was disagreement among members, and by 1976, there was a growing sense of divide that eventually led to competing individualities and varied concerns.

Throughout the 1970s, ''Art &amp; Language'' dealt with questions about art production and attempted a shift from conventional "nonlinguistic" forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, to more theoretically text-based works. The group often took argumentative positions against such prevailing views of critics like [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]].
The ''Art &amp; Language'' group that exhibited in the international ''[[Documenta 5]]'' exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by ''Art &amp; Language'' members.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen, Hazel Gardiner, ''Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice'', Intellect Books, 2009, p104. {{ISBN|1-84150-248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Art &amp; Language==
Burn and Ramsden co-founded ''The Society for Theoretical Art'' and ''Analysis in New York'' in the late 1960s. They joined ''Art &amp; Language'' in 1970-71. ''New York Art &amp; Language'' became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p48. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Beveridge]] and [[Carol Condé]], who had been peripheral members of the group in New York, returned to Canada where they worked with trade unions and community groups. In 1977, Ian Burn returned to Australia and Mel Ramsden to the United Kingdom.

==Late 1970s==

By the end of the 1970s, the group was essentially reduced to Baldwin, Harrison, and Ramsden with the occasional participation of [[Mayo Thompson]] and his group [[Red Crayola]]. The political analysis and development within the group resulted in several members leaving the group to work in more activist-oriented political occupations. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions. Other members from the United Kingdom drifted off into a variety of creative, academic and sometimes "politicized" activities.

At the beginning of the 1970s, there were about thirty members. The ''Art &amp; Language'' group emphasized the use of language on the theory that language is the basis from which ideas and concepts are built. Their philosophy was that language permits index words which appear, disappear, and for some even persist, thus allowing viewers and artists alike to analyze the evolution of a word through the proposal of different definitions.

==Exhibitions and awards==
=== Awards and critics ===
In 1986, ''Art &amp; Language'' was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
In 1999, ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibited at [[MoMA PS1|PS1 MoMA]] in New York, with a major installation entitled ''The Artist Out of Work''. This was a recollection of ''Art &amp; Language''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. This exhibition closely followed the revisionist exhibition of ''Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin'' at the [[Queens Museum|Queens Museum of Art]], also in New York. The ''Art &amp; Language'' show at PS1 offered an alternative account of the antecedents and legacy of '"classic" conceptual art and reinforced a transatlantic rather than nationalistic version of events from 1968-1972. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, [[art critic]] [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote, "A quarter century ago, 'Art &amp; Language' forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, ''Seeing out loud: the Voice art columns, fall 1998-winter 2003'', Geoffrey Young, 2003, p293. {{ISBN|1-930589-17-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Permanent collections ===
Other exhibits around the world include the works of Atkinson and Baldwin (working as ''Art &amp; Language'') held in the collection of the [[Tate]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2202&amp;page=1 tate.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Papers and works relating to ''New York Art &amp; Language'' are held at the [[Getty Research Institute]], Los Angeles. 

In March 2011, [[Philippe Méaille]] loaned 800 artworks of the ''Art &amp; Language'' collective to the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]], also known as MACBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/390089-un-tresor-al-macba.html?piwik_campaign=rss&amp;piwik_kwd=mesCultura Un tresor al Macba]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the [[:fr:Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire|Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire]] and Philippe Méaille signed a long term lease agreement for the [[Château de Montsoreau]] to promote contemporary art in the [[Loire Valley]].

==Theoretical installations==

''Art &amp; Language'' and the ''[[Jackson Pollock Bar]]'' collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the ''Art &amp; Language &amp; Luhmann'' symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für Sozial Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium saw the intervention of speakers including [[Catherine David]], who prepared the Documenta X, and [[Peter Weibl]], artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of a ''Art &amp; Language'' text produced in playback by the ''Jackson Pollock Bar''. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt. Using [[lip sync]], the actors used pre-recorded text for a "New Conceptual" conversation. Ever since this collaboration, each new ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibition has been joined by a ''Jackson Pollock Bar'' theoretical installation.

[[Atheism]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|निरीश्वरवाद}},  {{IAST|''nir-īśvara-vāda''}}, lit. "statement of no [[Ishvara|Lord]]", "doctrine of godlessness") or disbelief in [[Deity|God or gods]] has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] streams of [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosophies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-05-22/edit-page/28331091_1_god-acceptance-shankara |title = The Speaking Tree – The Atheistic Roots of Hindu Philosophy|work = [[The Times of India]]|date = 22 May 2004|last = Daga|first = Mahesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indian philosophy]], three schools of thought are commonly referred to as ''nastika'' for rejecting the doctrine of Vedas: [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Cārvāka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3215570/The-tradition-atheism-India-goes-2-000-years-m-proud-that.html|title=The tradition of atheism in India goes back 2,000 years. I'm proud to be a part of that|work = The Daily Mail |author = Palash Krishna Mehrotra|date = 29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism is a religion, but also a philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Make-space-for-true-values-of-Hinduism/articleshow/46972987.cms|title=Make space for true values of Hinduism|date = 19 April 2015|work = Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. ix, ''The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning'' By Eva Rudy Jansen&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] and [[Mimamsa]] while not rejecting either [[the Vedas]] or the [[Brahman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyo.in/lifestyle/atheism-schools-indian-philosophy-jainism-buddhism-materialism-religion-vedas/story/1/5904.html|title=Why Indian philosophy is incomplete without atheism|work = Daily O|date= 27 August 2015|author = Hari Ravikumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically reject a personal God, creator God, or a God with attributes. While Samkhya and Yoga rejected the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God, Mimamsa argued that the Vedas could not have been authored by a deity.

Though some schools of thought view the path of the atheist as difficult to follow in matters of [[spirituality]], it is still a valid one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chakravarti |first=Sitansu |title=Hinduism, a way of life |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1991 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71 |isbn=978-81-208-0899-7 |quote=According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is a very difficult one to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' ("pious, orthodox") refers to the systems of thought which admit the validity of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Pruthi"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pruthi| title = Vedic civilization – Culture and civilization series| publisher = Discovery Publishing House| year = 2004| page = 214| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z3ksBrWoZm0C&amp;pg=PA214| isbn = 978-81-7141-875-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit ''{{IAST|asti}}'' means "there is", and ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' (per [[Pāṇini]] 4.2.60) derives from the verb, meaning "one who says ''{{IAST|'asti'}}''". Technically, in [[Hindu philosophy]] the term {{IAST|[[Astika and Nastika|Āstika]]}} refers only to acceptance of authority of Vedas, not belief in the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kapoor| first = Subodh| title = The Systems of Indian Philosophy| publisher = Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd| page = 6| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FWLRyXBzgsoC&amp;pg=PA6| isbn = 978-81-7755-887-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, though not accepted universally, ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' is sometimes translated as "theist" and ''{{IAST|Nāstika}}'' as "[[atheist]]", assuming the rejection of Vedas to be synonymous to the rejection of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Monier-Williams|first1=Monier|last2=Leumann|first2=Ernst|last3=Cappeller|first3=Carl|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymological And Philologically Arranged With Special Reference To Cognate Indo-european Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUKaou4KcMC&amp;pg=PA161|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0369-1|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation by [[Swami Vivekananda]] states "As certain religions of the world say that a man who does not believe in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the Vedanta says, a man who does not believe in himself is an atheist. Not believing in the glory of our own soul is what the Vedanta calls atheism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advaitaashrama.org/cw/volume_2/practical_vedanta_and_other_lectures/practical_vedanta_part_i.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
The [[Rig Veda]], the oldest of the [[Vedas]], deals with significant skepticism around the fundamental question of a creator God and the creation of the universe. It does not, at many instances, categorically accept the existence of a creator God. [[Nasadiya Sukta]] (''Creation   Hymn'') in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=World  scriptures: an   introduction to comparative religions| first=Kramer|   last=Kenneth| isbn=978-0-8091-2781-8|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&amp;pg=PA34 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Subodh Varma | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-06/vintage-wisdom/28377203_1_vedas-philosophy-speculation |title=The gods came afterwards |publisher=  [[Times of India]] |date= May 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation? &lt;br/&gt;The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.}}
The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]], [[Isha Upanishad|Isha]], [[Mundaka Upanishad|Mundaka]] (in which [[Brahman]] is everything and "no-thing") and especially the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]s have also been interpreted as atheistic because of their stress on the subjective self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bhatt| first = Chetan| title = Liberation and purity: race, new religious movements and the ethics of postmodernity| publisher = [[Routledge]]| year = 1997| page = 160| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VukJs0ik0rUC&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-1-85728-424-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mimamsa]] was a [[Philosophical realism|realistic]], pluralistic school of philosophy which was concerned with the [[exegesis]] of the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Vitsaxis"&gt;{{citation|last=Vitsaxis|first=Vassilis|title=Thought and Faith: The concept of divinity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52b-A2l7QbwC&amp;pg=PA517|year=2009|publisher=Somerset Hall Press|isbn=978-1-935244-05-9|pages=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core text of the school was the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]] of [[Jaimini]] (c. 200 BCE–200 CE). Mimamsa philosophers believed that the [[revelation]] of the Vedas was sacred, authorless (''[[apaurusheyatva]]'') and infallible, and that it was essential to preserve the sanctity of the Vedic ritual to maintain dharma (cosmic order).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{citation|last=King|first=Richard|title=Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uca8R72W8iQC&amp;pg=PA52|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-0954-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}} As a consequence of the belief in sanctity of the ritual, Mimamsas rejected the notion of God in any form.&lt;ref name="Vitsaxis"/&gt; Later commentators of the Mimamsa sutras such as [[Prabhākara]] (c. 7th century CE) advanced arguments against the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bales|first=Eugene F.|title=A Ready Reference to Philosophy East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34cjS0M1rFIC&amp;pg=PA198|year=1987|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-6640-1|page=198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Warder|first=Anthony Kennedy|title=A Course In Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zw1UD1Mj9DwC&amp;pg=PA187|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1244-4|page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early Mimamsa not only did not accept God but said that human action itself was enough to create the necessary circumstances for the enjoyment of its fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1 = [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] |author2 = Poolla Tirupati Raju | title = The concept of man: a study in comparative philosophy| publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin| year = 1960| page = 305| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uLsAAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the [[Samkhyakarika]] (c. 350–450 CE) of Iśvarakṛṣṇa.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;{{rp|63}} The Samkhyakarika is silent on the issue of Isvara's existence or nonexistence, although first millennium commentators such as Gaudapada understand the text as compatible with some concept of God. However, the Samkhya Sutra (14th c. CE) and its commentaries explicitly attempt to disprove God's existence through reasoned argument.&lt;ref name = nicholson&gt;{{cite book|last = Nicholson|first = Andrew J.|chapter = Hindu Disproofs of God: Refuting Vedāntic Theism in the Sāṃkhya Sūtra|title =  Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy|date = 2016|chapter-url = http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199314621-e-29|chapter-url-access = subscription|editor-first = Jonardon|editor-last = Ganeri |doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.013.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cārvāka]], a materialistic and atheistic school of Indian philosophy, had developed a systematic philosophy by the 6th century CE. Cārvākas rejected metaphysical concepts like [[reincarnation]], the [[afterlife]], an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of [[Yajna|religious rites]], other worlds (heaven and hell), fate, and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Cārvākas also refused to ascribe supernatural causes to natural phenomena. Cārvāka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna.

[[Ājīvika]]s was a movement (extinct from at least the 13th century CE) whose founder, [[Makkhali Gosala]], was a contemporary of Mahavira and [[Gautama Buddha]] (the central figures of Jainism and Buddhism, respectively). Gosala and his followers also denied the existence of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=History and Doctrines of the {{IAST|Ājīvikas}}: A Vanished Indian Religion|last = Balsham| first = B.L.|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BiGQzc5lRGYC&amp;| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| year = 2003| isbn = 81-208-1204-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against God ==
Mimamsas argued that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the [[Veda]]s or a God to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further thought that the Gods named in the [[Veda]]s had no physical existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. In this regard, the power of the mantras was what was seen as the power of Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mimamsas reasoned that an incorporeal God could not author the Vedas, for he would not have the organs of speech to utter words. An embodied God could not author the Vedas either because such a God would be subject to the natural limitations of sensory knowledge and therefore, would not be able to produce supernatural revelations like the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Cowell|first1=E.

Samkhya gave the following arguments against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:&lt;ref name="nicholson" /&gt;
* If the existence of [[Karma (Hinduism)|karma]] is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
* Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of [[prakriti]] and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the [[Vedas]], according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.
* Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya's notion of higher self.
* Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of prakriti as the origin of the world, not God.
Therefore, Samkhya maintained not only that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God, but that God as normally understood--an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent creator who is free from suffering--cannot exist.

[[File:blackstones-ratio.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[William Blackstone]] with a quote of Blackstone's ratio.]]

In [[criminal law]], '''Blackstone's ratio''' (also known as '''the Blackstone ratio''' or '''Blackstone's formulation''') is the idea that:

{{quote|It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/blackstone-commentaries-on-the-laws-of-england-in-four-books-vol-2/simple|title=Commentaries on the laws of England|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As expressed by the English jurist [[William Blackstone]] in his seminal work, ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', published in the 1760s.

The idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate. There is also a long pre-history of similar sentiments going back centuries in a variety of legal traditions. The message that government and the courts must err on the side of innocence has remained constant.{{Citation needed|reason=This is both a sweeping declaration unlimited in time and unsupported by the text below, and unclear|date=October 2018}}

==In Blackstone's ''Commentaries''==
The phrase, repeated widely and usually in isolation, comes from a longer passage, the fourth in a series of five discussions of policy by Blackstone:

{{quote|Fourthly, all presumptive evidence of felony should be admitted cautiously, for the law holds that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer. And Sir Matthew Hale in particular lays down two rules most prudent and necessary to be observed: 1. Never to convict a man for stealing the goods of a person unknown, merely because he will give no account how he came by them, unless an actual felony be proved of such goods; and, 2. Never to convict any person of murder or manslaughter till at least the body be found dead; on account of two instances he mentions where persons were executed for the murder of others who were then alive but missing.}}

The phrase was absorbed by the British legal system, becoming a maxim by the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; Re Hobson, 1 Lew. C. C. 261, 168 Eng. Rep. 1034 (1831) (Holroyd, J.).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also absorbed into American common law, cited repeatedly by that country's Founding Fathers, later becoming a standard drilled into law students all the way into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;G. Tim Aynesworth, An illogical truism, Austin Am.-Statesman, April 18, 1996, at A14.  Specifically, it is "drilled into [first year law students'] head[s] over and over again."  Hurley Green, Sr., Shifting Scenes, Chi. Independent Bull., January 2, 1997, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ben-franklin-blackstone.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]]'s version of Blackstone's Ratio is very commonly quoted]]
Other commentators have echoed the principle; [[Benjamin Franklin]] stated it as, "it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer".&lt;ref&gt;9 Benjamin Franklin, Works 293 (1970), Letter from Benjamin Franklin to Benjamin Vaughan (14 March 1785)&lt;/ref&gt;

Defending [[British Army|British soldiers]] charged with murder for their role in the [[Boston Massacre]], [[John Adams]] also expanded upon the rationale behind Blackstone's Ratio when he stated: 

{{quote|It is more important that innocence should be protected, than it is, that guilt be punished; for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world, that all of them cannot be punished.... when innocence itself, is brought to the bar and condemned, especially to die, the subject will exclaim, 'it is immaterial to me whether I behave well or ill, for virtue itself is no security.' And if such a sentiment as this were to take hold in the mind of the subject that would be the end of all security whatsoever}}

Given that Hale and Fortescue in English law had made similar statements previously, some kind of explanation is required for the enormous popularity and influence of the phrase across all the Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Cullerne Bown has argued that it "...can be seen as a new kind of buttress of the law that was required in a new kind of society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1365712718798387|title=Killing Kaplanism: Flawed methodologies, the standard of proof and modernity|publisher=The International Journal of Evidence &amp; Proof}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quantitativejurisprudence.com|title="Quantitative Jurisprudence" blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic expressions of the principle==

The immediate precursors of Blackstone's Ratio in English law were articulations by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]] (about 100 years earlier) and [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] (about 200 years before that), both influential jurists in their time.

Hale wrote, "for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die." Fortescue's ''De Laudibus Legum Angliae'' (c. 1470) states that "one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally." &lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;Alexander Volokh, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 300 years before Fortescue, the Jewish legal theorist [[Maimonides]] wrote that "the Exalted One has shut this door" against the use of presumptive evidence, for "it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."&lt;ref name=Volokh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269-271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein(Rabbi.)2006"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Goldstein
|first=Warren
|authorlink=Warren Goldstein

|isbn=978-1-58330-732-8
|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would progressively lead to convictions merely "according to the judge's caprice" and was expounding on both [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:7 (''"the innocent and righteous slay thou not''") and an Islamic text, [Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi.

[Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi quotes Muhammad as saying, "Avoid legal punishments as far as possible, and if there are any doubts in the case then use them, for it is better for a judge to err towards leniency than towards punishment".  Another similar expression reads, "Invoke doubtfulness in evidence during prosecution to avoid legal punishments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadith.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=192&amp;TOCID=951&amp;BookID=37&amp;PID=2650 ''Exegesis of Sunan at-Tirmidhi - the Book of Punishments''],  Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi, 884 C.E.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other statements, some even older, which seem to express similar sentiments have been compiled by Volokh. A vaguely similar principle, echoing the number ten and the idea that it would be preferable that many guilty people escape consequences than a few innocents suffer them, appears as early as the narrative of the Cities of the Plain in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (at 18:23-32),&lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;Alexander Volokh, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
{{Biblesource | Genesis | 18:23 | WEB | text=Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?}} ... {{Biblesource | Genesis | 18:32 | WEB | text=What if ten are found there?" He [The Lord] said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."}}
}}

With respect to the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom,]] the text describes it as ultimately being destroyed, but only after the rescuing of most of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s family, the aforementioned "righteous" among a city or overwhelming wickedness who, despite the overwhelming guilt of their fellows, were sufficient by their mere presence to warrant a "stay of execution" of sorts for the entire region, slated to be destroyed for being uniformly a place of sin. The text continues, 

{{quote|
{{Biblesource | Genesis | 19:27-28 | WEB | text=27 Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord. 28 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.}}

{{Biblesource | Genesis | 19:29 | WEB | text=29 So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.}}
}}

Similarly, on 3 October 1692, while decrying the [[Salem witch trials]], [[Increase Mather]] adapted Fortescue's statement and wrote, "It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits |year=1693 |page= 66 |url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/mather/mather.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In current scholarship==

Particularly in the United States, Blackstone’s ratio continues to be an active source of debate in jurisprudence. For example Daniel Epps and Laura Appleman exchanged arguments against and in favour of its continuing influence in the Harvard Law Review in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Consequences of Error in Criminal Justice |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/02/the-consequences-of-error-in-criminal-justice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Tragedy of Errors: Blackstone, Procedural Asymmetry, and Criminal Justice |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/02/a-tragedy-of-errors-blackstone-procedural-asymmetry-and-criminal-justice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints in politics==
[[Authoritarianism|Authoritarian]] personalities tend to take the opposite view; [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is believed to have stated that "it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape".&lt;ref name=Volokh /&gt;  [[Pol Pot]] made similar remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Locard, Henri. ''Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar''. Silkworm Books, 2004. pp. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] referenced this principle while saying that it is not applicable to the context of preventing terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.faz.net/s/Rub594835B672714A1DB1A121534F010EE1/Doc~E307DE59120324224ACCD7CA59A6F1C17~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |title=Schäuble: Zur Not auch gegen Unschuldige vorgehen |publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former American [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] said that his support of American use of "enhanced interrogation techniques"  against suspected terrorists was unchanged by the fact that 25% of CIA detainees subject to that treatment were later proven to be innocent, including one who died of hypothermia in [[CIA]] custody.  "I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that in fact were innocent."  Asked whether the 25% margin was too high, Cheney responded, "I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. ...  I'd do it again in a minute."&lt;ref&gt;  [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/cheney-alright-with-torture-of-innocent-people.html "Dick Cheney Simply Does Not Care That the CIA Tortured Innocent People"], ''[[New York Magazine]]''. December 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal columnist [[Ezra Klein]] supported California's SB 967 "Affirmative Consent" law with the same reasoning as Cheney's supported "enhanced interrogation techniques". While claiming the law was "terrible" and could be used to punish people who did not commit rape, Klein states "its overreach is precisely its value" and "ugly problems don't always have pretty solutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6966847/yes-means-yes-is-a-terrible-bill-and-i-completely-support-it|title="Yes Means Yes" is a terrible law, and I completely support it|first=Ezra|last=Klein|date=13 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Volokh cites an apparent questioning of the principle, with the tale of a Chinese professor who responds, "Better for whom?"&lt;ref name="Volokh"/&gt;

'''CoSMoS''' was a UK funded research project seeking to build capacity in generic modelling tools and simulation techniques for complex systems. Its acronym stands for Complex Systems Modelling and Simulation.
This was a four-year project, running from 2007 to 2011 as a collaboration between the [[University of York]] and [[University of Kent|Kent]], with further collaborations from the [[University of Abertay Dundee]] and [[Bristol Robotics Laboratory]].

== History ==
Collaboration between the universities of York and Kent started with the [http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna TUNA project], a feasibility study looking at the requirements for developing networks of [[nanite]]s that behave safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = TUNA - Theory Underpinning Nanotech Assemblers| url = http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna/| accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project involved researchers from York, Kent and Surrey. TUNA's outcomes were both conceptual and practical. An example of theoretical contribution consists of investigators showing that [[Emergence|emergent properties]] do not [[Refinement (computing)|refine]]
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first = Fiona  | last = Polack  | authorlink =   | author2 = Stepney, S.  | title = Emergent properties do not refine  | booktitle = REFINE 2005 workshop  | pages = 163–181  | date = July 2005  | publisher = Elsevier  | location = Guildford  | volume = 137  | number = 2  | series = ENTSC  | url = http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fiona/PUBS/REFINE05.pdf  | accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but gave insights into the engineering of emergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first = Susan  | last = Stepney  | authorlink =   | author2 = Polack, F.| author3 =  Turner, H.  | title = Engineering emergence  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems  | pages = 89–97  | year = 2006  | publisher = IEEE Computer Society  | url = http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna/outputs/Stepney-iceccs06.pdf  | accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Practical results were obtained through the use of a blood clotting case-study. This led to the development of a [[Process-oriented programming|process-oriented]], large-scale simulation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 3D Blood Clotting| url = https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/plas/wiki/3D_Blood_Clotting| accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented in [[occam-pi]].

In the 18th and 19th centuries, coloured cockades were used in Europe to show the allegiance of their wearers to some political faction, their rank, or as part of a servant's livery.&lt;ref name="google31"&gt;{{cite book|title=Patriots Against Fashion: Clothing and Nationalism in Europe’s Age of Revolutions|author=Maxwell, A.|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781137277145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLpCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parades and the Politics of the Street: Festive Culture in the Early American Republic|author=Newman, S.P.|date=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press, Incorporated|isbn=9780812200478|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvKSSSZzrBoC&amp;pg=PA161|page=161|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military uniform]]s would use cockades as well.

A cockade was pinned on the side of a man's [[tricorne]] or [[cocked hat]], or on his lapel. Women could also wear it on their hat or in their hair.

In pre-revolutionary France, the cockade of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty was all white.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The White Cockade; Or, Bourbon Songster: Being a Patriotic Collection of Songs on the Downfall of Tyranny, and Restoration of Louis XVIII., Etc. &amp;#91;A Chap-book.&amp;#93;|date=1814|publisher=J.

During the 1780 [[Gordon Riots]] in London the blue cockade became a symbol of anti-government feelings and was worn by most of the rioters.&lt;ref name="google10"&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Intervention in Britain: From the Gordon Riots to the Gibraltar Incident|author=Babington, A.|date=2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317397717|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-SoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|page=21|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google11"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Covent Garden Journal ...|author=Stockdale, J.J.|date=1810|publisher=J.J.

During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Continental Army]] initially wore cockades of various colors as an ''ad hoc'' form of rank insignia, as General [[George Washington]] wrote:

{{quote |As the Continental Army has unfortunately no uniforms, and consequently many inconveniences must arise from not being able to distinguish the commissioned officers from the privates, it is desired that some badge of distinction be immediately provided; for instance that the field officers may have red or pink colored cockades in their hats, the captains yellow or buff, and the [[subalterns]] green.&lt;ref name="defense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42199|publisher=archive.defense.gov|title=Defense.gov News Article: Insignia: The Way You Tell Who's Who in the Military|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google18"&gt;{{cite book|title=American archives|author=Force, P.|date=1844|publisher=Рипол Классик|isbn=9785885286961|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5oTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA1745|pages=2–1745|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before long however, the Continental Army reverted to wearing the black cockade they inherited from the British. Later, when [[Franco-American relations#France and the American Revolution|France became an ally of the United States]], the Continental Army pinned the white cockade of the French ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' onto their old black cockade; the French reciprocally pinned the black cockade onto their white cockade, as a mark of the French-American alliance. The black-and-white cockade thus became known as the "Union Cockade".&lt;ref name="google19"&gt;{{cite book|title=LincolnÂ?s 90-Day Volunteers 1861: From Fort Sumter to First Bull Run|author1=Field, R.|author2=Hook, A.|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781782009214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKWqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|page=47|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google20"&gt;{{cite book|title=Early American Drama|author=Richards, J.H.|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=9781101177211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLpLlr1gBBoC&amp;pg=PA68|page=68|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google21"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln's Citadel: The Civil War in Washington, DC|author=Winkle, K.J.|date=2013|publisher=W.

In the [[Storming of the Bastille]], [[Camille Desmoulins]] initially encouraged the revolutionary crowd to wear green; this colour was later rejected as it was associated with the reactionary [[Charles X of France|Count of Artois]]. Instead revolutionaries would wear cockades with the traditional colours of the [[Coat of arms of Paris|arms of Paris]], red and blue. Later the Bourbon white was added to this cockade - thus producing the original [[tricolore cockade|''Tricolore'' cockade]].&lt;ref name="google22"/&gt; Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction—although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.

==Cockades of the Confederate States==
Echoing their use when Americans rebelled against Britain, cockades – usually made with blue ribbons and worn on clothing or hats – were widespread tokens of [[Slave and free states|southern]] support for [[Secession in the United States|secession]] preceding the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865.&lt;ref&gt;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/female-partisans/ New York Times blogs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cockades of the European military==
[[File:Kokarde Schwarz-Weiß-Rot 1897.jpg|thumb|200px|A metal cockade on the swivel of a [[Pickelhaube]] helmet.]]

During the [[Napoleonic wars]], the armies of [[France]] and [[Russia]], had the imperial French cockade or the larger cockade of [[St. George]] pinned on the front of their [[shako]]s.&lt;ref name="google29"&gt;{{cite book|title=Napoleon's Mercenaries: Foreign Units in the French Army Under the Consulate and Empire, 1799-1814|author=Dempsey, G.|date=2002|publisher=Greenhill Books|isbn=9781853674884|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUuaBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267|page=267|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second [[German Empire]] (1870–1918) used two cockades on each army headgear: one (black-white-red) for the empire; the other for one of the monarchies the empire was composed of, which had used their own colors long before. The only exceptions were the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Württemberg, having preserved the right to keep their own armed forces which were not integrated in the Imperial Army. Their only cockades were either white and blue (Bavaria) or black-red-black (Württemberg).&lt;ref name="google30"&gt;{{cite book|title=MILITARY UNIFORMS IN EUROPE 1900 - 2000 Volume One|author=Kidd, R.S.|date=2013|publisher=LULU Press|isbn=9781291187441|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FE4DBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|page=5|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google32"&gt;{{cite book|title=Germany at War: 400 Years of Military History &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;: 400 Years of Military History|author=D, D.T.Z.P.|date=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598849813|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCWMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA494|page=494|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France began the first [[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909-1942)|Air Service]] in 1909 and soon picked the traditional French cockade as the first national emblem, now usually termed a [[roundel]], on military aircraft. During World War I, other countries adopted national cockades and used these coloured emblems as roundels on their military aircraft. These designs often bear an additional central device or emblem to further identify national aircraft, those from the [[French navy]] bearing a black anchor within the French cockade.&lt;ref name="google35"&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. Air Service in the Great War, 1917-1919|author=Cooke, J.J.|date=1996|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780275948627|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pvHjd79SgzIC&amp;pg=PA202|page=202|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14674">The '''collective action theory''' was first published by [[Mancur Olson]] in 1965. He argues that any group of individuals attempting to provide a public good has troubles to do so efficiently. On the one hand individuals have incentives to "[[Free rider problem|free-ride]]" on the efforts of others in certain groups and on the other hand the size of a group is of high importance and difficult to optimally determine.

== Basic theory of groups  ==

=== Purpose of organizations  ===

The primary function of an organization is the furtherance of common interests of groups of individuals. In the normal case an organization will go down if it does not foster the common interest of its members. If such a common interest is existing every unorganized action of an individual will either fail in advancing the common interest at all or will not be able to advance the interest in a suitable way.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 6 f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, each member of the organization has its own individual interests which differ from the interests of other members. These individual goods can also be provided by an organization (e. g. the state provides its citizens with electric power which is an individual good).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public goods  ===

[[Public good]]s bear common and collective benefits. Therefore, one of the basic goals of an organization is to provide its members with public goods. Public or “common” goods are freely accessible by each member of the group. Olson further defines the public good as any good that “cannot feasibly be withheld from other members of the group when one member of the group consumes the good”&lt;ref name="olson p14"&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; - even if those members did not contribute to the provision of the good. To provide an example Olson assumes that the state’s taxes were voluntary for each citizen. In this case it would not be feasible to keep certain members who did not pay their taxes away from activities like police protection, law and order or the state’s defense.&lt;ref name="olson p14" /&gt;

Public goods can be further divided into ''inclusive public goods'' and ''exclusive public goods''.

| A public good is called inclusive public good in nonmarket situations where the provision of the good expands when the group gets larger, thus also expands.&lt;br&gt; 
| A public good is called exclusive public good in market situations where the members attempt to reduce the size of their group as there is only a fixed and thus limited amount of the gain from the good.&lt;ref&gt;The public good in a market situation, where at least two firms are rivaling, is a higher price for the product they sell. If then one firm is able to sell more at that price, the other firms must sell less, so it can be seen that the gain is fixed. Cf. Olson (1971), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Traditional theory  ===

Generally the traditional theory of groups does not regard the size of a group. Hence there is no distinction between large and small groups. Every group has the same basic character and is equally effective in fulfilling its function of fostering the main interests of its members. The traditional theory of groups can be divided into two basic variants which are briefly introduced in the following section.

==== Casual theory  ====

This variant of the traditional theory says that private organizations and groups are ubiquitous because of a human affinity to form associations. According to the theory this behavior can be explained by the human instinct to form herds to get stronger and to be able to fight other herds.&lt;ref name="olson p17"&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 17 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Formal theory  ====

In contrast to the casual variant the formal theory is not based on any instincts of human beings. The focus of the formal variant lies on the “evolution of modern, industrial societies”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution starts with family and other kinship groups which form the majority of groups under primitive circumstances. As society evolves secondary groups emerge which gradually absorb the social functions that had been provided by the kinship- and family-type units. Often these new groups reach a higher rate of interaction and importance than the primary groups. Examples for those secondary groups would be labor unions, large companies, states, churches or universities.&lt;ref name="olson p17" /&gt;

== Olson's theory of collective action ==

=== Difficulty of collective action  ===

A single individual barely has influence on an organization’s situation, but every individual is able to rejoice in every improvement, regardless of whether he/she has contributed to it, a "conflict between collectively and individually best action"&lt;ref&gt;Tuomela (1992), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; is existing. Nobody is interested in bearing the expenses for the improvement, instead everyone is trying to profit from the public good in a greedy way.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eek, Biel (2003), p. 196 f; Coleman (1966), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Olson's theory explores the market failures where individual consumer rationality and firms' profit-seeking do not lead to efficient provision of the public goods, i. e. where another level of provision would provide a higher gain at lower expenses.&lt;br&gt;The basic problem consists of the fact that within the scope of Olson’s model individuals, acting [[Homo oeconomicus|economically rational]], do not have an interest in contributing to the provision of a public good. This is even the case if they themselves are able to utilize the good after it has been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Examples for "free-riding" problems in collective actions can be found in Tuomela (1992), p.172-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective good provision  ===

First of all some general remarks are made here concerning the provision of a good. The costs rise with an increasing output, of public goods as well as of private goods. Moreover, there are fixed costs, this means that the first produced unit is the most expensive one. Furthermore, the difficulties in coordination and the [[Transaction Cost Economics and IOS|transaction costs]] rise with the group size. Ergo, the average costs feature a U-shaped course. Lastly, every single individual’s share of the overall profit depends on the quantity of individuals and on the individual utilization.

In the context of collective action the focus is on the provision of a collective good. The following&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the value to the individual &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; divided by the value to the group &lt;math&gt;V_g&lt;/math&gt;, thus the share of the group gain which the individual gets. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the rate or level at which the public good is provided. &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are the costs of the collective good, more precisely a function of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;C = f(T)&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; applies for the optimal amount of a collective good to be obtained by an individual – if he/she obtains any:&lt;ref name="olson p24"&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; F_i * \frac{dV_g}{dT} = \frac{dC}{dT} &lt;/math&gt;

This means that the optimal amount of a collective good is found when the rate of gain to the group, multiplied by the share of the group gain which the individual gets, equals the rate of increase of the total costs of the public good. Expressed in other words this means the optimal amount is reached when the rate of gain to the group exceeds the rate of increase in cost by the same coefficient that the group gain exceeds the gain to the individual as&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac{\frac{dV_g}{dT}}{\frac{dC}{dT}} = \frac{1}{F_i} = \frac{V_g}{V_i} &lt;/math&gt;

More important than how much of a collective good is provided, is the question if the public good is provided at all. It becomes clear that, “at the optimum point for the individual acting independently”&lt;ref&gt;Olson (1971), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; – described in the last paragraph – the collective good is provided if &lt;math&gt; F_i &gt; \frac{C}{V_g} &lt;/math&gt;, for if &lt;math&gt; F_i = \frac{V_i}{V_g} &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V_i &gt; C&lt;/math&gt;. So it can be seen that the gain to the individual exceeds the costs for providing the good. In other words, the total gain exceeds the total costs at least as much as the total gain exceeds the gain to the individual.&lt;ref name="olson p24" /&gt;

This analysis can i. e. be applied to a group of firms and the [[Cournot duopoly|market theory about rivaling firms]] developed by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] can be seen as a special, more detailed case of this analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group size  ===

In contrast to the traditional theory the group size plays a decisive role in Olson’s theory. Concerning the optimal group size it has to be stated that small groups possess the tendency of suboptimal provision with public goods. But large groups often fail to provide themselves with a collective good at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller the single share of a member is the less is the optimality. This means that larger groups are less efficient. Moreover, it is important to consider not only the number of members of a group but also the size of each individual. The individual with the highest gain will most likely pay for the most part of the public good. “Normal” members will most likely not pay but nevertheless consume the public good, which is known as the so-called "free-riding",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anesi (2009), p. 198 f.&lt;/ref&gt; this can only be wiped out in groups which provide benefits only to active members. This results in the tendency of the ''exploitation of the great by the small''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 28 f.&lt;/ref&gt; An optimum can only be reached, if the marginal costs are equally high as the marginal gain. There cannot be an over-optimality as in that case some individual had to have higher marginal costs than marginal gain and would cease the payment to provide the good, which would lead to a suboptimal provision of the public good.

In the end this leads to the conclusion that even though they tend to provide a suboptimal amount of a public good smaller groups are more efficient than larger ones which fail more likely to obtain even a minimal amount of a public good the larger they are.

=== Incentives for collective action  ===

There are not only economic incentives – described in the previous paragraphs – for individuals to contribute to the provision of a public good.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 60 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; As so to say negative incentives to contribute there can e. g. be identified sanctions or social pressure. Furthermore, forced payments (taxes, etc.) are in some cases inevitable to finance public goods (e. g. law and order). But there are positive incentives as well. There might be some sort of social incentives in small groups with close contact (friendships within the group, the desire to gain prestige, etc.), which lead to an individual obtaining a public good. However, such altruistic behavior cannot be recognized in large groups. Moreover, some of the huge amount of incentives can be identified as so called ''selective incentives'' as they are able to mobilize a latent group and to differ between contributing and non-contributing individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance for interorganizational systems  ==

An [[interorganizational system]] (IOS) provides a basis to interchange information of all kinds between a minimum of two organizations, which expect many benefits from this system, subdivided in transactional,strategic and informational benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ahituv, Geri (2008), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; The above explained ''theory of collective action'' gives some important issues which have to be minded in operating an IOS in order to reduce free-riding and optimize the groups behavior:

#'''Efficiency of the group: '''Olson mentioned several observations made in practice concerning the optimal size of groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social group#Types of groups|Small groups]]&lt;/ref&gt; are more efficient than bigger groups, whereas small groups are defined as groups between four and seven members. This means for IOS not having too many participants, neither within a system nor in other parts of the organization (e. g. many persons in front of a terminal).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Olson (1971), p. 53 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Having in mind that especially larger organizations try to improve their performance by using IOS this insight should be remembered when it comes to group composition.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ahituv, Geri (2008), p. 355 f.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Incentives:''' Participants of various type of groups behave in different ways when incentives are used. Referring to the above chapter sozial incentives in a positive or negative way are only possible in smaller groups, where members are knowing each other. By using IOS it could be possible to uncover the members behavior leading to more social pressure even in larger groups. Anymore, in larger Interorganizational Systems financial aspects should be in mind to reward a member for conducing to the common welfare.
#'''Public goods:''' Naturally it is not possible to control the exploitation of the public goods, but by the usage of IOS, primarily in form of an IT-system, a [[digital rights management]] (DRM) can be provided. With it access can be denied for some members to certain areas if they are not contributing their dues. Also it is possible to share the public good in a fair way by calculating members activities within the system for the common welfare.

'''Comparative negligence''', or non-absolute [[contributory negligence]] outside the United States, is a partial legal defense that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim, based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the [[plaintiff]]'s negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Victor E.|title=Strict Liability and Comparative Negligence|journal=Tennessee Law Review|date=1974|volume=42|page=171|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/tenn42&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

== Explanation ==
Prior to the late 1960s, only a few states had adopted the system. When comparative negligence was adopted, three main versions were used. The first was called "pure" comparative negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooter|first1=Robert D.|last2=Ulen|first2=Thomas S.|title=An Economic Case for Comparative Negligence|journal=New York University Law Review|date=1986|volume=61|page=1067|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff who was 90% to blame for an accident could recover 10% of his losses. (Of course, defendants who suffered injuries in such a case could counter claim and recover 90% of losses from the other party.)

The second and third versions are lumped together in what is called "modified" comparative negligence. One variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only" if the plaintiff's negligence is "not greater than" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must not be more than 50% of the combined negligence of both parties).

The other variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only if" the plaintiff's negligence is "not as great as" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must be less than 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor difference between the two modified forms of comparative negligence is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.

== Contributory negligence doctrine ==
Some states, though, still use the [[contributory negligence]] doctrine to evaluate negligence in a tort. For instance, [[Alabama]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] continue to use contributory negligence.

Neither comparative negligence nor contributory negligence should be confused with [[joint and several liability]], which generally holds each of two or more culpable [[defendants]] responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of comparative negligence may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the design of [[radio]] broadcast systems, especially [[television]] systems, the desired-to-undesired channel ratio ('''D/U ratio''') is a measure of the strength of the broadcast signal for a particular channel compared with the strength of undesired [[broadcast signal]]s in the same channel (e.g. from other nearby transmitting stations).

{{Certainty}}

'''Determinism''' is the philosophical idea that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes. Determinism is at times understood to preclude free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do. It can also be called as [[hard determinism]] from this point of view. [[Hard determinism]] is a position on the relationship of determinism to free will. The theory holds that the universe is utterly rational because complete knowledge of any given situation assures that unerring knowledge of its future is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/determinism Determinism] Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers suggest variants around this basic definition.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;A list of a dozen varieties of determinism is provided in {{cite book |title=Free Will: The Scandal in Philosophy |author=Bob Doyle |pages=145–146 ''ff'' |isbn=0983580200 |year=2011 |publisher=I-Phi Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeA_gFfHMgoC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. The opposite of determinism is some kind of [[indeterminism]] (otherwise called nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;For example, see {{cite book |title=Freewill and determinism: a study of rival conceptions of man |author=Richard Langdon Franklin |year=1968 |publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51wIAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism often is taken to mean ''causal determinism'', which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.

Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or [[multiverse]]). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as [[compatibilistic]] (allowing the two to coexist) and [[incompatibilistic]] (denying their coexistence is a possibility). Determinism should not be confused with [[Self-determination_theory|self-determination]] of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism rarely requires that perfect [[prediction]] be practically possible.

==Varieties==
"Determinism" may commonly refer to any of the following viewpoints:

[[File:Bled (9664110474).jpg|thumb|right|140px|Many philosophical theories of determinism frame themselves with the idea that reality follows a sort of predetermined path.]]
* Causal determinism is "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature".&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hoefer |first=Carl | title=Causal Determinism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2009 edition) |date=Apr 1, 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way".&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 |date=Nov 18, 2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/moral-responsibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing in the universe that is uncaused or [[causa sui|self-caused]]. [[Historical determinism]] (a sort of [[path dependence]]) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions.&lt;ref name=StanfordIncompatibilism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ Arguments for Incompatibilism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding events&amp;mdash;a combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"/&gt; Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"/&gt;
** {{anchor|Nomological determinism}} Nomological determinism is the most common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]].&lt;ref name=laplace&gt;
[[Laplace]] posited that an omniscient observer knowing with infinite precision all the positions and velocities of every particle in the universe could predict the future entirely. For a discussion, see {{cite book |title=The Big Questions: A Short Introduction to Philosophy |author1=Robert C. Solomon |author2=Kathleen M. Higgins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekh2AKqXdqgC&amp;pg=PA232 |page=232 |isbn=0495595152 |publisher=Cengage Learning |chapter=Free will and determinism|year=2009 |edition=8th}} Another view of determinism is discussed by {{cite book |title=The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation |author=Ernest Nagel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6EycHgRfkQC&amp;pg=PA285 |pages =285–292 |chapter=§V: Alternative descriptions of physical state |quote=a theory is deterministic if, and only if, given its state variables for some initial period, the theory logically determines a unique set of values for those variables for any other period. |isbn=0915144719 |year=1999 |publisher=Hackett |edition=2nd }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being [[Indeterminism|physical indeterminism]]).
** [[Necessitarianism]] is closely related to the causal determinism described above. It is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be. [[Leucippus]] claimed there were no uncaused events, and that everything occurs for a reason and by necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Leucippus, Fragment 569 - from Fr. 2 Actius I, 25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H. James Birx"|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture |title=Predeterminism |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |doi=10.4135/9781412963961.n191 |pages=1035–1036|chapter=Evolution, Chemical |isbn=9781412941648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Predeterminism |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/predeterminism |accessdate=20 December 2012 |date=April 2010 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}.

In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of determinism.&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

* [[Fatalism]] is normally distinguished from "determinism",&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ SEP, Causal Determinism]&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of teleological determinism. Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future. [[Fate]] has arbitrary power, and need not follow any causal or otherwise deterministic [[law]]s.&lt;ref name="StanfordIncompatibilism"/&gt; Types of fatalism include hard [[theological determinism]] and the idea of [[predestination]], where there is a [[God]] who determines all that humans will do. This may be accomplished either by knowing their actions in advance, via some form of [[omniscience]]&lt;ref name = "Fischer"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

* [[Theological determinism]] is a form of determinism that holds that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are [[destiny|destined]] to occur given its [[omniscience]].

A weaker version holds that, though not predestined to happen, everything that happens has been eternally known by virtue of the divine foreknowledge of an omniscient divinity. If this divinity is also omnipotent, as in the case of the Judeo-Christian religions, this weaker version is hard to distinguish from the previous one because, though able to prevent what happens and knowing that it is going to happen, God lets it happen. To this, advocates of free will reply that God permits it to happen in order to make room for the free will of humans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;mdash;"because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed".&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism|quote=Theological determinism constitutes a fifth kind of determinism. There are two types of theological determinism, both compatible with scientific and metaphysical determinism. In the first, God determines everything that happens, either in one all-determining single act at the initial creation of the universe or through continuous divine interactions with the world. Either way, the consequence is that everything that happens becomes God's action, and determinism is closely linked to divine action and God's omnipotence. According to the second type of theological determinism, God has perfect knowledge of everything in the universe because God is omniscient. And, as some say, because God is outside of time, God has the capacity of knowing past, present, and future in one instance. This means that God knows what will happen in the future. And because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (i.e. they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J.

We might think of God here as the all-powerful movie director who writes script and causes everything to go accord with it. We should note, as an aside, that there is some debate over what would be sufficient for theological determinism to be true. Some people claim that God's merely knowing what will happen determines that it will, while others believe that God must not only know but must also cause those events to occur in order for their occurrence to be determined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions", more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Arguments for Incompatibilism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Spring 2011 | year=2011 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/incompatibilism-arguments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of causal determinism, in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"/&gt;
* Logical determinism or ''Determinateness'' is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either [[Law of excluded middle|true or false]]. Note that one can support causal determinism without necessarily supporting logical determinism and vice versa (depending on one's views on the nature of [[time]], but also [[randomness]]). The problem of free will is especially salient now with logical determinism: how can choices be free, given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (i.e. it is already determined as either true or false)? This is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]]. [[File:Iimatyas.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Adequate determinism focuses on [[quantum mechanics|the fact that]], even without a full understanding of microscopic physics, we can predict the distribution of 1000 coin tosses.]]
** Often synonymous with logical determinism are the ideas behind spatio-temporal determinism or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]: the view of special relativity. [[J. J. C. Smart]], a proponent of this view, uses the term "tenselessness" to describe the simultaneous existence of past, present, and future. In physics, the "block universe" of [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Albert Einstein]] assumes that time is a fourth dimension (like the three spatial dimensions). In other words, all the other parts of time are real, like the city blocks up and down a street, although the order in which they appear depends on the driver (see [[Rietdijk–Putnam argument]]).
* Adequate determinism is the idea that [[quantum indeterminacy]] can be ignored for most macroscopic events. This is because of [[quantum decoherence]]. Random quantum events "average out" in the [[Expected value|limit of large numbers]] of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of classical mechanics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/adequate_determinism.html The Information Philosopher website], "Adequate Determinism", from the site: "''We are happy to agree with scientists and philosophers who feel that quantum effects are for the most part negligible in the macroscopic world. We particularly agree that they are negligible when considering the causally determined will and the causally determined actions set in motion by decisions of that will.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of [[quantum mechanics]] is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the predictions of [[classical mechanics]], which are quite accurate (albeit still [[Uncertainty principle|not perfectly certain]]) at larger scales.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: "the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets.", and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (emphasis in original, discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; Something as large as an [[cell (biology)|animal cell]], then, would be "adequately determined" (even in light of quantum indeterminacy).
* The [[many-worlds interpretation]] accepts the linear causal sets of sequential events with adequate consistency yet also suggests constant forking of causal chains creating "multiple universes" to account for multiple outcomes from single events.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Adrian. "One world versus many: the inadequacy of Everettian accounts of evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation." Many worlds (2010): 307–354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning the causal set of events leading to the present are all valid yet appear as a singular linear time stream within a much broader unseen conic probability field of other outcomes that "split off" from the locally observed timeline.  Under this model causal sets are still "consistent" yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes.  The interpretation side steps the exclusive retrospective causal chain problem of "could not have done otherwise" by suggesting "the other outcome does exist" in a set of parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred.  This theory is sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that recursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, Lev. "Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics." (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  This model is highly contested with multiple objections from the scientific community.

==Philosophical connections==

===With nature/nurture controversy===
[[File:JuliusOttoGrimm-Sculpture.jpg|thumb|140px|Nature and nurture interact in humans. A scientist looking at a sculpture after some time does not ask whether we are seeing the effects of the starting materials or of environmental influences.]]
Although some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and [[cognition]], others frame themselves as an answer to the debate on [[nature and nurture]]. They will suggest that one factor will entirely determine behavior. As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions of these theories have been widely rejected as a [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]].&lt;ref name="melo-martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Melo-Martín I|title=Firing up the nature/nurture controversy: bioethics and genetic determinism |journal=J Med Ethics|volume=31 |issue=9|pages=526–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16131554 |pmc=1734214|doi=10.1136/jme.2004.008417|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature ''and'' nurture is entirely predictable. The concept of [[heritability]] has been helpful in making this distinction.

[[Biological determinism]], sometimes called [[genetic determinism]], is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.

[[Behaviorism]] involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes—either environmental or reflexive. [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]] developed this nurture-focused determinism.

[[Cultural determinism]] or [[social determinism]] is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we are raised determines who we are.

[[Environmental determinism]], also known as climatic or geographical determinism, proposes that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture. Supporters of environmental determinism often{{quantify|date=August 2014}} also support [[Behaviorism|Behavioral determinism]]. Key proponents of this notion have included [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], [[Ellsworth Huntington]], [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] and possibly [[Jared Diamond]], although his status as an environmental determinist is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===With particular factors===
[[File:Using Mobile Phone 0251.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A technological determinist might suggest that technology like the mobile phone is the greatest factor shaping human civilization.]]
Other 'deterministic' theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect predictions.

[[Psychological determinism]] can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be synonymous with some sort of [[Psychological egoism]]. The latter is the view that humans will always act according to their perceived best interest.

[[Linguistic determinism]] claims that our language determines (at least limits) the things we can think and say and thus know. The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] argues that individuals experience the world based on the grammatical structures they habitually use.

[[Economic determinism]] attributes primacy to economic structure over politics in the development of human history. It is associated with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]].

[[Technological determinism]] is a reductionist theory that presumes that a society's technology drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.

===With free will===
{{Main article|Free will}}
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|right|300px|A table showing the different positions related to free will and determinism]]
Philosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will. This creates the four possible positions in the figure. [[Compatibilism]] refers to the view that [[free will]] is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three [[incompatibilist]] positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The [[hard incompatibilism|hard incompatibilists]] hold that both determinism and free will do not exist, the [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianists]] that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist, and the [[hard determinism|hard determinists]] that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.

The standard argument against free will, according to philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] focuses on the implications of determinism for 'free will'.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. C. Smart, "Free-Will, Praise and Blame,"''Mind'', July 1961, p.293-4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.

In his book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', author and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] also argues against free will. He offers one thought experiment where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, of a particular human. Harris believes that it is no longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has "free will". Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.216, note102&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.217, note109&lt;/ref&gt; That is, he believes there is compelling [[evidence of absence]] of free will.

===With the soul===
Some determinists argue that [[materialism]] does not present a complete understanding of the universe, because while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, it ignores the [[mind]]s or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of conscious beings.

A number of positions can be delineated:

# Immaterial souls are all that exist ([[Idealism]]).
# Immaterial souls exist and exert a non-deterministic causal influence on bodies. (Traditional free-will, [[interactionist dualism]]).&lt;ref&gt;By 'soul' in the context of (1) is meant an [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] immaterial agent that has the power to control the body but not to be controlled by the body (this theory of determinism thus conceives of conscious agents in [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] terms). Therefore the soul stands to the activities of the individual agent's body as does the creator of the universe to the universe. The creator of the universe put in motion a deterministic system of material entities that would, if left to themselves, carry out the chain of events determined by ordinary causation. But the creator also provided for souls that could exert a causal force analogous to the primordial causal force and alter outcomes in the physical universe via the acts of their bodies. Thus, it emerges that no events in the physical universe are uncaused. Some are caused entirely by the original creative act and the way it plays itself out through time, and some are caused by the acts of created souls. But those created souls were not created by means of physical processes involving ordinary causation. They are another order of being entirely, gifted with the power to modify the original creation. However, determinism is not necessarily limited to matter; it can encompass energy as well. The question of how these immaterial entities can act upon material entities is deeply involved in what is generally known as the [[mind-body problem]]. It is a significant problem which philosophers have not reached agreement about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/ Free Will (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Immaterial souls exist, but are part of deterministic framework.
# Immaterial souls exist, but exert no causal influence, free or determined ([[epiphenomenalism]], [[occasionalism]])
# Immaterial souls do not exist — there is no [[mind-body problem|mind-body]] [[dichotomy]], and there is a [[Materialism|Materialistic]] explanation for intuitions to the contrary.

===With ethics and morality===
Another topic of debate is the implication that Determinism has on [[Ethics|morality]]. [[Hard determinism]] (a belief in determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral judgments impossible. Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.

Philosopher and incompatibilist [[Peter van Inwagen]] introduces this thesis as such:

Argument that [[Free Will]] is Required for Moral Judgments
# The moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X implies that you should have done something else instead
# That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you to do
# That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else
# That you could have done something else implies that you have free will
# If you don't have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Inwagen|first=Peter|title=The Powers of Rational Beings: Freedom of the Will|year=2009|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a compatibilist might have an issue with Inwagen's process because one can not change the past like his arguments center around. A compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might posit:
# The moral judgment that you should not have done X implies that you can do something else instead
# That you can do something else instead implies that there is something else for you to do
# That there is something else for you to do implies that you can do something else
# That you can do something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse
# If you have free will to do other than X we can make the moral judgment that you should do other than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you know you should not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.

== History ==
Determinism has been established by the Greek philosophers, during the 7th and 6th centuries BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus, Leucippus and mainly by the Stoics with the universal causal determinism and Aristotle. Some of the main philosophers who have dealt with this issue are [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul Heinrich Dietrich), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[William James]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and, more recently, [[John Searle]], [[Sam Harris]], [[Ted Honderich]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].

Mecca Chiesa notes that the [[probabilistic]] or selectionistic determinism of [[B.F. Skinner]] comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] at all. Mechanistic determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca (2004) ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy &amp; The Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = J.

===Western tradition===
In the West, some elements of determinism have been expressed in Greece from the 6th century BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 5 ([[Heraclitus]])&lt;/ref&gt;  and Leucippus.&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 4 ([[Leucippus]])&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the [[Stoics]], as part of their theory of universal causal determinism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]] ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'' (Oxford 1998) chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien ''The Inadvertent Conception and Late Birth of the Free-Will Problem'' (Phronesis 43, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; an issue that is known in theology as the [[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]. The writings of [[Epictetus]] as well as [[Middle Platonist]] and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frede]] ''A Free Will: Origins of the Notion in Ancient Thought'' (Berkeley 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god:&lt;ref&gt;Though Moses Maimonides was not arguing against the existence of God, but rather for the incompatibility between the full '''exercise''' by God of his [[omniscience]] and genuine human [[free will]], his argument is considered by some as affected by Modal Fallacy. See, in particular, the article by Prof. Norman Swartz for ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm Foreknowledge and Free Will] and specifically [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm#section6 Section 6: The Modal Fallacy]&lt;/ref&gt; "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [that] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism in the West is often associated with [[Newtonian physics]], which depicts the physical matter of the universe as operating according to a set of fixed, knowable laws. The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of every event that will ever occur (''[[Laplace's demon]]''). In this sense, the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.

Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]] and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.

[[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as any following physical theories are results of observations and experiments, and so they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in western philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Norman (2003) The Concept of Physical Law / Chapter 10: Free Will and Determinism ( https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related theological views of [[Classical Pantheism]].

=== Eastern tradition ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2010}}
The idea that the entire universe is a [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic system]] has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religion, philosophy, and literature.

In ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Philosophical Taoism]], the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (see [[wu wei]]).

In the philosophical schools of India, the concept of precise and continual effect of laws of [[Karma]] on the existence of all sentient beings is analogous to western deterministic concept. Karma is the concept of "action" or "deed" in Indian religions. It is understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called saṃsāra) originating in ancient India and treated in Hindu, Jain, and Sikh. Karma is considered predetermined and deterministic in the universe, and in combination with the decisions (free will) of living beings, accumulates to determine futuristic situations that the living being encounters.

[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|120px|In [[Conway's Game of Life]], the interaction of just four simple rules creates patterns that seem somehow "alive".]]

As an illustration, the strategy board-games [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] have rigorous rules in which no information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no [[randomness|random]] events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game. Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, endgame tables are available that dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.  This implies that, given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible.  In this scenario, the winning player can announce that a checkmate will happen within a given number of moves, assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Nowak"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Axtell"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Epstein"/&gt; Another hands-on example of generative processes is [[John Horton Conway]]'s playable [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ John Conway's Game of Life]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] is wary of such models, and coined the term "[[ludic fallacy]]".

=== Compatibility with the existence of science ===
Certain [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] argue that while causal determinism in which everything including the brain/mind is subject to the laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the [[brain]] reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: Conjectures and refutations&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical models ===
Many [[mathematical models]] of physical systems are deterministic. This is true of most models involving [[differential equations]] (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called [[stochastic]]. Because of [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to [[numerical instability]] and a finite amount of [[accuracy and precision|precision]] in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werndl | first1 = Charlotte | year = 2009 | title = Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent? | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.06.004 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | bibcode = 2009SHPMP..40..232W | arxiv = 1310.1615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werndl, Charlotte (2009).

=== Quantum and Classical Mechanics ===

====Day-to-day physics====
{{further information|Macroscopic quantum phenomena}}
Since the beginning of the 20th century, [[quantum mechanics]]—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of [[Phenomenon|event]]s. Before that, [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]—the physics of everyday life—dominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an [[approximation]] to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]] of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce an absolutely accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.

Relevant is the fact that [[certainty]] is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's [[problem of induction]]). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This is an example of the [[butterfly effect]], which is one of the subjects of [[chaos theory]]. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to [[predict]] real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to ''predict'' or attain ''certainty'' as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.

====[[Quantum realm]]====
Quantum physics works differently in many ways from Newtonian physics. Physicist [[Aaron D. O'Connell]] explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does. O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale. O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ted.com/2011/06/02/struggling-with-quantum-logic-qa-with-aaron-oconnell/ "Struggling with quantum logic: Q&amp;A with Aaron O'Connell]&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum mechanics is the product of a careful application of the [[scientific method]], [[logic]] and [[empiricism]]. The [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is frequently confused with the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]. The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &amp;mdash; if we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose accuracy in measuring the other. "These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes."&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1930"&gt;{{cite book |first=Werner |last=Heisenberg |authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|year=1949 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie |trans-title=Physical Principles of Quantum Theory |location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel/University of Chicago Press |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzMBh4ZxKJsC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=9780486601137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|thumb|right|Although it is not possible to predict the trajectory of any one particle, they all obey determined probabilities which do permit some prediction.]]
This is where [[statistical mechanics]] come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. "Path" is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one that quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived path of the particle). As [[Stephen Hawking]] explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities.&lt;ref name=GDesign&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: ''"the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets...so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion"'', and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development is at least as predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes [[wave function]]s that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many [[Quantum mechanics#Applications|applications]], and allow us to build [[transistors]] and [[lasers]]. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world.&lt;ref name="WhatIsItGoodFor?"&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=everyday-quantum-physics Scientific American, "What is Quantum Mechanics Good For?"]&lt;/ref&gt; None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of [[quantum mechanics]] are not still [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|up for debate]].

On the topic of predictable probabilities, the [[double-slit experiment]]s are a popular example. [[Photon]]s are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, and the distribution of its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but there is no way to predict where in the resulting [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern any individual [[photon]] will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use [[weak measurement]] to acquire more information without violating the [[Uncertainty principle]]).

Some (including [[Albert Einstein]]) argue that our inability to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] insisted that, "I am convinced God does not play dice" in a private letter to [[Max Born]], 4 December 1926, [http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 Albert Einstein Archives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045822/http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 |date=19 August 2010 }} reel 8, item 180&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or "[[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable]]s" that determine ''absolutely'' in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.

[[John S. Bell]] criticized Einstein's work in his famous [[Bell's Theorem]], which proved that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions that would be violated if local hidden variables really existed. A number of experiments have tried to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated. Improved continue to verify the result, including the 2015 "[[Bell test experiments#Hensen et al..2C Giustina et al..2C Shalm et al. .282015.29: .22loophole-free.22 Bell tests|Loophole Free Test]]" that plugged all known sources of error and the 2017 "[[Bell test experiments#Johannes Handsteiner et al. .282017.29: .22Cosmic Bell Test.22 - Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars|Cosmic Bell Test]]" that based the experiment cosmic data streaming from different directions toward the Earth, precluding the possibility the sources of data could have had prior interactions. However, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jabs | first=Arthur | year=2016 | title= A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics | doi= 10.1007/s40509-016-0077-7 | journal= Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations | volume= 3 | issue= 4 | pages=279–292| arxiv=1204.0614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Bohm's Interpretation, though, violates special relativity and it is highly controversial whether or not it can be reconciled without giving up on determinism.

More advanced variations on these arguments include [[Quantum contextuality]], by Bell, [[Simon B. Kochen]] and [[Ernst Specker]] in which argues that hidden variable theories cannot be "sensible," which here means that the values of the hidden variables inherently depend on the devices used to measure them.

This debate is relevant because it is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see [[Schrödinger's cat]] - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).

Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined. This was the subject of the famous [[Bohr–Einstein debates]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] and there is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Comparison|still no consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Robert C. |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Kane |title=The Oxford Handbook of Free Will |edition=Second |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=9780195399691 | oclc=653483691 |page=90 |chapter=Chaos, Indeterminism, and Free Will |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzcFDsWg0GEC&amp;pg=PA90 |quote=The key question is whether to understand the nature of this probability as epistemic or ontic. Along epistemic lines, one possibility is that there is some additional factor (i.e., a hidden mechanism) such that once we discover and understand this factor, we would be able to predict the observed behavior of the quantum stoplight with certainty (physicists call this approach a "hidden variable theory"; see, e.g., Bell 1987, 1–13, 29–39; Bohm 1952a, 1952b; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Bub 1997, 40–114, Holland 1993; see also the preceding essay in this volume by Hodgson). Or perhaps there is an interaction with the broader environment (e.g., neighboring buildings, trees) that we have not taken into account in our observations that explains how these probabilities arise (physicists call this approach decoherence or consistent histories&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). Under either of these approaches, we would interpret the observed indeterminism in the behavior of stoplights as an expression of our ignorance about the actual workings. Under an ignorance interpretation, indeterminism would not be a fundamental feature of quantum stoplights, but merely epistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge about the system. Quantum stoplights would turn to be deterministic after all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim E.|title=Beyond Measure: Modern Physics, Philosophy, and the Meaning of Quantum Theory|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=0-19-852536-2|oclc=52486237|page=203|chapter=Complementarity and Entanglement|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVdjwsqrgz8C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=scientific+consensus+determinism+bell+theorem&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4v8PUaL5MarK0QWk8oCwBw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific%20consensus%20determinism%20bell%20theorem&amp;f=false|quote=So, was Einstein wrong? In the sense that the EPR paper argued in favour of an objective reality for each quantum particle in an entangled pair independent of the other and of the measuring device, the answer must be yes. But if we take a wider view and ask instead if Einstein was wrong to hold to the realist's belief that the physics of the universe should be objective and deterministic, we must acknowledge that we cannot answer such a question. It is in the nature of theoretical science that there can be no such thing as certainty. A theory is only 'true' for as long as the majority of the scientific community maintain a consensus view that the theory is the one best able to explain the observations. And the story of quantum theory is not over yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate determinism (see [[Determinism#Varieties|Varieties]], above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] "just an illusion".&lt;ref name="GDesign"/&gt; see [[Free will]] for further discussions on this topic.

====Other matters of quantum determinism====

[[File:HEUraniumC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Chaotic radioactivity is the next explanatory challenge for physicists supporting determinism.]]
All uranium found on earth is thought to have been synthesized during a [[supernova]] explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago. Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the [[radioactivity]] of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability. One gram of [[uranium-238]], a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to all tests known to modern science. Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an [[alpha particle]]. The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since it does not seem to depend on external stimulus. Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes [[testable]] predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay. At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's [[half life]].

The time dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] gives the first time [[derivative]] of the [[quantum state]]. That is, it explicitly and uniquely predicts the development of the [[wave function]] with time.
::&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\psi&lt;/math&gt;
So if the wave function itself is reality (rather than probability of classical coordinates), then the unitary evolution of the wave function in quantum mechanics, can be said to be deterministic. But the unitary evolution of the wave function is not the entirety of quantum mechanics.

Asserting that quantum mechanics is deterministic by treating the wave function itself as reality might be thought to imply a [[Universal wavefunction|single wave function for the entire universe]], starting at the origin of the universe. Such a "wave function of everything" would carry the probabilities of not just the world we know, but every other possible world that could have evolved. For example, large voids in the distributions of [[galaxy|galaxies]] are believed by many cosmologists to have originated in quantum fluctuations during the big bang. (''See'' [[cosmic inflation]], [[primordial fluctuations]] and [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].)

However, neither the posited reality nor the proven and extraordinary accuracy of the wave function and quantum mechanics at small scales can imply or reasonably suggest the existence of a single wave function for the entire universe. Quantum mechanics breaks down wherever gravity becomes significant, because nothing in the wave function, or in quantum mechanics, predicts anything at all about gravity. And this is obviously of great importance on larger scales.

Gravity is thought of as a large-scale force, with a longer reach than any other. But gravity becomes significant even at masses that are tiny compared to the mass of the universe.

A wave function the size of the universe might successfully model a universe with no gravity. Our universe, with gravity, is vastly different from what quantum mechanics alone predicts. To forget this is a colossal error.

[[Objective collapse theory|Objective collapse theories]], which involve a dynamic (and non-deterministic) collapse of the wave function (e.g. [[Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory]], [[Penrose interpretation]], or [[causal fermion system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) avoid these absurdities. The theory of [[causal fermion system]]s for example, is able to unify [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]], via a more fundamental theory that is non-linear, but gives rise to the linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that a deeper understanding of the theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''emergent''' (or '''emergentist''') '''materialism''' is a theory which asserts that the [[mind]] is an irreducible existent in some sense, albeit not in the sense of being an [[ontology|ontological]] simple, and that the study of [[mental event|mental phenomena]] is independent of other sciences.

The view can be divided into emergence which denies [[mental causation]] and emergence which allows for causal effect.  A version of the latter type has been advocated by [[John R. Searle]], called [[biological naturalism]].  
  
The other main group of materialist views in the philosophy of mind can be labeled non-emergent (or non-emergentist) materialism, and includes [[Type physicalism|identity theory (reductive materialism)]], philosophical [[behaviorism]], [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], and [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism (eliminative materialism)]].

'''Environmental technology''' (''envirotech''), green technology (''greentech'') or clean technology (''cleantech'') is the application of one or more of [[environmental science]], [[green chemistry]], [[environmental monitoring]] and electronic devices to monitor, model and conserve the [[natural environment]] and resources, and to curb the negative impacts of human involvement. The term is also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[wind turbine]]s, [[bioreactors]], etc.  [[Sustainable development]] is the core of ''environmental technologies''.  The term ''environmental technologies'' is also used to describe a class of electronic devices that can promote sustainable management of resources.

===Renewable energy===
[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|A view across a [[reverse osmosis]] [[desalination]] plant in [[Nepal]].]]
[[Renewable energy]] is the [[energy]] that can be replenished easily. For years we have been using sources such as [[wood]], [[sun]], [[water]], etc. for means for producing energy. Energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood, sun, wind, etc. is considered to be renewable.

===Water purification===
[[Water purification]]: The whole idea/concept of having dirt/germ/pollution free water flowing throughout the environment. Many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water. Water pollution is the main enemy of this concept, and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water.&lt;ref&gt;Recycling”.

===Air purification===
[[Air purifier|Air purification]]:  Basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and convert it into [[oxygen]]. The best examples are: ''[[Dypsis lutescens]]'', ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'', and ''[[Epipremnum aureum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/kamal_meattle_on_how_to_grow_your_own_fresh_air.html Kamal Meattle on how to grow fresh air] [[TED (conference)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that besides using the plants themselves, some species of bacteria can also be added to the leaves of these plants to help remove toxic gases, such as toluene&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, February 2017; Azalea's with extra bacteria can help to degrade toluene&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent_Stevens Diesel fuel degrading bacteria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhasselt.be/UH/Nieuws/2016/Vincent-Stevens-wint-EOS-prijs-2016.html Bacteria on Hedera helix able to help degrade exhaust gases from Diesel engines running on Diesel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sewage treatment===
[[Sewage treatment]] is conceptually similar to water purification. Sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution. The most polluted water is not used for anything, and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently. It may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection, sustainability etc.&lt;ref&gt;“Sewage Treatment”.

===eGain forecasting===
Egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future [[weather]]'s impact on a building.&lt;ref&gt;Taesler, R. (1990/91) Climate and Building Energy Management. Energy and Buildings, Vol. 15-16, pp 599 - 608.&lt;/ref&gt; By adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast, the system eliminates redundant use of heat, thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ip.com/patent/US6098893 United States Patent 6098893] Comfort control system incorporating weather forecast data and a method for operating such a system (Inventor Stefan Berglund)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy conservation===
[[Energy conservation]] is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity. Reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity.

==Alternative and clean power==
[[File:Roadster 2.5 charging.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]] was the first all-electric sports car for sale and in serial production. It can completely recharge from the electrical grid in 4 to 48 hours depending on the outlet used.]]

Concerns over pollution and greenhouse gases have spurred the search for sustainable alternatives to our current fuel use. For example, biogas from anaerobic digestion of plant waste can be stored to produce heat or electricity. The global reduction of greenhouse gases requires the adoption of energy conservation as well as sustainable generation. That environmental harm reduction involves global changes such as:

* reducing air pollution and methane from biomass 
* virtually eliminating fossil fuels for vehicles, heat and electricity, left in the ground. 
* wide spread use of public transport, battery and fuel cell vehicles 
* more wind/solar/water generated electricity 
* reducing peak demands with carbon taxes and time of use pricing.

Since fuel used by industry and transportation account for the majority of world demand, by investing in conservation and efficiency (using less fuel), pollution and greenhouse gases from these two sectors can be reduced around the globe. Advanced energy efficient [[electric motor]] (and [[electric generator]]) technology that are cost effective to encourage their application, such as [[brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine|variable speed generators]] and [[efficient energy use]], can reduce the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere, if electricity were generated using fossil fuels.

==Education==
Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes:
*''[[Environmental Engineering|Environmental Engineering or Environmental Systems]]'' courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment;
*''[[Environmental chemistry]]'', ''sustainable chemistry'' or ''environmental chemical engineering'' courses oriented towards understanding the effects (good and bad) of chemicals in the environment.  Such awards can focus on mining processes, pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes;
*''Environmental technology'' courses oriented towards producing electronic, electrical or electrotechnology graduates capable of developing devices and artefacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources, and developing novel energy generation technologies.

{{Platonism}}

The '''Euthyphro dilemma''' is found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Euthyphro]]'', in which [[Socrates]] asks [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]], "Is the [[piety|pious]] ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) loved by the [[deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" ([[Stephanus pagination|10a]]) It implies that if moral authority must come from the gods it does not have to be good, and if moral authority must be good it does not have to come from the gods – a highly controversial idea at the time Socrates first presented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Was the Charge Against Socrates? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-the-charge-against-socrates-121060 |website=Thoughtco |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the argument applied to the many capricious gods of [[ancient Greece]], it has implications for the [[monotheism|monotheistic religions]] of today. "Is what is [[good and evil|morally good]] commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?"&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Leibniz stated, in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-010-1426-7_60#page-1 ''Reflections on the Common Concept of Justice''] (circa 1702):  "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since Plato's original discussion, this question has presented a problem for some theists, though others have thought it a [[false dilemma]], and it continues to be an object of theological and philosophical discussion today.

==The dilemma==
Socrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety in Plato's ''[[Euthyphro]]''. Euthyphro proposes (6e) that the pious ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) is the same thing as that which is loved by the gods ([[:wikt:θεοφιλής|τὸ θεοφιλές]]), but Socrates finds a problem with this proposal: the gods may disagree among themselves (7e). Euthyphro then revises his definition, so that piety is only that which is loved by all of the gods unanimously (9e).

At this point the [[dilemma]] surfaces. Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious, or whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both contemplate the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates argues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot explain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they together would yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being the pious because the gods love it. And this in turn means, Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same as the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is the fact that the gods love it, whereas what makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro's theory does not give us the very ''nature'' of the pious, but at most a ''quality'' of the pious (11ab).

==In philosophical theism==
The dilemma can be modified to apply to philosophical theism, where it is still the object of theological and philosophical discussion, largely within the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions. As [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Mathematics|mathematician]] [[Gottfried Leibniz]] presented this version of the dilemma: "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=516}}

Many philosophers and theologians have addressed the Euthyphro dilemma since the time of Plato, though not always with reference to the Platonic dialogue. According to scholar [[Terence Irwin]], the issue and its connection with Plato was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2006}} More recently, it has received a great deal of attention from contemporary philosophers working in [[metaethics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]. Philosophers and theologians aiming to defend theism against the threat of the dilemma have developed a variety of responses.

=== God commands it because it is right ===

====Supporters====
The first horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is commanded by God ''because it is right'') goes by a variety of names, including [[intellectualism]], [[rationalism]], [[Moral realism|realism]], [[Natural law|naturalism]], and [[Moral universalism|objectivism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's dialogue. The [[Mu'tazilah]] school of [[Islamic theology]] also defended the view (with, for example, [[Ibrahim an-Nazzam|Nazzam]] maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying),{{sfn|Wolfson|1976|p=579}} as did the [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] [[Averroes]].{{sfn|Hourani|1962|pp=13–40}} [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue.{{sfn|Haldane|1989|p=40}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=I, pp. 553–556}} Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]] (adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal).{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}} Among later [[Scholastics]], [[Gabriel Vásquez]] is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's.{{sfn|Pink|2005}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=II, pp. 6–10}} [[Early modern period|Modern]] natural law theory saw [[Grotius]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] also putting morality prior to [[Will of God|God's will]], comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarists]] like [[Pufendorf]] in philosophical controversy.&lt;ref&gt;See esp. {{harvnb|Grotius|1625|loc=1.1.10}} and {{harvnb|Leibniz 1702(?)}}; see also {{harvnb|Leibniz|1706|pp=64–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Platonists]] like [[Benjamin Whichcote]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist [[metaethics]] of [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[Richard Price]];{{sfn|Gill|1999|loc=esp. pp. 272–74}}{{sfn|Mackie|1980|loc=Chapters 2, 8}}{{sfn|Gill|2011}} what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary [[Philosophy of religion|philosophers of religion]] who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include [[Richard Swinburne]]{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|pp=209–216}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}} and [[T. J. Mawson]]{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} (though see below for complications).

====Criticisms====

* [[Sovereignty]]: If there are moral standards independent of God's will, then "[t]here is something over which God is not sovereign. God is bound by the laws of morality instead of being their establisher. Moreover, God depends for his goodness on the extent to which he conforms to an independent moral standard. Thus, God is not absolutely independent."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=247}} 18th-century philosopher [[Richard Price]], who takes the first horn and thus sees morality as "necessary and immutable", sets out the objection as follows: "It may seem that this is setting up something distinct from God, which is independent of him, and equally eternal and necessary."{{sfn|Price|1769|loc=Chapter 5}}
* [[Omnipotence]]: These moral standards would limit God's power: not even God could oppose them by commanding what is evil and thereby making it good.  This point was influential in Islamic theology: "In relation to God, objective values appeared as a limiting factor to His power to do as He wills... [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|Ash'ari]] got rid of the whole embarrassing problem by denying the existence of objective values which might act as a standard for God's action."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=276}} Similar concerns drove the medieval voluntarists [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]].{{sfn|Haldane|1989|pp=42–43}} As contemporary philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] puts the point, this horn "seems to place a restriction on God's power if he cannot make any action which he chooses obligatory... [and also] it seems to limit what God can command us to do. God, if he is to be God, cannot command us to do what, independently of his will, is wrong."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}}
* [[Free will|Freedom of the will]]: Moreover, these moral standards would limit God's freedom of will: God could not command anything opposed to them, and perhaps would have no choice but to command in accordance with them.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} for a detailed discussion of this problem; also see {{harvnb|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6.22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Mark Murphy (philosopher)|Mark Murphy]] puts the point, "if moral requirements existed prior to God's willing them, requirements that an impeccable God could not violate, God's liberty would be compromised."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#2.1 Metaethical theological voluntarism: Considerations in Favor]}}
* [[Secular morality|Morality without God]]: If there are moral standards independent of God, then morality would retain its authority even if God did not exist. This conclusion was explicitly (and notoriously) drawn by early modern political theorist [[Hugo Grotius]]: "What we have been saying [about the natural law] would have a degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded without the utmost wickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to him"{{sfn|Grotius|1625|loc=Prolegomenon, 11}} On such a view, God is no longer a "law-giver" but at most a "law-transmitter" who plays no vital role in the foundations of morality.{{sfn|Kretzmann|1999|p=423}} [[Nontheism|Nontheists]] have capitalized on this point, largely as a way of disarming [[Argument from morality|moral arguments for God's existence]]: if morality does not depend on God in the first place, such arguments stumble at the starting gate.{{sfn|Oppy|2009|pp=352–356}}

====Responses to criticisms====
Contemporary philosophers Joshua Hoffman and Gary S. Rosenkrantz take the first horn of the dilemma, branding divine command theory a "subjective theory of value" that makes morality arbitrary.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=143–145}} They accept a theory of morality on which, "right and wrong, good and bad, are in a sense independent of what ''anyone'' believes, wants, or prefers."{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=145–147}} They do not address the aforementioned problems with the first horn, but do consider a related problem concerning God's omnipotence: namely, that it might be handicapped by his inability to bring about what is independently evil. To this they reply that God is omnipotent, even though there are states of affairs he cannot bring about: omnipotence is a matter of "maximal power", not an ability to bring about all possible states of affairs. And supposing that it is impossible for God not to exist, then since there cannot be more than one omnipotent being, it is therefore impossible for any being to have more power than God (e.g., a being who is omnipotent but not [[omnibenevolent]]). Thus God's omnipotence remains intact.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=166, 173–176}}

[[Richard Swinburne]] and [[T. J. Mawson]] have a slightly more complicated view. They both take the first horn of the dilemma when it comes to ''necessary'' moral truths. But divine commands are not totally irrelevant, for God and his will can still affect ''contingent'' moral truths.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 11}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} On the one hand, the most fundamental moral truths hold true regardless of whether God exists or what God has commanded: "Genocide and torturing children are wrong and would remain so whatever commands any person issued."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}} This is because, according to Swinburne, such truths are true as a matter of [[logical truth|logical necessity]]: like the laws of logic, one cannot deny them without contradiction.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=192ff}} This parallel offers a solution to the aforementioned problems of God's sovereignty, omnipotence, and freedom: namely, that these necessary truths of morality pose no more of a threat than the laws of logic.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 9}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=217–222}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=26–29}} On the other hand, there is still an important role for God's will. First, there are some divine commands that can directly create moral obligations: e.g., the command to worship on Sundays instead of on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|p=211}} Notably, not even these commands, for which Swinburne and Mawson take the second horn of the dilemma, have ultimate, underived authority. Rather, they create obligations only because of God's role as creator and sustainer and indeed owner of the universe, together with the necessary moral truth that we owe some limited consideration to benefactors and owners.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=211–215}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|pp=10–12}} Second, God can make an ''indirect'' moral difference by deciding what sort of universe to create. For example, whether a public policy is morally good might indirectly depend on God's creative acts: the policy's goodness or badness might depend on its effects, and those effects would in turn depend on the sort of universe God has decided to create.{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=29–32}}

===It is right because God commands it===

====Supporters====

The second horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is right ''because it is commanded by God'') is sometimes known as [[divine command theory]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are no moral standards other than God's will: without God's commands, nothing would be right or wrong. This view was partially defended by [[Duns Scotus]], who argued that not all [[Ten Commandments]] belong to the [[Natural Law]] in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus held that while our duties to God (the first three commandments, traditionally thought of as the First Tablet) are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without.

[[William of Ockham]] went further, contending that (since there is no contradiction in it) God could command us not to love God&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Quodlibeta'' 3.13&lt;/ref&gt; and even to ''hate'' God.&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Reportata'' 4.16; see also {{harvnb|Osborne|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Scholastics]] like [[Pierre D'Ailly]] and his student [[Jean Gerson|Jean de Gerson]] explicitly confronted the Euthyphro dilemma, taking the voluntarist position that God does not "command good actions because they are good or prohibit evil ones because they are evil; but... these are therefore good because they are commanded and evil because prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;D'Ailly, Pierre. ''Questions on the Books of the Sentences'' 1.14; quoted in {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}}, quoting Idziak 63–4; see {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}} for similar quotes from Gerson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestant]] reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] both stressed the absolute sovereignty of God's will, with Luther writing that "for [God's] will there is no cause or reason that can be laid down as a rule or measure for it",{{sfn|Luther|1525|loc=§88}} and Calvin writing that "everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it."{{sfn|Calvin|1536|loc= 3.23.2}} The voluntarist emphasis on God's absolute power was carried further by [[Descartes]], who notoriously held that God had freely created the eternal truths of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], and that God was therefore capable of giving [[circles]] unequal [[radii]],{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 25}} giving [[triangles]] other than 180 internal degrees, and even making [[contradictions]] true.{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 235}} Descartes explicitly seconded Ockham: "why should [God] not have been able to give this command [i.e., the command to hate God] to one of his creatures?"{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 343}} [[Thomas Hobbes]] notoriously reduced the justice of God to "irresistible power"&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "Of Liberty and Necessity" 12&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing the complaint of [[John Bramhall|Bishop Bramhall]] that this "overturns... all law").&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "A Defense of True Liberty", 12f&lt;/ref&gt; And [[William Paley]] held that all moral obligations bottom out in the self-interested "urge" to avoid [[Hell]] and enter [[Heaven]] by acting in accord with God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, William. "Principles" 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's [[Ash'ari|Ash'arite theologians]], [[al-Ghazali]] foremost among them, embraced voluntarism: scholar George Hourani writes that the view "was probably more prominent and widespread in Islam than in any other civilization."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=270}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Frank|1994|pp=32–36}} for the view that al-Ghazali incorporated rationalist elements that moved him away from traditional Ash'arite voluntarism.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wittgenstein]] said that of "the two interpretations of the Essence of the Good", that which holds that "the Good is good, in virtue of the fact that God wills it" is "the deeper", while that which holds that "God wills the good, because it is good" is "the shallow, rationalistic one, in that it behaves 'as though' that which is good could be given some further foundation".&lt;ref name=Janik&gt;{{harvnb|Janik|Toulmin|1973|p=194}}. The passage is also quoted in {{harvnb|Baggett|2002|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, divine command theory is defended by many philosophers of religion, though typically in a restricted form (see below).

====Criticisms====

This horn of the dilemma also faces several problems:

* No reasons for morality: If there is no moral standard other than God's will, then God's commands are arbitrary (i.e., based on pure whimsy or caprice). This would mean that morality is ultimately not based on reasons: "if theological voluntarism is true, then God's commands/intentions must be arbitrary; [but] it cannot be that morality could wholly depend on something arbitrary... [for] when we say that some moral state of affairs obtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of affairs obtaining rather than another."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#3.2 Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism: Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness]}} And as [[Michael J. Murray]] and [[Michael Rea]] put it, this would also "cas[t] doubt on the notion that morality is genuinely objective."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|pp=246–247}} An additional problem is that it is difficult to explain how true moral actions can exist if one acts only out of fear of God or in an attempt to be rewarded by him.{{sfn|Doomen|2011}}
* No reasons for God: This arbitrariness would also jeopardize God's status as a [[Wisdom|wise]] and [[Rationality|rational]] being, one who always acts on good reasons. As Leibniz writes: "Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it seems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must precede the act."{{sfn|Leibniz|1686|loc=II}}
* Anything goes:{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} This arbitrariness would also mean that ''anything'' could become good, and ''anything'' could become bad, merely upon God's command. Thus if God commanded us "to gratuitously inflict pain on each other"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} or to engage in "cruelty for its own sake"{{sfn|Adams|1973}} or to hold an "annual sacrifice of randomly selected ten-year-olds in a particularly gruesome ritual that involves excruciating and prolonged suffering for its victims",{{sfn|Morriston|2009|p=249}} then we would be morally obligated to do so. As 17th-century philosopher [[Ralph Cudworth]] put it: "nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but if it were supposed to be commanded by this omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis forthwith become holy, just, and righteous."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.1.5}}
* Moral [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]: If morality depends on the [[Free will|perfectly free will]] of God, morality would lose its necessity: "If nothing prevents God from loving things that are different from what God actually loves, then goodness can change [[Possible world|from world to world]] or time to time. This is obviously objectionable to those who believe that claims about morality are, if true, necessarily true."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} In other words, no action is necessarily moral: any right action could have easily been wrong, if God had so decided, and an action which is right today could easily become wrong tomorrow, if God so decides. Indeed, some have argued that divine command theory is incompatible with ordinary conceptions of moral [[supervenience]].{{sfn|Klagge|1984|pp=374–375}}
* Why do God's commands obligate?: Mere commands do not create obligations unless the commander has some commanding authority. But this commanding authority cannot itself be based on those very commands (i.e., a command to obey commands), otherwise a vicious circle results. So, in order for God's commands to obligate us, he must derive commanding authority from some source other than his own will. As Cudworth put it: "For it was never heard of, that any one founded all his authority of commanding others, and others {{sic}} obligation or duty to obey his commands, in a law of his own making, that men should be required, obliged, or bound to obey him. Wherefore since the thing willed in all laws is not that men should be bound or obliged to obey; this thing cannot be the product of the meer {{sic}} will of the commander, but it must proceed from something else; namely, the right or authority of the commander."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.2.4}} To avoid the circle, one might say our obligation comes from gratitude to God for creating us. But this presupposes some sort of independent moral standard obligating us to be grateful to our benefactors. As 18th-century philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] writes: "Is the Reason exciting to concur with the Deity this, 'The Deity is our Benefactor?' Then what Reason excites to concur with Benefactors?"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1742|loc=I}} Or finally, one might resort to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]'s view: "The right of nature whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that break his laws, is to be derived, not from his creating them (as if he required obedience, as of gratitude for his benefits), but from his ''irresistible power''."{{sfn|Hobbes|loc=31.5}} In other words, [[might makes right]].
* God's goodness: If ''all'' goodness is a matter of God's will, then what shall become of ''God's'' goodness? Thus [[William P. Alston]] writes, "since the standards of moral goodness are set by divine commands, to say that God is morally good is just to say that he obeys his own commands... that God practises what he preaches, whatever that might be;"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} Hutcheson deems such a view "an insignificant [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], amounting to no more than this, 'That God wills what he wills.'"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1738|loc=2.7.5}} Alternatively, as Leibniz puts it, divine command theorists "deprive God of the designation ''good'': for what cause could one have to praise him for what he does, if in doing something quite different he would have done equally well?"{{sfn|Leibniz|1710|p=176}} A related point is raised by [[C. S. Lewis]]: "if good is to be ''defined'' as what God commands, then the goodness of God Himself is emptied of meaning and the commands of an omnipotent fiend would have the same claim on us as those of the 'righteous Lord.'"{{sfn|Lewis|1943|p=79}} Or again Leibniz: "this opinion would hardly distinguish God from the devil."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=561}} That is, since divine command theory trivializes God's goodness, it is incapable of explaining the difference between God and an all-powerful demon.
* The [[is-ought problem]] and the [[naturalistic fallacy]]: According to [[David Hume]], it is hard to see how moral propositions featuring the relation ''ought'' could ever be deduced from ordinary ''is'' propositions, such as "the being of a God."{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=3.1.1.27}} Divine command theory is thus guilty of deducing moral ''oughts'' from ordinary ''ises'' about God's commands.{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}} In a similar vein, [[G. E. Moore]] argued (with his [[open question argument]]) that the notion ''good'' is indefinable, and any attempts to analyze it in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms are guilty of the so-called "naturalistic fallacy."{{sfn|Moore|1903|loc=Chapters 1, 2, 4}} This would block any theory which analyzes morality in terms of God's will: and indeed, in a later discussion of divine command theory, Moore concluded that "when we assert any action to be right or wrong, we are not merely making an assertion about the attitude of mind towards it of any being or set of beings whatever."{{sfn|Moore|1912|p=79}}
* No morality without God: If all morality is a matter of God's will, then if God does not exist, there is no morality. This is the thought captured in the slogan ([[q:Fyodor Dostoyevsky#The Brothers Karamazov (1879–1880)|often attributed to Dostoevsky]]) "[[The Brothers Karamazov|If God does not exist, everything is permitted.]]" Divine command theorists disagree over whether this is a problem for their view or a virtue of their view. [[Argument from morality|Many argue]] that morality does indeed require God's existence, and that this is in fact a problem for atheism. But divine command theorist [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] contends that this idea ("that no actions would be ethically wrong if there were not a loving God") is one that "will seem (at least initially) implausible to many", and that his theory must "dispel [an] air of paradox."{{sfn|Adams|1979|p=77}}

====Restricted divine command theory====

One common response to the Euthyphro dilemma centers on a distinction between ''value'' and ''obligation''. Obligation, which concerns rightness and wrongness (or what is required, forbidden, or permissible), is given a voluntarist treatment. But value, which concerns goodness and badness, is treated as independent of divine commands. The result is a ''restricted'' divine command theory that applies only to a specific region of morality: the [[deontic]] region of obligation. This response is found in [[Francisco Suárez]]'s discussion of natural law and voluntarism in ''De legibus''{{sfn|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6 "Is the natural law truly a preceptive divine law?"}} and has been prominent in contemporary philosophy of religion, appearing in the work of Robert M. Adams,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1973}}, esp. p. 109 and {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=esp. p. 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip L. Quinn]],{{sfn|Quinn|2007|loc=esp. p. 71}} and William P. Alston.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=306–307}}

A significant attraction of such a view is that, since it allows for a non-voluntarist treatment of goodness and badness, and therefore of God's own moral attributes, some of the aforementioned problems with voluntarism can perhaps be answered. God's commands are not arbitrary: there are reasons which guide his commands based ultimately on this goodness and badness.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=317–318}} God could not issue horrible commands: God's own essential goodness{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}}{{sfn|Quinn|2007|pp=81–85}}{{sfn|Alston|1990|p=317}} or loving character&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1979}}. In this early work, Adams's view is that it is logically possible but "unthinkable" that God would issue horrible commands: "the believer's concepts of ethical rightness and wrongness would break down in the situation in which he believed that God commanded cruelty for its own sake" (p. 324). In later work, Adams contends that "God ''cannot'' be sadistic" ({{harvnb|Adams|1999|p=47}}).&lt;/ref&gt; would keep him from issuing any unsuitable commands. Our obligation to obey God's commands does not result in circular reasoning; it might instead be based on a gratitude whose appropriateness is itself independent of divine commands.{{sfn|Adams|1999|pp=252–253}} These proposed solutions are controversial,&lt;ref&gt;For criticisms, see {{harvnb|Chandler|1985}}; {{harvnb|Morriston|2001}}; {{harvnb|Shaw|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Zagzebski|2004|pp=259–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some steer the view back into problems associated with the first horn.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} on the problems of divine omnipotence and freedom of the will&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem remains for such views: if God's own essential goodness does not depend on divine commands, then on what ''does'' it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=Chapter 1}}; {{harvnb|Quinn|2007}}; {{harvnb|Alston|1990}} distances himself from Platonism; see also {{harvnb|Kretzmann|1999|pp=375–376}} for a similar solution, put in terms of divine simplicity.&lt;/ref&gt; Alston offers the analogy of [[Metre#Prototype metre bar|the standard meter bar in France]]. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard meter bar, and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why ''God'' is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is "the end of the line," with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=318–322}} On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's ''will'', it still depends on ''God'', and thus God's sovereignty remains intact.

This solution has been criticized by [[Wes Morriston]]. If we identify the ultimate standard for goodness with God's nature, then it seems we are identifying it with certain properties of God (e.g., being loving, being just). If so, then the dilemma resurfaces: is God good because he has those properties, or are those properties good because God has them?{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=253}} Nevertheless, Morriston concludes that the appeal to God's essential goodness is the divine-command theorist's best bet. To produce a satisfying result, however, it would have to give an account of God's goodness that does not trivialize it and does not make God subject to an independent standard of goodness.{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=266}}

Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], disputing the perspective that "God is good" and could never advocate something like torture, states that those who propose this are "caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Practical Ethics|edition= 3d|last= Singer|first= Peter|year= 1993|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-43971-8|pages= 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False dilemma===
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], and Aquinas all wrote about the issues raised by the Euthyphro dilemma, although, like [[William James]]{{sfn|James|1891}} and Wittgenstein&lt;ref name=Janik/&gt; later, they did not mention it by name. As philosopher and Anselm scholar Katherin A. Rogers observes, many contemporary philosophers of religion suppose that there are true propositions which exist as platonic [[abstract object|abstracta]] independently of God.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} Among these are propositions constituting a moral order, to which God must conform in order to be good.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=186}} Classical [[Judaeo-Christian]] theism, however, rejects such a view as inconsistent with God's omnipotence, which requires that God and what he has made is all that there is.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} "The classical tradition," Rogers notes, "also steers clear of the other horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|2008|p=186}}; see also {{harvnb|Rogers|2000|pp=127–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From a classical theistic perspective, therefore, the Euthyphro dilemma is false. As Rogers puts it, "Anselm, like Augustine before him and Aquinas later, rejects both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. God neither conforms to nor invents the moral order. Rather His very nature is the standard for value."{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}}

====Jewish thought====
The basis of the false dilemma response—God's nature is the standard for value—predates the dilemma itself, appearing first in the thought of the eighth-century BC [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[prophet]]s, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], [[Hosea]], [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] and [[Isaiah]]. (Amos lived some three centuries before Socrates and two before [[Thales]], traditionally regarded as the first Greek philosopher.) "Their message," writes British scholar [[Norman H. Snaith]], "is recognized by all as marking a considerable advance on all previous ideas,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=59}}. Written over many centuries by many authors, the Old Testament displays a marked ethical evolution in its portrayal&amp;nbsp;– and therefore understanding&amp;nbsp;– of God. In its earliest-written books, God appears at times as no more than a nationalistic tribal deity who orders the extermination of entire peoples hostile to Israel, such as the [[Midianites]] (Numbers 31: 1–54) and [[Amalekites]] (1 Samuel 15: 1–25). By the time of Amos, however, such "primitive and immature notions" are a thing of the past ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|loc=p. 52; see also pp. 61–62, 66–67}}). For a recent overview, see {{harvnb|Head|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; not least in its "special consideration for the poor and down-trodden."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|pp=68–69}}. It was this "bias towards the poor and needy" ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=70}}) in the message of the Hebrew prophets and Jesus Christ that inspired the "[[preferential option for the poor]]" of late-twentieth-century Latin American [[liberation theology]].&lt;/ref&gt; As Snaith observes, ''tsedeq'', the Hebrew word for [[righteousness]], "actually stands for the establishment of God's will in the land." This includes justice, but goes beyond it, "because God's will is wider than justice. He has a particular regard for the helpless ones on earth."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=70}} ''Tsedeq'' "is the norm by which all must be judged" and it "depends entirely upon the Nature of God."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}

Hebrew has few [[abstract noun]]s. What the Greeks thought of as ideas or abstractions, the Hebrews thought of as activities.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=174}} In contrast to the Greek ''[[dikaiosyne|dikaiosune]]'' (justice) of the philosophers, ''tsedeq'' is not an idea abstracted from this world of affairs. As Snaith writes:
{{quote|''Tsedeq'' is something that happens here, and can be seen, and recognized, and known. It follows, therefore, that when the Hebrew thought of ''tsedeq'' (righteousness), he did not think of Righteousness in general, or of Righteousness as an Idea. On the contrary, he thought of a particular righteous act, an action, concrete, capable of exact description, fixed in time and space.... If the word had anything like a general meaning for him, then it was as it was represented by a whole series of events, the sum-total of a number of particular happenings.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}}}
The Hebrew stance on what came to be called the [[problem of universals]], as on much else, was very different from that of Plato and precluded anything like the Euthyphro dilemma.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|pp=9, 187–188}} This has not changed. In 2005, [[Jonathan Sacks]] wrote, "In Judaism, the Euthyphro dilemma does not exist."{{sfn|Sacks|2005|p=164}} Jewish philosophers Avi Sagi and Daniel Statman criticized the Euthyphro dilemma as "misleading" because "it is not exhaustive": it leaves out a third option, namely that God "acts only out of His nature."{{sfn|Sagi|Statman|1995|pp=62–63}}

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Like [[Aristotle]], Aquinas rejected Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics]'', Bk. 1, lectio 10, n. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, to speak of abstractions not only as existent, but as more perfect exemplars than fully designated particulars, is to put a premium on generality and vagueness.{{sfn|McInerny|1982|pp=122–123}} On this analysis, the abstract "good" in the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma is an unnecessary obfuscation. Aquinas frequently quoted with approval Aristotle's definition, "Good is what all desire."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' 1.1; Aquinas, ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Ethics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics]'' 1, 9 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 5,1}} As he clarified, "When we say that good is what all desire, it is not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all, but that whatever is desired has the nature of good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 6,2 ad 2}} In other words, even those who desire evil desire it "only under the aspect of good," i.e., of what is desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics'' 1,10.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between desiring good and desiring evil is that in the former, will and reason are in harmony, whereas in the latter, they are in discord.{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II q24, a2}}

Aquinas's discussion of [[sin]] provides a good point of entry to his philosophical explanation of why the nature of God is the standard for value. "Every sin," he writes, "consists in the longing for a passing [i.e., ultimately unreal or false] good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I/II 72,2}} Thus, "in a certain sense it is true what Socrates says, namely that no one sins with full knowledge."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II 58,2 and I/II 77,2}} "No sin in the will happens without an ignorance of the understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' 4,92.&lt;/ref&gt; God, however, has full knowledge ([[omniscience]]) and therefore by definition (that of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as well as Aquinas) can never will anything other than what is good. It has been claimed&amp;nbsp;– for instance, by [[Nicolai Hartmann]], who wrote: "There is no freedom for the good that would not be at the same time freedom for evil"&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Nicolai. ''Ethik'' (3rd edition). Berlin, 1949, p. 378. Cited in {{harvnb|Pieper|2001|pp=78–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that this would limit God's freedom, and therefore his omnipotence. [[Josef Pieper]], however, replies that such arguments rest upon an impermissibly [[anthropomorphic]] conception of God.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} In the case of humans, as Aquinas says, to be able to sin is indeed a consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer.htm De Veritate]'' 24,3 ad 2.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a sign, of freedom (''quodam libertatis signum'').&lt;ref name=Ver22&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 22,6.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, in other words, are not puppets manipulated by God so that they always do what is right. However, "it does not belong to the [[essence]] of the free will to be able to decide for evil."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 24,3 ad 2; ''Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard'' 2d,44,1,1 ad 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "To will evil is neither freedom nor a part of freedom."&lt;ref name=Ver22/&gt; It is precisely humans' creatureliness&amp;nbsp;– that is, their not being God and therefore omniscient&amp;nbsp;– that makes them capable of sinning.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=80}} Consequently, writes Pieper, "the inability to sin should be looked on as the very signature of a higher freedom&amp;nbsp;– contrary to the usual way of conceiving the issue."{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} Pieper concludes: "Only ''the'' will [i.e., God's] can be the right standard of its own willing and must will what is right necessarily, from within itself, and always. A deviation from the norm would not even be thinkable. And obviously only the absolute divine will is the right standard of its own act"{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 63,1 }}{{sfn|Pieper|2001|pp=80–81}}&amp;nbsp;– and consequently of all human acts. Thus the second horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory, is also disposed of.

====William James====
William James, in his essay "[[The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]]", dismisses the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma and stays clear of the second. He writes: "Our ordinary attitude of regarding ourselves as subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true 'in themselves,' is ... either an out-and-out superstition, or else it must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real Thinker ... to whom the existence of the universe is due."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}} Moral obligations are created by "personal demands," whether these demands&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gale|1999|p=44}}: In his essay, "James used 'desire', 'demand' and 'claim' interchangeably, using 'desire' and 'demand' each eleven times and 'claim' five."&lt;/ref&gt; come from the weakest creatures, from the most insignificant persons, or from God. It follows that "ethics have as genuine a foothold in a universe where the highest consciousness is human, as in a universe where there is a God as well." However, whether "the purely human system" works "as well as the other is a different question."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}}

For James, the deepest practical difference in the moral life is between what he calls "the easy-going and the strenuous mood."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In a purely human moral system, it is hard to rise above the easy-going mood, since the thinker's "various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same denominational value;&lt;ref&gt;James is acutely aware of how hard it is to "avoid complete moral skepticism on the one hand, and on the other escape bringing a wayward personal standard of our own along with us, on which we simply pin our faith." He briefly discusses several notions "proposed as bases of the ethical system", but finds little to help choose among them. ({{harvnb|James|1891|loc=Section III}})&lt;/ref&gt; he can play fast and loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximum stimulating power." Our attitude is "entirely different" in a world where there are none but "finite demanders" from that in a world where there is also "an infinite demander." This is because "the stable and systematic moral universe for which the ethical philosopher asks is fully possible only in a world where there is a divine thinker with all-enveloping demands", for in that case, "actualized in his thought already must be that ethical philosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore approach." Even though "exactly what the thought of this infinite thinker may be is hidden from us", our postulation of him serves "to let loose in us the strenuous mood"{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} and confront us with an [[existential]]{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=40}} "challenge" in which "our total character and personal genius ... are on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy, our choice and use of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or incapacity for moral life. From this unsparing practical ordeal no professor's lectures and no array of books can save us."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In the words of Richard M. Gale, "God inspires us to lead the morally strenuous life in virtue of our conceiving of him as unsurpassably ''good''. This supplies James with an adequate answer to the underlying question of the ''Euthyphro''."{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=44}}

==In philosophical atheism==
===Atheistic resolutions===
[[Atheism]] challenges the assumption of the dilemma that God exists (or in the original formulation, that the many gods in Greek religion existed).  This eliminates the need to decide whether God is either non-omniscient or arbitrary, and also eliminates the possibility of God as the source of morality.

[[Secular humanism]] takes the positive stance that morality is not dependent on religion or theology, and that ethical rules should be developed based on reason, science, experience, debate, and democracy.  Some secular humanists believe in [[ethical naturalism]], that there are objective, discoverable laws of morality inherent to the human condition, of which humans may have imperfect knowledge.  Others have adopted [[moral relativism]] in the sense of [[meta-ethics]] – the idea that ethics are a [[social construct]] – but nonetheless by way of [[utilitarianism]] advocate imposing a set of [[moral universalism|universal ethics]] and laws that create the type of society in which they wish to live, where people are safe, prosperous, and happy.  These competing resolutions represent different answers to a question similar to the original dilemma: "Is something inherently ethical or unethical, or is something ethical or unethical because a person or society says it is so?"

===Rejection of universal morality===
The other assumption of the dilemma is that there is a universal right and wrong, against which a god either creates or is defined by.  [[Moral nihilism]] challenges that assumption by rejecting the concept of morality entirely.  This conflicts with the teachings of most religions (and thus is usually accompanied by atheism) but is theoretically compatible with the notion of a powerful God or gods who have opinions about how people should behave.

[[Moral relativism]] accepts the idea of morality, but asserts that there are multiple potential arbiters of moral truth.  This opens the possibility of disagreeing with God about the rules of ethics, and of creating multiple societies with different, equally valid sets of ethics (just as different countries have different sets of laws).  "Normative moral relativism" asserts that behavior based on alternative systems of morality should be tolerated. In the context of [[religious pluralism]], strong [[relativism]] it also opens the possibility that different gods and different belief systems produce different but equally valid moral systems, which may apply only to adherents of those faiths.

==In popular culture==
In the song "[[No Church in the Wild]]" from the album ''[[Watch the Throne]]'', rapper [[Jay Z]] references the dilemma with the line, "Is pious pious 'cause God loves pious? [[Socrates]] asked whose bias do y'all seek."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-no-church-in-the-wild-lyrics#note-314340|title=Kanye West – No Church in the Wild Lyrics|accessdate = 5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In American legal thinking==

[[Yale Law School]] Professor [[Myres S. McDougal]], formerly a classicist, later a scholar of property law, posed the question, "Do we protect it because it's a property right, or is it a property right because we protect it?"&lt;ref&gt;See [[Richard H. Stern]], [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ScopeProtnProb.pdf  ''Scope-of-Protection Problems With Patents and Copyrights on Methods of Doing Business''], 10 {{smcaps|Fordham Intell. Prop., Media &amp; Ent.}} L.J. 105, 128 n.100 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]'', 324 U.S. 499 (1945), Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] addressed whether there was a protectable property interest in a head of water lessened by federal action. He stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]ot all economic interests are "property rights;" only those economic advantages are "rights" which have the law back of them, and only when they are so recognized may courts compel others to forbear from interfering with them or to compensate for their invasion. ... We cannot start the process of decision by calling such a claim as we have here a "property right;" whether it is a property right is really the question to be answered. Such economic uses are rights only when they are legally protected interests.&lt;ref&gt;324 U.S. at 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's majority (per Justice Jackson) resolved its version of the Euthyphro dilemma by ruling that property rights exist if courts recognize and protect them, rather than holding that property rights pre-exist and courts merely perceive them. A dissenting opinion, however, considered that property rights existed ''a priori'' and that they dictated the conclusion that courts should (therefore) enforce them.

{{short description|}}
'''Evolutionary psychology of language''' is the study of the evolutionary history of language as a psychological faculty within the discipline of [[evolutionary psychology]]. It makes the assumption that language is the result of a [[Darwinian adaptation]].

There are many competing theories of how language might have evolved, if indeed it is an evolutionary adaptation. They stem from the belief that language development could result from an [[adaptation]], an [[exaptation]], or a by-product. [[Heredity|Genetics]] also influence the study of the evolution of language. It has been speculated that the [[FOXP2]] gene may be what gives [[human]]s the ability to develop [[grammar]] and [[syntax]].

==Language evolution theories==

In the debate surrounding the evolutionary psychology of language, three sides emerge: those who believe in language as an [[adaptation]], those who believe it is a [[by-product]] of another adaptation, and those who believe it is an [[exaptation]].

===Adaptation===
Scientist and psychologists [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop. The complexity of the mechanisms, the faculty of language and the ability to learn language provides a comparative resource between the [[evolutionary psychology|psychological evolved]] traits and the [[evolutionary biology|physical evolved]] traits.&lt;ref name="Richardson 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Richardson,  | first = R. | title = The prospects for an evolutionary psychology: Human language and human reasoning |publisher = Springer | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00389658 | journal = Minds and Machines| volume =6| issue = 4| pages = 541–557| date = November 1996 | accessdate = 2 January 2014 | doi=10.1007/BF00389658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker, though he mostly agrees with [[Noam Chomsky]], a [[linguist]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive scientist]], in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction, but Pinker and Bloom argue that the [[organic (model)|organic]] nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) ''Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.'' Cambridge University Press p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By-product/Spandrel===
Noam Chomsky spearheaded the debate on the faculty of language as a cognitive by-product, or spandrel. As a linguist, rather than an evolutionary biologist, his theoretical emphasis was on the infinite capacity of speech and speaking: there are a fixed number of words, but there is an infinite combination of the words.&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;Chomsky, N., ''Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use.'' Praeger, New York. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis from this considers that the ability of our cognition to perceive infinite possibilities, or create infinite possibilities, helped give way to the extreme complexity found in our language.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt; Both Chomsky and Gould argue that the complexity of the brain is in itself an adaptation, and language arises from such complexities.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt;
On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a by product, [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2011). ''The Evolution of Language.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. p. 15. {{ISBN|052167736X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptationist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether "Language has evolved as an adaptation" as being misleading.&lt;ref name="Fitch" /&gt;
He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use [[symbolic communication]] is integrated in all other [[cognitive process]]es.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon, T. The Symbolic Species. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exaptation===
Exaptations, like adaptations, are fitness-enhancing characteristics, but, according to Stephen Jay Gould, their purposes were appropriated as the species evolved. This can be for one of two reasons: either the trait’s original function was no longer necessary so the trait took on a new purpose or a trait that does not arise for a certain purpose, but later becomes important.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botha|first1=Rudolf P|title=How much of language, if any, came about in the same sort of way as the brooding chamber in snails?|journal=Language &amp; Communication| volume=21| issue=3|year=2001|pages=225–243|doi=10.1016/S0271-5309(01)00002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically exaptations have a specific shape and design which becomes the space for a new function.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001" /&gt; The foundation of this argument comes from the low-lying position of the [[larynx]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Fitch2"&gt;Fitch, T., "Evolutionary Developmental Biology and Human Language Evolution: Constraints on Adaptation." "Evolutionary Biology". 39:4. pp. 613-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mammals have this same positioning of the larynx, but no other species has acquired language. This leads exaptationists to see an evolved modification away from its original purpose.&lt;ref name="Fitch2" /&gt;

==Genes and language==
Research has shown that “genetic constraints” on language evolution could have caused a “specialized” and “species-specific language module.&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chater | first1 = N. | last2 = Florencia | first2 = R. | last3 = Christiansen | first3 = M. H. | year = | title = Restrictions on biological adaptation in language evolution | url = | journal = [[PNAS]] | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 1015–1020 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807191106 | pmc = 2633574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through this module that there are many specified “domain-specific linguistic properties,” such as syntax and agreement.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; Adaptationists believe that language genes “coevolved with human language itself for the purpose of communication.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; This view suggests that the genes that are involved with language would only have coevolved in a very stable linguist environment. This shows that language could not have evolved in a rapidly changing environment because that type of environment would not have been stable enough for natural selection. Without natural selection, the genes would not have coevolved with the ability for language, and instead, would have come from “cultural conventions.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; The adaptationist belief that genes coevolved with language also suggests that there are no “arbitrary properties of language.” This is because they would have coevolved with language through natural selection.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;
 
The [[Baldwin effect]] provides a possible explanation for how language characteristics that are learned over time could become encoded in genes. He suggested, like Darwin did, that organisms that can adapt a trait faster have a “selective advantage.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; As generations pass, less environmental stimuli is needed for organisms of the species to develop that trait. Eventually no environmental stimuli are needed and it is at this point that the trait has become “genetically encoded.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;

===FOXP2 gene===
[[File:Protein FOXP2 PDB 2a07.png|thumb|Structure of the [[FOXP2]] protein. Based on [[PyMOL]] rendering of [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) 2ao9.]]
{{main|FOXP2}}
The genetic and cognitive components of language have long been under speculation, only recently have linguists been able to point out a gene that may possibly explain how language works.&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff"&gt;Fisher, S.E. &amp; Scharff, C. (2009). "FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language." ''Cell Press'' pp.166-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 [[gene]] may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist [[Myrna Gopnik]] identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the [[KE family]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The KE family has a mutation in the FOXP2, that makes them suffer from a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[language disorder]]. It has been argued that the FOXP2 gene is the grammar gene, which is what allows humans the ability to form proper syntax and make our communication of higher quality. Children that grow up in a stable environment are able to develop highly proficient language without any instruction. Individuals with a mutation to their FOXP2 gene have trouble mastering complex sentences, and shows signs of [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]].&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff" /&gt;

This gene most likely evolved in the [[hominini|hominin]] line after the hominin and the chimpanzee lines split; this accounts for the fact that humans are the only ones able to learn and understand grammar.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby"&gt;Christianse, M. H. &amp; Kirby, S. (2004). ''Language Evolution.'' [[Oxford University Press]]. pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a unique [[allele]] of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby" /&gt; This suggests that speech evolved late in overall spectrum of human evolution.

==Variation in human language==
In the world there are nearly 7000 languages, there is great amount of variation and this variation is thought to have come about through [[Cultural differentialism|cultural differentiation]]. There are four factors that are thought to be the reason as to why there is language variation between cultures: [[founder effect]]s, [[drift (linguistics)|drift]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and adaptation. With the vast amounts of lands available different tribes began to form and to claim their territory, in order to differentiate themselves many of these groups made changes to their language and this how the evolution of languages began. There also tended to be drifts in the population a certain group would get lost and be isolated from the rest of the group, this group would lose touch with the other groups and before they knew there had been mutations in their language and a whole new language had been formed.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Levinson | first1 = SC. | last2 = Gray | first2 = RD. | title = Tools from evolutionary biology shed new light on the diversification of languages. | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–73 |date=March 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2012.01.007 | pmid = 22336727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybridization also played a big role in the language evolution, one group would come in contact with another tribe and they would pick up words and sounds from each other eventually leading to the formation of a new language. Adaptation would also play a role in the evolution of language differentiation, the environment and the circumstances were constantly changing therefore the groups had to adapt to the environment and their language had to adapt to it as well, it is all about maximizing fitness.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"/&gt;

Atkinson theorized that language may have originated in [[Africa]] since [[African languages]] have a greater variation of speech sounds than other languages. Those sounds are seen as the root for the other languages that exist across the world.&lt;ref name="Bower 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bower|first1=Bruce|title=Darwin's tongues: Languages, like genes, can tell evolutionary tales|journal=Science News|volume=180| issue=11|year=2011| pages=22–25|issn=0036-8423|doi=10.1002/scin.5591801128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication in other animals==
Research indicates that nonhuman animals (e.g., apes, dolphins, and songbirds) show evidence of language. Comparative studies of the sensory-motor system reveal that speech is not special to humans: nonhuman primates can discriminate between two different spoken languages.&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;Hauser, M. D., et al. (2002). The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? Science 298. pp. 1569-1579.&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomical aspects of humans, particularly the descended larynx, has been believed to be unique to humans' capacity to speak. However, further research revealed that several other mammals have a descended larynx beside humans, which indicates that a descended larynx must not be the only anatomical feature needed for speech production.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;
Vocal imitation is not uniquely human as well.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; Songbirds seem to acquire species-specific songs by imitating.&lt;ref name="Haesler 2004"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Haesler S, Wada K, Nshdejan A, etal |title=FoxP2 expression in avian vocal learners and non-learners |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=24 |issue=13 |pages=3164–75 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15056696 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4369-03.2004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haesler 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haesler S, Rochefort C, Georgi B, Licznerski P, Osten P, Scharff C |title=Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e321 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18052609 |pmc=2100148 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because nonhuman primates do not have a descended larynx, they lack vocal imitative capacity, which is why studies involving these primates have taught them nonverbal means of communication, e.g., sign language.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

[[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] and [[Nim Chimpsky]] are two apes that have successfully learned to use sign language, but not to the extent that a human being can. Nim is a chimpanzee that was taken in by a family in the 1970s and was raised as if he were a human child. Nim was able to master 150 signs, which were limited but useful. Koko was a gorilla that was taken in by a Berkley student. She was able to master 600 signs for generative communication. Koko and Nim were not able to develop speech due to the fact that they lack the larynx which is what distinguishes humans from other animals and allows them to speak.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

'''Forced displacement''' or '''forced immigration''' is the coerced movement of a person or people away from their [[home]] or home [[region]] and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced forced displacement is a '''"forced immigrant"''', a '''"displaced person" (DP)''', rarely also a '''"displacee"''', or if it is within the same country, an [[internally displaced person]] (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a [[refugee]], as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of forced displacement is [[population transfer]], which is a coherent policy to move unwanted groups, for example, as an attempt at [[ethnic cleansing]]. Another form is [[deportation]].

Forced displacement has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced people to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], south and central [[Asia]], ripple out well beyond the immediate region.

== Definition ==
The concept of forced displacement envelopes demographic movements like flight, evacuation, displacement, and resettlement. The [[International Organization for Migration]] defines a forced migrant as any person who migrates to "escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_160632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023804/http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association for the Study of Forced Migration]] (IASFM) defines it as "the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (those displaced by conflicts) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects."&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcedmigration.org/about/whatisfm/what-is-forced-migration|title=What is forced migration? — Forced Migration Online|website=www.forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alden Speare, "in the strictest sense migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him." Movement under threat, even the immediate threat to life, contains a voluntary element, as long as there is an option to escape to another part of the country, go into hiding or to remain and hope to avoid persecution."&lt;ref name=conflict/&gt; However this thought has been questioned, especially by Marxians, who argue that in most cases migrants have little or no choice.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{cite web |title=FORCED MIGRATION IN INDONESIA : HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES |url=http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Graeme_Hugo-Forced_Migration_in_Indonesia-Historical_Perspectives.doc |work=graeme hugo |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Causes for forced displacement can include:
* [[Natural disaster]]: Occurrence of a disaster – such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, earthquakes or volcanoes – leads to temporary or permanent displacement of population from that area. In such a scenario, migration becomes more of a survival strategy, as natural disasters often cause the loss of money, homes, and jobs. For example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] resulted in displacement of almost the entire population of New Orleans, leaving the community and government with several economic and social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Oliver-Smith/ |title=Disasters and Forced Migration in the 21st Century |work=ssrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental problems]]: The term [[environmental refugee]] has been in use recently representing people who are forced to leave their traditional habitat because of environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood, or even environmental disruption i.e. biological, physical or chemical change in ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, University de Liege, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]], of deforestation or [[land degradation]]. Man-made disasters can also cause forced migration: examples are industrial accidents and especially accidents that involve radioactivity, such as in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. An elaboration of such migrants is given by Essam El-Hinnawi:
# Migrants who are able to return to their original habitat once the disruption is over, as in the case of the [[Bhopal disaster]].
# Migrants  who remain permanently displaced.
# Migrants  who seek better living conditions due to deterioration of environmental conditions in their present habitat, such as soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:1158 |title=Environment and forced migration : a review   Paper for 4th IRAP conference 5–9 January 1994, Oxford |author=Forced Migration Online, Refugee Studies Centre, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford |work=forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 19th century, for example, Ireland experienced a famine never before seen in the country’s history.
* [[War]], [[civil war]], [[political repression]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious conflict]]s: Some migrants are impelled to cross national borders by war or persecution, due to political, social, ethnic, religious reasons. These immigrants may be considered [[refugees]] if they apply for [[asylum seekers|asylum]] in the receiving country.&lt;ref&gt;Conventions No. 29, 105, 138 and 182; Convention No. 97 (Art. 3, Annex I; Art. 8 and Annex II, Art. 13); Convention No. 143, Part I; 1990 International Convention (Art. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development-induced displacement]]: Such displacement or [[population transfer]] is the forcing of communities and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of [[economic development]]. It has been historically associated with the construction of dams for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]] purposes but also appears due to many other activities, such as [[mining]] and transport (roads, ports, airports). The best-known recent example of such development-induced displacement may be that resulting from the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[China]]. This type of forced migration disproportionately affects low income earners and ethnic minorities. According to estimates, between 90 and 100 million people were forced to leave their homes due to development projects in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"/&gt;
* [[Human trafficking]] and [[human smuggling]]: Migrants displaced through deception or coercion with purpose of their exploitation fall under this category. The data on such forced migration are limited since the activities involved are clandestine in nature. While migration of this nature is well covered for male migrants (working in agriculture, construction etc.), same cannot be said for their female counterparts as the market situation for them might be unscrupulous (sex work or domestic service). The [[International Labour Organization]] considers trafficking an offence against labor protection and denies them the opportunity of utilizing their resources for their country. ILO’s Multilateral Framework includes principle no. 11 that recommends, "Governments should formulate and implement, in consultation with the social partners, measures to prevent abusive practices, migrant smuggling and people trafficking; they should also work towards preventing irregular labor migration.
* [[Slavery]]: History's greatest forced migration was the [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] during the 15th through the 19th centuries.  Of the 20 million Africans captured for the trade, half died in their forced march to the African coast, and another ten to twenty percent died on slave ships carrying them from Africa to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html |author=PBS-WGBH |title=The Middle Passage |work=Africans in America |date=1999 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethnic cleansing]]: The systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.

==Conditions==

In the majority of cases forced migration across borders takes place without the required documentation. It may even involve human smugglers and traffickers. Displaced people often place their lives at risk, are obliged to travel in inhumane conditions and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. And on top of that the states where they seek protection may regard them as a threat to their security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf | page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and distinctions between the terms==
{{see|Refugee law|Refugee}}
* The term 'Refugee Studies' denotes an academic discipline or field of study which covers the study of refugees, often their experiences in seeking refuge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Bobby Thomas|date=2014|title=Reflections on Refugee Studies and the Study of Refugees: Implications for Policy Analysts|url=https://bobbycameron.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/final_bobby-thomas-cameron_refugee-studies.pdf|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|pages=4–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several categories of individuals who are included in this study, with labels that include: 'Refugee’; ‘expellees’; ‘exile’; ‘displaced person’; ‘internally displaced person (IDP)’; ‘economic refugees’; ‘humanitarian refugee’; ‘stateless person’; ‘tsunami refugee’; ‘development refugee’; ‘environmental refugee’; ‘government assisted refugee (GAR)’ etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The term displaced person (DP) was first widely used during [[World War II]] and the resulting refugee outflows from [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman: ''Dps: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951''. Cornell University Press 1998 (reprint). {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was used to specifically refer to one removed from his or her native country as a [[refugee]], [[prison]]er or a [[unfree labour|slave laborer]]. Most of the victims of war, political refugees and DPs of the immediate post-Second World War period were Ukrainians, Poles, other Slavs, as well as citizens of the Baltic states – Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians, who refused to return to Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. A.J. Jaffe claimed that the term was originally coined by [[Eugene M. Kulischer]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Jaffe: Notes on the Population Theory of Eugene M. Kulischer. In: ''The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'', Vol. 40, No. 2. (April 1962). Pp. 187–206.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3348648 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning has significantly broadened in the past half-century.

* If the displaced person has crossed an international border and falls under one of the [[Refugee Law|relevant international legal instruments]], they may become a [[refugee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm U.N. Convention relating to status of Refugees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309151637/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "refugee" is also commonly used as a synonym for displaced person, causing confusion between the general descriptive class of anyone who has left their home and the subgroup of legally defined [[refugee]]s who enjoy specified international legal protection. However, forced migrants may not apply for asylum in the country they fled to, so they may not be classed as [[asylum seeker]]s or – if application would be successful – [[refugee]]s. The terms refugee and asylum seeker always have a legal framework or system as context. If forced migrants do not access this legal system or it does not exist in the country they have fled to, they cannot be categorised as such.

* Forced migrants are always either IDPs or displaced people, as both of these terms do not require a legal framework and the fact that they left their homes is sufficient. The distinction between the terms displaced person and forced migrant is minor, however, the term displaced person has an important historic context (e.g. [[World War II]]).

* A displaced person who crosses an international border without permission from the country they are entering, and without applying for asylum, may be considered an [[illegal immigrant]].

* A displaced person who left his or her home because of political persecution or violence, but did not cross an international border, is commonly considered to be the less well-defined category of [[internally displaced person]] (IDP), and is subject to more tenuous international protection. Bogumil Terminski distinguishes two general categories of internal displacement: displacement of risk (mostly conflict-induced displacement, deportations and disaster-induced displacement) and displacement of adaptation (associated with voluntary resettlement, development-induced displacement and environmentally-induced displacement).

* If the displaced person was forced out their home because of economically driven projects like that of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China and various [[India]]n dams, it is called [[development-induced displacement]]. People are also often displaced due to [[natural disaster|natural]] or man-made disasters. Displacement can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]]. A person who is displaced due to environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood is generally known as an [[environmental migrant]]. Such displacement can be cross-border in nature but is frequently internal. No specific international legal instrument applies to such individuals. Foreign nations often offer disaster relief to mitigate the effects of such disaster displacement.

* Displaced person generally refers to one who is forced to migrate for reasons other than economic conditions, such as war or persecution. A migrant who fled because of economic hardship is an [[economic migrant]].

==Criminal prosecution==
Forced displacement has been subjected to several trials before local and international courts. One of the requirements that need to be met for an offence as a [[war crime]] is that the victim is a "protected person" under [[international humanitarian law]]. The expression "protected person" originally referred only to the categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four [[Geneva Conventions of 1949]], but was later accepted as defining a [[civilian]] or police force who do not participate directly in a conflict.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e0344b344.pdf | title=Legal and Protection Policy Research Series: Forced Displacement and International Crimes |publisher=UNHCR| author=Guido Acquaviva |date=June 2011|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Krupp trial]] was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of civilian populations for the purpose of forced labour. The US Military Tribunal concluded that "
[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power".&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; At the [[Nuremberg trials]], [[Hans Frank]], chief jurist in [[occupied Poland]], was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nuremberg-trial-judgements-hans-frank|title=Nuremberg Trial Judgements: Hans Frank|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Article 49, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbids forced displacement:

{{quote3|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected people from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600056 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949 – DEPORTATIONS, TRANSFERS, EVACUATIONS |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:
{{quote3|"Deportation or forcible transfer of population" means forced displacement of the people concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf |publisher=International Criminal Court |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |year=2011 |p=7|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several people were tried and convicted by the [[ICTY]] for connection to forced displacement during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced [[Vojislav Šešelj]] 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating [[deportation]], [[persecution]] (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as [[crimes against humanity]] due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the [[expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmict.org/en/news/appeals-chamber-reverses-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj%E2%80%99s-acquittal-part-and-convicts-him-crimes-against-humanity|title=APPEALS CHAMBER REVERSES ŠEŠELJ’S ACQUITTAL, IN PART, AND CONVICTS HIM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY| date=11 April 2018| publisher=United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/europe/un-court-sentences-ultranationalist-serb-leader-to-10-years-16638|title=UN court sentences ultranationalist Serb leader to 10 years |publisher=[[TRT World]] |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/serbia-conviction-of-war-criminal-delivers-long-overdue-justice-to-victims/|title=Serbia: Conviction of war criminal delivers long overdue justice to victims| publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician [[Momčilo Krajišnik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal transfers former Bosnian Serb leader to UK prison |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/09/311692-un-tribunal-transfers-former-bosnian-serb-leader-uk-prison| date=8 September 2009|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ex-Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Martić]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal upholds 35-year jail term for leader of breakaway Croatian Serb state|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/10/277112-un-tribunal-upholds-35-year-jail-term-leader-breakaway-croatian-serb-state|date=8 October 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander [[Mladen Naletilić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Croat commander convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Italy |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/04/257282-bosnian-croat-commander-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-italy| date=25 April 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bosnian Serb politician [[Radoslav Brđanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Serb politician convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Denmark |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/03/251232-bosnian-serb-politician-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-denmark |date=4 March 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ferdinand VI 2.jpg|thumb|[[Fernando VI]], who approved the Great Roundup.]]
The '''Great Gypsy Round-up''' ({{lang-es|Gran Redada de Gitanos}}), also known as the '''general imprisonment of the gypsies''' (''prisión general de gitanos''), was a raid authorized and organized by the [[Spanish Monarchy]] that led to the arrest of all gypsies ([[Romani people in Spain|Romani]]) in the region, and their imprisonment in [[labor camp]]s. The raid was approved by the King [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]], and organized by the [[Marquis of Ensenada]], and set in motion simultaneously across Spain on July 30, 1749.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Another Darkness Another Dawn|last=Taylor|first=Becky|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd.:|year=2014|location=London UK|pages=105|ISBN=978-1-78023-257-7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a royal edict by [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] in 1695, Spanish gypsies had been restricted to certain towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/roma/Source/FS2/3.3_roundup-spain_english.pdf |author=Antonio Gómez Alfaro |title=The Great "Gypsy" Round-up in Spain |page=4 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official edict in 1717 restricted them to only 75 towns and districts, so that they would not be concentrated in any one region.

== Organization ==
The plans for the roundup were developed in secrecy. Among the first to draw up plans was the appointed Governor of the Council of Castile, [[Gaspar Vázquez Tablada]], [[Bishop of Oviedo]]. It was later also supported by the opinion of the [[Jesuit]] Father [[Francisco Rávago]], confessor to Ferdinand VI, whose reply about the morality of the roundup can be summarised in his commentary that: 
{{quote|The means proposed by the governor of the council to root out this bad race, which is hateful to God and pernicious to man, seem good to me. The king will be making a great gift to God, Our Lord, if he manages to get rid of these people.}}

The plan entailed sending troops to the towns with gypsy settlements, each carrying sealed set of instructions, which were only to be revealed to the commanders on a date just prior to the roundup in August. The gypsy settlements were to be surrounded, and all able-bodied adult gypsy males were internally deported to [[forced labor]] in the Naval arsenals or to specified mines, prisons, or factories. The women and children were forced into clothing manufacture. Those too ill to travel would remain in military custody until well enough to travel, or until they reached a "Christian death". The operation was to be funded by confiscated goods and homes of the gypsies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Another Darkness Another Dawn|last=Taylor|first=Becky|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd.:|year=2014|location=London UK|pages=105|ISBN=978-1-78023-257-7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanics of the raid varied in efficiency from town to town. The roundup in [[Seville]], where the city gates were closed by the encircling army to prevent escape of the target, created alarm in the general public, who was ignorant of the goals. Special edicts were obtained to prevent the use of churches as [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. The definition of who exactly was a gypsy proved to be difficult in many cases, and was prone to abuse. For example, Gypsies married to non-gypsies were often spared. Nomadic gypsies, already less frequent, proved difficult to roundup. Ultimately, nearly 9-12 thousand gypsies were detained. The latter stages of transport and housing of the detainees proved less organized.

==Reversal==

As protests began to arise from different communities, the orders were repeatedly modified to permit the release of some gypsies, often creating confusion among the local military commanders. Gradually, further imprisonments became sporadic, and in 1763, those gypsies who still remained in forced labor were ordered to be released by the king, a process that took the better part of two years.

==Epilogue==
The ''Gran Redada'' can be viewed as one of the last attempts by the crown of Spain to ''purify'' the country of Spain by large-scale dislocation of a whole ethnic community, preceded by the [[Alhambra Decree|Expulsion of the Jews]] in 1492 and the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24401">Created on July 8, 1992 by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE), now known as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the '''High Commissioner on National Minorities''' (HCNM) is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between and within the participating states of the OSCE. The HCNM focuses on the OSCE area and will alert the Organisation where a situation has the potential to develop into a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Mandate, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107878. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The Organisation consists of 57 participating States across North America, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE Participating States, at http://www.osce.org/states. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the HCNM is generally considered to be a “success story”&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 111&lt;/ref&gt; and a useful instrument of conflict prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of the office of HCNM was directly related to the political circumstances at the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yugoslav Wars]] were ethnic conflicts that broke out after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and of Communism, and which eventually resulted in the break up of the country. Efforts of the CSCE, [[European Union]] and [[United Nations]] failed to bring peace. The frustration at being unable to prevent such a devastating human tragedy led to the Netherlands government proposing the post of the HCNM.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 16&lt;/ref&gt; This office would aim to prevent conflicts based on tensions with ethnic minorities. In regards to the Yugoslav tragedy, international efforts were deemed to have failed because of the limited knowledge of the international mediators of the ethnic situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; This often meant that tensions escalated because the international community did not fully understand the issues at play. Further, any international aid that was provided came too late. It was recognised that such tensions should be identified and addressed as early as possible in order to prevent escalation into endless conflict. The Yugoslav conflict also made clear that many conflicts around the world were rooted in tensions involving national minorities. It was against this background that the proposal for the office of the HCNM was presented.

===Opposition to the proposal===

Many concerns were raised in regards to the model put forward by the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, several major restrictions to the HCNM’s role were implemented into the mandate.

States disagreed on whether the rights of national minorities were individual or group rights. Ultimately, there was a clear exclusion of individual cases through paragraph 5(c) of the HCNM mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 5(c), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibits the High Commissioner from considering “violations of CSCE commitments with regard to an individual person belonging to a national minority”. Many states feared that the HCNM would become a sort of "[[ombudsman]]" for national minorities. The aim of the office was not to create a new human rights instrument, but to create a conflict prevention tool.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 18&lt;/ref&gt; This was emphasised in the title of the office: the High Commissioner ''on'' National Minorities, not ''for'' National Minorities.

Many states were also highly opposed to involvement by the HCNM in cases of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 19&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the HCNM was prohibited from considering ‘national minority issues in situations involving organized acts of terrorism’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 5(b), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; The international community further decided that the HCNM should not be able to ‘communicate with and (...) acknowledge communications from any person or organization which practices or publicly condones terrorism or violence’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 25, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances this clause has become a way for states to ban the HCNM from interfering with their minority problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambiguity in the mandate===
The HCNM’s mandate as defined at the Helsinki Summit meeting in 1992 contained many ambiguities, the most significant of which is the definition of “national minorities”. No clear guidance was given in the mandate on how to interpret this term. This was largely because  the CSCE participating states could not come to an agreement on the definition of "national minorities", and therefore opted to provide no definition at all.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The first High Commissioner, [[Max van der Stoel]], focused on clarifying and defining his mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 21&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by consulting many experts on minority rights and international law, and thereby developing a set of guidelines and practices for overcoming the ambiguities in the mandate. Through the broadly defined mandate, he was able to approach the role in the best way he saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 22&lt;/ref&gt; The approach taken by van der Stoel came to define how his successors approached the role too. His definition of “national minorities” had three different elements.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, a national minority could be distinguished from the rest of society through linguistic, ethnic or cultural characteristics. Secondly, that minority strived to protect and strengthen those characteristics which made up its identity. Finally, he referenced paragraph 32 of the 1990 CSCE Copenhagen Document,&lt;ref&gt;Confoerence for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE’ 1990, paragraph 32, at http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/14304?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasised that being a part of a national minority was a person’s individual choice.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; In the approach taken by van der Stoel and his successors, there is no requirement that a national minority be a numerical minority in the population.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases a national minority will be a majority in certain countries or regions.

==Function==
The main role of the HCNM is to identify and address tensions involving national minorities which could develop into a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This involves “early warning” of potential conflict followed by “early action” to dissolve tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 3, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate authorises the HCNM to assess ‘the role of the parties directly concerned, the nature of the tensions and recent developments therein and, where possible, the potential consequences for peace and stability within the OSCE area’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 11(b), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; Her most important role is not necessarily to completely resolve all potential conflicts, but rather to manage them in a way that the tension between groups does not escalate but declines.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; This involves mediation as well as the introduction of sustainable solutions.

Ultimately, the role of the High Commissioner is one of preventative diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 26&lt;/ref&gt; She must provide early warnings of escalating tensions as well as early action to prevent any further escalation. Tensions between different societal groups can arise over a variety of elements, such as ethnicity, religion, or language.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Conflict prevention and resolution, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/117648. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM works to sort through these tensions and towards social cohesion, before those tensions escalate into conflicts. The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, noted that the HCNM should aim to prevent disputes from arising into armed conflicts, but should also understand that in some cases the situation may go beyond the realm of preventative diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 27&lt;/ref&gt; Where conflicts can only be resolved in the long term, a more comprehensive approach must be taken. This may result in the High Commissioner issuing an early warning notice to the Permanent Council, alongside a request for the OSCE to issue her an ‘ad hoc’ mandate for late prevention of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 113 CHECK&lt;/ref&gt; An early warning notice under paragraph 15 of the mandate has only been issued once before, in regards to the 1999 Kosovo crisis.&lt;ref&gt;CHECK Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to promote social cohesion, the HCNM must provide advice and take actions that are context specific. Significant research should be undertaken about the specific society and ethnic groups involved in order to effectively respond to the situation. Van der Stoel always prepared extensively for any state involvement, often by organising a one- or two-day workshop with leading experts in several relevant areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15  at 21&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this approach arose due to the failures of the international community during the Yugoslav Wars, where a lack of understanding about the ethnic situation by international mediators often led to a worsening of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The work undertaken by the High Commissioners since the inception of the role is considered to have been largely successful.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 75&lt;/ref&gt; The role requires expertise, tools and experience in monitoring situations of potential tension, as well as in recognising signs of escalation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 64&lt;/ref&gt; Such knowledge and skill is invaluable in regards to conflict prevention involving minorities, because these situations are often very precarious and complex. No inter-ethnic tension is alike, and each will involve different factors and historical and cultural influences. There is therefore a clear need for a dedicated office specialised in and focused on minority issues.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods used in conflict prevention===

The HCNM employs several different techniques in order to achieve her purpose of conflict prevention.  The High Commissioner works very closely with the particular state involved and with the leaders of the relevant parties. While the HCNM ultimately cannot enforce any compulsory action, there are many ways that the HCNM can assist the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Commissioner will assist in preventing an escalating conflict by introducing a minimum standard of minority rights, which should be upheld by the state and other majority actors. She may also assist in implementing those standards and helping them become the norm in that state. There are seven sets of thematic recommendations that can provide a platform for better inter-ethnic relations and help to reduce tension. These include recommendations on education, linguistic rights, participation, kin-states, policing in multi-ethnic societies, minority languages in broadcast media, and integration and conflict prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 65&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM frequently recommends that states take measures to protect minority languages, as this is one of the major causes of inter-ethnic tension.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Minority and majority languages, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107883. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, the OSCE and HCNM also promote a policy of integration, which strives for a balance between protection of minority culture and the development of an overarching common identity. This involves integration policies such as encouragement to learn the state language.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, F. (2010) ''Integration as Conflict Prevention: Possibilities and Limitations in the experience of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Security and Human Rights, 21(3) 220 at 221&lt;/ref&gt; The High Commissioner also promotes education of national minority languages and religious practices as a way to prevent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Education and conflict prevention, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107882. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This is a way to foster an appreciation of diversity among communities and also to dissolve stereotypes about certain ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Education and conflict prevention, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107882. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The HCNM will also focus on improving communication between the parties involved, including leaders of the state and leaders of the opposing national groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 113&lt;/ref&gt; This involves assisting processes of negotiations and ensuring participation by all relevant parties. When creating the role, it was recognised that the most frequent cause of hostile inter-ethnic relations was insufficient or distorted communication.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 115&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM plays an important role in setting up lines of effective communication before hostile relations begin to develop.

In order to develop a peaceful society the High Commissioner strives to ensure that all minority groups are sufficiently involved in public life, and are fairly represented at national, regional and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Promoting effective participation in public life, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107884. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By ensuring that minority groups are involved in decision-making processes and that they enjoy some level of influence, states can prevent these groups from becoming marginalised. Active and effective participation also provides remedies for groups who feel their rights are being violated, and in doing so can prevent such groups from seeking remedies in a more violent manner.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, all governments may exercise a right of refusal against participation of the High Commissioner, and may prevent her from entering the country. In such a circumstance, the HCNM is to inform the OSCE.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 28, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Ukraine==

The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, was involved with inter-ethnic tensions in [[Ukraine]] between a substantial Russian minority and the Ukraine government from 1994 to 2001. His work during this time was considered largely successful in reducing tensions and building towards peaceful solutions. This conflict was multi layered and emphasised the importance of finding durable solutions in the search for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 389&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disintegration of the [[USSR]] and [[Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, tensions began to arise as Ukraine sought to establish its identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 391&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these uneasy relations were caused by historical Russian domination over Ukraine, as well as the prevalence of Russian language in Ukrainian life. While the HCNM was not the only influential actor in managing and resolving these issues, he played a critical role in establishing movement towards peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt;

The flexibility of the HCNM’s mandate and the nature of the role allowed van der Stoel to become involved in the tensions in Ukraine at a very early stage. He was able to craft a tactful and creative approach to dealing with the precarious issues that had arisen at that stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 392&lt;/ref&gt; The success of his work there is in large part credited to his ability to build a relationship of trust with the parties involved and to approach all issues from the basis of impartiality.

The HCNM was invited to Ukraine by the government in February 1994. In Ukraine at that time there were several minority issues that were causing tension. The HCNM  was involved in managing the relations between the Russian minority and the Ukrainian majority, the status of [[Crimea]] within Ukraine, and resettlement of the [[Crimean Tatars]].&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, descent into violent conflict was prevented in all areas. However, while the HCNM’s work was largely successful, it also exposed the limitations of the role. The Ukrainian government was unwilling to implement the majority of his recommendations, even though it was consistently willing to engage with the HCNM.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while the HCNM ultimately played a critical role in conflict prevention in Ukraine, his ability to secure a sustainable solution across all areas of tension was often limited.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 394&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] is a religion which incorporates diverse views on the concept of God. Different traditions of Hinduism have different theistic views, and these views have been described by scholars as [[polytheism]], [[monotheism]], [[henotheism]], [[panentheism]], [[pantheism]], [[monism]], [[agnostic]], [[humanism]], [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism]] or [[Nontheism|non-theism]].&lt;ref&gt;[a] [[Julius J.

Marty (2010), A Dictionary of Philosophy of Religion, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1441111975}}, pages 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism does not posit or require such a belief, and is considered a non-monotheistic religion by scholars of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Ackroyd|title=Divinity in Things: Religion Without Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bv8o5lGxtgAC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2009|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-333-1 |pages=78 }}, Quote: "The jealous God who says, "Thou shalt have no other gods but me" belongs to the Jewish-Christian-Muslim tradition, but not to the Hindu tradition, which tolerates all gods but is not a monotheism, monism, yes, but not monotheism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Whaling|title=Understanding Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WudXAAAAYAAJ |year=2010|publisher=Dunedin Academic Press |isbn=978-1-903765-36-4 |pages=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hiroshi Ōbayashi|title=Death and afterlife: perspectives of world religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ub8oAAAAYAAJ |year=1992|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-94104-8 |pages=145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditions within Hinduism share the Vedic idea of a metaphysical ultimate reality and truth called [[Brahman]] instead. According to [[Jan Gonda]], Brahman denoted the  "power immanent in the sound, words, verses and formulas of Vedas" in the earliest Vedic texts. The early Vedic religious understanding of Brahman underwent a series of abstractions in the Hindu scriptures that followed the Vedic scriptures. These scriptures would reveal a vast body of insights into the nature of Brahman as originally revealed in the Vedas. These Hindu traditions that emerged from or identified with the Vedic scriptures and that maintained the notion of a metaphysical ultimate reality would identify that ultimate reality as Brahman. Hindu adherents to these traditions within Hinduism revere Hindu deities and, indeed, all of existence, as aspects of the Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, ''Brahman'', The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, pages 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; The deities in Hinduism are not considered to be almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent, and spirituality is considered to be seeking the ultimate truth that is possible by a number of paths.&lt;ref name=johnmurdoch141&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7cEF8JfPHQC |year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03163-0|page=63}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey P.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], there are many different schools.&lt;ref name=bowker194&gt;{{cite book|author=John Bowker|title=Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7IcQL1JBvAC |year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09903-5 |pages=194, 206–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta such as Advaita do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God (monotheistic God), while its theistic traditions posit a personal God left to the choice of the Hindu. The major schools of Hindu philosophy explain morality and the nature of existence through the [[karma]] and [[samsara]] doctrines, as in other Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaufman | first=Whitley R.

Contemporary Hinduism can be categorized into four major traditions: [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], and [[Smarta Tradition|Smartism]]. Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism worship [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], and [[Devi]] — the Divine Mother — as the Supreme respectively, or consider all Hindu deities as aspects of the formless Supreme Reality or [[Brahman]]. Other minor sects such as [[Ganapatya]] and [[Saura (Hinduism)|Saura]] focus on [[Ganesha]] and [[Surya]] as the Supreme. A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century (where Vishnu as Krishna is a monotheistic God). This tradition posits a concept of monotheistic God so similar to Christianity that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 177-179&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-21}}

Krishnaism is a sub-tradition of Vaishnavism wherein Krishna is considered ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]'', meaning 'Lord Himself' and it is used exclusively to designate Krishna as the Supreme Lord.&lt;ref name=Gupta20071&gt;Gupra, 2007, p.36 note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = jsn&gt;''Bhagawan Swaminarayan bicentenary commemoration volume, 1781-1981.'' p. 154: ...Shri Vallabhacharya [and] Shri Swaminarayan...

Gaudiya Vaishnavas and followers of the [[Vallabha Sampradaya]] [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], use the [[Gopala Tapani Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B. V. Tripurari |title=Gopala-tapani Upanisad |publisher=Audarya Press |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-932771-12-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bhagavata Purana, to support their view that Krishna is indeed the ''Svayam Bhagavan''. This belief was summarized by the 16th century author [[Jiva Goswami]] in some of his works, such as ''Krishna-sandarbha''.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007&gt;{{cite book| author = Gupta, Ravi M.| year = 2007| title = Caitanya Vaisnava Vedanta of Jiva Gosvami| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-40548-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta2004&gt;{{cite book| author = Gupta, Ravi M.| year = 2004| title = Caitanya Vaisnava Vedanta: Acintyabhedabheda in Jiva Gosvami's Catursutri tika| publisher = University Of Oxford| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other sub-traditions of Vaishnavism, Krishna is one of many aspects and [[avatar]]s of Vishnu (Rama is another, for example), recognized and understood from an eclectic assortment of perspectives and viewpoints.&lt;ref name=Mahony1987&gt;{{cite journal| author = Mahony, W.K.| year = 1987| title = Perspectives on Krishna's Various Personalities| journal = History of Religions| volume = 26| issue = 3| pages = 333–335| url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1062381?uid=3739616&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103483476523|deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-02-10| doi = 10.1086/463085| jstor=1062381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2088">In [[Inuit mythology]], an '''inua''' (ᐃᓄᐊ; plural '''inuat''' ᐃᓄᐊᑦ, literally "possessor" or "master") is a [[Soul (spirit)|spirit or soul]] that exists in all people, animals, lakes, mountains, and plants.  They were sometimes personified in mythology.  The concept is similar to [[mana]]. For arctic people, human and animals are equal - All life has the same kind of soul or "life essence" (inua). This creates a predicament that, in order to survive people must kill other creatures that are like them. Recognition of this dilemma lies at the centre of hunting practice, which is based upon respect and reciprocity. The hunter will only succeed if the animal chooses to give its life as a gift in return for moral and respectful behaviour on the part of the whole community. For example, after a seal has been killed fresh water is poured into its mouth so that its soul will not be thirsty and it will tell the other seals of the respect shown to it.

Among the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Yu'pik]] near Kuskokwim Bay of Coastal Alaska, the word '''yua''' (absolutive case form of the word ''yuk'' "human; human-like spirit") has similar connotations as that of the Iñupiaq of Northern Alaska, who similar to the Inuit call it ''iñua'' or ''inua''. For both the Yu'piak and Iñupiaq, the meaning is closest to an understanding of a world in which "Most Arctic peoples believe all the world is animate, and that animals have souls or spirits", (Berlo and Phillips 161) a foundational belief of the continuum and inter-connectivity of all life and spirit of all that which is, that which has been, and that which is yet to be.

'''Johnny D. Bright''' (June 11, 1930 &amp;ndash; December 14, 1983) was a professional [[Canadian football]] player in the [[Canadian Football League]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Drake University]]. He is a member of the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]], the [[National Football Foundation]]'s [[College Football Hall of Fame]], the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Hall of Fame, the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] [[Edmonton Eskimos#Wall of Honour|Wall of Honour]], the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame, and the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'s'' Iowa Sports Hall of Fame.

In 1951, Bright was named a First Team [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]], and was awarded the [[Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Award|Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Sportsmanship Award]]. In 1969, Bright was named Drake University's greatest football player of all time. Bright is the only Drake football player to have his jersey number (No.&amp;nbsp;43) retired by the school, and in June 2006, received honorable mention from ''[[ESPN]].com'' senior writer Ivan Maisel as one of the best college football players to ever wear No.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/newsstory.php?nid=1151679923 |accessdate=2006-07-08 |title=Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized |publisher=DrakeBulldogs.org |date=2006-06-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060711061727/http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/newsstory.php?nid=1151679923 |archivedate = 2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, the football field at [[Drake Stadium (Drake University)|Drake Stadium]], in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa – Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcci.com/sports/7374962/detail.html?rss=des&amp;psp=sports |accessdate=2006-08-12 |title=KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa – Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions |publisher=KCCI.com |date=2006-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307063552/http://www.kcci.com/sports/7374962/detail.html?rss=des&amp;psp=sports |archivedate=2006-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Bright was voted one of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s [[TSN Top 50 CFL Players|Top 50 players]] (No.&amp;nbsp;19) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].&lt;ref name="TSN Top 50 CFL Players"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/feature/?fid=10866 |accessdate=2007-04-28 |title=TSN Top 50 CFL Players |publisher=TSN.ca |date=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his outstanding professional and college football careers, Bright is perhaps best known for his role as the victim of an intentional, most likely racially motivated, on-field assault by an opposing college football player from Oklahoma A&amp;M (now [[Oklahoma State University – Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]]) on October 20, 1951, that was captured in a widely disseminated and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning photo sequence, and eventually came to be known as the "[[Johnny Bright incident]]."

==Early life==
Born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] on June 11, 1930, Bright was the second oldest of five brothers. Bright lived with his  mother and step father Daniel Bates, brothers, Homer Bright, the eldest, Alfred, Milton, and Nate Bates, in a [[working class]], predominantly [[African-American]] neighborhood in Fort Wayne.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett | first=Warrick |quote= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WG8JAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=johnny+bright+champion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FoTlTeSMHMbQiALM-9XkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |title=Johnny Bright, Champion |year=1996 |publisher=toExcel |location= |isbn=978-0-595-09704-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–14, 52}}

Bright was a three-sport ([[High school football|football]], [[High school basketball|basketball]], [[track and field]]) star at Fort Wayne's Central High School.  Bright, who also was an accomplished [[Fastpitch softball|softball]] pitcher and [[Boxing|boxer]], led Central High's football team to a City title in 1945, and helped the basketball team to two state tournament Final Four appearances.&lt;ref name="Go, Johnny, Go:  Johnny Bright could do it all"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwnextweb1.fortwayne.com/ns/sports/top50/bright.php |accessdate=2011-04-25 |author=Sebring, Blake |title=Go, Johnny, Go:  Johnny Bright could do it all |publisher=''Fort Wayne News-Sentinel'' |date=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003221245/http://fwnextweb1.fortwayne.com/ns/sports/top50/bright.php |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of college football career==
Following his graduation from Central High in 1947, Bright initially accepted a football scholarship at [[Michigan State University]], but, apparently unhappy with the direction of the [[Michigan State Spartans football|Spartans football]] program, transferred to [[Drake University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], where he accepted a track and field scholarship that allowed him to try out for the football and [[College basketball|basketball]] squads.&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt;{{rp|52}}&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright, Drake University, 1970"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19700324/SPORTS11/50623029/Johnny-Bright-Drake-University-1970 |accessdate=2011-04-25 |author=Turnbull, Buck |title=Johnny Bright, Drake University, 1970 |publisher=''Des Moines Register'' |date=1970-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121183721/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19700324/SPORTS11/50623029/Johnny-Bright-Drake-University-1970 |archivedate=2013-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright eventually lettered in [[College football|football]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[College basketball|basketball]], during his collegiate career at Drake.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright, Drake University, 1970"/&gt;

Following a mandatory freshman [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] year, Bright began his collegiate football career in 1949, rushing for 975 yards and throwing for another 975 to lead the nation in total offense during his sophomore year, as the [[Drake Bulldogs football|Drake Bulldogs]] finished their season at 6–2–1.&lt;ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright – Drake's Greatest Football Player"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |accessdate=2006-08-12 |title=2005 Drake Bulldogs Football Media Guide: The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player |publisher=Drake University |year=2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226033209/http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bright's junior year, the [[Running back|halfback]]/[[quarterback]] rushed for 1,232 yards and passed for 1,168 yards, setting an [[NCAA]] record for total offense (2,400 yards) in 1950, and again led the Bulldogs to a 6–2–1 record.&lt;ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright – Drake's Greatest Football Player"/&gt;

Bright's senior year began with great promise. Bright was considered a pre-season [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate, and was leading the nation in both rushing and total offense with 821 and 1,349 yards respectively, when the Drake Bulldogs, winners of their previous five games, faced [[Missouri Valley Conference]] foe [[Oklahoma State Cowboys|Oklahoma A&amp;M]] at Lewis Field (now [[Boone Pickens Stadium]]) in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], on October 20, 1951.

=="Johnny Bright Incident"==
[[File:Johnny Bright Incident.jpg|thumb|left|Johnny Bright Incident – Oct. 21, 1951 ''Des Moines Register'' newspaper cover showing Robinson and Ultang photo sequence&lt;ref name="Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=40&amp;REC=8 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |first=John |last=Robinson |author2=Don Ultang |title=Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14 |publisher=Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') |date=1951-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main|Johnny Bright incident}}
Bright's participation as a halfback/quarterback in Drake's game against Oklahoma A&amp;M on October 20, 1951, was controversial, as it marked the first time that such a prominent [[African-American]] athlete, with national notoriety (Bright was a pre-season [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate and led the nation in total offense going into the game) and of critical importance to the success of his team (Drake was undefeated and carried a five-game winning streak into the contest, due in large part to his rushing and passing), had played against Oklahoma A&amp;M in a home game at [[Lewis Field]], in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]].&lt;ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=26&amp;REC=2 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |author=White, Maury |title=Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14 |publisher=Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') |date=1951-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first seven minutes of the game, Bright had been knocked unconscious three times by blows from Oklahoma A&amp;M [[defensive tackle]] [[Johnny Bright Incident#Wilbanks Smith|Wilbanks Smith]]. While the final, elbow blow from Smith broke Bright's jaw, Bright was able to complete a 61-yard touchdown pass to halfback Jim Pilkington a few plays later before the injury finally forced Bright to leave the game. Bright finished the game with 75 yards (14 yards rushing and 61 yards passing), the first time he had finished a game with less than 100 yards in his three-year collegiate career at Drake. Oklahoma A&amp;M eventually won the game 27-14.&lt;ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14"/&gt;

A photographic sequence by ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' cameramen [[Don Ultang]] and John Robinson clearly showed that Smith's jaw breaking blow to Bright had occurred well after Bright had handed off the ball to [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] Gene Macomber, and that the blow was delivered well behind the play.&lt;ref name="Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14"/&gt;  Years later, Ultang said that he and Robinson were lucky to capture the incident when they did; they'd only planned to stay through the first quarter so they could get the film developed in time for the next day's edition.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/sports/football/27ultang.html "Don Ultang, Pioneer in Aerial Photography, Dies at 91"], ''The New York Times'', September 27, 2008. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been an open secret before the game that A&amp;M was planning to target Bright.  Even though A&amp;M had integrated two years earlier, the [[Jim Crow]] spirit was still very much alive in Stillwater.  Both Oklahoma A&amp;M's student newspaper, ''[[The Daily O'Collegian]]'', and the local newspaper, ''[[NewsPress|The News Press]]'', reported that Bright was a marked man, and several A&amp;M students were openly claiming that Bright "would not be around at the end of the game."  Ultang and Robinson had actually set up their camera after rumors of Bright being targeted became too loud to ignore.&lt;ref name="Schmidly closes door on Johnny Bright disgrace"/&gt;

When it became apparent that neither Oklahoma A&amp;M nor the MVC would take any disciplinary action against Smith, Drake withdrew from the MVC in protest and stayed out until 1956 (though it didn't return for football until 1971).  Fellow member [[Bradley University]] pulled out of the league as well in solidarity with Drake; while it returned for non-football sports in 1955, Bradley never played another down of football in the MVC (it dropped football in 1970).&lt;ref name="1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=37&amp;REC=1 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Moorhead, Jim | title = 1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1964-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Johnny Bright Incident", as it became widely known, eventually provoked changes in [[NCAA]] football rules regarding illegal blocking, and mandated the use of more protective helmets with face guards.&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter: Blow helped clean up sports"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=36&amp;REC=4 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |author=Hanson, Dave |title=Bright not bitter: Blow helped clean up sports |publisher=Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') |date=1980-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalling the incident without apparent bitterness in a 1980 ''Des Moines Register'' interview three years before his death, Bright commented: "There's no way it couldn't have been racially motivated... . ..What I like about the whole deal now, and what I'm smug enough to say, is that getting a broken jaw has somehow made college athletics better. It made the NCAA take a hard look and clean up some things that were bad."&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports"/&gt;

==Post-injury and end of college football career==
Bright's jaw injury limited his effectiveness for the remainder of his senior season at Drake, but he finished his college career with 5,983 yards in total offense, averaging better than 236 yards per game in total offense, and scored 384 points in 25 games.&lt;ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright – Drake's Greatest Football Player"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |accessdate=2006-08-12 |title=2005 Drake Bulldogs Football Media Guide: The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player |publisher=Drake University |year=2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226033209/http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior, Bright earned 70 percent of the yards Drake gained and scored 70 percent of the [[Drake Bulldogs football|Bulldogs]]' points, despite missing the better part of the final three games of the season.

Following his final football season at Drake (1951), Bright was named a First Team [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]] and finished fifth in the balloting for the 1951 [[Heisman Trophy]].  Bright was also awarded the [[Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Award|Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Sportsmanship Award]], and played in both the post-season [[East–West Shrine Game]] and the [[Hula Bowl]].

In 1969, Bright was named Drake University's greatest football player of all time. He is also the only Drake football player to have his jersey number (No.&amp;nbsp;43) retired by the school.  In June 2006, Bright received honorable mention from ''[[ESPN]].com'' senior writer Ivan Maisel as one of the best college football players to ever wear No.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized"/&gt;

==Professional football career==
Bright was the first pick of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the first round of the [[1952 NFL Draft|1952 National Football League draft]]. Bright spurned the NFL, electing to play for the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]], the precursor to the [[Canadian Football League West Division|West Division of the Canadian Football League]]. Bright later commented: 

{{quote|I would have been their (the Eagles') first [[African American|Negro]] player. There was a tremendous influx of [[Southern United States|Southern]] players into the NFL at that time, and I didn't know what kind of treatment I could expect.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"&gt;{{cite web |last=Soutar |first=Ted |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_legends_bright |title=CFL Legend: Johnny Bright |publisher=CFL.ca |accessdate=August 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922191450/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_legends_bright |archive-date=2008-09-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bright joined the Calgary Stampeders as a [[fullback (American football)|fullback]]/[[linebacker]] in [[1952 in Canadian football|1952]], leading the Stampeders and the WIFU in rushing with 815 yards his rookie season.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; Bright played fullback/linebacker with the Stampeders for the 1952, [[1953 in Canadian football|1953]], and part of the [[1954 in Canadian football|1954]] seasons. In 1954, the Calgary Stampeders traded him to the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] in mid-season. He would enjoy the most success of his professional football career as a member of the Eskimos.

Though Bright played strictly defense as a linebacker in his first year with the Eskimos, he played both offense (as a fullback) and defense for two seasons ([[1955 in Canadian football|1955]]–[[1956 in Canadian football|1956]]), and played offense permanently after that ([[1957 in Canadian football|1957]]–[[1964 CFL season|1964]]). He, along with teammates [[Rollie Miles]], [[Normie Kwong]], and [[Jackie Parker]], helped lead the Eskimos to successive [[Grey Cup]] titles in [[42nd Grey Cup|1954]], [[43rd Grey Cup|1955]], and [[44th Grey Cup|1956]] (where Bright rushed for a then Grey Cup record of 171 yards in a 50–27 win over the [[Montreal Alouettes]]).&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; In 1957, he rushed for eight consecutive 100-yard games, finishing the season with 1,679 yards. In [[1958 CFL season|1958]], he rushed for 1,722 yards.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; In [[1959 CFL season|1959]], following his third straight season as the Canadian pro rushing leader with 1,340 yards, Bright won the [[CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award]], the first [[African-American]] or [[African-Canadian]] athlete to be so honored.

Bright was approached several times during his Canadian career by NFL teams about playing in the United States, but in the days before the blockbuster salaries of today's NFL players, it was common for CFL players such as him to hold regular jobs in addition to football, and he had already started a [[teacher|teaching]] career in 1957, the year he moved his family to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. 

{{quote|I'd established a home and Canada had been good to me. I might have been interested, if the offers could have matched what I was making from both football and teaching.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt;}}

Bright retired in [[1964 CFL season|1964]] as the CFL's all-time leading rusher ([[Mike Pringle (football)|Mike Pringle]] and [[George Reed (Canadian football)|George Reed]] have since surpassed him). Bright rushed for 10,909 yards in 13 seasons, had five consecutive 1,000 yard seasons, and led the CFL in rushing four times. While Bright is currently 15th on the All-Pro Rushing list, his career average of 5.5 yards per carry is the highest among 10,000+ yard rushers ([[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r [[Jim Brown]] is second at 5.2 yards per carry).&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; At the time of his retirement, Bright had a then-CFL record thirty-six 100-plus-yard games, carrying the ball 200 or more times for five straight seasons. Bright led the [[Canadian Football League West Division|CFL Western Conference]] in rushing four times, winning the [[Eddie James Memorial Trophy]] in the process, and was a CFL Western Conference All-Star five straight seasons from [[1957 in Canadian football|1957]] to [[1961 CFL season#CFL All Stars|1961]]. Bright played in 197 consecutive CFL games as a fullback/linebacker. Bright's No.&amp;nbsp;24 jersey was added to the Edmonton Eskimos' [[Edmonton Eskimos#Wall of Honour|Wall of Honour]] at the Eskimos' [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]] in 1983. Bright was inducted into the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] on November 26, 1970. In November 2006, Bright was voted one of the [[TSN Top 50 CFL Players|CFL's Top 50 players]] (No.&amp;nbsp;19) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].&lt;ref name="TSN Top 50 CFL Players"/&gt;

==Post-football career and death==
Bright earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in education at [[Drake University]] in 1952,&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright All-Time Drake Great"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=47&amp;REC=16 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |author=Podolsky, Mickey |title=Johnny Bright All-Time Drake Great |publisher=Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') |date=1963-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a teacher, coach, and school administrator, both during and after his professional football career, eventually rising to the seat of [[Head teacher|principal]] of D.S. Mackenzie Junior High School and Hillcrest Junior High School in [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. He was head coach at Edmonton's Bonnie Doon High School in the 1960s when the Lancers were a champion football team.

He became a [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizen]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt;

Bright died of a massive [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on December 14, 1983, at the [[University of Alberta Hospital]] in Edmonton, while undergoing elective surgery to correct a knee injury suffered during his football career.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright, A Star of Football in 1950's"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/16/obituaries/johnny-bright-a-star-of-football-in-1950-s.html | accessdate=2011-04-25 | title=Johnny Bright, A Star of Football in 1950's | work=The New York Times | date=1983-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife and four children.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright, Drake University, 1970"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Despite irrefutable evidence of the incident, Oklahoma A&amp;M officials denied anything had happened.  Indeed, Oklahoma A&amp;M/State refused to make any further official comment on the incident for over half a century.  This was the case even when Drake's former dean of men, [[Robert B. Kamm]], became president of OSU in 1966; years later, he said that the determination to gloss over the affair was so strong that he knew he could not even discuss it.  Finally, on September 28, 2005, Oklahoma State President [[David J. Schmidly]] wrote a letter to Drake President [[David Maxwell (academic)|David Maxwell]] formally apologizing for the incident, calling it "an ugly mark on Oklahoma State University and college football."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6299">'''Kaivalya''' (कैवल्य), is the ultimate goal of [[Raja yoga]] and means "solitude", "detachment" or "isolation", a ''[[vrddhi]]''-derivation from ''kevala'' "alone, isolated". It is the isolation of [[Samkhya#Puruṣa|purusha]] from [[prakṛti]], and subsequent liberation from rebirth, i.e., [[Moksha]]. Kaivalya-Mukti is described in some Upanishads such as [[Muktika Upanishad|Muktika]] and [[Kaivalya Upanishad|Kaivalya]] as the most superior form of [[Moksha]] which can grant liberation both within this life [[Jivanmukti]] and after death [[Videhamukti]] and the essence of all [[Upanishads]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warrier |first1=Dr. A. G. Krishna |title=Muktika Upanishad |publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House |location=Chennai |url=http://www.vedarahasya.net/muktika.htm |accessdate=27 June 2018 |ref=Sloka 18-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
== Patanjali ==

The 34 [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] of the fourth chapter deal with impressions left by our endless cycles of birth and the rationale behind the necessity of erasing such impressions. It portrays the [[yogi]], who has attained ''kaivalya'', as an entity who has gained independence from all bondages and achieved the absolute true consciousness or ''ritambhara prajna'' described in the Samadhi Pada.

"…Or, to look from another angle, the power of pure [[consciousness]] settles in its own pure nature."
''—Kaivalya Pada: Sutra 34.''

"Only the minds born of meditation are free from [[karmic]] impressions."
—''Kaivalya Pada: Sutra 6.''

"Since the desire to live is [[eternity|eternal]], impressions are also beginningless.
The impressions being held together by [[cause]], [[Causality|effect]], [[wikt:basis|basis]] and [[wikt:support|support]], they disappear with the disappearance of these four."
—''Kaivalya Pada: Sutra 10-11.''

== Upanishads ==

The terms kevala, kaivalya, or kaivalya-mukti are encountered in the [[Upanishad]]s, including the ''[[Śvetāśvatara]]'' (I and VI) ''[[Kaivalya Upanishad|Kaivalya]]'' (25), the ''[[Amṛtabindu]]'' (29) and the ''[[Muktikā]]'' (1.18, 26, 31) Upanishads .&lt;ref&gt;P. 130 ''Astavakragita: The Song of the Self Supreme'' edited by Radhakamal Mukherjee&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Muktika]]'' Upanishad (sloka 1.18-29) as explained by [[Rama]] to [[Hanuman]], as the most superior form of [[Moksha]] being the essence of all Upanishads, and higher than the four types of Mukti namely: Salokya, Saameepya, Sarupya, &amp; Sayujya &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warrier |first1=Dr. A. G. Krishna |title=Muktika Upanishad |publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House |location=Chennai |url=http://www.vedarahasya.net/muktika.htm |accessdate=27 June 2018 |ref=Sloka 18-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In section 2 of the same Upanishad, Rama mentioned that Kaivalya-Mukti is the ultimate liberation (both [[jivanmukti]] and [[videha-mukti]]) from prarabdha karma and it can be attained by everyone through studying the 108  authentic Upanishads thoroughly from a realized guru, which will destroy the three forms of bodies (gross, subtle and causal) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warrier |first1=Dr. A. G. Krishna |title=Muktika Upanishad |publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House |location=Chennai |url=http://www.vedarahasya.net/muktika.htm |accessdate=27 June 2018 |ref=Sloka 18-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''[[Yogatattva]]'' Upanishad (16-18) reads, "Kaivalya is the very nature of the self, the supreme state (paramam padam). It is without parts and is stainless. It is the direct intuition of the Real-existence, intelligence and bliss. it is devoid of birth, existence, destruction, recognition, and experience. This is called knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;P. 130 ''Astavakragita: The Song of the Self Supreme'' edited by Radhakamal Mukherjee&lt;/ref&gt;

== In later Hinduism ==

Following the rise of Hinduism with the powerful [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 14th century, [[Veerashaivism]] experienced growth in southern India.
Some Veerashaiva scholars of the time such as [[Nijaguna Shivayogi]] (c. 1500) attempted to unify Veerashaivism with Shankara's [[Advaitism]].
His best known work is the ''Kaivalya Paddhati'', a collection of [[swara cavhanas]] set to classical [[ragas]].&lt;ref&gt;P. 190 Medieval Indian Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular writers of this tradition are Nijaguna Shivayogi, [[Shadaksharadeva]](Muppina Shadakshari), Mahalingaranga and Chidanandavadhuta.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
The Kaivalya literature was entirely in the [[Kannada language]].{{dubious|date=June 2013}}

[[Vijnanabhiksu|Vijñānabhiksu]] was a sixteenth-century Vedāntic philosopher. He writes about kaivalya explicitly in the fourth and final chapter of his ''Yogasārasamgraha''.&lt;ref&gt;P. 120 ''[[Unifying Hinduism|Unifying Hinduism: philosophy and identity in Indian intellectual history]]'' By Andrew J. Nicholson&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Assam]], some Hindus call their sect Kaval Dharma.
In this sect, "kevali" is the highest stage at which the bhagat becomes unconscious of everything else except the one all pervading Entity.&lt;ref&gt;P. 43-44 ''Tai-Ahom Religion and Customs'' by Dr. Padmeswar Gogoi&lt;/ref&gt;
Moamara and Kardoiguria Satras as the principal Satras of the Keval sect.

==In Jainism==

Kaivalya also known as [[Kevala Jnana]] means omniscience in Jainism and is roughly translated as absolute knowledge[1] or supreme knowledge.[2]

Kevala jnana is believed to be an intrinsic quality of all souls. This quality is masked by karmic particles that surround the soul. Every soul has the potential to obtain omniscience by shedding off these karmic particles. Jain scriptures speak of twelve stages through which the soul achieves this goal. A soul who has attained kevala jnana is called a kevalin (केवलिन्).[3] According to the Jains, only kevalins can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.[4]

'''Key Opinion Leader (KOL)''', also known as an "influencer", is a person or organization who has expert product knowledge and influence in a respective field. They are trusted by relevant interest groups and have significant effects on consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lianatech.com/news/liana-technologies-hints-and-tips/tip/key-opinion-leaders-who-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter.html|title=Key opinion leaders: who are they and why do they matter? {{!}} Liana Technologies|website=Liana Technologies|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to [[Celebrity branding|celebrity brand ambassadors]], KOLs often have a more direct relationship with their audiences to share new product recommendations. Business collaborations with KOLs have become an effective marketing tool due to the rise of [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parklu.com/kol-mini-influencer-marketing-agency/|title=The Life of a KOL: Running a Mini Influencer Marketing Agency {{!}} PARKLU|website=www.parklu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China has 700 million [[netizen]]s, making it the largest social media market in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hicom-asia.com/2017/05/10/kol-marketing-in-china/|title=KOL (Key Opinion Leader) Marketing in China 2017 {{!}} Hicom|website=Hicom|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, KOLs in China are essentially social media influencers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeescobedo/2017/05/22/key-opinion-leaders-in-china/#304cf6a072ee|title=Nearly $150K Per Post?

By posting professional videos or articles regularly, they can earn the trust of their followers who often purchase products shared and recommended. 
KOLs are widely distributed in a variety of different fields including sports, video games, electronic products, fashion, food, travel, luxury goods and cars.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

China's online KOL market valuation was estimated at more than $8 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/Content/cef776db-e1af-441c-bc58-6fff27c53a1b|title=Building an influencer strategy in China: Behind the USD8 billion industry {{!}} WARC|website=www.warc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships with KOLs have increasingly become an effective method to promote a product or brand. Compared to [[celebrity branding]], working with KOLs reduces costs and is often more accessible to consumers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Liang Tao]], known as Mr. Bags, is a fashion KOL in China who has 2.89 million fans on [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] and 1.09 million active followers on [[WeChat]]. In 2016, [[Givenchy]] partnered with Mr. Bags to promote their handbag line "Horizon". This handbag line included 80 limited edition styles which each retailed for $2146.00. Mr. Bags' promotion contributed to the handbags selling out in 12 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cosmeticschinaagency.com/3-foreign-brands-master-chinese-marketing/|title=3 Foreign Brands who Master Chinese Marketing|date=2017-09-04|work=Cosmetics China|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Mr. Bags worked with [[Burberry]] to promote the brand's limited color handbag DK88 on [[WeChat]] and these handbags also sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.isentia.com.au/blog/china-kol-blogger-mr-bags-teams-up-with-burberry|title=China KOL - Blogger Mr. Bags teams up with Burberry|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another KOL, [[Papi Jiang]] is an [[internet celebrity]] who is well known for her funny videos in China.

The so-called '''Latvian Operation''' ({{lang-ru|Латышская операция}}) '''of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs''' ([[NKVD]]) was a mass arrest and execution of persons of [[Latvians|Latvian]] origin in the [[Soviet Union]] during the period of [[Great Purge]] (1937–1938).

==Latvians in the Soviet Union until 1936==
More than 500 Latvian peasant colonies originated from the 19th century after the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]] near [[St. Petersburg]], [[Novgorod]] and in [[Siberia]]. As the front line of Courland was approaching in the [[First World War]], extensive forced evacuations were carried out, so that the number of Latvians living in Russia doubled to up to 500,000 people. Many of the [[Latvian Riflemen]] were the early supporters of the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1917. With the end of the World War and the [[Russian Civil War]], many of the refugees were able to return to an independent Latvia. The Riga peace treaty explicitly foresaw the departure of former Latvian riflemen and refugees. According to the 1926 census, about 150,000 Latvians lived in the Soviet Union. They cultivated a lively [[Latvian culture|cultural life]] with the schools, newspapers and theaters. Since the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], there has been a strong Latvian faction in the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. Persons of Latvian descent temporarily held the high positions in the State apparatus of Soviet Russia. Of 70 Commissioners of the [[Cheka]] were in the year 1918 38 were of Latvian origin. However, with the increasing Russification of the State organs, members of non-Russian minorities were largely ousted from the management positions. In the party leadership of Josef Stalin, Latvia was regarded as a so-called "enemy nation" and Latvians were generally regarded as counter-revolutionary and suspicious. The resistance of peasant colonists to the forced collectivization at the end of the 1920s seemed to confirm to this image. Through targeted deportations in the [[Gulag]], these colonies were eliminated by 1933. From this time, a rigorous "purge" of the party and state apparatus of non-Russians took place. The [[Latvian Communist Party]] was dissolved in 1936, its members persecuted and murdered as "nationalists" and "people's enemies". One aspect of Stalin's [[Great Purge]] was state-directed xenophobia. In July 1937 the closure of the publishing house and cultural association "Prometejs" and the arrest of its employees took place. The Red Latvian Riflemen were removed from the history and school books and their veteran associations were dissolved.

==The operation==
On November 23, 1937, [[Nikolai Yezhov]] ordered the [[NKVD]] services to pool all the information gathered about Latvians in cultural and political life, the military and other institutions to be able to arrest them "just as during the Polish operation". On 30 November, the Order No. 49990 was the mass arrest of ethnic Latvians throughout the Soviet Union. The lawsuits were streamlined by forms with pre-printed accusations and confessions, which then condemned judicial victims to criminal work or shooting. Through torture, the NKVD constructed the existence of a Latvian espionage circle, which allegedly belonged to all Latvian officials from the [[Politburo]] to the school directors. The last Latvian Chekists were now also executed by their colleagues. Due to the large number of detainees, despite the so-called album proceedings, the courts were unable to impose convictions quickly enough. Therefore, the finish date of the action was extended until August 1938. In October 1938, special Troikas were then set up to work out the backlog of unedited cases. When the successor of Yezhov, [[Lavrenty Beria]] issued the command No. 00762 on November 26, 1938, the Latvian operation ended with the conclusion of the Great Purge. The liquidation of the Latvian party officials gave the Soviet authorities certain difficulties in establishing a party and administrative apparatus in the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupation of Latvia 1940]].

==Deaths resulting from the operation==
In particular, 22,369 convictions of Latvians were known, of which 16,573 or 74% were shot. Various estimates are based on 73,000 Latvian casualties. Exact victim numbers are also not available because many other people were murdered under the pretext of "Latvians". Women who were sent to the gulag because of a marriage with the ethnic enemies and their children who came to orphanages were not included in the statistics. The operation led to the abandonment of their own culture among the remaining Latvians, so descendants of Latvian colonists barely speak [[Latvian language|Latvian]] today. A rehabilitation of the victims took place under [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]. Information about the specific death and date could only be obtained after the end of the communist rule after 1990. The perpetrators and performers of the action, often known by name, have never been held accountable. Larger groups of victims were shot at the practice places [[Butovo firing range|Butovo]] and [[Kommunarka]] near [[Moscow]], [[Levaschovo]] near [[Leningrad]] or [[Kurapaty]] near [[Minsk]]. However, the tortures and murders were carried out throughout the territory of the State.

In [[category theory]], a discipline within mathematics, the notion of '''lax functor''' between [[Bicategory|bicategories]] generalizes that of [[functor]]s between [[Category (mathematics)|categories]].

Let ''C,D'' be bicategories. We denote composition in [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/composition diagrammatic order]. A ''lax functor P from C to D'', denoted &lt;math&gt;P: C\to D&lt;/math&gt;, consists of the following data:
* for each object ''x'' in ''C'', an object &lt;math&gt;P_x\in D&lt;/math&gt;;
* for each pair of objects ''x,y ∈ C'' a functor on morphism-categories, &lt;math&gt; P_{x,y}: C(x,y)\to D(P_x,P_y)&lt;/math&gt;;
* for each object ''x∈C'', a 2-morphism &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{id}_x}:\text{id}_{P_x}\to P_{x,x}(\text{id}_x)&lt;/math&gt; in ''D'';
* for each triple of objects, ''x,y,z ∈C'', a 2-morphism &lt;math&gt;P_{x,y,z}(f,g): P_{x,y}(f);P_{y,z}(g)\to P_{x,z}(f;g)&lt;/math&gt; in ''D'' that is natural in ''f: x→y'' and ''g: y→z''.
These must satisfy three commutative diagrams, which record the interaction between left unity, right unity, and associativity between ''C'' and ''D''. See http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pseudofunctor.

A lax functor in which all of the structure 2-morphisms, i.e. the &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{id}_x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{x,y,z}&lt;/math&gt; above, are invertible is called a [[pseudofunctor]].

'''''Li Europan lingues''''' is a quotation in [[Occidental language|Occidental]], an [[international auxiliary language]] devised by [[Edgar von Wahl]] in 
1922. It is used in some [[HTML]] [[Web template|template]]s as a fill-in or [[Filler text|placeholder]] text.  

One of the most common placeholder texts is [[lorem ipsum]]. A similar text of this type is the [[pangram]] ''[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]'', which is often used in fill-in text and to demonstrate and compare [[typeface]]s because it contains all 26 letters of the [[Latin alphabet]].

==Text==

When used as placeholder text, ''Li Europan lingues'' is usually one or two paragraphs and reads as follows:

:''Li Europan lingues es membres del sam familie. Lor separat existentie es un myth. Por scientie, musica, sport etc, litot Europa usa li sam vocabular. Li lingues differe solmen in li grammatica, li pronunciation e li plu commun vocabules. Omnicos directe al desirabilite de un nov lingua franca: On refusa continuar payar custosi traductores.''

:''At solmen va esser necessi far uniform grammatica, pronunciation e plu commun paroles. Ma quande lingues coalesce, li grammatica del resultant lingue es plu simplic e regulari quam ti del coalescent lingues. Li nov lingua franca va esser plu simplic e regulari quam li existent Europan lingues. It va esser tam simplic quam Occidental in fact, it va esser Occidental. A un Angleso it va semblar un simplificat Angles, quam un skeptic Cambridge amico dit me que Occidental es.''

;English translation:

:''The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.''

:''To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me that Occidental is.''

==History and discovery of ''Li Europan lingues'' text==

The text of ''Li Europan lingues'' is found in many HTML templates and through copying and uploading of templates this phrase seems to have found its use in many websites.

[[Don Harlow]] posted a message to the Auxlang List on 5 August 2006, mentioning its appearance in the "[[CSS Cookbook]]" from [[O'Reilly]] by [[Christopher Schmitt]], and in templates of webpages which implement [[CSS]]. [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0608a&amp;L=auxlang&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=7343]

[[Don Gasper]] posted another message to the same list suggesting a possible source:
:I have a theory, but it is only a theory. The Interlinguist/Occidentalist Ilmari Federn, who later adopted the name [[Charles Sprague (linguist)|Charles Sprague]] and came to live in England in the late 1930s, worked at the "[[Financial Times]]" in London. I think in the newspaper press. It is possible that he added the text in Interlingue to the standard Lorem ipsum passage. Unfortunately, I never asked him about this when I got to know him in the latter years of his life, in the early 1990s.

William Patterson was pleasantly surprised that evening to read about the appearance of [http://www.kafejo.com/misc/lorem.htm his version] of ''Lorem ipsum'' in the "CSS Cookbook" and quickly confessed. In June 1998, at a time when he was dabbling in Occidental, he had come across the ''Lorem ipsum'' text somewhere and learned about its use as a template. As was his wont when learning something new like that, he created a webpage about it. But while warning about the existence of "corrupt" versions, he offered one himself which included some Occidental text, a dash of [[Esperanto]], some variations of his given name, and a little bit of nonsense. In September 2002 he came across a copy of his version on the Web. Curious, he searched for other instances, and found that on 10 September 2002, an [[AllTheWeb]] search for the strings "ulliam" and "willum" returned 513 hits; by 10 December 2002, 962; and by 14 October 2003, 2337. (One page which he found particularly amusing was a Swedish translation of his own webpage&amp;mdash; Occidental, commentary, page colors, page title ''"Ailanto : Lorem ipsum"'' and all!) And now it's in the "CSS Cookbook"!

An HTML comment in the page that started it all attributes the Occidental text itself to [[S. W. Beer]].

'''Massurrealism''' is a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau word]] coined in 1992 by American artist [[James Seehafer]],&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; who described a trend among some [[postmodern art]]ists that mix the aesthetic styles and themes of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]]&amp;mdash;including [[pop art]].&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;Adam.

Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Seehafer-Untitled-1990.jpg|thumb|right|75px|SFX photography, digital collage]]
Massurrealism is a development of surrealism that emphasizes the effect of technology and mass media on contemporary surrealist imagery.&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; said that he was prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]], the latter consisting of [[technology]] and [[pop art]]&amp;mdash;"a form of technology art."&lt;ref name=lecture&gt;Seehafer, James. [http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm#20_06eng "Discussions: The Artist and Modern Society."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608073616/http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm |date=2008-06-08 }}, lecture on Massurrealism at [[Saint Petersburg State University]], Saint Petersburg Russia, 20 June 2000. Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, which "represented American mass-consumerism that fuels mass-media", and then incorporated collages of colour [[photocopy|photocopies]] and [[spray paint]]  with the artist's traditional medium of [[oil paint]].&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;

In 1995, he assembled a small group show near [[New York City]] and found a local cyber-cafe, where he started to post material about massurrealism on internet arts news groups, inspiring some German art students to stage a massurrealist show.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; The next year he started his own web site, www.massurrealism.com and began to receive work from other artists, both mixed media and digitally-generated.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; He credits the World Wide Web with a major role in communicating massurrealism,&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; which spread interest from artists in [[Los Angeles]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name=Itinerante&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo3VDEahCg "Conoce más sobre el MASSURREALISMO? - Mexico City"] Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Ketter&gt;[http://www.kettererkunst.de/lexikon/massurrealismus.php "Massurrealismus (Massurrealism)"], Ketterer Kunst Auction House, Munich Germany. Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Seehafer has said:
{{cquote|I am not being credited with inventing a new technique, nor I don't think I should be credited with starting a new art movement, but rather simply coining a word to categorize the type of modern day surrealist art that had been lacking in definition. As a result, word "massurrealism" has received a lot of enthusiasm from artists. Though there are some who feel that defining something essentially limits it, the human condition has always had the need to categorize and classify everything in life.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;}} 

The differentiating factor, according to Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism is the foundation of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; It is difficult to define the visual style of massurrealism, though a general characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism's traditional access to the unconscious with pop art's ironic contradictions.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dfine-art&amp;field-keywords=Massurrealism&amp;rh=i%3Afine-art%2Ck%3AMassurrealism/ "Other Art and related items"], Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[graffiti]] artist [[Banksy]] illicitly hung a rock in the [[British Museum]] showing a caveman pushing a shopping cart, which Shelley Esaak of about.com described as "a nice tribute to James Seehafer and Massurrealism."&lt;ref&gt;Esaak, Shelley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Moral certainty''' is a concept of intuitive [[probability]]. It means a very high degree of probability, sufficient for action, but short of absolute or mathematical certainty.

==Origins==
The notion of different degrees of certainty can be traced back to a statement in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] that one must be content with the kind of certainty appropriate to different subject matters, so that in practical decisions one cannot expect the certainty of mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase ''moralis certitudo'' was first used by the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Jean Gerson]] about 1400,&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Braun/E. Vallance eds., ''The Renaissance Conscience'' (2011) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a basis for moral action that could (if necessary) be ''less'' exact than Aristotelian practical knowledge, thus avoiding the dangers of [[philosophical scepticism]] and opening the way for a benevolent [[casuistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Braun, p. 12 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] mentions occurrences in English from 1637. 

==Law==
In law, moral (or 'virtual') certainty has been associated with [[verdict]]s based on certainty [[beyond a reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=1281&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Legal definition of "moral certainty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral certainty, a quantum of evidence of about 100 percent proof, is required in two kinds of cases:
# In a criminal prosecution, when no [[direct evidence]] exists, the [[circumstantial evidence]] must be ''morally certain''; see ''[[Lizzie Borden]]''.
# In a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] case, when a [[putative father]] has been adjudicated to be the actual father by [[clear and convincing evidence]], then ''moral certainty'' is required to disprove [[Parent|paternity]], the [[Blame|onus]] being moved to the newly found father.


Legal debate about instructions to seek a moral certainty has turned on the changing definitions of the phrase over time. Whereas it ''can'' be understood as an equivalent to 'beyond reasonable doubt', in another sense moral certainty refers to a firm conviction which ''does not'' correlate but rather opposes evidentiary certainty:&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Moore, ''Mass Communication Law and Ethics'' (1999) pp. 52–3&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. one may have a firm subjective gut feeling of guilt – a feeling of moral certainty – without the evidence necessarily justifying a guilty conviction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9104">'''''Homo novus''''' (or: ''novus homo'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for "new man"; plural '''''homines novi''''') was the term in [[ancient Rome]] for a man who was the first in his family to serve in the [[Roman Senate]] or, more specifically, to be elected as [[Roman consul|consul]]. When a man entered public life on an unprecedented scale for a high communal office, then the term used was '''''novus civis''''' (plural: '''''novi cives''''') or "new citizen".&lt;ref&gt;Becker, M.B., "The Republican City State in Florence: An Inquiry into it origin and survival (1280-1434)", ''Speculum'', '''35''' (1960), pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the [[Roman Republic#Patrician Era (509–367 BC)|Early Republic]], tradition held that both Senate membership and the consulship were restricted to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. When [[plebeian]]s gained the right to this office during the [[Conflict of the Orders]], all newly elected plebeians were naturally ''novi homines''. With time, ''novi homines'' became progressively rarer as some plebeian families became as entrenched in the Senate as their patrician colleagues. By the time of the [[First Punic War]], it was already a sensation that ''novi homines'' were elected in two consecutive years ([[Gaius Fundanius Fundulus]] in 243&amp;nbsp;BC and [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] in 242&amp;nbsp;BC). In 63&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Cicero]] became the first ''novus homo'' in more than thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De lege agraria'', describes the interval as ''perlongo intervallo'' and his consulship "almost the first in living memory".&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133–49 BC)|Late Republic]], the distinction between the orders became less important. The consuls came from a new elite, the ''[[nobiles]]'' ([[nobility|noblemen]]), an artificial [[aristocracy]] of all who could demonstrate direct descent in the male line from a consul.&lt;ref&gt;First demonstrated in Matthias Gelzer, ''Die nobilität der römischen Republik'' 1912, correcting [[Theodor Mommsen]]'s earlier proposition that all families possessing the ''[[ius imaginum]]'', that is, descended from [[Aedile|curule magistrates]], were designated ''nobili''. D. R. Shackleton Bailey, "Nobiles and Novi Reconsidered" ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''107'''.2 (Summer 1986), pp. 255-260, assesses and rejects some apparent exceptions to Gelzer's rule.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Topos'' of the "New Man"==
The literary theme of ''Homo novus'', or "how the lowly born but inherently worthy man may properly rise to eminence in the world" was the ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s influential Epistle XLIV.&lt;ref&gt;The sources that follow are drawn from R. W. Truman, "Lázaro de Tormes and the "Homo Novus" Tradition" ''The Modern Language Review'' '''64'''.1 (January 1969), pp. 62-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the endpoint of [[Late Antiquity]], it was likewise a subject in [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' (iii, vi). In the [[Middle Ages]] [[Dante]]'s ''Convivio'' (book IV) and [[Petrarch]]'s ''De remediis utriusque fortunae'' (I.16; II.5) take up the subject, and [[Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale|Wife of Bath's Tale]].

In its Christian renderings, the theme suggested a tension in the ''scala naturae'' or [[great chain of being]], one that was produced through the agency of Man's [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantinos Patrides|C.A. Patrides]], "The Scale of nature and Renaissance treatises on nobility" ''Studia Neophilologica'' '''36''' (1964) pp 63-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme came naturally to [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] who were often ''homines novi''&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Vogt, "Gleanings for the history of a sentiment: Generositas Virtus non Sanguis" ''[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]'' '''24''' (1925):102-24."&lt;/ref&gt;  rising by their own wits in a network of [[noble court]]s that depended on the highly literate new men to run increasingly complicated chancelries and create the cultural propaganda that was a contemporary vehicle for noble fame, and that consequently offered a kind of intellectual ''[[cursus honorum]]''. In the fifteenth century [[Buonaccorso da Montemagno]]'s ''Dialogus de vera nobilitate'' treated of the "true nobility" inherent in the worthy individual; [[Poggio Bracciolini]] also wrote at length ''De nobilitate'', stressing the [[Renaissance]] view of human responsibility and effectiveness that are at the heart of Humanism: ''sicut virtutis ita et nobilitatis sibi quisque existit auctor et opifex''.&lt;ref&gt;"Thus of the road to manly excellence and nobility the author and workmaster".&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefer summaries of the theme were to be found in [[Francesco Patrizi]], ''De institutionae republicae'' (VI.1), and in [[Rodrigo Sánchez de Arévalo]]'s encyclopedic ''Speculum vitae humanae''. In the sixteenth century these and new texts came to be widely printed and distributed. Sánchez de Arévalo's ''Speculum'' was first printed at Rome, 1468, and there are more than twenty [[Incunabulum|fifteenth-century printings]]; German, French and Spanish translations were printed. The characters of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s [[The Book of the Courtier]] (1528) discuss the requirement that a ''cortegiano'' be noble (I.XIV-XVI). This was translated into French, Spanish, English, Latin and other languages.&lt;ref&gt;See: P. Burke. ''The Fortunes of the Courtier: The European Reception of Castiglione's Cortegiano''. (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerónimo Osório da Fonseca]]'s ''De nobilitate'' (Lisbon 1542, and seven reprintings in the sixteenth century), stressing ''propria strennuitas'' ("one's own determined striving") received an English translation in 1576.

The Roman figure most often cited as an ''[[exemplum]]'' is [[Gaius Marius]], whose speech of self-justification was familiar to readers from the set-piece in [[Sallust]]'s ''[[Bellum Iugurthinum]]'', 85; the most familiar format in the Renaissance treatises is a [[dialogue]] that contrasts the two sources of nobility, with the evidence weighted in favour of the "new man".

'''Ohm's law''' states that the [[electric current|current]] through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] between two points is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[voltage]] across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohm's law is an [[empirical law|empirical relation]] which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive materials]] over many orders of magnitude of current.  However some materials do not obey Ohm's law, these are called [[Non-ohmic resistance|non-ohmic]].

The law was named after the German physicist [[Georg Ohm]], who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above (see [[#History|History]]).

In physics, the term ''Ohm's law'' is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] form of the law used in [[electromagnetics]] and material science:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J''' is the [[current density]] at a given location in a resistive material, '''E''' is the electric field at that location, and ''σ'' ([[sigma]]) is a material-dependent parameter called the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This reformulation of Ohm's law is due to [[Gustav Kirchhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Darrigol, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzeYSbqITWkC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22alternative+formulation+of+Ohm%27s+law%22+isbn:0198505949&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alternative%20formulation%20of%20Ohm%27s%20law%22%20isbn%3A0198505949&amp;f=false ''Electrodynamics from Ampère to Einstein''], p.70, Oxford University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-19-850594-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ohm3.gif|thumb|200px|Georg Ohm]]
In January 1781, before [[Georg Ohm]]'s work, [[Henry Cavendish]] experimented with [[Leyden jar]]s and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution.  He measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body.  Cavendish wrote that the "velocity" (current) varied directly as the "degree of electrification" (voltage). He did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Electricity|volume=9|page=182|first=John Ambrose |last=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his results were unknown until [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] published them in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford P. Bordeau (1982)  ''Volts to Hertz...the Rise of Electricity.''  Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN.  pp.86–107, {{ISBN|0-8087-4908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Ronalds]] delineated “intensity” (voltage) and “quantity” (current) for the [[Voltaic pile#Dry pile|dry pile]] – a high voltage source – in 1814 using a [[Electrometer#Gold-leaf electrometer|gold-leaf electrometer]].  He found for a dry pile that the relationship between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.

[[File:Ohmsches Gesetz in Georg Simon Ohms Laborbuch.jpg|thumb|Ohm's law in Georg Ohm's lab book.]]
Ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' ("The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew considerable inspiration from [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work.  For experiments, he initially used [[voltaic pile]]s, but later used a [[thermocouple]] as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage.  He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature.  He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit.  He found that his data could be modeled through the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a}{b + l},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' was the reading from the [[galvanometer]], ''l'' was the length of the test conductor, ''a'' depended on the thermocouple junction temperature, and ''b'' was a constant of the entire setup.  From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.

In modern notation we would write,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+R},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; is the open-circuit emf of the thermocouple, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the internal resistance of the thermocouple and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire.  In terms of the length of the wire this becomes,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+\mathcal R l},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire per unit length.  Thus, Ohm's coefficients are,

:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac {\mathcal E}{\mathcal R}, \quad b = \frac {\mathcal r}{\mathcal R} .&lt;/math&gt;

Ohm's law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity.  We consider it almost obvious today. When Ohm first published his work, this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility.  They called his work a "web of naked fancies"&lt;ref&gt;
Davies, B, "A web of naked fancies?", ''Physics Education'' 15 57–61, Institute of Physics, Issue 1, Jan 1980 [http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/an0VsEw7ynSY0UzIRNaNVQ/abstract/0031-9120/15/1/314]
&lt;/ref&gt; and the German Minister of Education proclaimed that "a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, IB, ''Makers of Science'', London, Oxford University Press, 1923. p. 243. [http://www.foresight.org/news/negativeComments.html#loc037]&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to develop an understanding of nature because nature is so well ordered, and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schnädelbach, ''Philosophy in Germany 1831–1933'', pages 78-79, Cambridge University Press, 1984 {{ISBN|0521296463}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Ohm's brother Martin, a mathematician, was battling the German educational system. These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm's work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s.  However, Ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died.

In the 1850s, Ohm's law was known as such and was widely considered proved, and alternatives, such as "[[Barlow's law]]", were discredited, in terms of real applications to telegraph system design, as discussed by [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Shaffner's Telegraph Companion: Devoted to the Science and Art of the Morse Telegraph | author = Taliaferro Preston | authorlink = Taliaferro Preston Shaffner | publisher = Pudney &amp; Russell | volume = Vol.2 | year = 1855 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDEOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA43&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+date:0-1860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electron]] was discovered in 1897 by [[J. J. Thomson]], and it was quickly realized that it is the particle ([[charge carrier]]) that carries electric currents in electric circuits.  In 1900 the first ([[classical physics|classical]]) model of electrical conduction, the [[Drude model]], was proposed by [[Paul Drude]], which finally gave a scientific explanation for Ohm's law.  In this model, a solid conductor consists of a stationary lattice of [[atom]]s ([[ion]]s), with [[conduction electron]]s moving randomly in it.  A voltage across a conductor causes an [[electric field]], which accelerates the electrons in the direction of the electric field, causing a drift of electrons which is the electric current.  However the electrons collide with and scatter off of the atoms, which randomizes their motion, thus converting the kinetic energy added to the electron by the field to [[heat]] ([[thermal energy]]).  Using statistical distributions, it can be shown that the average drift velocity of the electrons, and thus the current, is proportional to the electric field, and thus the voltage, over a wide range of voltages.

The development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s modified this picture somewhat, but in modern theories the average drift velocity of electrons can still be shown to be proportional to the electric field, thus deriving Ohm's law. In 1927 [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] applied the quantum [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] of electron energies to the Drude model, resulting in the [[free electron model]]. A year later, [[Felix Bloch]] showed that electrons move in waves ([[Bloch wave]]s) through a solid crystal lattice, so scattering off the lattice atoms as postulated in the Drude model is not a major process; the electrons scatter off impurity atoms and defects in the material. The final successor, the modern quantum [[band theory]] of solids, showed that the electrons in a solid cannot take on any energy as assumed in the Drude model but are restricted to energy bands, with gaps between them of energies that electrons are forbidden to have.   The size of the band gap is a characteristic of a particular substance which has a great deal to do with its electrical resistivity, explaining why some substances are [[electrical conductor]]s, some [[semiconductor]]s, and some [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s.

While the old term for electrical conductance, the [[Siemens (unit)|mho]] (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm), is still used, a new name, the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]], was adopted in 1971, honoring [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]].  The siemens is preferred in formal papers.

In the 1920s, it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]], is due to the discrete nature of charge.  This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that fluctuate from the value of R implied by the time average or [[ensemble average]] of the measured current; Ohm's law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.

Ohm's work long preceded [[Maxwell's equations]] and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits. Modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict Ohm's law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits.

==Scope==
Ohm's law is an [[empirical law]], a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than [[Maxwell's equations]] and is not always obeyed. Any given material will [[electrical breakdown|break down]] under a strong-enough electric field, and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are "non-ohmic" under weak fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Purcell |first=Edward M. |authorlink=Edward Mills Purcell |year=1985 |title=Electricity and magnetism |edition=2nd |series=Berkeley Physics Course |volume=2 |isbn=0-07-004908-4 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffiths |first=David J. |authorlink=David Griffiths (physicist) |year=1999 |title=Introduction to electrodynamics |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-805326-X |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales. In the early 20th century, it was thought that Ohm's law would fail at the [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], but experiments have not borne out this expectation. As of 2012, researchers have demonstrated that Ohm's law works for [[silicon]] wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = B. | last2 = Mahapatra | first2 = S. | last3 = Ryu | first3 = H. | last4 = Lee | first4 = S. | last5 = Fuhrer | first5 = A. | last6 = Reusch | first6 = T.

The Drude model treats [[electron]]s (or other charge carriers) like pinballs bouncing among the [[ion]]s that make up the structure of the material.  Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field.  The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.

The [[drift velocity]] then determines the electric [[current density]] and its relationship to '''''E''''' and is independent of the collisions.  Drude calculated the average drift velocity from '''''p'''''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''e'''E'''τ'' where '''''p''''' is the average [[momentum]], −''e'' is the charge of the electron and τ is the average time between the collisions.   Since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity, the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to Ohm's law.

==Hydraulic analogy==

A [[hydraulic analogy]] is sometimes used to describe Ohm's law.  Water pressure, measured by [[pascal (unit)|pascals]] (or [[pounds per square inch|PSI]]), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow.  Water flow rate, as in [[liter]]s per second, is the analog of current, as in [[coulomb]]s per second. Finally, flow restrictors—such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured—are the analog of resistors. We say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor.

Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=A. Akers |author2=M. Gassman |author3=R.

Esposito, "A Simplified Method for Analyzing Circuits by Analogy", ''Machine Design'', October 1969, pp. 173–177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The method can be applied to both steady and transient flow situations.  In the linear [[laminar flow]] region, [[Poiseuille's law]] describes the hydraulic resistance of a pipe, but in the [[turbulent flow]] region the pressure–flow relations become nonlinear.

The hydraulic analogy to Ohm's law has been used, for example, to approximate blood flow through the circulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 |page=164  |chapter=Chapter 14: Overview of the Circulation; Medical Physics of Pressure, Flow, and Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interchangeability of the equation may be represented by a triangle, where V ([[voltage]]) is placed on the top section, the I ([[electric current|current]]) is placed to the left section, and the R ([[electrical resistance|resistance]]) is placed to the right. The line that divides the left and right sections indicates multiplication, and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).

===Resistive circuits===

[[Resistor]]s are circuit elements that impede the passage of electric charge in agreement with Ohm's law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value ''R''.  In a schematic diagram the resistor is shown as a zig-zag symbol.  An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm's law over some operating range is referred to as an ''ohmic device'' (or an ''ohmic resistor'') because Ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.

Ohm's law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current, regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant ([[direct current|DC]]) or time-varying such as [[alternating current|AC]].  At any instant of time Ohm's law is valid for such circuits.

Resistors which are in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]]'' or in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]]'' may be grouped together into a single "equivalent resistance" in order to apply Ohm's law in analyzing the circuit.

===Reactive circuits with time-varying signals===

When reactive elements such as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which AC or time-varying voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a [[differential equation]], so Ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value R, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance ("C") or inductance ("L").

Equations for [[time-invariant]] [[alternating current|AC]] circuits take the same form as Ohm's law. However, the variables are generalized to [[complex number]]s and the current and voltage waveforms are [[complex exponential]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering | author = Rajendra Prasad | publisher = Prentice-Hall of India | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nsmcbzOJU3kC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+complex+exponentials | isbn = 978-81-203-2729-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this approach, a voltage or current waveform takes the form &lt;math&gt;Ae^{st}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''t'' is time, ''s'' is a complex parameter, and ''A'' is a complex scalar.  In any [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system]], all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same ''s'' parameter as the input to the system, allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms.

The complex generalization of resistance is [[electrical impedance|impedance]], usually denoted ''Z''; it can be shown that for an inductor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = sL\,&lt;/math&gt;

and for a capacitor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{sC}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can now write,

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{V} = \boldsymbol{I} \cdot \boldsymbol{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''V''''' and '''''I''''' are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and '''''Z''''' is the complex impedance.

This form of Ohm's law, with ''Z'' taking the place of ''R'', generalizes the simpler form.  When ''Z'' is complex, only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat.

In the general AC circuit, ''Z'' varies strongly with the frequency parameter ''s'', and so also will the relationship between voltage and current.

For the common case of a steady [[Sine wave|sinusoid]], the ''s'' parameter is taken to be &lt;math&gt;j\omega&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to a complex sinusoid &lt;math&gt;Ae^{\mbox{ } j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;.  The real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit, which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars.

===Linear approximations===

{{See also|Small-signal modeling|Network analysis (electrical circuits)#Small signal equivalent circuit}}

Ohm's law is one of the basic equations used in the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|analysis of electrical circuits]].  It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components ([[resistor]]s) specifically made for this behaviour.  Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering.  Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as "ohmic" &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, E, ''Electrical Technology'', pp10, Longmans, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; which means they produce the same value for resistance (R = V/I) regardless of the value of V or I which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC ([[direct current]]) of either positive or negative polarity or AC ([[alternating current]]).

In a true ohmic device, the same value of resistance will be calculated from R = V/I regardless of the value of the applied voltage V.  That is, the ratio of V/I is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is ''linear'' (a straight line).  If voltage is forced to some value V, then that voltage V divided by measured current I will equal R.  Or if the current is forced to some value I, then the measured voltage V divided by that current I is also R.  Since the plot of I versus V is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; applied across a given device of resistance R, producing currents I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R, that the ratio (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is also a constant equal to R.  The operator "delta" (Δ) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write ΔV = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ΔI = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Summarizing, for any truly ohmic device having resistance R, V/I = ΔV/ΔI = R for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents.

[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|400px|The [[I–V curve]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The two resistors follow Ohm's law: The plot is a straight line through the origin. The other two devices do ''not'' follow Ohm's law.]]

There are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their [[I–V curve]]) is ''nonlinear'' (or non-ohmic).  An example is the [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|p-n junction diode]] (curve at right).  As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode.  One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of "resistance" is not constant as a function of applied voltage.  Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative.  The ratio ''V''/''I'' for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the ''static'', or ''chordal'', or [[direct current|DC]], resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T. Brown | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8493-9648-9 | page = 43 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UzqX4j9VZWcC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22chordal+resistance%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Electromagnetic Compatibility Handbook | author = Kenneth L.

This means the "DC resistance" V/I at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the ''dynamic'', ''small-signal'', or ''incremental'' resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the [[derivative]] of current with respect to voltage).  For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.&lt;ref name=horowitz-hill&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Horowitz |author2=[[Winfield Hill]] | title=The Art of Electronics |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |page = 13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=small-signal+%22dynamic+resistance%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature effects==

Ohm's law has sometimes been stated as, "for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced."  That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied [[electromotive force]] (or voltage) to the current, "does not vary with the current strength ."  The qualifier "in a given state" is usually interpreted as meaning "at a constant temperature," since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to [[Joule heating]] of the conducting body, according to [[Joule's first law]], the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current.  The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify.  [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relation to heat conductions==
{{See also|Conduction (heat)}}
Ohm's principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e. current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier|Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier]]'s principle predicts the flow of [[heat]] in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences.

The same equation describes both phenomena, the equation's variables taking on different meanings in the two cases. Specifically, solving a heat conduction (Fourier) problem with ''[[temperature]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[flux|flux of heat]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. heat energy) variables also solves an analogous [[electrical conduction]] (Ohm) problem having ''[[electric potential]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[electric current]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. charge) variables.

The basis of Fourier's work was his clear conception and definition of [[thermal conductivity]]. He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.

A similar assumption is made in the statement of Ohm's law: other things being alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.

==Other versions==

Ohm's law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a "macroscopic" level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an [[electrical circuit]]. Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm's law, having variables that are closely related to the V, I, and R [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] variables of Ohm's law, but which are each functions of position within the conductor.  Physicists often use this continuum form of Ohm's Law:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/math&gt;

where "'''E'''" is the [[electric field]] vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to "V" of Ohm's law which has units of volts), "'''J'''" is the [[current density]] vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to "I" of Ohm's law which has units of amperes), and "ρ" (Greek "rho") is the [[resistivity]] with units of ohm·meters (analogous to "R" of Ohm's law which has units of ohms).  The above equation is sometimes written&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', Pitman, 1972, pp 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; as '''J''' = &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;'''E''' where "σ" (Greek "sigma") is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] which is the reciprocal of ρ.

[[File:Ohms law vectors.svg|thumb|290px|Current flowing through a uniform cylindrical conductor (such as a round wire) with a uniform field applied.]]
The voltage between two points is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA685 pp. 685–686]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta V} = -\int {\mathbf E \cdot d \mathbf l} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;d \mathbf l&lt;/math&gt; the element of path along the integration of electric field vector '''E'''. If the applied '''E''' field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure, then defining the voltage V in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure), and with the understanding that the voltage V is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the Δ symbol, the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:

:&lt;math&gt;V = {E}{l}  \ \  \text{or} \ \ E = \frac{V}{l}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the '''E''' field is uniform in the direction of wire length, for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity ρ, the current density '''J''' will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length, so we may write:&lt;ref name=lerner732&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA732 pp. 732–733]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J = \frac{I}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above 2 results (for ''E'' and ''J'' respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{l} = \frac{I}{a}\rho \qquad \text{or} \qquad V = I \rho \frac{l}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[electrical resistance]] of a uniform conductor is given in terms of [[resistivity]] by:&lt;ref name=lerner732/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{R} = \rho \frac{l}{a} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''l'' is the length of the conductor in [[International System of Units|SI]] units of meters, ''a'' is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire ''a'' = ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if ''r'' is radius) in units of meters squared, and ρ is the resistivity in units of ohm·meters.

After substitution of ''R'' from the above equation into the equation preceding it, the continuum form of Ohm's law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form:
:&lt;math&gt;{V}={I}{R}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

A perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no [[resistivity]],&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', pp 48–49, Pitman, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; but a real metal has [[crystallographic defect]]s, impurities, multiple [[isotope]]s, and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons [[scattering|scatter]] from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.

The more complex generalized forms of Ohm's law are important to [[condensed matter physics]], which studies the properties of [[matter]] and, in particular, its [[electronic structure]]. In broad terms, they fall under the topic of [[constitutive equations]] and the theory of [[Green–Kubo relations|transport coefficients]].

===Magnetic effects===
If an external '''B'''-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity '''v''', then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the [[Lorentz force]] on the charge carriers.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[rest frame]] of the moving conductor this term drops out because '''v'''= 0. There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the '''E'''-field in the lab frame: '''E′'''  = '''E''' + '''v'''×'''B'''.
Electric and magnetic fields are relative, see [[Lorentz transformation]].

If the current '''J''' is alternating because the applied voltage or '''E'''-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see [[electrical impedance]]. The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.

===Conductive fluids===
In a conductive fluid, such as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The relative motion induces an electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; which exerts [[electric force]] on the charged particles giving rise to an [[electric current]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a [[number density]] &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;, is written as

:&lt;math&gt; m_en_e{d\mathbf{v}_e\over dt}=-n_e e \mathbf{E}+ n_e m_e \nu (v_i-v_e)-en_e\mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_e&lt;/math&gt; are the charge, mass and velocity of the electrons, respectively. Also, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})=\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the definition of the [[current density]], and also put &lt;math&gt;\sigma={n_e e^2\over \nu m_e}&lt;/math&gt; which is the [[electrical conductivity]]. This equation can also be equivalently written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}=\rho\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical resistivity]]. It is also common to write &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=1/\mu_0\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Omni art performance 1984.jpg|thumb|300px|Jeffrey Milburn's first Omni Art performance installation Denver, Colorado (1984).]]
'''Omni art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in 1988 in [[New York City]] ([[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Village Voice, 1988. Village Voice Media Group&lt;/ref&gt; Omni art followed [[Pop art]] and [[Postmodernism]] by shifting attention from social and political issues focusing on the emerging convergence of science, consciousness and art in the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Art and Consciousness 2008, Embracing The Journey Podcast with Karen Humphries Sallick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Weekly, Interview for performance installation "Khymera" benefit for The Boulder County AIDS Project.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

It draws from ancient [[Sanskrit]] mysticism, [[sacred geometry]], and [[Quantum field theory|theoretical quantum physics]], and its premise maintains that sentient experience is immersed in a multidimensional [[quantum field]] that can be distilled into 5 distinct yet connected planes or dimensions that together weave a Universal fabric or “cosmic soup” of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Observer 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Creating an Art Style", The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1,2,3. Omni Art Salon Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Omni art Perspective==
Within the Omni art paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;see OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. 2007, Voice One Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; there is an ascending series of vibrational fields ranging from the most coarse in vibratory rate (the physical dimension) to the most subtle and sublime (the etheric dimension). Each of the 5 dimensions (described below) maintain environmental vibrational fields that correlate with universal particle and wave energy signatures with qualities that can be ascertained through both [[empirical]] and subjective methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Observer'', September 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey 2007, Voice One Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-4276-1589-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Colorado Daily,University of Colorado 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Omni art is concerned with exploring and expressing sentient life experiences of and within these 5-dimensional fields that exhibit powerful influences within and upon sentient and other life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Weekly Interview, Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum physicist postulates that a wave/particle model of energy and matter substructs universal cosmology and in this way quantum physicists and Omni artists are concerned with the same observable and intuited phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;The Creation of an Art Movement,Episodes 1-3. The Omni Art Salon 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] postulates that these 5-dimensional vibrational particle and wave fields are experienced in the human consciousness through light and sound waves forming a 5-dimensional matrix that sustains the fabric of existence for all life in the visible and invisible universe.&lt;ref&gt;Omni Art - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. Voice One Publishing 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Dimensions of Human Experience==
[[Image:Omni Art Book.jpg|thumb|200px|Language of Consciousness (2007) is a personal description of an art style he developed during the late 1980s and founded as a style in a groundbreaking museum installation in 1991.]]

'''The Physical Dimension''' - The [[primary vibrational field]] has the most dense oscillation pattern and energy signature manifested as matter within the physical universe.

'''The Astral Dimension''' - The [[secondary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the physical dimension. This is where dreams, psychic cognition, human emotions, and paranormal phenomenon take place.

'''The Causal Dimension''' - The [[tertiary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the astral dimension, and is described by many researchers as a resonant “brain” or record of all the cause-effect relationships in the universe, known in ancient [[Vedic]] texts as the [[akasha]].

'''The Mental Dimension''' - The [[quaternary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the causal dimension. The human mind experiences this vibrational field as thoughts, ideas, concepts and connectivity.

'''The Etheric Dimension''' - The [[quinary dimensional field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the mental dimension. This is the subconscious portal to the non-dual dimensions.
This dimension acts as the gateway into non-duality or singularity and can be observed in sudden, unexplainable awareness that spontaneously appears as an "aha!", or sudden, moment of realization.

==The Universalist Group Collection==

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] mounted a museum installation of the foundational collection of 12 artworks called “The Universalist Group.” in 1991 at [http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islip_art_museum/index.html The Islip Art Museum]&lt;ref&gt;The Islip Art Museum, Islip, New York. March 1991&lt;/ref&gt; in Islip, New York. This group of 12 assemblage artworks were created over a period of 10 years beginning in 1981, and provide the basic vocabulary for the language of the Omni art style. Milburn coined this style of art “Omni art” in 1988 when he founded this nascent art movement. The Universalist Group collection has appeared in whole or in part in all of Milburn's performance installations over the last 30 years and is described in detail in his book, OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn’s treatise regarding Omni art.

Milburn's artworks are assemblages of found objects, canvas, and paint. Milburn describes the juxtaposition of objects in his artworks as creating a gestalt “language” allowing the observer to communicate with an inner experience he describes as a “language of consciousness” that is attuned to the observer's current state of developmental awareness. In this way, each artwork serves as a catalyst for a personal inspiration or realization that mirrors what quantum physicists describe as the observer and observed duality that collapses into a singularity field. This is the same [[Omega Point|singularity]] that scientists and ancient spiritual teachers describe as “Source” or “Oneness” that is the origination point for all particles and waves that form the phenomenon of existence.

In this way, Omni art is literally defined as “God art” or “Source art” both by intentional application and [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] utilization. The term Omni was discovered by Milburn when researching terminology that would apply to this emerging art form. Milburn describes his role as one of an artist/mystic and subsequently he has come to be known as “The Oracle of Omni.”

[[Image:Omni art universalist group.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Artist's statement from a 1991 installation at The Islip Art Museum in Islip, New York.]]

===Sacred Geometry===

One of the two primary artworks from The Universalist Group collection titled “SOUL” (1981) contains many elements that are fundamental in the science of [[sacred geometry]]. Surrounding the mirror in the center circle on this art work are 5 hand cut quartz crystals in the shape of the 5 platonic solids originally discovered and articulated upon by [[Plato]].

Milburn identified these platonic solids as corresponding to the 5-dimensional vibrational fields which he deduced constitute the basic elements forming a universal cosmological structure.

This center circle area is fronted with a 3-dimensional metaform mandala projecting out from the front of the artwork also containing many sacred geometry's. Milburn discovered 16 years after creating this artwork that its basic shape reflects the geometric shape of a black hole and posited that this peculiarity pertains to the ancient [[Kabbalistic]] theory that all in the invisible universe is reflected in the visible universe - or more commonly stated as “as above, so below.” In quantum physics jargon this same cosmological structure was articulated by physicist [[David Bohm]] as an “implicate and explicate order.”

Milburn further describes this artwork as a symbolic map or representation of universal [[cosmological]] structures that integrate with emerging scientific theories of conscious human evolution.

===The Omni art Movement===
According to Milburn, conscious human evolution is intrinsic and incontrovertible and can be seen in all aspects of life.  It naturally follows that this conscious evolution can then be observed in all the arts, sciences, and cultural idioms and he coined this process “meta-evolution” as it transcends the boundaries of [[scientific materialism]]. Reaching into the invisible regions of discovery not accessible by current technology, this evolutionary phenomenon is seen by Milburn to be the definition of the Omni art movement in the widest sense.&lt;ref&gt;Creating a New Art, The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1-3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rocky Mountain News, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;radio interview, KGNU Boulder Public Radio 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Public Dialogue on The Four Propositions 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Milburn states that in popular culture one can observe the contemporary appearance of this meta-evolutionary process in contemporary films, books, and videos exploring the many aspects of emerging awareness as it intersects with a popular fascination with metaphysical and [[paranormal phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Orbiting Omni Art", The Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this phenomenon such as UFO sightings, and most recently the light orbs that are appearing by the hundreds of thousands in low resolution (below 2 mega-pixels) digital photographs espoused upon in [[Miceal Ledwith]] and physicist Klaus Heinemann's 2008 book [http://books.simonandschuster.ca/Orb-Project/Klaus-Heinemann/9781582701820 The Orb Project], have captured the imaginations of millions of people around the world and show no sign of abating.

'''Personalism''' is a philosophical school of thought searching to describe the uniqueness of 1) [[God]] as Supreme [[Soul|Person]] or 2) a human [[person]] in the world of nature, specifically in relation to [[animal]]s. One of the main points of interest of personalism is human subjectivity or self-consciousness, experienced in a person's own acts and inner happenings—in "everything in the human being that is internal, whereby each human being is an eyewitness of its own self".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karol Wojtyla|K. Wojtyła]], ''Subjectivity and Irreducible'' in: Idem ''Person and Community. Selected Essays'', Th. Sandok OSM, P. Lang (trans.), New York 1993,  p. 214; Cf. P. Bristow, ''Christian Ethics and the Human Person'', Family Publications [[Maryvale Institute]], Oxford 2009, pp. 102-103 {{ISBN|978-1-871217-98-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other principles:
# Persons have unique value, and
# Only persons have [[free will]]
According to [[idealism]] there is one more principle
# Only persons are real (in the [[ontology|ontological]] sense).

==Overview==
Writing in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=personalism |title=Personalism |last=Williams |first=Thomas D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted scholar Thomas D. Williams cites a plurality of "schools" holding to a "personalist" ethic and "[[Weltanschauung]]", arguing:
{{quote|Personalism exists in many different versions, and this makes it somewhat difficult to define as a philosophical and theological movement. Many philosophical schools have at their core one particular thinker or even one central work which serves as a canonical touchstone. Personalism is a more diffused and eclectic movement and has no such universal reference point. It is, in point of fact, more proper to speak of many personalisms than one personalism. In 1947 [[Jacques Maritain]] could write that there are at least 'a dozen personalist doctrines, which at times have nothing more in common than the word ‘person.’ Moreover, because of their emphasis on the subjectivity of the person and their ties to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], some dominant forms of personalism have not lent themselves to systematic treatises.

It is perhaps more proper to speak of personalism as a 'current' or a broader 'worldview, since it represents more than one school or one doctrine while at the same time the most important forms of personalism do display some central and essential commonalities. Most important of the latter is the general affirmation of the centrality of the person for philosophical thought. Personalism posits ultimate reality and value in personhood — human as well as (at least for most personalists) divine. It emphasizes the significance, uniqueness and inviolability of the person, as well as the person's essentially relational or communitarian dimension. The title 'personalism' can therefore legitimately be applied to any school of thought that focuses on the reality of persons and their unique status among beings in general, and personalists normally acknowledge the indirect contributions of a wide range of thinkers throughout the history of philosophy who did not regard themselves as personalists. Personalists believe that the human person should be the ontological and epistemological starting point of philosophical reflection. They are concerned to investigate the experience, the status, and the dignity of the human being as person, and regard this as the starting-point for all subsequent philosophical analysis.}}

Thus, according to Williams, one ought to keep in mind that although there may be dozens of theorists and social activists in the West adhering to the rubric "personalism," their particular foci may, in fact, be [[asymptote|asymptotic]], and even diverge at material junctures.

==Berdyaev's personalism==
[[Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev]] (1874–1948) was a Russian religious and political philosopher who emphasized human freedom, subjectivity and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-8870-8_3 Existentialism: A Personalist Philosophy of History], ''Berdyaev’s Philosophy of History. An Existentialist Theory of Social Creativity and Eschatology'', by David Bonner Richardson, pp 90-137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mounier's personalism==
{{further|Non-conformists of the 1930s|Alexandre Marc}}
In France, philosopher [[Emmanuel Mounier]] (1905–1950) was the leading proponent of personalism, around which he founded the review ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', which exists to this day. Under [[Jean-Marie Domenach]]'s direction, it criticized the use of [[torture during the Algerian War]]. Personalism was seen as an alternative to both [[Liberalism]] and [[Marxism]], which respected [[human rights]] and the human personality without indulging in excessive [[collectivism]]. Mounier's personalism had an important influence in France, including in political movements, such as [[Marc Sangnier]]'s ''[[Ligue de la jeune République]]'' (Young Republic League) founded in 1912.

A Jewish anti-fascist, [[Zeev Sternhell]], has identified personalism with fascism in a very controversial manner, claiming that Mounier's personalism movement "shared ideas and political reflexes with fascism". He argued that Mounier's "revolt against [[individualism]] and [[materialism]]" would have led him to share the ideology of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zeev Sternhell]], "Sur le fascisme et sa variante française", in ''[[Le Débat]]'', November 1984, "Emmanuel Mounier et la contestation de la démocratie libérale dans la France des années 30", in ''[[Revue française de science politique]]'', December 1984, and also [[John Hellman]]'s book, on which he takes a lot of his sources, ''Emmanuel Mounier and the New Catholic Left, 1930-1950'' (University of Toronto Press, 1981). See also [[Denis de Rougemont]], Mme Mounier et [[Jean-Marie Domenach]] dans ''Le personnalisme d’Emmanuel Mounier hier et demain'', Seuil, Paris, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic personalism&lt;!--Ethical personalism' redirects here--&gt;==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
{{main|Phenomenological Thomism}}
Following on the writings of [[Dorothy Day]], a distinctively Christian personalism developed in the 20th century. Its main theorist was the Polish philosopher [[Karol Wojtyła]] (later Pope John Paul II). In his work, ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'', first published in 1960, Wojtyła proposed what he termed 'the personalistic norm':
{{quote|This norm, in its negative aspect, states that the person is the kind of good which does not admit of use and cannot be treated as an object of use and as such the means to an end. In its positive form the personalistic norm confirms this: the person is a good towards which the only proper and adequate attitude is love&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Responsibility'' (Ignatius Press, 1993), pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This brand of personalism has come to be known as "Thomistic" because of its efforts to square modern notions regarding the person with the teachings of Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Thomas D.|title=What Is Thomistic Personalism?|url=http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao42_williams1.pdf|publisher=Alpha Omega|accessdate=20 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425213150/http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao42_williams1.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wojtyła was influenced by the '''ethical personalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personalism/ Personalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A first principle of Christian personalism is that persons are not to be used, but to be respected and loved. In ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', the [[Second Vatican Council]] formulated what has come to be considered the key expression of this personalism: "man is the only creature on earth that God willed for its own sake and he cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself".&lt;ref&gt;''Gaudium et spes'', no. 24. This apparently paradoxical idea - if you seek your life selfishly, you will lose it; if you are generous in giving it, you will find it - is rooted in the gospel: cf. Mt. 16:25; Mk 8:35; Lk 17:33.&lt;/ref&gt;

This formula for self-fulfillment offers a key for overcoming the dichotomy frequently felt between personal "realization" and the needs or demands of social life. Personalism also implies inter-personalism, as Benedict XVI stresses in ''[[Caritas in Veritate]]'':
{{quote|As a spiritual being, the human creature is defined through interpersonal relations. The more authentically he or she lives these relations, the more his or her own personal identity matures. It is not by isolation that man establishes his worth, but by placing himself in relation with others and with God.&lt;ref&gt;''Caritas in veritate'', #53&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Boston personalism&lt;!--'Boston personalism' redirects here--&gt;==
Personalism flourished in the early [[20th century]] at [[Boston University]] in a movement known as '''Boston personalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; led by theologian [[Borden Parker Bowne]].  Bowne emphasized the person as the fundamental category for explaining reality and asserted that only persons are real.  He stood in opposition to certain forms of [[materialism]] which would describe persons as mere particles of matter.  For example, against the argument that persons are insignificant specks of dust in the vast universe, Bowne would say that it is impossible for the entire universe to exist apart from a person to experience it.  Ontologically speaking, the person is “larger” than the universe because the universe is but one small aspect of the person who experiences it.   Personalism affirms the existence of the [[soul]].  Most personalists assert that [[God]] is real and that God is a person (or as in Christian [[trinitarianism]], three 'persons', although it is important to note that the nonstandard meaning of the word 'person' in this theological context is significantly different from Bowne's usage).

Bowne also held that persons have value (see [[axiology]], [[value theory]], and [[ethics]]).  In declaring the absolute value of personhood, he stood firmly against certain forms of [[philosophical naturalism]] (including [[social Darwinism]]) which sought to reduce the value of persons.  He also stood against certain forms of [[positivism]] which sought to render ethical and theological discourse meaningless and dismiss talk of God ''a priori''.

[[George Holmes Howison]] taught a metaphysical theory called '''personal idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707190718/http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''California personalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. Howison maintained that both impersonal, monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the moral freedom experienced by persons. To deny the freedom to pursue the ideals of truth, beauty, and "benignant love" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy. Thus, even the Personalistic Idealism of Borden Parker Bowne and [[Edgar S. Brightman]] and the Realistic Personal Theism of Thomas Aquinas are inadequate, for they make finite persons dependent for their existence upon an infinite Person and support this view by an unintelligible doctrine of creatio ex nihilo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/howison-george-holmes-18341916-eoph/|title=Research Howison, George Holmes (1834-1916) - Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.bookrags.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002094713/http://www.bookrags.com/research/howison-george-holmes-18341916-eoph/|archivedate=2012-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Personal Idealism of Howison was explained in his book ''The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism''. Howison created a radically democratic notion of personal idealism that extended all the way to God, who was no more the ultimate monarch, no longer the only ruler and creator of the universe, but the ultimate democrat in eternal relation to other eternal persons. Howison found few disciples among the religious, for whom his thought was heretical; the non-religious, on the other hand, considered his proposals too religious; only [[J. M. E. McTaggart]]'s idealist atheism or [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]]'s [[apeirotheism]] seem to resemble Howison's personal idealism.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_speculative_philosophy/v020/20.3mclachlan.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180043/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=%2Fjournals%2Fjournal_of_speculative_philosophy%2Fv020%2F20.3mclachlan.html |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents and influence==
Philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], though not formally considered a personalist, made an important contribution to the personalist cause by declaring that a person is not to be valued merely as a means to the ends of other people, but that he possesses dignity (an absolute inner worth) and is to be valued as an end in himself.

Catholic philosopher and theologian [[John Henry Newman]], has been posited as a main proponent of personalism by John Crosby of Franciscan University in his book ''Personalist Papers''. Crosby notes Newman's personal approach to faith, as outlined in ''[[Grammar of Assent]]'' as a main source of Newman's personalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=John|title=Personalist Papers|year=2003|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8132-1317-0|pages=280|url=https://www.amazon.com/Personalist-Papers-John-F-Crosby/dp/0813213177|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311084811/http://www.amazon.com/Personalist-Papers-John-F-Crosby/dp/0813213177|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was greatly influenced by personalism in his studies at [[Boston University]].   King came to agree with the position that only personality is real.  It solidified his understanding of [[God]] as a [[personal god]].  It also gave him a metaphysical basis for his belief that all human personality has dignity and worth.&lt;ref&gt;See his essay [http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/papers/vol4/580901-002-My_Pilgrimage_to_Nonviolence.htm "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]] explicitly sought to support personalist movement by developing its theoretical foundation and expanding it with a new personalist social ethic.{{r|Deweer 2013|p=3}} However, he later had significant disagreements with Mournier and criticized other personalist writers for insufficient conceptual clarity. Ricœur also disagreed with the other personalists in asserting the signfiicance of justice as a value in its own right and gave this primary in the public sphere, whereas Mournier characterized all relationships including public and political ones in terms of love and friendship.&lt;ref name="Deweer 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deweer |first=D. |year=2013 |title=Ricœur and the Pertinence of a Political Education: on Crisis and Commitment |work=Archivio di filosofia |volume=81 |number=1 |pp=71-80 |url=https://www.academia.edu/download/41620619/Deweer_-_Ricoeur_and_the_Pertinence_of_a_Political_Education_preprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

[[Pope John Paul II]] was also influenced by the personalism advocated by [[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialist]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Before his election to the Roman papacy, he wrote ''Person and Act'' (sometimes mistranslated as ''The Acting Person''), a philosophical work suffused with personalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|90-277-0985-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he remained well within the traditional stream of Catholic social and individual morality, his explanation of the origins of moral norms, as expressed in his [[encyclical]]s on economics and on [[sexual ethics|sexual morality]], for instance, was largely drawn from a personalist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;see Doran, Kevin P.  Solidarity:  A Synthesis of Personalism and Communalism in the Thought of Karol Wojtyła/John Paul II.  New York:  Peter Lang, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8204-3071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings as Roman pontiff, of course, influenced a generation of Catholic theologians since who have taken up personalist perspectives on the theology of the family and social order.

{{selfref|For the Wikipedia system function, see [[Wikipedia:Purge]]}}

In [[history]], [[religion]] and [[political science]], a '''purge''' is a removal of people who are considered undesirable by those in power from a government, another organization, their team owners, or society as a whole. A group undertaking such an effort is labeled as '''purging''' itself. Purges can be either nonviolent or violent; with the former often resolved by the simple removal of those who have been purged from office, and the latter often resolved by the [[imprisonment]], [[exile]], or [[murder]] of those who have been purged.

== Historical use of the term ==

The earliest use of the term dates back to the [[English Civil War]]'s [[Pride's Purge]].  In 1648-1650, the moderate members of the English [[Long Parliament]] were purged by the army. Parliament would suffer subsequent purges under the Commonwealth including the purge of the entire [[House of Lords]]. Counter-revolutionaries such as royalists were purged as well as more radical revolutionaries such as the [[Levellers]]. After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], obstinate republicans were purged while some{{which|date=December 2013}} fled to [[New England]].

The [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]] and the [[Night of the Long Knives]] of 1934, in which the leader of a political party turned against and killed a particular section or group within the party, are commonly called "purges" while mass expulsions on grounds of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]], such as that of the [[Crimean Tatars]] and the [[Japanese-American internment]] are not.

The term "purge" is often associated with [[Stalinism]]. While leading the USSR, [[Joseph Stalin]] imprisoned in [[Gulag]]-labor camps and executed, i.e. purged, "wreckers", or citizens accused of plotting against [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hunt, Lynn|title=The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, Vol. C: Since 1740|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|isbn=978-0312465100|year=2008|edition=3rd|page=846|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin initiated the most notorious of the [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU purges]], the [[Great Purge]], during the 1930s.

Though sudden and violent purges are notable, most purges do not involve immediate execution or imprisonment, for example the periodic massive purges of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia#Membership|Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] on grounds of apathy or dereliction, or the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|purge of Jews]] and [[German resistance to Nazism|political dissenters]] from the German Civil Service in 1933-1934. [[Mao Zedong]] and his associates purged much of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s leadership, including the head of state, President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and the then-[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], beginning in 1966 as part of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In [[Maoism|Maoist]] states, sentences usually involved hard labor in ''[[laogai]]'' camps and executions. Deng Xiaoping acquired a reputation for returning to power after having been purged several times.

[[List of leaders of North Korea|North Korean leaders]] [[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]], and [[Kim Jong-un]] have each periodically purged their political rivals or perceived threats, beginning in the 1950s. The most senior Kim purged those who opposed his son's succession to the supreme leadership of North Korea. Kim Il-sung's most prominent purge occurred during the "[[August Incident]]" in 1956, when the pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese [[Yanan faction]]s of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) attempted to depose Kim. Most of those involved in the plot were executed while some others fled to the USSR and China. While some purges were carried out under Kim Jong-il, they were not as common as they were under his father/son. Kim Jong-un purged a number of high-ranking officials and generals installed by his father Kim Jong-il in the former's first years in power, including, most prominently, his uncle [[Jang Sung-taek]]. 

After [[France]]'s liberation by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944, the [[Free French]] and particularly the [[French Resistance]] carried out purges of former collaborationists, the so-called "[[Vichy France|vichystes]]". The process became known in legal terms as ''[[épuration légale]]'' ("legal purging"). Similar processes in other countries and on other occasions included [[denazification]] and [[decommunization]].

After the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]] often purged those who had previously been involved with the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista regime]]. Purges often involved the execution of the condemned. Castro periodically carried out party purges thereafter. One prominent purge was carried out in 1989, when a high-ranking general named [[Arnaldo Ochoa]] was sentenced to death and executed by [[firing squad]] on charges of [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. Purges became less common in Cuba during the 1990s and 2000s.

== In the 21st century ==
{{main article|2016–2018 purges in Turkey}}
Purges have seldom occurred during the 21st century. However, after the failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], the government of Turkey began a purge against members of its own civil service and the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. The purge ostensibly focused mainly on public servants and soldiers alleged to be part of the [[Gülen movement]], the group the government blamed for the coup. As part of the purge, about 50,000 officials, including thousands of judges, were dismissed and detained.

[[File:Reciprocal altruism summary.svg|thumb|right|240px|Diagram showing reciprocal altruism]]
In [[evolutionary biology]], '''reciprocal altruism''' is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time. The concept was initially developed by [[Robert Trivers]] to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts. The concept is close to the strategy of "[[tit for tat]]" used in [[game theory]].

==Theory==
The concept of "reciprocal altruism", as introduced by Trivers, suggests that [[altruism]], defined as an act of helping another individual while incurring some cost for this act, could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the individual who was helped before may perform an altruistic act towards the individual who helped them initially.&lt;ref name="trivers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi = 10.1086/406755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept finds its roots in the work of [[W. D. Hamilton|W.D. Hamilton]], who developed mathematical models for predicting the likelihood of an altruistic act to be performed on behalf of one's kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|date=1964|title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior II|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=7|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting this into the form of a strategy in a repeated [[prisoner’s dilemma]] would mean to cooperate unconditionally in the first period and behave cooperatively (altruistically) as long as the other agent does as well.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt; If chances of meeting another reciprocal altruist are high enough, or if the game is repeated for a long enough amount of time, this form of altruism can evolve within a population.

This is close to the notion of "[[tit for tat]]" introduced by [[Anatol Rapoport]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (2006). The Selfish Gene (30th Anniversary ed.). United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-929114-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although there still seems a slight distinction in that "tit for tat" cooperates in the first period and from thereon always replicates an opponent’s previous action, whereas “reciprocal altruists” stop cooperation in the first instance of non-cooperation by an opponent and stay non-cooperative from thereon. This distinction leads to the fact that in contrast to reciprocal altruism, tit for tat may be able to restore cooperation under certain conditions despite cooperation having broken down.

Christopher Stephens shows a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions “… for an instance of reciprocal altruism:&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephens | first1 = C. | year = 1996 | title = Modelling Reciprocal Altruism | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 533–551 | doi = 10.1093/bjps/47.4.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the behaviour must reduce a donor's fitness relative to a selfish alternative;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# the fitness of the recipient must be elevated relative to non-recipients;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# the performance of the behaviour must not depend on the receipt of an immediate benefit;&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
# conditions 1, 2, and 3 must apply to both individuals engaging in reciprocal helping.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

There are two additional conditions necessary "…for reciprocal altruism to evolve:"&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

* A mechanism for detecting 'cheaters' must exist.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;
* A large (indefinite) number of opportunities to exchange aid must exist.&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt;

The first two conditions are necessary for altruism as such, while the third is distinguishing reciprocal altruism from simple mutualism and the fourth makes the interaction reciprocal.
Condition number five is required as otherwise non-altruists may always exploit altruistic behaviour without any consequences and therefore evolution of reciprocal altruism would not be possible. However, it is pointed out that this “conditioning device” does not need to be conscious. Condition number six is required to avoid cooperation breakdown through backwards induction&amp;mdash;a possibility suggested by game theoretical models.&lt;ref name="Stephens" /&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples could be understood as altruism. 
However, showing reciprocal altruism in an unambiguous way requires more evidence as will be shown later.

===Cleaner fish===
{{further|Cleaning symbiosis}}
[[File:Cleaner station komodo.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cleaning symbiosis]]: a small cleaner [[wrasse]] (''Labroides dimidiatus'') with [[Animal coloration|advertising coloration]] services a big eye squirrelfish (''[[Priacanthidae|Priacanthus hamrur]]'') in an apparent example of reciprocal altruism.]]

An example of reciprocal altruism is [[cleaning symbiosis]], such as between [[cleaner fish]] and their hosts, though cleaners include shrimps and birds, and clients include fish, turtles, octopuses and mammals.&lt;ref name=Grutter&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cleaning symbioses from the parasites' perspective | author=Grutter, Alexandra S. | journal=Parasitology | year=2002 | volume=124 | issue=7 | pages=S65–S81 | doi=10.1017/S0031182002001488}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Aside from the apparent [[symbiosis]] of the cleaner and the host during actual cleaning, which cannot be interpreted as altruism, the host displays additional behaviour that meets the criteria for altruism:

The host fish allows the cleaner fish free entrance and exit and does not eat the cleaner, even after the cleaning is done.&lt;ref name="Eibel-Eibesfeldt"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1955.tb01523.x | title = Über Symbiosen, Parasitismus und andere besondere zwischenartliche Beziehungen tropischer Meeresfische1 | year = 2010 | last1 = Eibi-Eibesfeldt | first1 = T | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidiger"&gt;Heidiger, H. 1968. Putzer-fische im aquarium. Natur und Museum, 98:89–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1958 | title = A review of the Labrid fish genus Labriodes with descriptions of two new species and notes on ecology | journal = Pacific Science | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 327–347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = J. E. | year = 1962 | title = Fish service stations | journal = Sea Frontiers | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 40–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The host signals the cleaner it is about to depart the cleaner's locality, even when the cleaner is not in its body. The host sometimes chases off possible dangers to the cleaner.&lt;ref name="Randall2" /&gt;

The following evidence supports the hypothesis:

The cleaning by cleaners is essential for the host. In the absence of cleaners the hosts leave the locality or suffer from injuries inflicted by ecto-parasites.&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;Feder, H. M. 1996. "Cleaning symbioses in the marine environment". In S. M. Henry (ed.), ''Symbiosis'', Vol. 1, pp. 327–380. Academic Press, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; There is difficulty and danger in finding a cleaner. Hosts leave their element to get cleaned.&lt;ref name="Randall2" /&gt; Others wait no longer than 30 seconds before searching for cleaners elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Eibel-Eibesfeldt" /&gt;

A key requirement for the establishment of reciprocal altruism is that the same two individuals must interact repeatedly, as otherwise the best strategy for the host would be to eat the cleaner as soon as cleaning was complete. This constraint imposes both a spatial and a temporal condition on the cleaner and on its host. Both individuals must remain in the same physical location, and both must have a long enough lifespan, to enable multiple interactions. There is reliable evidence that individual cleaners and hosts do indeed interact repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Randall1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Limbaugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Limbaugh | first1 = C. | last2 = Pederson | first2 = H. | last3 = Chase | first3 = F. | year = 1961 | title = Shrimps that clean fishes | url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1961/00000011/00000001/art00011 | journal = Bull. Mar. Sci. Gulf Caribb. | volume = 11 | issue =1 | pages = 237–257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This example meets some, but not all, of the criteria described in Trivers’s model. In the cleaner-host system the benefit to the cleaner is always immediate. However, the evolution of reciprocal altruism is contingent on opportunities for future rewards through repeated interactions. In one study, nearby host fish observed "cheater" cleaners and subsequently avoided them.&lt;ref name="bshary"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bshary | first1 = R. | year = 2002 | title = Biting cleaner fish use altruism to deceive image-scoring client reef fish | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 269 | issue = 1505 | pages = 2087–2093 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2084| pmid = 12396482 | pmc = 1691138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, true reciprocity is difficult to demonstrate since failure means the death of the cleaner. However, if Randall’s claim that hosts sometimes chase off possible dangers to the cleaner is correct, an experiment might be constructed in which reciprocity could be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Randall1" /&gt;

===Warning calls in birds===
[[File:2012-06-09 16-04-22 Switzerland Kanton Graubünden Sagliaz cropped.JPG|thumb|Eurasian jay, ''[[Garrulus glandarius]]'', gives loud alarm calls from its tree perch when it sees a predator.]]
{{further|Signalling theory}}

Warning calls, although exposing a bird and putting it in danger, are frequently given by birds. An explanation in terms of altruistic behaviors given by Trivers:&lt;ref name="trivers"/&gt;

It has been shown that predators learn specific localities and specialize individually on prey types and hunting techniques.&lt;ref name="Murie"&gt;Murie, A. 1944. The Wolves of Mount McKinley. Fauna of National Parks, Faunal Series # 5; Wash., D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Southern"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Southern | first1 = H. N. | year = 1954 | title = Tawny owls and their prey | url = | journal = Ibis | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 384–410 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1954.tb02332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tinbergen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | year = 1968 | title = On war and peace in animals and man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 160 | issue = 3835| pages = 1411–1418 | doi = 10.1126/science.160.3835.1411 | pmid = 5690147 |bibcode = 1968Sci...160.1411T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = D. F. | year = 1963 | title = Similar polymorphismas in an insect and a land snail | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 198 | issue = 4876| pages = 201–203 | doi = 10.1038/198201b0 |bibcode = 1963Natur.198..201O }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is therefore disadvantageous for a bird to have a predator eat a conspecific, because the experienced predator may then be more likely to eat him. Alarming another bird by giving a warning call tends to prevent predators from specializing on the caller’s species and locality. In this way, birds in areas in which warning calls are given will be at a selective advantage relative to birds in areas free from warning calls.

Nevertheless, this presentation lacks important elements of reciprocity. It is very hard to detect and ostracize cheaters. There is no evidence that a bird refrains from giving calls when another bird is not reciprocating, nor evidence that individuals interact repeatedly. Given the aforementioned characteristics of bird calling, a continuous bird emigration and immigration environment (true of many avian species) is most likely to be partial to cheaters, since selection against the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is unlikely.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt;

Another explanation for warning calls is that these are not warning calls at all:
A bird, once it has detected a bird of prey, calls to signal to the bird of prey that it was detected, and that there is no use trying to attack the calling bird. Two facts support this hypothesis:

* The call frequencies match the hearing range of the predator bird.
* Calling birds are less attacked—predator birds attack calling birds less frequently than other birds.

===Nest protecting===

[[File:Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) attacking, Amsterdam island, Svalbard.jpg|thumb|[[Arctic tern]]s protect their offspring extremely aggressively by very quick drop-downs from a stationary flight over their enemies. Other birds often benefit from this behavior by breeding very close to the Arctic terns.]]
[[Red-winged blackbird]] males help defend neighbor's nests. There are many theories as to why males behave this way. One is that males only defend other nests which contain their extra-pair offspring. Extra-pair offspring is juveniles which may contain some of the male bird's DNA. Another is the tit-for-tat strategy of reciprocal altruism. A third theory is, males help only other closely related males. A study done by The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife provided evidence that males used a tit-for-tat strategy. The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife tested many different nests by placing stuffed crows by nests, and then observing behavior of neighboring males. The behaviors they looked for included the number of calls, dives, and strikes. After analyzing the results, there was not significance evidence for kin selection; the presence of extra-pair offspring did not affect the probability of help in nest defense. However, males reduced the amount of defense given to neighbors when neighbor males reduced defense for their nests. This demonstrates a tit-for-tat strategy, where animals help those who previously helped them. This strategy is one type of reciprocal altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Olendorf, Robert, Thomas Getty, and Kim Scribner. "Cooperative Nest Defence in Red–winged 
Blackbirds: Reciprocal Altruism, Kinship or By–product Mutualism?" Cooperative Nest Defence in Red–winged Blackbirds: Reciprocal Altruism, Kinship or By–product Mutualism?Royal Society Publishing, 22 Jan. 2004. Web. 14 Sept. 2014. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vampire bats===
[[Vampire bats]] also display reciprocal altruism, as described by Wilkinson.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1984 | title = Reciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 308 | issue = 5955| pages = 181–184 | doi=10.1038/308181a0 | bibcode=1984Natur.308..181W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1988 | title = Reciprocal Altruism in Bats and Other Mammals | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 9 | issue =2–4 | pages = 85–100 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90015-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bats feed each other by regurgitating blood. Since bats only feed on blood and will die after just 70 hours of not eating, this food sharing is a great benefit to the receiver and a great cost to the giver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Gerald|title=Food Sharing in Vampire Bats: Reciprocal Help Predicts Donations More than Relatedness or Harassment | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=January 2, 2013 |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3574350/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To qualify for reciprocal altruism, the benefit to the receiver would have to be larger than the cost to the donor. This seems to hold as these bats usually die if they do not find a blood meal two nights in a row. Also, the requirement that individuals who have behaved altruistically in the past are helped by others in the future is confirmed by the data.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson1" /&gt; However, the consistency of the reciprocal behaviour, namely that a previously non-altruistic bat is refused help when it requires it, has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the bats do not seem to qualify yet as an unequivocal example of reciprocal altruism.

===Primates===
Grooming in primates meets the conditions for reciprocal altruism according to some studies.  One of the studies in vervet monkeys shows that among unrelated individuals, grooming induce higher chance of attending to each other's calls for aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Grooming, alliances and reciprocal altruism in vervet monkeys|last = Seyfarth|first = Robert M|date = 1984|journal = Nature |volume=308 |issue = 5959|pages=541–543|doi = 10.1038/308541a0|pmid = 6709060|access-date = |first2 = Dorothy L|last2 = Cheney|bibcode = 1984Natur.308..541S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, vervet monkeys also display grooming behaviors within group members, displaying alliances.&lt;ref name="sibships"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = P.C. | year = 1987 | title = Sibships: Cooperation and Competition Among Immature Vervet Monkeys. | url = | journal = [[Primates (journal)|Primates]] | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1007/bf02382182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would demonstrate vervet monkey's grooming behavior as a part of kin selection since the activity is done between siblings in this study. Moreover, following the criteria by Stephen,&lt;ref name="Stephens" /&gt; if the study is to be an example of reciprocal altruism, it must prove the mechanism for detecting cheaters.

==Regulation by emotional disposition==
In comparison to that of other animals, the human altruistic system is a sensitive and unstable one.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt; Therefore, the tendency to give, to cheat, and the response to other’s acts of giving and cheating must be regulated by a complex psychology in each individual, social structures, and cultural traditions. Individuals differ in the degree of these tendencies and responses.
According to [[Trivers]], the following emotional dispositions and their evolution can be understood in terms of regulation of altruism.&lt;ref name="trivers" /&gt;

*Friendship and emotions of liking and disliking.
*Moralistic aggression. A protection mechanism from cheaters acts to regulate the advantage of cheaters in selection against altruists. The moralistic altruist may want to educate or even punish a cheater.
*Gratitude and sympathy. A fine regulation of altruism can be associated with gratitude and sympathy in terms of cost/benefit and the level in which the beneficiary will reciprocate.
*Guilt and reparative altruism. Prevents the cheater from cheating again. The cheater shows regret to avoid paying too dearly for past acts.
*Subtle cheating. A stable evolutionary equilibrium could include a low percentage of mimics in controversial support of adaptive sociopathy.
*Trust and suspicion. These are regulators for cheating and subtle cheating.
*Partnerships. Altruism to create friendships.

It is not known how individuals pick partners as there has been little research on choice. Modeling indicates that altruism about partner choices is unlikely to evolve, as costs and benefits between multiple individuals are variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schino | first1 = G. | last2 = Aureli | first2 = F. | year = 2010 | title = A few misunderstandings about reciprocal altruism | journal = Commun. Integr. Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| pages = 561–563 | doi = 10.4161/cib.3.6.12977 | pmid = 21331239 | pmc=3038063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the time or frequency of reciprocal actions contributes more to an individual's choice of partner than the reciprocal act itself.

In mathematics, a '''recurrent tensor''', with respect to a [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; on a [[manifold]] ''M'', is a [[Tensor field|tensor]] ''T'' for which there is a [[differential form|one-form]] ''ω'' on ''M'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla T = \omega\otimes T. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Parallel Tensors===
An example for recurrent [[Tensor field|tensor]]s are parallel tensors which are defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla A = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
with respect to some connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;.

If we take a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] &lt;math&gt;(M,g)&lt;/math&gt; then the metric ''g''  is a parallel and therefore recurrent tensor with respect to its [[Levi-Civita connection]], which is defined via
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^{LC} g = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and its property to be torsion-free.

Parallel vector fields (&lt;math&gt;\nabla X = 0&lt;/math&gt;) are examples of recurrent tensors that find importance in mathematical research. For example, if &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a recurrent non-null vector field on a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla X = \omega\otimes X &lt;/math&gt;
for some closed [[one-form]] &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;, then X can be rescaled to a parallel vector field.&lt;ref&gt;Alekseevsky, Baum (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, non-parallel recurrent vector fields are null vector fields.

===Metric space===
Another example appears in connection with [[Weyl structure]]s. Historically, Weyl structures emerged from the considerations of [[Hermann Weyl]] with regards to properties of parallel transport of vectors and their length.&lt;ref&gt;Weyl (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; By demanding that a manifold have an affine parallel transport in such a way that the manifold is locally an [[affine space]], it was shown that the induced connection had a vanishing torsion tensor
:&lt;math&gt;T^\nabla(X,Y) = \nabla_XY-\nabla_YX - [X,Y] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Additionally, he claimed that the manifold must have a particular parallel transport in which the ratio of two transported vectors is fixed. The corresponding connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla'&lt;/math&gt; which induces such a parallel transport satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla' g = \varphi \otimes g&lt;/math&gt;
for some one-form &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Such a metric is a recurrent tensor with respect to &lt;math&gt;\nabla'&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, Weyl called the resulting manifold &lt;math&gt;(M,g)&lt;/math&gt; with affine connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; and recurrent metric &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; a metric space. In this sense, Weyl was not just referring to one metric but to the conformal structure defined by &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt;. 

Under the conformal transformation &lt;math&gt;g \rightarrow e^{\lambda}g&lt;/math&gt;, the form &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; transforms as &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \varphi -d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This induces a canonical map &lt;math&gt;F:[g] \rightarrow \Lambda^1(M)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;(M, [g])&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;F(e^\lambda g) := \varphi - d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;[g]&lt;/math&gt; is the conformal structure. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is called a Weyl structure,&lt;ref&gt;Folland (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; which more generally is defined as a map with property
:&lt;math&gt;F(e^\lambda g) = F(g) - d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

===Recurrent spacetime===
One more example of a recurrent tensor is the curvature tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; on a recurrent spacetime,&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; for which
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \mathcal{R} = \omega \otimes \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''regression''' (or '''regressive''') '''fallacy''' is an [[informal fallacy]]. It assumes that something has returned to normal because of corrective actions taken while it was abnormal. This fails to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of the [[post hoc fallacy]].

==Explanation==
Things like golf scores, the earth's temperature, and chronic back pain fluctuate naturally and usually [[regression toward the mean|regress towards the mean]]. The logical flaw is to make predictions that expect exceptional results to continue as if they were average (see [[Representativeness heuristic]]). People are most likely to take action when variance is at its peak. Then after results become more normal they believe that their action was the cause of the change when in fact it was not causal.

This use of the word "regression" was coined by Sir [[Francis Galton]] in a study from 1885 called "Regression Toward Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature". He showed that the height of children from very short or very tall parents would move towards the average. In fact, in any situation where two variables are less than perfectly correlated, an exceptional score on one variable may not be matched by an equally exceptional score on the other variable. The imperfect correlation between parents and children (height is not entirely heritable) means that the distribution of heights of their children will be centered somewhere between the average of the parents and the average of the population as whole. Thus, any single child can be more extreme than the parents, but the odds are against it.

==Examples==
&lt;blockquote&gt;When his pain got worse, he went to a doctor, after which the pain subsided a little.  Therefore, he benefited from the doctor's treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pain subsiding a little after it has gotten worse is more easily explained by regression towards the mean.  Assuming the pain relief was caused by the doctor is fallacious.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The student did exceptionally poorly last semester, so I punished him.  He did much better this semester.  Clearly, punishment is effective in improving students' grades.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Often exceptional performances are followed by more normal performances, so the change in performance might better be explained by regression towards the mean.  Incidentally, some experiments have shown that people may develop a systematic bias for punishment and against reward because of reasoning analogous to this example of the regression fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner, 1985; Gilovich, 1991 pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The frequency of accidents on a road fell after a speed camera was installed.  Therefore, the speed camera has improved road safety.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Speed cameras are often installed after a road incurs an exceptionally high number of accidents, and this value usually falls (regression to mean) immediately afterwards.  Many speed camera proponents attribute this fall in accidents to the speed camera, without observing the overall trend.

Some authors use the [[Sports Illustrated cover jinx|''Sports Illustrated'' cover jinx]] as an example of a regression effect: extremely good performances are likely to be followed by less extreme ones, and athletes are chosen to appear on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' only after extreme performances. Attributing this to a "[[jinx]]" rather than regression, as some athletes reportedly believe, is an example of committing the regression fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;Gilovich, 1991 pp. 26–27; Plous, 1993 p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misapplication==
On the other hand, dismissing valid explanations can lead to a worse situation. For example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After the Western Allies invaded Normandy, creating a second major front, German control of Europe waned. Clearly, the combination of the Western Allies and the USSR drove the Germans back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Fallacious evaluation:'' "Given that the counterattacks against Germany occurred only after they had conquered the greatest amount of territory under their control, regression to the mean can explain the retreat of German forces from occupied territories as a purely random fluctuation that would have happened without any intervention on the part of the USSR or the Western Allies." However, this was not the case. The reason is that political power and occupation of territories is not primarily determined by random events, making the concept of regression to the mean inapplicable (on the large scale).

In essence, misapplication of regression to the mean can reduce all events to a [[just-so story|"just so" story]], without cause or effect. (Such misapplication takes as a premise that all events are random, as they must be for the concept of regression to the mean to be validly applied.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28267">In [[psychology]], '''schizotypy''' is a theoretical concept that posits a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] of [[personality psychology|personality]] characteristics and experiences, ranging from normal dissociative, imaginative states to extreme states of mind related to [[psychosis]], especially [[schizophrenia]]. The continuum of personality proposed in schizotypy is in contrast to a categorical view of psychosis, wherein psychosis is considered a particular (usually pathological) state of mind, which the person either has or does not have.

==Development of the concept==

The categorical view of psychosis is most associated with [[Emil Kraepelin]], who created criteria for the [[medical diagnosis]] and classification of different forms of psychotic illness. Particularly, he made the distinction between [[dementia praecox]] (now called schizophrenia), [[manic depression|manic depressive insanity]] and non-psychotic states. Modern diagnostic systems used in [[psychiatry]] (such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) maintain this categorical view.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (1994).  ''DSM IV: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition''. Washington: APA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] did not believe there was a clear separation between [[sanity]] and [[Insanity|madness]], believing instead that psychosis was simply an extreme expression of thoughts and behaviours that could be present to varying degrees throughout the population.&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911"&gt;Bleuler, E. (1911). ''Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias''. Translated by J. Zinkin. New York: International Universities Press, Inc. (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of psychosis as a spectrum was further developed by [[psychologist]]s such as [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Gordon Claridge]], who sought to understand unusual variations in thought and behaviour in terms of personality theory. Eysenck conceptualised cognitive and behavioral variations as all together forming a single personality trait, ''[[psychoticism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Eysenck, H.J. (1992). The Definition and Meaning of Psychoticism. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 13, 757-785.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claridge named his concept ''schizotypy,'' and through examination of unusual experiences in the general population and clustering of [[symptom]]s in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, the work of Claridge suggested that this personality trait was more complex than had been previously thought and could be broken down into four factors.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall, R.P., Claridge, G. and Slade, P.D. (1989).  The multi dimensional nature of schizotypal traits: a factor analytic study with normal subjects.  ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', 28, 363-375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClaridgeMcCreery"&gt;Claridge, G., McCreery, C., Mason, O., Bentall, R., Boyle, G., Slade, P., &amp; Popplewell, D. (1996). The factor structure of 'schizotypal' traits: A large replication study. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'',  '''35''', 103-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Unusual experiences'': The disposition to have unusual [[perception|perceptual]] and other cognitive experiences, such as [[hallucination]]s, magical or superstitious belief and interpretation of events (see also [[delusion]]s).
# ''Cognitive disorganization'': A tendency for thoughts to become derailed, disorganised or tangential (see also [[formal thought disorder]]).
# ''Introverted [[anhedonia]]'': A tendency to introverted, emotionally flat and asocial behaviour, associated with a deficiency in the ability to feel pleasure from social and physical stimulation.
# ''Impulsive nonconformity'': The disposition to unstable mood and behaviour particularly with regard to rules and social conventions.

==The relationship between schizotypy, mental health and mental illness==

Although aiming to reflect some of the features present in diagnosable mental illness, schizotypy does not necessarily imply that someone who is more schizotypal than someone else is more ill. For example, certain aspects of schizotypy may be beneficial. Both the ''unusual experiences'' and ''cognitive disorganisation'' aspects have been linked to [[creativity]] and artistic achievement.&lt;ref name="Nettle, 2006"&gt;Nettle, D. (2006). Schizotypy and mental health amongst poets, visual artist, and mathematicians. ''Journal of Research in Personality'', '''40''', 876-890. Also available online: [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/jrp.pdf Nettle, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M. (1997). Benign schizotypy? The case of religious experience. In G. Claridge, ed., ''Schizotypy, implications for illness and health''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Pp. 227-250&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the concept of ‘benign schizotypy’ in relation to certain classes of religious experience, which he suggested might be regarded as a form of problem-solving and therefore of adaptive value. The link between positive schizotypy and certain facets of creativity&lt;ref&gt;^ Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Claridge, G. (2005). More words, less words: Verbal fluency as a function of 'positive' and 'negative' schizotypy. ''Personality and Individual Differences,'' 39, 705-713&lt;/ref&gt;  is consistent with the notion of a "healthy schizotypy", which may account for the persistence of schizophrenia-related genes in the population despite their many dysfunctional aspects.

However, the exact nature of the relationship between schizotypy and diagnosable psychotic illness is still controversial. One of the key concerns that researchers have had is that questionnaire-based measures of schizotypy, when analysed using [[factor analysis]], do not suggest that schizotypy is a unified, homogeneous concept. The three main approaches have been labelled as 'quasi-dimensional', ‘dimensional’ and ‘fully dimensional’.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of these three variant models, see McCreery, C. and Claridge, G. (2002). Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of-the-body experiences. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32, 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each approach is sometimes used to imply that schizotypy reflects a [[cognitive]] or [[biological process|biological]] vulnerability to psychosis, although this may remain dormant and never express itself, unless triggered by appropriate environmental events or conditions (such as certain doses of drugs or high levels of stress).

===Quasi-dimensional approach===

The quasi-dimensional model may be traced back to Bleuler&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911"/&gt; (the inventor of the term ‘schizophrenia’), who commented on two types of continuity between normality and psychosis: that between the schizophrenic and his or her relatives, and that between the patient’s [[premorbid]] and post-morbid personalities (i.e. their personality before and after the onset of overt psychosis).

On the first score he commented: ‘If one observes the relatives of our patients, one often finds in them peculiarities which are qualitatively identical with those of the patients themselves, so that the disease appears to be only a quantitative increase of the anomalies seen in the parents and siblings.’&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911 p. 238"&gt;Bleuler, E. (1911). ''Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias''. Translated by J. Zinkin. New York: International Universities Press, Inc. (1950), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second point, Bleuler discusses in a number of places whether peculiarities displayed by the patient before admission to hospital should be regarded as premonitory ''symptoms'' of the disease or merely indications of a ''predisposition'' to develop it.

Despite these observations of continuity Bleuler himself remained an advocate of the disease model of schizophrenia.  To this end he invoked a concept of ''latent schizophrenia'', writing: ‘In [the latent] form, we can see ''in nuce'' [in a nutshell] all the symptoms and all the combinations of symptoms which are present in the manifest types of the disease.’&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911 p. 238"/&gt;

Later advocates of the quasi-dimensional view of schizotypy are [[Sandor Rado|Rado]]&lt;ref&gt;Rado, S. (1953).  Dynamics and classification of disordered behaviour. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', '''110''', 406 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and Meehl,&lt;ref&gt;Meehl, P.E. (1962). Schizotaxia, schizotypy, schizophrenia.'' American Psychologist'', '''17''', 827 838.
&lt;/ref&gt; according to both of whom schizotypal symptoms merely represent less explicitly expressed manifestations of the underlying disease process which is schizophrenia.  Rado proposed the term ‘schizotype’ to describe the person whose genetic make-up gave him or her a lifelong predisposition to schizophrenia.

The quasi-dimensional model is so called because the only dimension it postulates is that of gradations of severity or explicitness in relation to the symptoms of a disease process: namely schizophrenia.

===Dimensional approach===

The dimensional approach, influenced by personality theory, argues that full blown psychotic illness is just the most extreme end of the schizotypy spectrum and there is a natural continuum between people with low and high levels of schizotypy. This model is most closely associated with the work of Hans Eysenck, who regarded the person exhibiting the full-blown manifestations of psychosis as simply someone occupying the extreme upper end of his ‘psychoticism’ dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, H.J. (1960). Classification and the problems of diagnosis. In H.J. Eysenck, ed., ''Handbook of Abnormal Psychology''. London: Pitman. Pp.1-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the dimensional model comes from the fact that high-scorers on measures of schizotypy may meet, or partially fulfill, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[schizoid personality disorder]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder]]. Similarly, when analyzed, schizotypy traits often break down into similar groups as do symptoms from schizophrenia&lt;ref&gt;Liddle, P.F. (1987). The symptoms of chronic schizophrenia: A re-examination of the positive negative dichotomy. ''British Journal of Psychology'', 151, 145 151.&lt;/ref&gt; (although they are typically present in much less intense forms).

===Fully dimensional approach===

Claridge calls the latest version of his model ‘the fully dimensional approach’.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Claridge, G. and Beech, T. (1995). Fully and quasi-dimensional constructions of schizotypy. In Raine,  A.,  Lencz, T.,  and Mednick,  S.A., ''Schizotypal Personality''.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it might also be  characterised as the ''hybrid'' or ''composite'' approach, as it incorporates elements of both the disease model and the dimensional one.

On this latest Claridge model, schizotypy is regarded as a dimension of personality, normally distributed throughout the population, as in the Eysenck model. However, schizophrenia itself is regarded as a breakdown process, quite distinct from the continuously distributed trait of schizotypy, and forming a second, graded continuum, ranging from schizotypal personality disorder to full-blown schizophrenic psychosis.

The model is characterised as fully dimensional because, not only is the personality trait of schizotypy continuously graded, but the independent continuum of the breakdown processes is also graded rather than categorical.

The fully dimensional approach argues that full blown psychosis is not just high schizotypy, but must involve other factors that make it qualitatively different and pathological.

== Relationship to personality traits ==
Many research studies have examined the relationship between schizotypy and various standard models of personality, such as the [[Five factor model]]. &lt;ref name=hierarchic&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2009.07.018|title=The hierarchic structure in schizotypy and the five-factor model of personality|year=2011|last1=Asai|first1=Tomohisa|last2=Sugimori|first2=Eriko|last3=Bando|first3=Naoko|last4=Tanno|first4=Yoshihiko|journal=Psychiatry Research|volume=185|pages=78–83|pmid=20537405|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has linked the unusual experiences factor to high [[neuroticism]] and [[openness to experience]]. The introvertive anhedonia factor has been linked to high neuroticism and low [[extraversion]]. The cognitive disorganisation factor has been linked to low [[conscientiousness]]. It has been argued that these findings provide evidence for a fully dimensional model of schizotypy and that there is a continuum between normal personality and schizotypy.&lt;ref name=hierarchic/&gt; 

Relationships between schizotypy and the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]] have also been examined.&lt;ref name=laidlaw&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.01.025|title=Low self-directedness (TCI), mood, schizotypy and hypnotic susceptibility|year=2005|last1=Laidlaw|first1=Tannis M.|last2=Dwivedi|first2=Prabudha|last3=Naito|first3=Akira|last4=Gruzelier|first4=John H.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|issue=2|pages=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-transcendence]], a trait associated with openness to "spiritual" ideas and experiences, has moderate positive associations with schizotypy, particularly with unusual experiences. [[Cloninger]] described the specific combination of high self-transcendence, low [[cooperativeness]], and low [[self-directedness]] as a "schizotypal personality style"&lt;ref name=laidlaw/&gt; and research has found that this specific combination of traits is associated with a "high risk" of schizotypy. &lt;ref name=Danelluzo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danelluzo|first=E. |author2=Stratta, P. |author3=Rossi, A.|title=The contribution of temperament and character to schizotypy multidimensionality|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|date=Jan–Feb 2005|volume=46|issue=1|pages=50–5|pmid=15714195|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2004.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low cooperativeness and self-directedness combined with high self-transcendence may result in openness to odd or unusual ideas and behaviours associated with distorted perceptions of reality.&lt;ref name=laidlaw/&gt; On the other hand, high levels of cooperativeness and self-directedness may protect against the schizotypal tendencies associated with high self-transcendence.&lt;ref name=siblings&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Matthew J. |author2=Cloninger, C.R. |author3=Harms, M.P. |author4=Csernansky, J.G.|title=Temperament and character as schizophrenia-related endophenotypes in non-psychotic siblings|journal=Schizophrenia Research|date=September 2008|volume=104|issue=1–3|pages=198–205|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2008.06.025|pmid=18718739|pmc=2565802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible biological bases of schizotypy==

===Anhedonia===
[[Anhedonia]], or a reduced ability to experience pleasure, is a feature of full-blown schizophrenia that was commented on by both Kraepelin&lt;ref&gt;Kraepelin, E. (1913). ''Dementia Praecox and Paraphrenia''. Translated by R.M. Barclay. Edinburgh: Livingston, (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; and Bleuler.&lt;ref name="Bleuler, E. 1911"/&gt;  However, they regarded it as just one among a number of features that tended to characterise the ‘deterioration’, as they saw it, of the schizophrenic’s emotional life.  In other words, it was an effect, rather than a cause, of the disease process.

[[Sandor Rado|Rado]]&lt;ref&gt;Rado, S. (1953).  Dynamics and classification of disordered behaviour. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', 110, 406 416.&lt;/ref&gt; reversed this way of thinking, and ascribed anhedonia a causal role. He considered that the crucial neural deficit in the schizotype was an ‘integrative pleasure deficiency’, i.e. an innate deficiency in the ability to experience pleasure.  Meehl&lt;ref&gt;Meehl, P.E. (1962). Schizotaxia, schizotypy, schizophrenia. ''American Psychologist,'' 17, 827 838.&lt;/ref&gt; took on this view, and attempted to relate this deficiency to abnormality in the [[dopamine]] system in the brain, which is implicated in the human [[reward system]].

Questionnaire research on schizotypy in normal subjects is ambiguous with regard to the causal role, if any, of anhedonia.  Nettle&lt;ref name="Nettle, 2006"/&gt; and McCreery and Claridge&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. and Claridge, G. (2002). Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of-the-body experiences. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32, 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt; found that high schizotypes as measured by factor 1 ([[Schizotypy#Development of the concept|above]]) scored lower than controls on the introverted anhedonia factor, as if they were particularly enjoying life.

Various writers, including Kelley and Coursey&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M.P. and Coursey, R.D. (1992).  Factor structure of schizotypy scales.  ''Personality and Invividual Differences'', 13, 723-731.&lt;/ref&gt; and L.J. and J.P. Chapman&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, L.J., Chapman, J.P., Kwapil, T.R, Eckblad, M., &amp; Zinser, M.C. (1994). Putatively psychosis-prone subjects 10 years later. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 103, 171 183.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that anhedonia, if present as a pre-existent trait in a person, may act as a potentiating factor, whereas a high capacity for hedonic enjoyment might act as a protecting one.

===Weakness of inhibitory mechanisms===

====Negative priming====

A number of studies have found that high schizotypes, as measured by questionnaire, show less [[negative priming]] than controls.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Beech, A.R. and Claridge, G.S. (1987).  Individual differences in negative priming: Relations with schizotypal personality traits.  ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', 78, 349-356.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative priming is said to occur when a person reacts more slowly than usual to a stimulus which has previously been presented as a distractor and which has therefore had to be ignored. Beech interprets the relative weakness of the negative priming effect in schizotypes as a sign that ‘inhibition of distracting information is reduced in schizophrenia and high schizotypes’.&lt;ref&gt;Beech, A.R. (1987).  ''Cognitive Differences and Schizophrenia''.  Unpublished DPhil thesis, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduced negative priming shown by high schizotypes has the interesting effect that they actually perform better on certain tasks (those that require them to respond to previously ignored stimuli) than low schizotypes.  This phenomenon may be of significance in the relation to the question of why schizotypy, and indeed schizophrenia itself, is not progressively ‘weeded out’ by the process of [[natural selection]].

====SAWCI====

The phenomenon of [[semantic]] activation without conscious identification (SAWCI) is said to be displayed when a person shows a priming effect from the processing of consciously undetectable words. For example, a person who has just been shown the word ‘giraffe’, but at a speed at which he or she was not able consciously to report what it was, may nevertheless identify more quickly than usual another animal word on the next trial. Evans&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J.L. (1992). ''Schizotypy and Preconscious Processing''.  Unpublished D.Phil. thesis, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; found that high schizotypes showed a greater priming effect than controls in such a situation.  She argued that this could be accounted for by a relative weakness of inhibitory mechanisms in the semantic networks of high schizotypes.

====Attention, working memory, and executive functions====

Schizotypy symptoms have been related to deficits in [[executive functions]], which entails the psychological processes that supersede habitual inclinations with novel responses and behaviors to fulfill important goals. In particular, when schizotypy is elevated, the ability to filter out task-irrelevant stimuli may be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;Shrira, A. &amp; Tsakanikos, E. (2009). Latent inhibition as a function of schizotypal symptoms: evidence for a bi-directional model. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 47, 922-927.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, participants who score highly on schizotypy  tend to fail to  ignore a previously preexposed, non-reinforced stimulus as compared to a non-preexposed, novel and potentially important event.

Enhanced performance on [[Verbal fluency test|verbal fluency]] has been associated with high levels of positive schizotypy, i.e. increased reports of hallucination-like experiences, delusional ideation, and perceptual aberrations. However, decreased performance was associated with negative schizotypy{{clarify|date=June 2018}}, such as anhedonia&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. &amp; Claridge, G. (2005). Less words, more words: psychometric schizotypy and verbal fluency. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 39, 705-713.&lt;/ref&gt;
       
Many studies have also shown that individuals who exhibit schizotypy features demonstrate deficits in [[Attention]] and [[Working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;^ Beech, A.R. and Claridge, G.S. (1987). Individual differences in negative priming: Relations with schizotypal personality traits. British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 78, 349-356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2004).

''Journal of Behavior Therapy &amp; Experimental Psychiatry'', 36, 300-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abnormalities of arousal===

Claridge&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S. (1967). ''Personality and Arousal''. Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that one consequence of a weakness of inhibitory mechanisms in high schizotypes and schizophrenics might be a relative failure of [[homeostasis]] in the central nervous system.  This, it was proposed, could lead, both to [[lability]] of [[arousal]], and to dissociation of arousal in different parts of the nervous system.

====Dissociation of different arousal systems====

Claridge and co-workers&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S. and Clark, K.H. (1982). Covariation between two flash threshold and skin conductance level in first breakdown schizophrenics: Relationships in drug free patients and effects of treatment. ''Psychiatry Research'', 6, 371 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S. and Birchall, P.M.A. (1978). Bishop, Eysenck, Block and psychoticism. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 87, 664 668.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claridge, G.S., Robinson, D.L. and Birchall, P.M.A. (1985). Psychophysiological evidence of `psychoticism' in schizophrenics' relatives. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 6, 1 10.&lt;/ref&gt; have found various types of abnormal co-variation between different [[psychophysiological]] variables in schizotypes, including between measures of cortical and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] arousal.

McCreery and Claridge&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C., and Claridge, G. (1996). ‘A study of hallucination in normal subjects – II. Electrophysiological data’. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 21, 749-758.&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of a relative activation of the right [[cerebral hemisphere]] as compared with the left in high schizotypes attempting to induce a hallucinatory episode in the laboratory. This suggested a relative [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociation]] of arousal between the two hemispheres in such people as compared with controls.

====Hyperarousal====

A failure of homeostasis in the central nervous system could lead to episodes of hyper-arousal. Oswald&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, I. (1962). ''Sleeping and Waking: Physiology and Psychology.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that extreme stress and hyper-arousal can lead to sleep as a provoked reaction.  McCreery&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (1997). Hallucinations and arousability: pointers to a theory of psychosis. In Claridge, G. (ed.): ''Schizotypy, Implications for Illness and Health''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, C. (2008). Dreams and psychosis: a new look at an old hypothesis. ''Psychological Paper No. 2008-1''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Also available online: [http://www.celiagreen.com/charlesmccreery/dreams-and-psychosis.pdf McCreery 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that this could account for the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] similarities between Stage 1 sleep and psychosis, which include hallucinations, delusions, and flattened or inappropriate affect (emotions). On this model, high schizotypes and schizophrenics are people who are liable to what Oswald calls ‘micro-sleeps’, or intrusions of Stage 1 [[sleep]] phenomena into waking consciousness, on account of their tendency to high arousal.

In support of this view McCreery points to the high correlation that has been found to exist&lt;ref name="ClaridgeMcCreery" /&gt; between scores on the Chapmans’ Perceptual Aberration scale,&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, L.J., Chapman, J.P. and Raulin, M.L. (1978). Body image aberration in schizophrenia. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'',''' 87''', 399 407.&lt;/ref&gt; which measures proneness to perceptual anomalies such as hallucinations, and the Chapmans’ Hypomania scale,&lt;ref&gt;Eckblad, M. and Chapman, L.J. (1986). Development and validation of a scale for hypomanic personality. ''Journal of Abnormal Personality'', '''95''', 217 233.&lt;/ref&gt; which measures a tendency to episodes of heightened arousal. This correlation is found despite the fact that there is no overlap of item content between the two scales.

In the clinical field there is also the paradoxical finding of Stevens and Darbyshire,&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, J.M. and Darbyshire, A.J. (1958).  Shifts along the alert-repose continuum during remission of catatonic `stupor' with amobarbitol.  ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', 20, 99-107.&lt;/ref&gt; that schizophrenic patients exhibiting the symptom of [[catatonia]] can be aroused from their apparent stupor by the administration of sedative rather than stimulant drugs.  They wrote: ‘The psychic state in catatonic schizophrenia can be described as one of great excitement (i.e., hyperalertness)[…] The inhibition of activity apparently does not alter the inner seething excitement.'

It is argued that such a view would be consistent with the model that suggests schizophrenics and high schizotypes are people with a tendency to hyper-arousal.

====Aberrant salience hypothesis====

Kapur (2003) proposed that a hyperdopaminergic state, at a "brain" level of description, leads to an aberrant assignment of salience to the elements of one’s experience, at a "mind" level.&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, S. (2003). Psychosis as a state of aberrant salience: a framework linking biology, phenomenology, and pharmacology in schizophrenia. ''American Journal of Psychiatry'',160, 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Dopamine mediates the conversion of the neural representation of an external stimulus from a neutral bit of information into an attractive or aversive entity, i.e. a salient event. Symptoms of  schizophrenia and schizotypy  may arise out of ‘the aberrant assignment of salience to external objects and internal representations’; and antipsychotic medications may reduce positive symptoms by attenuating aberrant motivational salience, via blockade of the Dopamine D2 receptors (Kapur, 2003). There is no evidence however on a link between attentional irregularities and enhanced stimulus salience in schizotypy.&lt;ref&gt;Tsakanikos, E. (2004). Latent inhibition, visual pop-out and schizotypy: is disruption of latent inhibition due to  enhanced stimulus salience?''Personality and Individual Differences'', 37, 1347-1358.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palm oil]], produced from the [[oil palm]], is a basic source of income for many farmers in South East Asia, Central and West Africa, and Central America. It is locally used as a cooking oil, exported for use in many commercial food and personal care products and is converted into biofuel. It produces up to 10 times more oil per unit area than [[soyabean]]s, [[rapeseed]] or [[sunflower]]s.&lt;ref name=econ2010 /&gt;

In some areas, the cultivation of oil palm has replaced traditional practices, often due to the higher income potential of palm oil.&lt;ref name="Budidarsono"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norwana"/&gt;

However, in some cases, land has been developed by oil palm plantations without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land.

In Indonesia, rising demand for palm oil and timber has led to the clearing of [[tropical forest]] land in [[National parks of Indonesia|Indonesian national parks]]. According to a 2007 report published by [[UNEP]], at the rate of deforestation at that time, an estimated 98 percent of Indonesian forest would be destroyed by 2022 due to legal and illegal logging, [[forest fire]]s and the development of palm oil plantations.&lt;ref name="UNEP Report"/&gt;

Malaysia, the second largest producer of palm oil has pledged to conserve a minimum of 50 percent of its total land area as forests. As of 2010, 58 percent of Malaysia was forested.&lt;ref name="Morales"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia Has Little Room for Expanding Palm-Oil Production, Minister Says |last1=Morales |first1=Alex |last2= |first2= |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-18/malaysia-has-little-room-for-palm-oil-expansion-plantation-minister-says.html |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/worldbusiness/31biofuel.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=e653a375e67e8e49&amp;ex=1327899600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Once a Dream, Palm Oil May Be an Eco-Nightmare] The New York Times, January 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; due to the clearing of large areas of rainforest for palm oil plantations. Many Indonesian and Malaysian rainforests lie atop [[peat bogs]] that store great quantities of [[carbon]]. Forest removal and bog drainage to make way for plantations releases this carbon.

Researchers are looking for possible solutions and ways to help the situation and have suggested that if enough land is conserved and there remain large enough areas of primary forest reserves, the effects of the palm oil industry may not have as much of an impact on wildlife and biodiversity. Environmental groups like Greenpeace, the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]], and [[Amnesty International]] are also taking part in advocating bans on unsustainable palm oil crops and the companies that purchase these exports.

Environmental groups such as [[Greenpeace]] claim that this [[deforestation]] produces far more emissions than biofuels remove.&lt;ref name="pachter"&gt;{{

Greenpeace argues the peatlands represent massive carbon sinks, and they claim the destruction already accounts for four percent of annual global CO₂ emissions. However, according to the Tropical Peat Research Laboratory, at least one measurement has shown that oil palm plantations are carbon sinks because oil palms convert carbon dioxide into oxygen just as other trees do,&lt;ref name="New Straits"&gt;{{cite news |title=The truth about oil palms and carbon sinks |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-186087678.html |newspaper=New Straits Times |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as reported in Malaysia's Second National Communication to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], oil palm plantations contribute to Malaysia's net carbon sink.&lt;ref name="NC2"&gt;{{Cite report |author= |date= |title=Malaysia: Second National Communication to the UNFCCC |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/malnc2.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment Malaysia |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=where does it say that?

Greenpeace recorded peatland destruction in the Indonesian province of Riau on the island of [[Sumatra]], home to 25 percent of Indonesia's palm oil plantations. Greenpeace claims this would have devastating consequences for Riau's peatlands, which have already been degraded by industrial development and store a massive 14.6 billion tonnes of carbon, roughly one year's greenhouse gas emissions.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Indonesia and Malaysia===
{{Main|Palm oil production in Indonesia|Palm oil production in Malaysia}}

In the two countries responsible for over 80% of world oil palm production, Indonesia and Malaysia, smallholders account for 35–40% of the total area of planted oil palm and as much as 33% of the output. Elsewhere, as in West African countries that produce mainly for domestic and regional markets, smallholders produce up to 90% of the annual harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=13533IIED Vermeulen and Goad. 2006. Towards better practice in smallholder palm oil production. IIED]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Malaysia's commitment to retain natural forest cover on at least 50 percent of the nation's land, the growth of new palm oil plantations has slowed in recent years. According to Malaysia's Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok, significant expansion of palm oil is no longer possible, therefore Malaysian farmers are now focusing on increasing production without expansion.&lt;ref name="Morales"/&gt;

In January 2008, the CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal stating that Malaysia was aware of the need to pursue a [[sustainability|sustainable]] palm oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120122705116215667 Malaysian Palm Trees Are Fine and Green, Too]. January 25, 2008. OP-ED letter from the CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, WSJ online&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Malaysian government, along with palm oil companies, have increased production of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO).&lt;ref name="Sarif"/&gt; Malaysia has been recognized by the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] as the largest producer of CSPO, producing 50 percent of the world's supply,&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;{{cite news |title=RSPO names Malaysia as world's largest producer of sustainable palm oil |last1=McDougall |first1=Andrew |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Formulation-Science/RSPO-names-Malaysia-as-world-s-largest-producer-of-sustainable-palm-oil |newspaper=Cosmetics Design |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accounting for 40% of CSPO growers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WWF2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sustainable plam oil is good for business WWF study |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.wwf.org.my/media_and_information/newsroom_main/?uNewsID=13940 |newspaper=World Wildlife Federation |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia produces 35 percent of the world's CSPO.&lt;ref name="Sarif"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia expected to maintain position as world’s largest producer of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil |last1=Sarif |first1=Edy |last2= |first2= |url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/17/business/8916226&amp;sec=business |newspaper=The Malaysian Star |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, the Indigenous Peoples' Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN) under the direction of [[Mina Susana Setra]] has fought for policies that find balance between economic need and indigenous people's rights. 99% of the palm oil concessions in the country concern land that is occupied by indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Eshelman (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eshelman|first1=Robert S.|title=Indonesian government's concession policy prioritizes companies over forest communities|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2014/1103-sri-eshelman-indonesia-industrial-concessions.html|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=Mongabay|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, AMAN led an advocacy team which won a Constitutional Court case recognizing customary land rights;&lt;ref name="Nasional  (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Media|first1=Tim|title=Mina Setra Wakili Regio Kalimantan|url=http://dkn.or.id/en/2014/05/08/mina-setra-wakili-regio-kalimantan/|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=Dewan Kehutanan Nasional|date=May 8, 2014|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, implementation of programs that protect indigenous rights, the environment and developers have failed to come to fruition except in limited cases.&lt;ref name="Eshelman (2014)" /&gt;

===Africa===
In Africa, the situation is very different compared to Indonesia or Malaysia. In its [[Human Development Report]] 2007-2008, the [[United Nations Development Program]] says production of palm oil in West Africa is largely sustainable, mainly because it is undertaken on a smallholder level without resorting to diversity-damaging [[monoculture]]. The United Nations Food and Agriculture program is encouraging small farmers across Africa to grow palm oil, because the crop offers opportunities to improve livelihoods and incomes for the poor.&lt;ref name=hdr2008&gt;

==Increasing demand==
Food and cosmetics companies, including [[Archer Daniels Midland|ADM]], [[Unilever]], [[Cargill]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Nestle]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] and [[Burger King]], are driving the demand for new palm oil supplies,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.greenpeace.org/cookingtheclimate Cooking the Climate – palm oil industry] Greenpeace November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; demand was partly driven by a need for a replacement for high [[trans fat]] content oils.&lt;ref&gt;

Although palm oil is used in the production of [[biofuel]]s and proposals have been made to use it in large installations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/burning_palm_oil_fuels_cli_23082006.html|title=Burning palm oil fuels climate change|publisher=Friends of the Earth|date=Aug 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2012 report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] concluded that the increase in palm oil production is related to food demands, not biofuel demands.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;{{Cite report |last1= Saunders |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Balagtas |first2=Joseph V. |last3=Gruere |first3=Guillaume |date=March 2012 |title=Revisiting the Palm Oil Boom in Southeast Asia |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01167.pdf |publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiesel===
[[Biodiesel]] made from palm oil grown on sustainable non-forest land and from established plantations reduces greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="CSIRO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/resources/pf13o.html |title=The greenhouse and air quality emissions of biodiesel blends in Australia |date=26 November 2007 |work=csiro.au |publisher=The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Greenpeace, clearing peatland to plant oil palms releases large amounts of [[greenhouse gasses]], and that biodiesel produced from oil palms grown on this land may not result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/faq-palm-oil-forests-and-climate-change |title=FAQ: Palm oil, forests and climate change |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work=greenpeace.org.uk |publisher=Greenpeace UK |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research by Malaysia's Tropical Peat Research Unit has found that oil palm plantations developed on peatland produce lower carbon dioxide emissions than forest peat swamp. However, it has been suggested that this research unit was commissioned by politicians who have interests in the palm oil industry.&lt;ref name=Wong2&gt;{{cite news |title=Less carbon dioxide from oil palm estates |author=Jack Wong |url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/9/20/business/7042775 |work=The Star |date=20 September 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, eight of Malaysia's [[Federal Land Development Authority]] (FELDA) plantations were certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification System (ISCC), becoming part of Asia's first ISCC certified supply and production chain for palm biodiesel. This certification system complies with the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED).&lt;ref name="Vogele"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mission achieves ISCC certification, loses contract with Chevron |author=Erin Vogele |url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/7671/mission-achieves-iscc-certification-loses-contract-with-chevron |work=Biodiesel Magazine |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[European Commission]] approved the RSPO's biofuel certification scheme allowing certified sustainable palm oil biofuel to be sold in Europe.&lt;ref name="RSPO press"&gt;{{cite press release |title=RSPO Announcement: On the Approval from the European Commission of RSPO-RED, the Biofuels Certification Scheme of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil |url=http://www.rspo.org/news_details.php?nid=137 |publisher=RSPO |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
[[File:Palm forest.jpg|thumb|250px|In Borneo, the forest (F), is being replaced by oil palm plantations (G). These changes are irreversible for all practical purposes (H).]]

The [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO), founded in 2004, works to promote the production of sustainably sourced palm oil through involvement with growers, processors, food companies, investors and NGOs.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt; Beginning in 2008, palm oil that meets RSPO introduced standards has been designated "certified sustainable palm oil" (CSPO). Within two years of implementation, CSPO-designated palm oil comprised 7 percent of the global palm oil market.&lt;ref name="Adnan"&gt;{{cite news |title=A shot in the arm for CSPO |last1=Adnan |first1=Hanim |url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=business&amp;file=/2011/3/28/business/8360810 |newspaper=The Star Online |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2012, 12 percent of palm oil has been certified by the RSPO.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite news |title=WWF: Industry should buy into GreenPalm today, or it will struggle to source fully traceable sustainable palm oil tomorrow |last1=Watson |first1=Emma |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/WWF-Industry-should-buy-into-GreenPalm-today-or-it-will-struggle-to-source-fully-traceable-sustainable-palm-oil-tomorrow |newspaper=Food Navigator |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the first year of CSPO certification only 30 percent of sustainable oil was marketed as CSPO.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;

In ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2010, the RSPO was criticized for not setting standards for greenhouse-gas emissions for plantations and because its members account for only 40 percent of palm oil production.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt; In a 2007 report, [[Greenpeace]] was critical of RSPO-member food companies saying that they are "dependent on suppliers that are actively engaged in deforestation and the conversion of peatlands".&lt;ref name="Greenpeace2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2007/11/palm-oil-cooking-the-climate.pdf |title=How the Palm Oil Industry is Cooking the Climate |year=2007 |work=greenpeace.org |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a contribution of $1 billion from Norway, in May 2010, Indonesia announced a two-year suspension on new agreements to clear natural forests and peatlands. Additionally, Indonesia announced plans to create its own organization similar to the RSPO, which, as a government certification system, will introduce mandatory regulation for all Indonesian palm oil producers.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillespie"&gt;{{cite news |title=ISPO, RSPO: Two sides of the same coin? |last1=Gillespie |first1=Piers |last2=Harjanthi |first2=Rahayu Siti |url=http://www2.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/02/ispo-rspo-two-sides-same-coin.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Malaysia began developing a national certification, the "Malaysia sustainable palm oil" (MSPO) certification, to improve involvement in sustainable palm oil production nationwide.&lt;ref name="Daily Express"&gt;{{cite news |title=Having own palm oil certification hailed |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=79183 |newspaper=Daily Express |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification program, aimed at small and medium-sized producers, is expected to be launched in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2013/09/04/Govt-expected-to-launch-palm-oil-standard-by-next-year.aspx Hanim Adnan.

===Carbon credit programs===
Oil palm producers are eligible to take part in [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) programs in which developed nations invest in clean energy projects in developing nations to earn carbon credits to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.&lt;ref name="Chiew"&gt;{{cite news |title=Developing countries play role to minimise global warming |last1=Chiew |first1=Hilary |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2008/4/1/lifefocus/20318588&amp;sec=lifefocus |newspaper=The Star |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors have been cautious about investing in palm oil biofuel projects because of the impact the expansion of oil palm plantations has had on tropical rain forests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asria.org/news/press/1195793283 Carbon market takes sides in palm oil battle] Carbon Finance, 23 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the South East Asian CDM development company [[YTL Corporation#YTL-SV Carbon|YTL-SV Carbon]], many CDM projects in the palm oil sector focus on improving use of waste products to reduce gas emissions and do not contribute to the establishment of new oil palm plantations.&lt;ref name="Varming"&gt;{{cite news |title=CDM is promoting sustainable palm oil |last1=Varming |first1=Soeren |last2=Dutschke |first2=Michael |url=http://www.ytl-svcarbon.com/news.php?newsID=19 |work=Point Carbon Newsletter: CDM &amp; JI Monitor |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of sustainable oil by corporations===

The [[World Wildlife Foundation]] (WWF) publishes an annual report on the use of sustainable palm oil by major corporations. In the 2011 report, 31 of the 132 companies surveyed received a top score for their use of sustainable palm oil. This represents an increase from 2009, the first year the report was issued, where no companies received top scores.&lt;ref name="WWF2011"/&gt;

The WWF reports that 87 companies have committed to using only sustainable palm oil by 2015, including [[Unilever]] and [[Nestlé]], both of which committed to exclusively using sustainable palm oil following demonstrations and urgings from environmental organizations in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=foodnav&gt;
[http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?n=85047-unilever-greenpeace-palm-oil-carbon-emissions-sustainable     Unilever commits to sustainable palm oil] Food Navigator.com 2 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the WWF, the overall growth in the use of sustainable palm oil is too slow.&lt;ref name="WWF2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/palm_oil/solutions/responsible_purchasing/scorecard2011/ |title=2011 Palm Oil Buyers' Scorecard |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2011 |work=wwf.panda.org |publisher=World Wildlife Foundation |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retailers who have made commitments to offering products containing sustainable oil, including [[Walmart]] and [[Carrefour]], have attributed the slow rate of growth in the availability of sustainable palm oil to a lack of consumer interest and awareness in products made with sustainable palm oil. These companies have expressed concern about the potential impact of low consumer demand on the cost and future availability of sustainable palm oil.&lt;ref name="Watson2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Certified sustainable palm oil derivatives 'prohibitively expensive' in US |last1=Watson |first1=Elaine |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/Certified-sustainable-palm-oil-derivatives-prohibitively-expensive-in-US |newspaper=Food Navigator |date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lingga"&gt;{{cite news |title=Consumer response to certified palm oil products still weak |last1=Lingga |first1=Vincent |last2= |first2= |url=http://www2.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/01/consumer-response-certified-palm-oil-products-still-weak.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuading governments===
It may be possible to persuade governments of nations that produce competing products to enact [[Protectionism|protectionist]] legislation against the products of deforestation, an approach that was presented in a report by the [[National Farmers Union (United States)]] and [[Avoided Deforestation Partners]]. The 2010 report estimates that protecting the {{convert|13,000,000|ha|sqmi}} of mostly tropical forest that are lost annually worldwide would boost American agricultural revenue by $190–270 billion between 2012 and 2030. However, several conservation groups, including [[Conservation International]], [[Environmental Defense Fund]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], and [[The Nature Conservancy]], presented a rebuttal to the report, stating that it was "based on the assumption, totally unfounded, that deforestation in tropical countries can be easily interrupted, and its conclusions are therefore also unrealistic."&lt;ref name=econ2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=gardner2010&gt;{{

'''Social comparison bias''' is having feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone that is seen physically, or mentally better than yourself.

==Introduction==
A majority of people in [[society]] base their moods and feelings on how well they are doing compared to other people in their environment.  Social comparison bias happens in everyday society regularly.  Social comparison bias can be defined as having feelings of dislike and competitiveness with someone that is seen as physically or mentally better than yourself.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97–101}}  This can be compared to [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]], which is believed to be central to achievement motivation, feelings of [[injustice]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[jealousy]] and people's willingness to remain in relationships or jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Buunk &amp; Gibbons 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suls &amp; Wheeler 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  People often compete to get the best grades, the best jobs and the best houses.  In many situations, social comparison bias is fairly self-explanatory.  For example, you might make a comparison if you shop at low-end department stores and a peer shops at the designer stores, and you are overcome with feelings of [[resentment]], [[anger]] and [[envy]] with that peer.  This social comparison bias involves [[wealth]] and [[social status]].  Some of us make social comparisons,{{Who|date=June 2012}}&lt;!-- 1/6 of the world population is hungry! --&gt; but are largely unaware of them.{{Sfn|Smith|Leach|2004|pp=297–308}}  In most cases, we try to compare ourselves to those in our [[peer group]] or with whom we are similar.{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569–575}}

==Research==
There are many studies revolving around social comparison and the effects it has on [[mental health]].  One study involved the relationship between depression and [[social comparison]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309–323}}  Thwaites and Dagnan, in "Moderating variables in the relationship between social comparison and depression", investigated the relationship between social comparison and depression utilizing an evolutionary framework.  Their hypothesis was that depression was an outcome from social comparisons that people carried out.  This study investigated the moderating effects on social comparison of the importance of comparison dimensions to the person, and of the perceived importance of the dimensions to other people.  What the researchers used to measure the depression in their participants was a [[self-esteem]] test called the Self Attributes Questionnaire created by Pelham and Swann in 1989.  The test consisted of 10-point [[Likert scale]] ratings on 10 individual social comparison dimensions (e.g. [[intelligence]], [[social skills]], [[Humour|sense of humor]]).  "Questions were added to explore beliefs regarding the importance of social comparison dimensions.  Data were collected from a combined clinical sample and non-clinical sample of 174 people."{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309–323}}  They concluded that social comparison did have a relationship with depression based on the data that they collected.  More people that contributed in social comparisons had a higher level of depression than people that rarely used social comparison.

==Cognitive effects==
One major symptom that can occur with social comparison bias is the mental disorder of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].  Depression is typically diagnosed during a clinical encounter using the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] volume IV (DSM-IV) criteria.  Symptoms include depressed mood, [[hope]]lessness, and [[Sleep disorder|sleep difficulties]], including both [[hypersomnia]] and [[insomnia]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309–323}}  Clinical depression can be caused by many factors in a person's life.  Depression is the most common mental illness associated to social comparison bias.{{Sfn|Pyszczynski|Greenberg|1987|pp=122–138}}  Depression has a biological explanation to why people lose hope in life.  It is caused by the brain because of the [[hippocampus]] decreasing in size and the lowering levels of [[serotonin]] that circulates through the brain.{{Sfn|Nolen-Hoeksema|Morrow|1993|pp=561–570}}  Another negative symptom that is associated to social comparison bias is [[suicide ideation]].  "Suicide ideation can be defined as the constant thoughts about [[suicide]] and suicide attempts.  Suicide is the taking of one's own life."{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569–575}}  Suicide ideation can occur due to social comparison bias because people that compare themselves to people that are seen better than themselves get mentally discouraged because they believe they can not perform or look a certain way which causes low self-esteem.  Low self-esteem is one of the main factors in suicide ideation.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97–101}}

==In the media==
[[Mainstream media]] is also a main contributor to social comparisons.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73–81}} Everywhere one goes, advertisements try to portray to the public what [[beauty]] should be. Magazines, commercials and billboards all show what beauty is supposed to look like. When a growing generation of youth and adults see this, they socially compare themselves to the advertisements they see all around them.&lt;ref name="Wood 1989"&gt;Wood V. J. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; When they do not look a certain way or weigh a certain amount, society puts them down for it. This can cause low self-esteem and an onset of depression because they do not fit the mold of what beauty is seen to be.{{Sfn|Richins|1991|pp=73–81}} People get criticized when they do not look like the models in the magazine or on TV. Socially comparing oneself to the people in the media can have negative effects and cause mental anxiety, stress, negative body image and eating disorders.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}} With media being such an important part of our generation, having low self-esteems and negative self-images of ourselves effects society with tragic incidents including suicide and [[self-harm]].  Social comparison to others whether on TV and magazines can cause people to lose confidence in themselves and stress over trying to be perfect and be what society expects them to be.  In an experiment that studied women's body image after comparing themselves to different types of models, body image was significantly more negative after viewing thin media images than after viewing images of either average-size models, or plus-size models.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}} [[Mass media|Media]] is one of the leading causes for bad body image among youth and adults because of social comparison.{{Sfn|Menon|Kyung|Agrawal|2008|pp=39–52}}

===Through social media===
[[Social media]] being a main source of news and breaking new stories, people can connect to people from all over the world and learn in new ways.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}}  It is easier to see people's private life on a public network.  This being said, social networks such as [[Facebook]] makes viewing someone's daily life as simple as sending a request.  Society is exposed to everyone's lives and people are starting to compare themselves with their friends that they have on Facebook.  It is easy to log in and see someone brag about their success or their new belongings and feel bad about yourself.  In recent studies, researchers have been linking Facebook with depression in this generation of social media.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59–68}}  They may start to have low self-esteem by seeing their friends online have more exciting lives and more popularity. This social comparison bias among social network users online can make people start to think of their lives as not as fulfilling as they want to be. They see pictures or statuses about job promotions or new jobs, vacations; new relationships, fun outings or even those that can afford nice things. This can cognitively affect people's [[self-esteem]] and cause depression.{{Sfn|Pappas|2012}} They can start to feel bad about their appearance and their life in general. Social media influences the number of social comparisons people have.{{Sfn|Kendler|Karkowski-Shuman|1997|pp=539–547}} One study found that the more time users spend on Facebook each week, the more likely they are to think that others were happier and having better lives than they themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hui-Tzu Grace Chou and Nicholas Edge. Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. February 2012, 15(2): 117-121. doi:10.1089/cyber.2011.0324.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social comparison bias in the classroom==
Social comparisons are also very important in the school system.  Students depending on their grade level are very [[Competitiveness|competitive]] about the grades they receive compared to their peers.  Social comparisons not only influence students' self-concepts but also improve their performance.&lt;ref name="Möoller 2006"&gt;Möoller 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  This social comparison process leads to a lower self-concept when the class level is high and to a higher self-concept when the class level is low.&lt;ref name="Möoller 2006" /&gt;  Therefore, two students with equal performance in a domain may develop different [[self-concept]]s when they belong to different classes with different performance levels.&lt;ref name="Wood 1989" /&gt;  Social comparisons are important and valid predictors of students' self-evaluations and achievement behavior.  Students may feel jealousy or [[competitiveness]] when it comes to grades and getting into better colleges and universities than their peers.  Social comparison can also motivate students to do well because they want to keep along with their peers.

==Conclusion==
{{POV section|date=June 2016}}
Social comparison bias can occur in people's everyday life.  Whether it is on social networking sites, in the media, in society regarding wealth and [[social status]] or in the school system.  It can be negative to one's mental health due to the increasing risks of depression, suicide ideation and other mental disorders.{{Sfn|Kendler|1995|pp=5–9}}  Social comparison in this generation is everywhere and society revolves around comparing ourselves to each other if it is to have a higher self-esteem or to try and better themselves as a whole.  With social comparison being so important, it will lead to social comparison bias and cause negative effects in a person's life.  With the research found, the hypothesis was proven correct stating that depression does have a relationship with the social comparison that people in society participate in.

The societal [[Impact of nanotechnology|impact]] of [[nanotechnology]] are the potential benefits and challenges that the introduction of novel nanotechnological devices and materials may hold for [[society]] and human interaction.  The term is sometimes expanded to also include nanotechnology's [[Health impact of nanotechnology|health]] and [[Environmental impact of nanotechnology|environmental impact]], but this article will only consider the social and political impact of nanotechnology.

As nanotechnology is an emerging field and most of its applications are still speculative, there is much debate about what positive and negative effects that nanotechnology might have.

==Overview==
Beyond the toxicity risks to human health and the environment which are associated with first-generation nanomaterials, nanotechnology has broader societal implications and poses broader social challenges. Social scientists have suggested that nanotechnology's social issues should be understood and assessed not simply as "downstream" risks or impacts.  Rather, the challenges should be factored into "upstream" research and decision making in order to ensure technology development that meets social objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Kearnes| first =Matthew| last2 =Grove-White| first2 =Robin| last3 =Macnaghten|first3 =Phil|last4 =Wilsdon|first4 =James|last5 =Wynne|first5=Brian |publication-date = December 2006| title =From Bio to Nano: Learning Lessons from the UK Agricultural Biotechnology Controversy| volume =15| issue= 4| series =Science as Culture| publisher = Routledge| doi =10.1080/09505430601022619| pages= 291–307| url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content?content=10.1080/09505430601022619 |accessdate =2007-10-19| year =2006| journal =Science as Culture| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many social scientists and organizations in civil society suggest that [[technology assessment]] and governance should also involve public participation&lt;ref&gt;[http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/docs/nano%20project%20sci%20com%20proofs%20nov05.pdf] Nanotechnology,
Governance, and Public Deliberation: What Role for the Social Sciences? - (Science Communication Volume 27 Number 2 December 2005 1-24 © 2005 Sage Publications 10.1177/1075547005281531)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanolabweb.com/index.cfm/action/main.default.viewArticle/articleID/135/CFID/60255/CFTOKEN/45212442/ Nanotechnology Law &amp; Business]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sshl/pdf/CSDBUlletinMohr.pdf] - The Royal Society Report on Nanotechnology and Related Debates in 
the UK: a Participatory Governance Perspective Alison Mohr - Research Fellow )Centre for the Study of Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale Demos | Publications | Governing at the Nanoscale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214083000/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers suggest that nanotechnology will build incrementally, as did the 18-19th century [[industrial revolution]], until it gathers pace to drive a nanotechnological revolution that will radically reshape our economies, our labor markets, international trade, international relations, social structures, civil liberties, our relationship with the natural world and even what we understand to be human. Others suggest that it may be more accurate to describe change driven by nanotechnology as a “technological [[tsunami]]”. Just like a tsunami, analysts warn that rapid nanotechnology-driven change will necessarily have profound disruptive impacts. As the APEC Center for Technology Foresight observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If nanotechnology is going to revolutionize manufacturing, health care, energy supply, communications and probably defense, then it will transform labour and the workplace, the medical system, the transportation and power infrastructures and the military. None of these latter will be changed without significant social disruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819180108/http://www.apecforesight.org/php/publication/download1.php?pub_id=5 Publication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those concerned with the negative impact of nanotechnology suggest that it will simply exacerbate problems stemming from existing socio-economic inequity and unequal distributions of power, creating greater inequities between rich and poor through an inevitable nano-divide (the gap between those who control the new nanotechnologies and those whose products, services or labour are displaced by them). Analysts suggest the possibility that nanotechnology has the potential to destabilize international relations through a nano arms race and the increased potential for [[bioweapon]]ry; thus, providing the tools for ubiquitous surveillance with significant implications for [[civil liberties]]. Also, many critics believe it might break down the barriers between life and non-life through [[nanobiotechnology]], redefining even what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etcgroup.org/en/materials/publications.html?pub_id=104 ETC Group - Publications - The Little Big Down: A Small Introduction to Nano-scale Technologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nano.foe.org.au/node/168{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanoethicists posit that such a transformative technology could exacerbate the divisions of rich and poor – the so-called “nano divide.” However nanotechnology makes the production of technology, e.g. computers, cellular phones, health technology etcetera, cheaper and therefore accessible to the poor.

In fact, many of the most enthusiastic proponents of nanotechnology, such as transhumanists, see the nascent science as a mechanism to changing human nature itself – going beyond curing disease and enhancing human characteristics.  Discussions on nanoethics have been hosted by the federal government, especially in the context of “converging technologies” – a catch-phrase used to refer to nano, biotech, information technology, and cognitive science.

==Possible military applications==
Possible military applications of nanotechnology have been suggested in the fields of soldier enhancement ([http://web.mit.edu/ISN/]) and chemical weapons amongst others. However, more socially disruptive weapon systems are to be expected from [[molecular manufacturing]], a potential future form of nanotechnology that would make it possible to build complex structures at atomic precision.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426045511/http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but its supporters posit that once achieved it could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories weighing a kilogram or more.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Phoenix|author2=Mike Treder|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global catastrophic risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-857050-9|chapter=Chapter 21: Nanotechnology as global catastrophic risk}}&lt;/ref&gt; If nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Molecular manufacturing might be used to cheaply produce, among many other products, highly advanced, durable weapons. Being equipped with compact computers and motors these might be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder from the [[Center for Responsible Nanotechnology]] as well as Anders Sandberg from the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] the military uses of molecular manufacturing are the applications of nanotechnology that pose the most significant [[global catastrophic risk]].&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sandberg xrisk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandberg|first1=Anders|title=The five biggest threats to human existence|url=http://theconversation.com/the-five-biggest-threats-to-human-existence-27053|website=http://theconversation.com/|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nanotechnology researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sandberg xrisk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=A Dialog on Dangers|url=http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background3.html#DangerDialog|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing might be cheap and easy to hide;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION  (Chapter 11)|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html|website=http://e-drexler.com/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade,&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; a potential peace-promoting factor;&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Democracy_trade_and_social_stability|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5) [[wars of aggression]] may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Self-regulation by all state and non-state actors has been called hard to achieve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; so measures to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been proposed in the area of [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]].&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Need for International Control|url=http://www.crnano.org/int_control.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level.

==Intellectual property issues==
On the structural level, critics of nanotechnology point to a new world of ownership and [[corporation|corporate]] control opened up by nanotechnology. The claim is that, just as [[biotechnology]]'s ability to manipulate [[gene]]s went hand in hand with the [[patent]]ing of life, so too nanotechnology's ability to manipulate molecules has led to the patenting of matter. The last few years has seen a gold rush to claim patents at the nanoscale. Academics have warned that the resultant [[patent thicket]] is harming progress in the technology &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = | title = Open-source nanotechnology: Solutions to a modern intellectual property tragedy | url = | journal = Nano Today | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 339–341 | doi = 10.1016/j.nantod.2013.04.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Usman Mushtaq and Joshua M.

Corporations are already taking out broad-ranging patents on nanoscale discoveries and inventions. For example, two corporations, [[NEC]] and [[IBM]], hold the basic patents on [[carbon nanotube]]s, one of the current cornerstones of nanotechnology. Carbon nanotubes have a wide range of uses, and look set to become crucial to several industries from electronics and computers, to strengthened materials to drug delivery and diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes are poised to become a major traded commodity with the potential to replace major conventional raw materials. However, as their use expands, anyone seeking to (legally) manufacture or sell carbon nanotubes, no matter what the application, must first buy a license from NEC or IBM. [http://www.azonano.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1383][https://web.archive.org/web/20070929060604/http://www.ipr-nec.com/system/en/infolistcat/120/1/0/]

The United States' [[essential facilities doctrine]] may be of importance as well as other anti-trust laws.

==Potential benefits and risks for developing countries==
Nanotechnologies may provide new solutions for the millions of people in [[developing countries]] who lack access to basic services, such as safe water, reliable energy, health care, and education.  The [[United Nations]] has set [[Millennium Development Goals]] for meeting these needs.  The 2004 [[United Nations|UN]] Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation noted that some of the advantages of nanotechnology include production using little labor, land, or maintenance, high productivity, low cost, and modest requirements for materials and energy.

Many developing countries, for example Costa Rica, Chile, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia, are investing considerable resources in research and development of nanotechnologies.  Emerging economies such as Brazil, China, India and South Africa are spending millions of US dollars annually on R&amp;D, and are rapidly increasing their scientific output as demonstrated by their increasing numbers of publications in peer-reviewed scientific publications.

Potential opportunities of nanotechnologies to help address critical international development priorities include improved [[water purification]] systems, [[energy management systems|energy systems]], [[pharmaceutical technology|medicine and pharmaceuticals]], [[food production]] and nutrition, and [[information technology|information and communications technologies]].  Nanotechnologies are already incorporated in products that are on the market. Other nanotechnologies are still in the research phase, while others are concepts that are years or decades away from development.

Applying nanotechnologies in developing countries raises similar questions about the environmental, health, and societal risks described in the previous section.  Additional challenges have been raised regarding the linkages between nanotechnology and development.

Protection of the environment, human health and worker safety in developing countries often suffers from a combination of factors that can include but are not limited to lack of robust environmental, human health, and worker safety regulations; poorly or unenforced regulation which is linked to a lack of physical (e.g., equipment) and human capacity (i.e., properly trained regulatory staff).  Often, these nations require assistance, particularly financial assistance, to develop the scientific and institutional capacity to adequately assess and manage risks, including the necessary infrastructure such as laboratories and technology for detection.

Very little is known about the risks and broader impacts of nanotechnology.  At a time of great uncertainty over the impacts of nanotechnology it will be challenging for governments, companies, civil society organizations, and the general public in developing countries, as in developed countries, to make decisions about the governance of nanotechnology.

Companies, and to a lesser extent governments and universities, are receiving patents on nanotechnology.  The rapid increase in patenting of nanotechnology is illustrated by the fact that in the US, there were 500 nanotechnology patent applications in 1998 and 1,300 in 2000.  Some patents are very broadly defined, which has raised concern among some groups that the rush to patent could slow innovation and drive up costs of products, thus reducing the potential for innovations that could benefit low income populations in developing countries.

There is a clear link between commodities and poverty. Many least developed countries are dependent on a few commodities for employment, government revenue, and export earnings. Many applications of nanotechnology are being developed that could impact global demand for specific commodities.  For instance, certain nanoscale materials could enhance the strength and durability of [[rubber]], which might eventually lead to a decrease in demand for [[natural rubber]].  Other nanotechnology applications may result in increases in demand for certain commodities. For example, demand for [[titanium]] may increase as a result of new uses for nanoscale [[titanium dioxide|titanium oxides]], such as [[titanium dioxide]] nanotubes that can be used to produce and store hydrogen for use as fuel.  Various organizations have called for international dialogue on mechanisms that will allow developing countries to anticipate and proactively adjust to these changes.

In 2003, [http://www.merid.org/ Meridian Institute] began the [http://www.merid.org/nano Global Dialogue on Nanotechnology and the Poor: Opportunities and Risks (GDNP)] to raise awareness of the opportunities and risks of nanotechnology for [[developing countries]], close the gaps within and between sectors of society to catalyze actions that address specific opportunities and risks of nanotechnology for developing countries, and identify ways that science and technology can play an appropriate role in the development process.  The GDNP has released several publicly accessible papers on nanotechnology and development, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110116/http://www.meridian-nano.org/gdnp/paper.php "Nanotechnology and the Poor: Opportunities and Risks - Closing the Gaps Within and Between Sectors of Society"]; [http://www.merid.org/nano/waterpaper/ "Nanotechnology, Water, and Development"]; and [http://www.merid.org/nano/watertechpaper/ "Overview and Comparison of Conventional and Nano-Based Water Treatment Technologies"].

===Social justice and civil liberties===
Concerns are frequently raised that the claimed benefits of nanotechnology will not be evenly distributed, and that any benefits (including technical and/or economic) associated with nanotechnology will only reach affluent nations.&lt;ref name="South"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Invernizzi N, Foladori G and Maclurcan D |title=Nanotechnology's Controversial Role for the South |journal=Science Technology and Society |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=123–148 |year= 2008 |doi=10.1177/097172180701300105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of nanotechnology research and development - and patents for nanomaterials and products - is concentrated in developed countries (including the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada and France). In addition, most patents related to nanotechnology are concentrated amongst few multinational corporations, including IBM, Micron Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=Nanotech's "Second Nature" Patents: Implications for the Global South, Communiques No. 87 and 88, March/April and May June |publisher=ETC Group |year=2005 |url=http://www.etcgroup.org/documents/Com8788SpecialPNanoMar-June05ENG.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to fears that it will be unlikely that developing countries will have access to the infrastructure, funding and human resources required to support nanotechnology research and development, and that this is likely to exacerbate such inequalities.

Producers in developing countries could also be disadvantaged by the replacement of natural products (including rubber, cotton, coffee and tea) by developments in nanotechnology. These natural products are important export crops for developing countries, and many farmers' livelihoods depend on them. It has been argued that their substitution with industrial nano-products could negatively impact the economies of developing countries, that have traditionally relied on these export crops.&lt;ref name="South" /&gt;

It is proposed that nanotechnology can only be effective in alleviating poverty and aid development "when adapted to social, cultural and local institutional contexts, and chosen and designed with the active participation by citizens right from the commencement point" (Invernizzi et al. 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;132).&lt;ref name="South" /&gt;

== Effects on laborers ==
[[Ray Kurzweil]] has speculated in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' that [[Laborer|people who work in unskilled labor jobs for a livelihood]] may become the first human workers to be displaced by the constant use of nanotechnology in the [[Employment|workplace]], noting that layoffs often affect the jobs based around the lowest technology level before attacking jobs with the highest technology level possible.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"&gt;{{cite book

  |first = Raymond
  |authorlink = Raymond Kurzweil
  |title = The Singularity is Near
  |publisher = [[Penguin Books]]
  |year = 2005
  |isbn = 0-14-303788-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been noted that every major economic era has stimulated a global revolution both in the kinds of jobs that are available to people and the kind of training they need to achieve these jobs, and there is concern that the world's educational systems have lagged behind in preparing students for the "Nanotech Age".&lt;ref name="prweb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/08/prweb426596.htm| title = Learning to Work in the Nanotech Age| publisher = PR Web | date = 2006-08-22| accessdate = 2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been speculated that nanotechnology may give rise to [[Molecular assembler|nanofactories]] which may have superior capabilities to conventional [[factory|factories]] due to their small carbon and physical footprint on the global and regional environment.  The [[miniaturization]] and transformation of the multi-acre conventional factory into the nanofactory may not interfere with their ability to deliver a high quality product; the product may be of even greater quality due to the lack of human errors in the production stages. Nanofactory systems may use precise atomic precisioning and contribute to making superior quality products that the "[[Bulk material handling|bulk]] [[chemistry]]" method used in 20th century and early 21st currently cannot produce.  These advances might shift the computerized workforce in an even more complex direction, requiring skills in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics.&lt;ref name="nanofactory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-nanofactory.htm| title = Nanofactory information | publisher = Wise Geek | accessdate = 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crnano.org/products.htm| title = Nanotechnology: Products of Molecular Engineering| publisher = Center for Responsible Nanotechnology | accessdate = 2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">In mathematics, a [[sequence]] { ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' }, ''n'' ≥ 1, is called '''superadditive''' if it satisfies the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]

: &lt;math&gt;a_{n+m} \geq a_n+a_m&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''m'' and ''n''.  The major reason for the use of superadditive sequences is the following [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] due to [[Michael Fekete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fekete |first=M. |title=Über die Verteilung der Wurzeln bei gewissen algebraischen Gleichungen mit ganzzahligen Koeffizienten |journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift |volume=17 |issue=1 |year=1923 |pages=228–249 |doi=10.1007/BF01504345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lemma:''' (Fekete) For every superadditive sequence { ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' }, ''n'' ≥ 1, the limit lim ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''/''n'' exists and is equal to sup ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''/''n''.  (The limit may be positive infinity, for instance, for the sequence ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = log&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.)

Similarly, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is ''superadditive'' if

: &lt;math&gt;f(x+y) \geq f(x)+f(y)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''f''.

For example, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; is a superadditive function for nonnegative real numbers because the square of &lt;math&gt;(x+y)&lt;/math&gt; is always greater than or equal to the square of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; plus the square of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, for nonnegative real numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

The analogue of Fekete's lemma holds for subadditive functions as well.
There are extensions of Fekete's lemma that do not require the definition of superadditivity above to hold for all ''m'' and ''n''.  There are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of convergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete's lemma if some kind of both superadditivity and [[subadditivity]] is present. A good exposition of this topic may be found in Steele (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael J. Steele|title=Probability theory and combinatorial optimization|publisher=SIAM, Philadelphia|year=1997|isbn=0-89871-380-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author=Michael J. Steele|title=CBMS Lectures on Probability Theory and Combinatorial Optimization|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=2011|url=http://sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/1189351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''f'' is a superadditive function, and if 0 is in its domain, then ''f''(0) ≤ 0. To see this, take the inequality at the top. &lt;math&gt;f(x) \le f(x+y) - f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;f(0) \le f(0+y) - f(y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The negative of a superadditive function is [[subadditivity|subadditive]].

== Examples of superadditive functions ==
* The determinant is superadditive for nonnegative Hermitian matrices, i.e., If &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\text{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative Hermitian then &lt;math&gt;\det(A+B)\geq\det(A)+\det(B)&lt;/math&gt;.
This follows from the Minkowski determinant theorem, which more generally states that &lt;math&gt; \det(\cdot)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt; is superadditive (equivalently, concave)&lt;ref&gt;M. Marcus, H. Minc (1992). [https://books.google.pt/books?id=hLHKwSNqLOcC ''A survey in matrix theory and matrix inequalities'']. Dover. Theorem 4.1.8, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt; for nonnegative Hermitian matrices of size ''n'': If &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\text{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative Hermitian then &lt;math&gt;\det(A+B)^{1/n}\geq\det(A)^{1/n}+\det(B)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Mutual information]]. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[That is not true! This is NOT superadditive (e.g. Nielsen, Chuang)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
* Horst Alzer proved &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Horst Alzer|title=A superadditive property of Hadamard's gamma function| publisher=Springer|year=2009| doi=10.1007/s12188-008-0009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Hadamard's gamma function]] H(''x'') is superadditive for all real numbers ''x'',''y'' with ''x'', ''y'' &amp;ge; 1.5031.

'''The KLF''' (also known as '''the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu''', '''The JAMs''', '''the Timelords''' and other names) are a British [[electronic music|electronic]] band started in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;IMO Records. [https://archive.is/20120802004439/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/house-2/house-artists/klf-biography/ "The KLF Biography"], ''[[IMO Records]]' Retrieved on 29 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] (alias King Boy D) and [[Jimmy Cauty]] (alias Rockman Rock) released [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired and [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy records as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, and on one occasion (the British number one hit [[single (music)|single]] "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]") as the Timelords. The KLF released a series of international hits on their own KLF Communications record label and became the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;Bush, J., KLF biography, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4694/biography|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; The duo also published a book, ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', and worked on a road movie called ''[[The White Room (film)|The White Room]]''.

From the outset, they adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novel series ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', making [[anarchism|anarchic]] [[Situationist International|situationist]] manifestations, including the [[vandalism|defacement]] of billboard adverts, the posting of cryptic advertisements in ''[[NME]]'' magazine and the mainstream press, and unusual performances on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. In collaboration with [[Extreme Noise Terror]] at the February 1992 [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]], they fired [[machine gun]] [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. After this performance the duo departed the music business and, in May 1992, [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] their entire back catalogue.

With the KLF's profits, Drummond and Cauty established the [[K Foundation]] and sought to subvert the [[art world]], staging an [[K Foundation art award|alternative art award]] for the worst artist of the year and [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burning one million pounds sterling]]. The KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the UK, but ''[[The White Room]]'' is still being pressed in the US by [[Arista Records|Arista]]. They have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, [[the One World Orchestra]] and most recently, in 1997, as [[Fuck the Millennium|2K]].

==History==

In 1986, Bill Drummond was an established figure within the British [[music industry]], having co-founded [[Zoo Records]],&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up And Start Again: Post-punk 1978–1984'', {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; played guitar in the [[Liverpool]] band [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;"Big in Japan&amp;nbsp;– Where are they now?", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', January 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=271 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112152/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=271 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as manager of [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]] and [[the Teardrop Explodes]].&lt;ref name="TateTat"&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 20 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150534/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 |date=4 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July he resigned from his position as an [[A&amp;R]] man at record label [[Warner Music Group|WEA]], citing that he was nearly 33⅓ years old (33⅓ [[revolutions per minute]] being the speed at which a [[gramophone record|vinyl LP]] revolves), and that it was "time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top".&lt;ref name="specialk"&gt;"Special K", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' magazine (April 1995), quoting "a ringingly quixotic press release" issued by Drummond in 1986 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115215/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; He released a solo LP, ''[[The Man (Bill Drummond album)|The Man]]'', judged by reviewers as "tastefully understated,"&lt;ref name="Trouserpress"&gt;[[Ira Robbins|Robbins, I.]], "KLF", ''[[Trouser Press]]'' magazine ([http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305015031/http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf |date=5 March 2016 }}).

Artist and musician Jimmy Cauty was the guitarist in the three-piece [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]]&lt;ref name="Trouserpress"/&gt;—an act that Drummond had signed to WEA Records and managed.&lt;ref name="BrilliantAMG"&gt;LeRoy, D., Brilliant biography, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p22681|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; Cauty and Drummond shared an interest in the esoteric conspiracy novels ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' and, in particular, their theme of [[Discordianism]], a form of post-modern anarchism. As an art student in Liverpool, Drummond had been involved with the set design for the first stage production of ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy'', a 12-hour performance which opened in Liverpool on 23 November 1976.&lt;ref&gt;The production was staged by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]]'s "Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool". [[Ian Broudie]] recalled meeting Drummond during the period of time that the play was staged, in a January 1997 interview with ''[[Mixmag]]'' ({{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id%3D433 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916110721/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=433 |archivedate=16 September 2016 |df=dmy }}).

Re-reading ''Illuminatus!'' in late 1986, and influenced by hip-hop, Drummond felt inspired to react against what he perceived to be the stagnant soundscape of popular music. Recalling that moment in a later radio interview, Drummond said that the plan came to him in an instant: he would form a hip-hop band with former colleague Jimmy Cauty, and they would be called the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu.

{{quote|It was New Year's Day ... 1987. I was at home with my parents, I was going for a walk in the morning, it was, like, bright blue sky, and I thought "I'm going to make a hip-hop record. Who can I make a hip-hop record with?". I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself, 'cause, although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [Jimmy], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said "Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu". And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, "where I was coming from". And within a week we had recorded our first single which was called "All You Need Is Love".|&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story Of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond.

===The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu===
Early in 1987, Drummond and Cauty's collaborations began. They assumed alter egos&amp;nbsp;– King Boy D and Rockman Rock respectively&amp;nbsp;– and adopted the name the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (the JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group "The Justified Ancients of Mummu" from ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''. The JAMs' primary instrument was the [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital sampler]] with which they would [[plagiarism|plagiarise]] the history of popular music, cutting chunks from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, underpinned by rudimentary [[beatboxing|beatbox]] rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's [[rapping|raps]], of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery.

The JAMs' debut studio single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" dealt with the media coverage given to [[AIDS]], sampling heavily from [[the Beatles]]' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" and [[Samantha Fox]]'s "[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided [[white label]] 12" were sent to the [[music journalism|music press]]; it received positive reviews and was made "single of the week" in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"All You Need Is Love" review, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 14 March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=20 link])--&gt; A later piece in the same magazine called the JAMs "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year&amp;nbsp;.... It's hard to understand what it feels like to come across something you believe to be totally new; I have never been so wholeheartedly convinced that a band are so good and exciting."&lt;ref name="Sounds16May"&gt;"The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 16 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JAMs re-edited and re-released "All You Need Is Love" in May 1987, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples; lyrics from the song appeared as promotional [[graffiti]], defacing selected billboards. The re-release rewarded the JAMs with praise (including ''NME''´s "single of the week")&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D., "All You Need Is Love" review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 23 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=33 link])--&gt; and the funds necessary to record their debut album. The album, ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'', was released in June 1987. Included was a song called "The Queen and I", which sampled the [[ABBA]] single "[[Dancing Queen]]".&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;"The KLF Biography", KLF BIOG 012, KLF Communications, December 1990([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=512 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113659/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=512 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; After a legal showdown with ABBA&lt;ref&gt;Didcock, Barry, "Bitter Swede symphony", ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' ([[Glasgow]]), 21 October 2001, p4.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]],&lt;ref&gt;News item, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 12 September 1987&lt;/ref&gt; the ''1987'' album was forcibly withdrawn from sale. Drummond and Cauty travelled to Sweden in hope of meeting ABBA and coming to some agreement, taking an ''NME'' journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP.&lt;ref name=sweden87&gt;[[James Brown (editor)|Brown, J.]], "Thank You For The Music", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 17 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; They failed to meet ABBA, so disposed of the copies by burning most of them in a field and throwing the rest overboard on the [[North Sea]] ferry trip home. In a December 1987 interview, Cauty maintained that they "felt that what [they]'d done was artistically justified."&lt;ref name = "tune"/&gt;

Two new singles followed on The JAMs' "KLF Communications" independent record label. Both reflected a shift towards [[house music|house]] rhythms. According to ''NME'', The JAMs' choice of samples for the first of these, "[[Whitney Joins The JAMs]]" saw them leaving behind their strategy of "collision course" to "move straight onto the art of super selective theft".&lt;ref&gt;"Whitney Joins The JAMs" review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The song uses samples of the ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' themes alongside [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)|I Wanna Dance With Somebody]]". Drummond has claimed that the KLF were later offered the job of producing or remixing a new Whitney Houston album as an inducement from her record label boss ([[Clive Davis]] of [[Arista Records]]) to sign with them.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;Interview with Bill Drummond by Ernie Longmire, "KLF Is Going to Rock You" ''X Magazine'', July 1991 ([https://archive.is/20120708094940/http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bomlagadafshipoing"&gt;Transcript of a Bill Drummond interview on "Bomlagadafshipoing" (Norwegian national radio house-music show), September 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150538/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521 |date=4 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"JAMs turn down Whitney", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 November 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=261 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011154837/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=261 |date=11 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The second single in this sequence&amp;nbsp;– Drummond and Cauty's third and final single of 1987&amp;nbsp;– was "[[Down Town]]", a dance record built around a [[gospel choir]] and "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" by 1960s star [[Petula Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by ''[[NME]]'' writer [[James Brown (editor)|James Brown]] in the 28 November 1987 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; These early works were later collected on the compilation album ''[[Shag Times]]''.

A second album, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', was released in early 1988. ''Who Killed The JAMs?'' earned the duo a five-star review from ''Sounds'' Magazine, who called it "a masterpiece of pathos".&lt;ref&gt;"Who Killed The JAMs?" review, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Timelords===&lt;!-- there are section links to this header --&gt;
In 1988, Drummond and Cauty became "Time Boy" and "Lord Rock", and released a '[[novelty song|novelty]]' pop single, "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" as The Timelords. The song is predominantly a [[mashup (music)|mash-up]] of the [[Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme music]], "[[Block Buster!]]" by [[The Sweet|Sweet]] and [[Gary Glitter]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll (Part Two)]]".

Also credited on the record was "Ford Timelord", Cauty's 1968 [[Ford Galaxie]] American police car (claimed to have been used in the film ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace|Superman IV]]'' filmed in the UK). Drummond and Cauty declared that the car had spoken to them, giving its name as Ford Timelord, and advising the duo to become "The Timelords".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/style-icons-h-p-baxxter-on-the-klf/ |title=''Style Icons: H.P. Baxxter on The KLF'' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013 |website=electronicbeats.net |publisher=''Electronic Beats'' |access-date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Cauty later portrayed the song as the result of a deliberate effort to write a number one hit single. In interviews with [[Snub TV]] and [[BBC Radio 1]],&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;Bill Drummond interviewed by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on ''Saturday Sequence'', [[BBC Radio 1]], December 1990 ([http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 MP3]) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524180959/http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 |date=24 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond said that they had intended to make a house record using the ''Doctor Who'' theme. After Cauty had laid down a basic track, Drummond observed that their house idea wasn't working and what they actually had was a [[Gary Glitter|Glitter beat]]. Sensing the opportunity to make a commercial pop record they went instead for the lowest common denominator. According to the British music press, the result was "rancid",&lt;ref name="sounds-timelords"&gt;Wilkinson, R., "...Ford Every Scheme", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 28 May 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=81 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112637/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=81 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; "pure, unadulterated agony" and "excruciating"&lt;ref&gt;,"Doctorin' the Tardis" review, ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 28 May 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=78 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112326/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=78 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; and from ''Sounds'' "a record so noxious that a top ten place can be its only destiny".&lt;ref name="sounds-timelords"/&gt; The record sold over one million copies.&lt;ref name="select92"&gt;"Who Killed The KLF?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', July 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011034454/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315 |date=11 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; A single of The Timelords' [[remix]]es of the song was released: "Gary Joins The JAMs" featured original vocal contributions from Glitter, who also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to promote the song with The Timelords.

The Timelords released one other product, a 1989 book called ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', a step-by-step guide to achieving a number one hit single with little money or talent.

===The KLF===
By the time the JAMs' single "Whitney Joins The JAMs" was released in September 1987, their record label had been renamed "KLF Communications" (from the earlier "The Sound of Mu(sic)"). The duo's first release as the KLF was in March 1988, with the single "[[Burn the Bastards|Burn the Bastards"/"Burn the Beat]]" (KLF 002). Although the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was not yet retired, most future Drummond and Cauty releases went under the name "The KLF".

The name change accompanied a change in Drummond and Cauty's musical direction. As 'King Boy D', Drummond said in January 1988, "We might put out a couple of 12" records under the name The K.L.F., these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers". King Boy D also said that he and Rockman Rock were "pissed off at [them]selves" for letting "people expect us to lead some sort of crusade for sampling".&lt;ref name="info88"&gt;Drummond, B., KLF Communications Info Sheet, 22 January 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=501 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011172329/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=501 |date=11 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he recalled that "We wanted to make [as the KLF] something that was ... pure dance music, without any reference points, without any nod to the history of rock and roll. It was the type of music that by early '87 was really exciting ''me''&amp;nbsp;... [although] we weren't able to get our first KLF records out until late '88".&lt;ref name="skinner"/&gt;

The 12" records subsequently released in 1988 and 1989 by the KLF were indeed rap free and house-oriented; remixes of some of the JAMs tracks, and new singles, the largely instrumental [[acid house]] anthems "[[What Time Is Love?]]" and "[[3 a.m. Eternal]]", the first incarnations of later international chart successes. The KLF described &lt;!--the sound of --&gt;these new tracks as "Pure Trance". In 1989, the KLF appeared at the [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter rave]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. "They wooed the crowd", wrote ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' some years later, "by pelting them with&amp;nbsp;... £1,000 worth of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|Scottish pound notes]], each of which bore the message 'Children we love you{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rimmer, L., "T in the Park: Greatest festival stories ever...", ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' ([[Edinburgh]]) {{ISSN|0955-8756}} , EG MAGAZINE Edition, 8 July 2001, p7. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpHFtHwo_4Q Video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418192720/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpHFtHwo_4Q |date=18 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1989, the KLF embarked upon the creation of a [[road movie]] and [[soundtrack album]], both titled ''[[The KLF films|The White Room]]'', funded by the profits of "Doctorin' The Tardis".&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, C. "Beam Me Up, Scotty&amp;nbsp;– How to have a number one (The JAMs way)", ''Offbeat'' Magazine, February 1989 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=94 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113953/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=94 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the film nor its soundtrack were formally released, although [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies exist. The soundtrack album contained pop-house versions of some of the "pure trance" singles, as well as new songs, most of which would appear (in radically reworked form) on the version of the album which was eventually released to mainstream success. A single from the original album was released: "[[Kylie Said to Jason]]", an [[electropop]] record featuring references to [[Todd Terry]], [[Rolf Harris]], [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]] and BBC comedy programme ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]''. In reference to that song, Drummond and Cauty noted that they had worn "[[Pet Shop Boys]] infatuations brazenly on [their] sleeves".&lt;ref&gt;Sleevenotes, ''Indie Top 20 Volume 8'', published by Beechwood Music, catalogue number TT08, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film project was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. "Kylie Said to Jason", which Drummond and Cauty were hoping could "rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy", flopped commercially, failing even to make the UK top 100. In consequence, ''The White Room'' film project was put on hold, and the KLF abandoned the musical direction of the soundtrack and single.&lt;ref name="info8"&gt;KLF Communications, "Information Sheet Eight", August 1990 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=508 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011034421/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=508 |date=11 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, "What Time Is Love?" was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, "The KLF were being feted by all the 'right' DJs".&lt;ref name="info8" /&gt; This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their Pure Trance series. A further Pure Trance release, "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]", followed. At this time, Cauty had co-founded [[the Orb]] as an ambient side-project with [[Alex Paterson]].&lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby-The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]] |year=2003 |isbn= 1-58234-323-3 |pages = 407–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ambient album ''[[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]'' and the KLF's ambient video ''[[The KLF films|Waiting]]'' were also released in 1990, as was a dance track, "[[It's Grim Up North]]", under The JAMs' moniker.

The single, "What Time Is Love?", was released in August 1990. The follow-up, "3 a.m. Eternal", was released in January 1991. The album ''[[The White Room]]'' followed in March 1991.

The KLF's chart success continued with the single "Last Train to Trancentral" hitting number two in the UK, and number three in the [[Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;"History Rewritten: The KLF biography", sleevenotes, ''Mu'', [[EMI|EMI Japan]] TOCP-6916, October 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=520 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916111655/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=520 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1991, a re-working of a song from ''1987'', "[[Justified &amp; Ancient]]" was released, featuring [[Tammy Wynette]]. It was another international hit—peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100—as was "[[America: What Time Is Love?]]".

In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by [[Depeche Mode]] ("[[Policy of Truth]]"), [[the Moody Boys]] ("What Is Dub?"), and [[Pet Shop Boys]] ("So Hard" from the ''[[Behaviour (Pet Shop Boys album)|Behaviour]]'' album, and "It Must Be Obvious"). Pet Shop Boy [[Neil Tennant]] described the process: "When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I had to go and sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. I was impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough."&lt;ref name="psb"&gt;[[James Brown (editor)|Brown, J.]], "The Pet Shop Boys Versus The World", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 25 25 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- broken link: ([http://microsites.nme.com/petshopboys/site/versus.html link])--&gt;

After successive name changes and dance records, Drummond and Cauty ultimately became, as the KLF, the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991,&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TimelordsGentlemen"&gt;"Timelords gentlemen, please!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 May 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011034313/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309 |date=11 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; still incorporating the work of other artists but in less gratuitous ways and predominantly without legal problems.

===Retirement===
On 12 February 1992, the KLF and [[crust punk]] group [[Extreme Noise Terror]] performed a live version of "3 a.m. Eternal" at the [[BRIT Awards]], the [[British Phonographic Industry]]'s annual awards show; a "violently antagonistic performance" in front of "a stunned music-business audience".&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, N., "The Arts: My name is Bill, and I'm a popaholic", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), 2 March 2000, p27.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond and Cauty had planned to throw buckets of sheep's blood over the audience, but were prevented from doing so due to opposition from [[BBC]] lawyers&lt;ref&gt;"Brits behaving badly", BBC News Online, 4 March 2000 ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2000/brit_awards/665776.stm link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315065845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2000/brit_awards/665776.stm |date=15 March 2009 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baa"&gt;"Baa-nned!!

"Welcome To The Sheep Seats", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 29 February 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=297 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916111310/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=297 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was instead ended by a limping, [[kilt]]ed, cigar-chomping Drummond firing [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] from an automatic weapon over the heads of the crowd. As the band left the stage, the KLF's promoter and narrator [[Scott Piering]] proclaimed over the [[public address|PA]] system that "The KLF have now left the music business". Later in the evening the band dumped a dead sheep with the message "I died for you&amp;nbsp;– bon appetit" tied around its waist at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt;

Producer [[Trevor Horn]] is reported to have called their antics "disgusting".&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt; ''NME'', on the other hand, said that the KLF "stormed" the show and that after their performance the BRITs show went "downhill all the way".&lt;ref name="baa"/&gt;

[[Scott Piering]]'s announcement was largely ignored at the time. ''NME'', for example, assured their readers that the tensions and contradictions would continue to "push and spark" the KLF and that more "musical treasure" would be the result.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt;

In the weeks following the BRITs performance, the KLF continued working with Extreme Noise Terror on the album ''[[The Black Room (The KLF album)|The Black Room]]'',&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt; but it was never finished. On 14 May 1992, the KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the [[deletion (music industry)|deletion]] of their back catalogue:

{{quote|We have been following a wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path these past five years. The last two of which has [sic] led us up onto the commercial high ground — we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what. For the foreseeable future there will be no further record releases from The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords, The KLF and any other past, present and future name attached to our activities. As of now all our past releases are deleted&amp;nbsp;.... If we meet further along be prepared&amp;nbsp;... our disguise may be complete.&lt;ref name="TimelordsGentlemen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RetirementAd"&gt;KLF Communications advertisement in ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a comprehensive examination of the KLF's announcement and its context, ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' called it "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction in the history of pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt."&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt; Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I ''know'' they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it "Conceptually and philosophically&amp;nbsp;... absolutely brilliant". [[Mark Stent]] reported the doubts of many when he said that "I [have] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A&amp;R men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".

There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115215/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[1992] had been the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when the KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, (toy) machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony and dumped a sheep's carcass on the steps at the after-show party." Martin, G., "The Chronicled Mutineers", ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', December 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=430 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916120933/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=430 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond himself said that he was on the edge of the "abyss".&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Bill and Mark Manning, ''Bad Wisdom'' ({{ISBN|0-14-026118-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; BRIT Awards organiser [[Jonathan King]] had publicly endorsed the KLF's live performance, a response which Scott Piering cited as "the real low point".&lt;ref name="select92" /&gt; The KLF's BRITs statuette for "Best British Group" of 1992 was later found buried in a field near [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref&gt;"BRITs statuette dug up", ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, Feb 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=322 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114416/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=322 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===K Foundation and post-retirement projects===
{{Main|K Foundation|Fuck the Millennium}}
The [[K Foundation]] was an arts foundation established by Drummond and Cauty in 1993 following their 'retirement' from the music industry. From 1993 to 1995 they engaged in art projects and media campaigns, including the high-profile [[K Foundation art award]] (for the "worst artist of the year").&lt;ref&gt;"The Best Of Artists, The Worst of Artists", ''[[New York Times]]'', 29 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=366 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115344/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=366 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, M.

[[File:2K - Wheelchair.gif|thumb|left|The KLF come out of retirement for 23 minutes to make an appearance as 2K.]]
In 1995, Drummond and Cauty contributed a song to ''[[The Help Album]]'' as [[The One World Orchestra]] ("featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards").&lt;ref&gt;Discogs.com entry for "One World Orchestra, The" ([http://www.discogs.com/artist/One+World+Orchestra,+The discogs.com link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215081017/http://www.discogs.com/artist/One%2BWorld%2BOrchestra%2C%2BThe |date=15 February 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Magnificent (song)|The Magnificent]]" is a [[drum and bass|drum'n'bass]] version of the theme tune from ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', with vocal samples from [[Fleka|DJ Fleka]] of Serbian radio station [[B92]]: "Humans against killing... that sounds like a junkie against dope".

{{As of|2010}}, Drummond continues to work as a writer and conceptual artist, with occasional appearances on radio and television. Cauty has been involved in several post-KLF projects including the music and conceptual art collective [[Blacksmoke]] and, more recently, numerous creative projects with the aquarium and the L-13 Light Industrial Workshop based in Clerkenwell, London.

===KLF Communications===
[[Image:The KLF - Trancentral Logo.png|right|thumb|The KLF's 'Trancentral' logo: speakers arranged in a 'T' shape.]]
From their very earliest releases as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu until their [[The KLF#Retirement|retirement]] in 1992, the music of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty was [[independent record label|independently released]] in their home country (the UK).&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;KLF Communications profile at [[Discogs.com]] ([http://www.discogs.com/label/KLF+Communications link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615115823/http://www.discogs.com/label/KLF%2BCommunications |date=15 June 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Their debut releases—the single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" and the album ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)|1987]]''—were released under the label name "The Sound Of Mu(sic)". By the end of 1987 Drummond and Cauty had renamed their label to "KLF Communications" and, in October 1987, the first of many "information sheets" (self written missives from the KLF to fans and the media) was sent out by the label.&lt;ref name="Info1"/&gt;

KLF Communications releases were [[record distributor|distributed]] by [[Rough Trade Distribution]] (a spinoff of [[Rough Trade Records]]) in the South East of England, and across the wider UK by [[The Cartel (record distributor)|the Cartel]]. As Drummond and Cauty explained, "The Cartel is, as the name implies, a group of independent distributors across the country who work in conjunction with each other providing a solid network of distribution without stepping on each other's toes. We are distributed by the Cartel."&lt;ref name="the-manual"&gt;Drummond, B. &amp; Cauty, J.

Outside the UK, KLF releases were issued under licence by local labels. In the US, the licensees were [[Wax Trax]] (the ''[[Chill Out]]'' album&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allmusic]]'' review of ''Chill Out'' ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11084|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt;), [[TVT Records|TVT]] (early releases including ''[[The History of The JAMs a.k.a.

Drummond and Cauty also published a book under the imprint "KLF Publications" ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'' (ISBN 0-86359-616-9).

The duo [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] the entire KLF Communications catalogue upon their 1992 retirement from the music industry.&lt;ref name="TimeGents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RetirementAd"/&gt;--&gt;

On 5 January 2017, the ''Eastfolk Chronicle'' reported on the reunion of the duo; a poster in [[Hackney, London]] that was spotted by the newspaper's editor Cally Callomon, who is also manager for Drummond, with the heading "2017: What the Fuck Is Going On?", announced a return for the duo as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu on 23 August 2017, and asked those seeking further information to contact K2 Plant Hire Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doran|first1=John|title=KLF Announce Return After 23 Year Absence|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/21514-klf-jamms-to-return-slam-film|website=The Quietus|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; K2 has been registered in Drummond and Cauty's names at Companies House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03013255|title=K2 PLANT HIRE LIMITED - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 23 seconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41022272|title=The return of the band who burned £1m|date=23 August 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bidolito.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bidolito.co.uk/jams/|title=Welcome To The Dark Ages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superweirdsubstance.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superweirdsubstance.com/jams-klf-dark-ages/|title=Welcome To The Dark Ages: The JAMs Return - Super Weird Substance|date=30 August 2017|website=Superweirdsubstance.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; past midnight on 23 August, the KLF returned in an ice-cream van to a book signing in [[Liverpool]] of their new book ''2023: A Trilogy by the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu'', described as "a multi-layered, self-referential meta tale."&lt;ref name=gua2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=The return of the KLF: pop's greatest provocateurs take on a post-truth world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/23/klf-bill-drummond-jimmy-cauty-2023-book|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paterson|first1=Colin|title=The KLF return 23 years after bowing out of the music industry|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-41023934/the-klf-return-23-years-after-bowing-out-of-the-music-industry|website=BBC News|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the book signing, Cauty and Drummond staged three days of events along with 400 volunteers under the banner of "Welcome To The Dark Ages".&lt;ref name="bidolito.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="superweirdsubstance.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://welcometothedarkagespage130.com|title=The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu present Welcome To The Dark Ages by Page 130|website=The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu present Welcome To The Dark Ages by Page 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welcometothedarkages.com|title=Welcome To The Dark Ages – Welcome To The Dark Ages – The JAMs / The KLF – Liverpool – August 23rd – 25th, 2017|website=Welcometothedarkages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Several threads and themes unify the many incarnations of Drummond and Cauty's creative partnership. Mostly these are esoteric or opaque in nature, which has led ''Melody Maker'' to compare them to [[The Residents]].&lt;ref name="Stubbs"&gt;Stubbs, D. "Pranks for the Memory", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 16 February 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=202 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114935/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=202 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his book ''[[45 (book)|45]]'' (Little &amp; Brown, {{ISBN|0-316-85385-2}} / Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-11289-4}}), Drummond documented his love of The Residents as a concept ([http://www.theresidents.co.uk/articles/books/art_drum.html link]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond and Cauty have also been compared to [[Stewart Home]] and the [[Neoism|Neoists]].&lt;ref&gt;Extract from a feature on [[Stewart Home]]. Cornwell, J. ''[[i-D]]'' Magazine, Nov 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=354 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916121143/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=354 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Home himself said that the duo's work "has much more in common with the Neoist, Plagiarist and [[Art Strike 1990-1993|Art Strike]] movements of the nineteen-eighties than with the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] avant-garde of the fifties and sixties." Drummond and Cauty "represent a vital and innovative strand within contemporary culture", he added.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|Home, S.]], "Doctorin' Our Culture", published on the website of The Stewart Home Society ([http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314035101/http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm |date=14 March 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Illuminatus!''===
Drummond and Cauty made heavy references to [[Discordianism]], popularised by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] in the ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy|Illuminatus!]]'' books, written between 1969 and 1971. Throughout the partnership, these tactics were often interpreted by media commentators as "[[Situationist prank]]s" or "[[publicity stunt]]s".&lt;ref name="Vincentelli04"&gt;Vincentelli, Elisabeth (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yoCV0eaetb0C ''ABBA gold''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511084103/https://books.google.com/books?id=yoCV0eaetb0C |date=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Drummond, "That's just the way it was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever going to believe us, but we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct."&lt;ref&gt;Morton, R., "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 22 January 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150446/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 |date=4 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, "I think it worked because we really meant it."&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

The number [[23 (numerology)|23]] is a theme of ''Illuminatus!'', where instances of the number are both overtly and surreptitiously placed.
&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: the following list is a *representative* selection to illustrate the types of occurrence of 23--&gt;
* In lyrics to the song "Next" from the album ''1987'': "23 years is a mighty long time".
* They reportedly signed a contract preventing either of them from publicly discussing the burning of a million pounds for a period of 23 years;&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation, "Cape Wrath" advertisement, in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (''G2''), 8 December 1995([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113827/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; their 1997 return as 2K was "for 23 minutes only".&lt;ref name="2K"&gt;2K press advert ([http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2k1.htm link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327005822/http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2k1.htm |date=27 March 2006 }}, [http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2kpress.htm overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327002924/http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2kpress.htm |date=27 March 2006 }})&lt;/ref&gt;
* In numbering schemes: for instance, the debut single "All You Need Is Love" took the catalogue number JAMS 23, while the final KLF Communications Information Sheet was numbered 23; and Cauty's Ford Galaxie police car had on its roof the identification mark 23.
* In significant dates during their work: for instance, a rare public appearance by the KLF, at the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, was on 23 June 1991; they announced the winner of the K Foundation award on 23 November 1993;&lt;ref&gt;"K-Foundation nailed", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 11 December 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=368 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115513/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=368 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and they burned one million pounds on 23 August 1994.&lt;ref name="burning"/&gt;
* The 2017 reunion happened at 00:23 on 23 August, 23 years after the KLF ended in 1994, with the release of a book entitled ''2023: A Trilogy''.&lt;ref name=gua2017/&gt;

When questioned on the importance that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically "I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know."&lt;ref name="i-D"&gt;"Freak Show", ''[[i-D]]'' magazine, December 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=392 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916111453/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=392 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Pyramid Blaster"&lt;ref name="info8" /&gt; is a logo and [[iconography|icon]] frequently and prominently depicted within the duo's collective work: a [[pyramid]], in front of which is suspended a [[boombox|ghetto blaster]] displaying the word "Justified". This references the [[Eye of Providence|All-Seeing Eye]] icon, often depicted as an eye within a triangle or pyramid, a significant symbol of ''Illuminatus!'' The pyramid was also a theme of the duo's 1997 re-emergence, with the proposed building by [[Fuck the Millenium#K2 Plant Hire|K2 Plant Hire]] of "a massive pyramid containing one brick for every person born in the UK during the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fortean Times]]'', referencing ''[[The Big Issue]]'', 15 September 1997 and ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 November 1997 ([http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/107_sdays.shtml link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504220313/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/107_sdays.shtml |date=4 May 2006 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

KLF has been variously reported as being an [[initialism]] for "Kopyright Liberation Front",&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Martin C. (1999) ''The Great Alternative &amp; Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|0-86241-913-1}}, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; and "Kings of the Low Frequencies".

Although Drummond accounted for the adoption of the JAMs name in the first KLF Communications Info Sheet,&lt;ref name="Info1"&gt;Drummond, B. (1987), ''KLF Info Sheet Oct 1987'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=500 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225447/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=500 |date=11 March 2007 }})&lt;/ref&gt; the reasoning behind Drummond and Cauty's decision to reference the ''Illuminatus!'' mythology with such consistent intricacy is unknown. Indeed, it has been suggested by journalist [[Steven Poole]] that the public's inability to understand the KLF fully results in all their subsequent activities (as a partnership or otherwise) being absorbed into the KLF's mystique. In a review of Drummond's 1999 book, ''45'', and an appraisal of the KLF's career, Poole stated that "[Bill Drummond] and collaborator Jimmy Cauty are the only true [[conceptual art]]ists of the [1990s]. And for all the [[wikt:eldritch|eldritch]] beauty of their art, their most successful creation is the myth they have built around themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Poole|Poole, S.]], "Hit man, myth maker—''45''", ''[[The Observer]]'', 26 February 2000 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=487 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112918/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=487 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded,

{{quote|A myth like the KLF's is peculiarly omnivorous. Just as there can never be any evidence to disprove a conspiracy theory because the fabrication of such evidence&amp;nbsp;– don't you see?&amp;nbsp;– is itself part of the conspiracy, so the pop myth of the KLF can never be blown apart by anything they do, no matter how dumb or embarrassing. The myth will suck it up, like a black hole.}}

===Trancentral, eternity, sheep===
Trancentral (aka the Benio&lt;ref&gt;Mead, H. (1990), ''Chill Out'' review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=123 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112531/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=123 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;) was their studios. Despite the grandiose lyrics of "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]", Trancentral was in fact Cauty's residence in [[Stockwell]], [[South London]] ({{Coord|51.471373|-0.128167|display=inline|name=55 Jeffrey's Road, Stockwell, London}}), "a large and rather grotty [[squatting|squat]]" according to ''[[Melody Maker]]'''s David Stubbs: "Jimmy has lived [there] for 12 years. ('I hate the place. I've no alternative but to live here.') There's little evidence of fame or fortune. The kitchen is heated by means of leaving the three functioning gas rings on at full blast until the fumes make us all feel stoned&amp;nbsp;.... And, pinned just above a working top cluttered with chipped mugs is a letter from a five-year-old fan, featuring a crayon drawing of the band."&lt;ref name="Stubbs"/&gt;

Following the February 1990 release of ''Chill Out'', [[sheep]] had recurring roles in the duo's output until their 1992 retirement.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt; Drummond has claimed that the use of sheep on the ''Chill Out'' cover was intended to evoke contemporary rural [[rave]]s&lt;ref name="X" /&gt; and the cover of the [[Pink Floyd]] album [[Atom Heart Mother]].&lt;ref name="17book"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Drummond | first = Bill | authorlink = Bill Drummond | coauthors = | title = 17 | publisher = Beautiful Books | date = | location = | page = 410 | url = http://www.the17.org | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-905636-26-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies and journeys===
Drummond and Cauty's work often involved notions of ceremony and journey. Journeys are the subject of the KLF Communications recordings ''Chill Out'', ''Space'', "Last Train to Trancentral", "Justified &amp; Ancient" and "America: What Time Is Love?", as well as the aborted film project ''The White Room''. The ''Chill Out'' album depicts a journey across the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]]. In his book ''45'', Drummond expressed his admiration for the work of artist [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], who incorporates physical journeys into his art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Drummond|Drummond, B.]], "A Smell Of Money Under Ground", ''[[45 (book)|45]]'', Little &amp; Brown, {{ISBN|0-316-85385-2}} / Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-11289-4}}, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire and [[sacrifice]] were recurring ceremonial themes: Drummond and Cauty made fires to dispose of their illegal debut album and to sacrifice the KLF's profits; their dead sheep gesture of 1992 carried a sacrificial message. The KLF's short film ''[[The KLF films|The Rites of Mu]]'' depicts their celebration of the 1991 [[Midsummer|summer solstice]] on the [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]]: a {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} tall [[Wicker Man|wicker man]] was burnt at a ceremony in which journalists were asked to wear yellow and grey robes and join a [[chant]].&lt;ref name="i-D" /&gt;

===Promotion===
[[File:K-Foundation - Fuck the Millenium Advert.jpg|thumb|upright|A K2 Plant Hire advertisement, exhibiting the stark quality of Drummond and Cauty's press adverts, and the characteristic typeface]]
Drummond and Cauty were renowned for their distinctive and humorous public appearances (including several on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''), at which they were often costumed.&lt;ref name="Stubbs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, M., "The Return of The KLF", ''[[SKY magazine|Sky]]'', October 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=445 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113500/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=445 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; They granted few interviews, communicating instead via semi-regular newsletters, or cryptically phrased full-page adverts in UK national newspapers and the music press. Such adverts were typically stark, comprising large white lettering on black.

From the outset of their collaborations, Drummond and Cauty practised the [[guerrilla communication]] tactic that they described as "illegal but effective use of [[graffiti]] on [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] and public buildings" in which "the original meaning of the advert would be totally subverted".&lt;ref name="biog" /&gt; Much as the JAMs' early recordings carried messages on the back of existing musical works, their promotional graffiti often derived its potency from the context in which it was placed. For instance, The JAMs' "SHAG SHAG SHAG" graffiti, coinciding with their release of "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]", was drawn over the "HALO HALO HALO" slogan of a ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' billboard that depicted [[Greater Manchester]] Police Chief Constable [[James Anderton]],&lt;ref name="Sounds16May"/&gt; who had decried [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] amidst the UK media's AIDS furore.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see: "The 1980s AIDS campaign", ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4348096.stm Article on the BBC website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115085729/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4348096.stm |date=15 January 2009 }}. Retrieved 26 April 2006. A fuller set of references are available in the article "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Music press journalists were occasionally invited to witness the defacements. In December 1987, a ''Melody Maker'' reporter was in attendance to see Cauty reverse his car Ford Timelord alongside a billboard and stand on its roof to graffiti a [[Christmas]] message from the JAMs.&lt;ref name="tune"&gt;Smith, M., "The Great TUNE Robbery", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 12 December 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=52 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211026/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=52 |date=4 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1991, another ''Melody Maker'' journalist watched the KLF deface a billboard advertising ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', doctoring the slogan "[[Gulf War|THE GULF]]: the coverage, the analysis, the facts" by painting a 'K' over the 'GU'. Drummond and Cauty were, on this occasion, caught at the scene by police and arrested, later to be released without charge.&lt;ref name="Stubbs" /&gt;

In November 1991, the slogan "It's Grim Up North" appeared as graffiti on the junction of London's [[M25 motorway|M25]] orbital motorway with the [[M1 motorway|M1]], which runs to Northern England. The graffiti, for which the JAMs denied responsibility, led to a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] motion being timetabled by [[Member of Parliament]] [[Joseph Ashton (politician)|Joe Ashton]] regarding regional imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;"The JAMs: centre of political interest", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 9 November 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=258 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114545/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=258 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1997, on the day after Drummond and Cauty's brief remergence as 2K, the graffiti "1997: What The Fuck's Going On?" appeared on the outside wall of London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], ten years after the slogan "1987: What The Fuck's Going On?" had been similarly placed to mark the release of the JAMs' debut album.&lt;ref&gt;"Pre-millennium tension hits new high", ''[[New Musical Express]]'' 27 September 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=465 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916120234/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=465 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chill Out'' is cited as "one of the essential ambient albums".&lt;ref&gt;Bush, J., [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11084|pure_url=yes}} ''Chill Out'' review], [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved 6 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''[[Mixmag]]'' named ''Chill Out'' the fifth best "dance" album of all time, describing Cauty's DJ sets with the Orb's Alex Paterson as "seminal".&lt;ref&gt;Philips, D., "50 Greatest Dance Albums: # 5", ''[[Mixmag]]'', March 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=478 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916110651/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=478 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' has credited the KLF with inventing "stadium house"&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, J. "The horny old devils", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 August 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=437 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115808/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=437 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and ''NME'' named the KLF's stadium house album ''The White Room'' the 81st best album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020106061903/http://microsites.nme.com/top100/site/90.html NME TOP 100 ALBUMS OF ALL TIME] at [[NME]], via the Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040815023740/http://microsites.nme.com/reviews/top100.html nme.com - Top 100 Of All Times] at [[NME]], via the Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine credited the KLF with "set[ting] the trend for a new approach to mixing". Engineer [[Mark Stent]] is quoted as saying:

{{quote|It was in working with Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty that things really started to happen in a new way, using mixing as a work-in-progress, rather than an end stage. We were running everything live in the studio, from [[music sequencer|sequencers]] and samplers. Obviously there was also stuff on tape, but they would come in with their [[Atari ST|Ataris]] and [[Akai]] samplers, and we would end up rearranging the whole song whilst mixing things. They would then take away what we did, work on it again, and come back a while later, and I'd mix stuff again. My KLF work put me in the picture, and after that the phone never stopped ringing.|&lt;ref name="SoS"&gt;[[Mark Stent]], in Tingen, P.

===Opinions of contemporaries===
In 1991, [[Chris Lowe]] of the Pet Shop Boys said that he considered the only other worthwhile group in the UK to be the KLF. [[Neil Tennant]] added that "They have an incredibly recognisable sound. I liked it when they said [[EMF (band)|EMF]] nicked the F from KLF.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, R. "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 12 January 1991 ({{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id%3D191 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150446/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 |archivedate=4 October 2016 |df=dmy }})&lt;/ref&gt; They're from a different tradition to us in that they're pranksters and we've never been pranksters."&lt;ref name="psb"/&gt;

At the time of the KLF's retirement announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague [[David Balfe]] said of Drummond's KLF career that "the path he's trod[den] is a more artistic one than mine. I know that deep down I like the idea of building up a very successful career, where Bill is more interested in weird stuff&amp;nbsp;.... I think the very avoidance of cliché has become their particular cliché".&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt;

In March 1994, members of the anarchist band [[Chumbawamba]] expressed their respect for the KLF. Vocalist and percussionist Alice Nutter referred to the KLF as "real situationists" categorising them as political musicians alongside the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. Dunst Bruce lauded the K Foundation, concluding "I think the things the KLF do are fantastic. I'm a vegetarian but I wish they'd sawn an elephant's legs off at the BRIT Awards."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Maconie|Maconie, S.]], Chumbawamba interview, ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', March 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=378 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114318/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=378 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct influence===
The KLF have been imitated to some degree by German techno band [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]], being sampled on virtually every album Scooter have released. An outfit called "1300 Drums featuring the Unjustified Ancients of M.U." released a novelty single to cash-in on the popularity of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] footballer [[Eric Cantona]]. 1300 Drums even made a KLF-style ''Top of the Pops'' appearance, with the "band" wearing Cantona masks. The authorship of "Ooh Aah" remains unresolved: at least one source maintains that Drummond and Cauty themselves were 1300 Drums.&lt;ref&gt;RedMuze biography of the KLF at [[BBC Online]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/k/klf/ link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115183849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/k/klf/ |date=15 January 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timelords' book, ''[[The Manual]]'', was reportedly used by the one-hit-wonders [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] to secure their hit "Bring Me Edelweiss".&lt;ref name="X-not-Bill"&gt;Longmire, E. "KLF Is Going to Rock You" ''X Magazine'', July 1991 ([https://archive.is/20120708094940/http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reighley, K.B. "Hear No Evil", ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', 26 May 1999 ([http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211002/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php |date=3 March 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 ''Classic Pop'' magazine featured an article which claimed the KLF were in turn influenced by the Dr Calculus mdma 1986 album ''Designer Beatnik''.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Calculus Vs. The KLF, Classic Pop Magazine, Summer 2014 ([https://www.classicpopmag.com/2014/06/dr-calculus-vs-the-klf/ link])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career retrospectives===
Drummond and Cauty have made frequent appearances in the British [[broadsheet]]s and music papers since the KLF's retirement, most often in connection with the K Foundation and their burning of one million pounds. The ''NME'' described them as "Masters of manipulating media and perceptions of themselves".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nme.com/news/klf/9225 Fresh JAMMS?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115183849/http://www.nme.com/news/klf/9225 |date=15 January 2016 }}", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 6 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, ''NME'' referred to the KLF as "Britain's greatest pop group" and "the two most brilliant minds in pop today",&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt; and in 2002 listed the duo in their "Top 50 Icons" at number 48.&lt;ref&gt;"Top 50 NME Icons", ''[[New Musical Express]]''. See also "Roll over, Beatles - Smiths top the pops: Oldies and goldies in hall of fame", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), 17 April 2002, "Guardian Home Pages" section, p6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 404: ([http://microsites.nme.com/nme50/index.html link])--&gt; The British music paper also listed the KLF's 1992 BRIT Awards appearance at number 4 in their "top 100 rock moments of all time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/kurt-cobain/6010 "Top 100 Rock Moments of All Time"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181059/http://www.nme.com/news/kurt-cobain/6010 |date=3 March 2016 }}, NME.com. Retrieved 3 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "What's unique about Drummond and Cauty", the paper said in 1993, "is the way that, under all the slogans and the sampling and the smart hits and the dead sheep and the costumes, they appear not only to care, but to have some idea of how to achieve what they want."&lt;ref name="TateTat"/&gt;

"[Of their many aliases,] it is as the KLF that they will go down in pop history," wrote Alix Sharkey in 1994, "for a variety of reasons, the most important being the resolute purity of their self-abnegation, and their visionary understanding of pop." He added: "By early 1992 the KLF was easily the best-selling, probably the most innovative, and undoubtedly the most exhilarating pop phenomenon in Britain. In five years it had gone from pressing up 500 copies of its debut recording to being one of the world's top singles acts." The same piece also quoted Sheryl Garratt, editor of ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'': ""the music hasn't dated. I still get an adrenaline rush listening to it." Garratt believes their influence on the British house and rap scene cannot be overestimated. "Their attitude was shaped by the rave scene, but they also love pop music. So many people who make pop actually despise it, and it shows.""&lt;ref name="trash"&gt;Sharkey, A., "Trash Art &amp; Kreation", ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian Weekend]]'', 21 May 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150520/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384 |date=4 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Trouser Press]]'' reviewer Ira Robbins referred to the KLF's body of work as "a series of colorful sonic marketing experiments".&lt;ref name="Trouserpress"/&gt; ''The Face'' called them "the kings of cultural anarchy".&lt;ref&gt;"K Foundation: Nailed To The Wall", ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', January 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112429/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ''[[The Observer]]'' named the KLF's departure from the music business (and the BRITs performance in which the newspaper says "their legend was sealed") the fifth greatest "publicity stunt" in the history of popular music ([[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] joining the army being hailed as the greatest).&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, B. "The 10 greatest publicity stunts", ''[[The Observer]]'', 27 September 2003 ([http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/the10/story/0,11109,1043955,00.html link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315112412/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/the10/story/0%2C11109%2C1043955%2C00.html |date=15 March 2007 }})&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 listener poll by [[BBC 6 Music]] saw the KLF/K Foundation placed second in a list of "rock excesses" (after [[the Who]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Anthony, "The Who top rock's hall of shame", ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' (London), 20 June 2004, p5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
&lt;!-- http://www.xmission.com/pub/lists/klf/archive/v02.n347 --&gt;

Early releases by the JAMs, including the album ''1987'', were performed using an [[Apple II series|Apple II]] computer with a Greengate DS3 sampler [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral card]], and a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine.&lt;ref&gt;KLF Communications, sleevenotes, "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits", JAMS 23T, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NME''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 28 November 1987 review of The JAMs' single "[[Down Town]]" referred to them as "The Kings of The Greengate Sampler".&lt;/ref&gt; On later releases, the Greengate DS3 and Apple II were replaced with an [[Akai|Akai S900]] sampler and [[Atari ST]] computers respectively.&lt;ref name="SoS" /&gt; The house music of [[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]&lt;!--this should not be italicised, the prose is referring to artist, not album--&gt; and the KLF involved much original instrumentation, for which the [[Oberheim OB-8]] analogue synthesiser was prominently used.&lt;ref name="LP6"&gt;KLF Communications, sleevenotes, ''[[The White Room]]'', JAMS LP6, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The KLF's 1990–1992 singles were [[record producer|mixed]] by [[Mark Stent]], using a [[Solid State Logic]] automated mixing desk, and ''The White Room'' LP mixed by J. Gordon-Hastings using an analogue desk. The SSL is referenced in the subtitle of the KLF single "3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)". The [[Roland TB-303]] bassline and [[Roland TR-909]] drum machine feature on "What Time Is Love (Live at Trancentral)".&lt;ref name="LP6" /&gt;

Several of Drummond and Cauty's compositions feature original instrumentation. Drummond played a [[Gibson ES-330]] semi-acoustic guitar on "America: What Time Is Love?",&lt;ref name="USA4"&gt;KLF Communications, sleevenotes, "America: What Time Is Love?", KLF USA4, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cauty played [[electric guitar]] on "Justified &amp; Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)" and "America: What Time Is Love?". [[Graham Lee (Australian musician)|Graham Lee]] provided prominent [[pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] contributions to the KLF's ''[[Chill Out]]'' and "Build a Fire". Duy Khiem played [[clarinet]] on "3 a.m. Eternal" and "Make It Rain".&lt;ref name="LP6" /&gt; The KLF track "America No More" features a [[pipe band]].&lt;ref name="USA4" /&gt;

'''Transrational''', or "transrational reality," refers to the experience of objective nonpersonal, nonrational phenomena occurring in the natural universe, information and experience that does not readily fit into standard cause and effect logical structure; the kinds of experience that typically are labeled and dismissed as [[superstition]], irrational, and, in the extreme, abnormal or crazy.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Jerome S. Introduction. Living in the Borderland: The Evolution of Consciousness and the Challenge of Healing Trauma. London: Routledge, 2005. xv-xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the ‘supernatural’ and the ‘rational’ in that it neither directly controverts nor affirms logical sense or reason. A transrational experience is not [[pathological]]. The transrational does not engage with the question of how to sensibly fit an experience into a rational framework, instead allowing the experience to remain as it was experienced or witnessed, uninterpreted by rational [[sensemaking]] or [[meaning-making]]. The experience is what it is and is taken on its own terms.

The concept was first conceptualized in this sense by Jungian analyst [http://www.borderlanders.com/book/about-author Jerome Bernstein] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Jerome. "Listening in the Borderlands." The Salt Journal 2.2 (January/February 2000): 13-21. [The concept was first published, though not named, by Bernstein in this article, and was later coined “transrational” in lectures that year and in subsequent publications.]&lt;/ref&gt; however it had also been used to very different effect by Ken Wilber in his 1995 book, ''[[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality]]''.

People are so afraid of being considered pre-rational that they avoid and deny the very possibility of the transrational. Others substitute mere pre-rational emotions for authentic religious  experience, which is always transrational. Ken  Wilbur

# [After an account of human communication with animals and stones] “Of course, many of us shudder when we think of some of our companions who do talk with inanimate objects or invisible friends. Yet even here, I think that psychologists’ scholarly prejudices have often overcome their common sense and analytical skills. The point is not whether people talk to animals and plants, but the validity of the messages that are given and received. In other words, people picking up gibberish should be given therapy. When a person is told, however, that a certain plant, used in a particular way, is excellent for curing boils, stopping bleeding, or reducing fevers—and the cure works—that is another matter altogether.”&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, Vine.

A '''trichotomy''' is a three-way classificatory division. Some philosophers pursued trichotomies.

Important trichotomies discussed by [[Aquinas]] include the causal principles (agent, patient, act), the potencies for the intellect (imagination, cogitative power, and memory and reminiscence), and the acts of the intellect (concept, judgment, reasoning), with all of those rooted in Aristotle; also the transcendentals of being (unity, truth, goodness) and the requisites of the beautiful (wholeness, harmony, radiance).

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] expounded a [[category (Kant)#The table of judgments|table of judgments]] involving four three-way alternatives, in regard to (1) Quantity, (2) Quality, (3) Relation, (4) Modality, and, based thereupon, a [[category (Kant)#The table of categories|table of four categories]], named by the terms just listed, and each with three subcategories. Kant also adapted the Thomistic acts of intellect in his trichotomy of higher cognition—(a) understanding, (b) judgment, (c) reason—which he correlated with his adaptation in the soul's capacities—(a) cognitive faculties, (b) feeling of pleasure or displeasure, and (c) faculty of desire&lt;ref name=Kant&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''The Critique of Judgment'', 2007 edition, Cosimo Classics, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;—of [[Johannes Nikolaus Tetens|Tetens]]'s trichotomy of feeling, understanding, will.&lt;ref name=Tetens&gt;Teo, Thomas (2005), ''The critique of psychology: from Kant to postcolonial theory'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] held that a thing's or idea's internal contradiction leads in a dialectical process to a new synthesis that makes better sense of the contradiction. The process is sometimes described as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Triads|thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]. It is instanced across a pattern of trichotomies (e.g. being-nothingness-becoming, immediate-mediate-concrete, abstract-negative-concrete); such trichotomies are not just three-way classificatory divisions; they involve trios of elements functionally interrelated in a process. They are often called triads (but 'triad' does not have that as a fixed sense in philosophy generally).

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] built his philosophy on trichotomies and triadic relations and processes, and framed the "[[categories (Peirce)|Reduction Thesis]]" that every predicate is essentially either monadic (quality), dyadic (relation of reaction or resistance), or triadic (representational relation), and never genuinely and irreducibly tetradic or larger.

The '''United Federation of Planets''' ('''UFP'''), usually referred to as '''the Federation''', is a fictional interstellar federal republic in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' science fiction franchise, composed of numerous [[planet]]ary sovereignties. In the UFP, the member planetary governments agreed to exist semi-autonomously under a single central authority based on the utopian principles of universal liberty, rights and equality, and [[Technological utopianism|to share their knowledge and resources in peaceful cooperation]] and [[Outer space|space]] exploration while each member world retained its own political and social structure.

The Federation was introduced in the 1966–1969 television show ''[[Star Trek]]'' as the organization that sent the starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] on its mission of peaceful exploration. As the Federation has continued to explore the galaxy and expand its membership, it has been increasingly challenged by hostile alien civilizations such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] and the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]]. The survival, success, and growth of the Federation and its principles of freedom have become some of the ''Star Trek'' franchise's central themes.

The Federation was conceived as an idealized version of the [[United Nations]]. The Federation has been generally well received by critics and fans, becoming one of the most enduring storylines and symbols of the ''Star Trek'' franchise.

==Conception==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The first mention of the United Federation of Planets was in the 1967 episode "[[A Taste of Armageddon]]", although other vague references such as just the Federation or to the United Earth Space Probe Agency ("[[Tomorrow is Yesterday]]") were used in prior episodes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} As part of the [[anti-war]] message he wanted the show to convey, ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] intended to depict the Federation as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In several following episodes of the original series that were intended as allegories to the then-current [[Cold War]] tensions, the Federation took on the role resembling NATO while the [[Klingon]]s represented the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Westmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westmore|first1=Michael|title=Star Trek: Aliens &amp; Artifacts|date=2000|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=0-671-04299-8|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Orci]], writer of the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' movie, explained that the utopianism of the series has many times been a thematic foil to ongoing world events, showing that peace is possible in times where there are fears of "perpetual war".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Sides of ‘Star Trek’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20090514thursday.html |author=Dave Itzkoff|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date= 2009-05-14|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation is described as an [[star system|interstellar]] [[federalism|federal]] [[polity]] with, as of the year 2373, more than 150 member [[planet]]s and thousands of colonies spread across some 8,000,000 cubic light years of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy; each successive series in the timeline bringing in more races and planets into the Federation. The Federation is described as stressing, at least nominally, the values of [[Liberty|universal liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[justice]], [[peace]], and [[cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia: A Reference Guide to the Future|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=9780671034757|edition=Updated and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name=secretio9&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Jane Anders |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5965604/the-secret-history-of-star-treks-utopian-federation/ |title=The Secret History of Star Trek's Utopian Federation |publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation also maintains its own quasi-militaristic and scientific exploratory agency, known as [[Starfleet]] (also written as "Star Fleet" in some texts). Starfleet is seen handling many other governmental processes, often with no other agency's influence, such as border defense ("[[Balance of Terror]]", "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]"), diplomatic envoy ("[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror Mirror]]"), and has seen extensive use as a defensive military force ("[[Errand of Mercy]]", "[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Doomsday Machine]]").

==Portrayal==
The television series and films depict [[Earth]] and humanity as holding a center-stage political role within the Federation, in some ways first among equals.  The legislature, the [[Federation Council (Star Trek)|Federation Council]], is located at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;This is established in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' and corroborated in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' installment "[[In a Mirror, Darkly|In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Several other bodies of the Federation have been depicted. There is an [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] headed by a Federation President,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who keeps offices in the [[Place de la Concorde|Palais de la Concorde]] in Paris. There is a [[judiciary]] branch as well, the highest court of which is the Federation Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;This is referred to in "[[Doctor Bashir, I Presume?]]" in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federation's scientific, diplomatic and defensive/military arm is Starfleet, depicted as being headquartered at [[Fort Baker]]. The Federation comes into military conflict with other major powers in the galaxy such as the [[Klingon|Klingon Empire]], the [[Romulan|Romulan Star Empire]], the [[Cardassian Union]], the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], and the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].

The United Federation of Planets has existed as part of the ''Star Trek'' universe since the first season of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] and is the primary focus of all the ''Star Trek'' series. Several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' follow events leading up to the creation of the Federation, with the final episode featuring the signing of the Federation Charter.

In the series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', Earth Minister Nathan Samuels advocated the Coalition of Planets and invited other alien species, initially the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], [[Andorian]]s and [[Tellarite]]s, to become a part of this. The formation of the Coalition seems to have been the event that provoked the xenophobic Terra Prime incident in the episodes "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]". After Terra Prime leader [[John Frederick Paxton]] exploited the xenophobia on Earth, many of the aliens were unnerved and nearly abandoned the idea of a coalition. However, they were convinced by a speech from Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] to give the idea of a united organization of worlds a chance. Six years later in 2161,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Outcast (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|"The Outcast"]]&lt;/ref&gt; the United Federation of Planets was organized.

The Federation was founded in 2161 with the adoption of the Charter of the United Federation of Planets (sometimes referred to informally as the "Constitution). It draws text and inspiration from the [[United Nations Charter]] and other sources. An important guiding principle—it is listed as General Order One in the list of Starfleet general orders—is the [[Prime Directive]], which forbids any interference in the natural development of any civilization which has not yet discovered [[warp drive|faster-than-light (or warp) travel]]. This is intended to prevent even well-intentioned Federation personnel from [[Accelerating change|introducing changes]] which could destabilize or even destroy other pre-warp era cultures through interference.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Circle (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Circle]]" (''Deep Space Nine'')&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, however, consistent application of the Prime Directive tends to be a controversial issue, and the Federation does not always abide strictly by it, as when it initially approved the forced relocation of the [[Ba'ku]] from their adopted homeworld—although it was eventually determined that the Ba'ku were not a pre-warp civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Starfleet's Omega Directive supersedes the Prime Directive allowing for any means possible to destroy the Omega particle if encountered.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Omega Directive]]" ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other aspects of the articles provide for rule of law, equality among individuals, and protection of civil and creative liberties—all of which appear to be based on principles found in contemporary Western political theory. The charter includes guarantees of civil rights, the Seventh Guarantee being analogous to the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and its protection against self-incrimination.

The Federation also has its own semi-independent black operations agency, known as [[Section 31]], analogous to the Romulan Star Empire's Tal Shiar and the Cardassian Union's Obsidian Order.

The Federation has exacting requirements for prospective member worlds that wish to join. [[Caste]]-based discrimination is forbidden,&lt;ref name=Accession&gt;[[Accession (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and major systematic violations of sentient rights, such as the unjust peacetime imprisonment of [[supersoldier|specially modified soldiers]] on Angosia, are not tolerated for any petitioner.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hunted (Star Trek: The Next Generation)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although most member worlds have single, unified [[world government]]s, this is not required for entry, since the Federation will consider associate membership of non-unified worlds.&lt;ref name=Attached&gt;"[[Attached]]" (''The Next Generation'')&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, the Federation at large does not interfere with any member planet's internal politics and how it governs its own people, provided it abides by the rules of conduct expected of all Federation worlds.

===Government===
The government of the United Federation of Planets consists of the central federal government and the local planetary governments, who share joint sovereignty. The chief of state or of government of most planets is referred to as Governor, Prime Minister, or First Minister. The central government is composed of the office of the president, the president's cabinet, the Federation Council—made up of an equal number of representatives from every member planet—and the Federation Supreme Court.

====President====
The President of the United Federation of Planets (informally, the Federation President or the President of the Federation) is the elected [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] of the United Federation of Planets and is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the government, setting and coordinating foreign policy, and dealing with resource distribution issues. The Federation President is also the commander-in-chief of all [[Starfleet]] forces.

The President is supported by the Cabinet, a special committee composed of the heads of the executive departments of the Federation government as mentioned in "[[Extreme Measures (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Extreme Measures]]".

The Federation President's office is located in the city of Paris, France on [[Earth]].

====Council====
The Federation Council is the legislature of the UFP. Seats on the council are filled by representatives from the various Federation member worlds. In addition to legislation, the Federation Council is the only federal entity which may declare war. It frequently passes resolutions which the federation president and his or her staff must enact and enforce.

The makeup and location of the Council is somewhat vague and open to interpretation based upon canonical evidence.

====Supreme Court====
The Federation Supreme Court is the highest court in the Federation, and is led by an elected Chief Justice. The court was first mentioned in "[[Doctor Bashir, I Presume?]]".

===History of the Federation===

====21st century====
The film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' depicts the events surrounding the first meeting of humans with aliens. After the end of World War III on Earth, scientist [[Zefram Cochrane]] built Earth's first warp-capable vessel, the ''[[Phoenix (Star Trek)|Phoenix]]'', launched on April 5, 2063. Cochrane's warp tests of the ''Phoenix'' caught the attention of a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] science ship operating just outside the [[Solar System|Sol system]]. Vulcans, having not previously considered Sol or Earth worthy of their attention, established first contact with Cochrane and the inhabitants of his base in [[Bozeman, Montana]], when landing on Earth that same day. This meeting marked the point at which Earth first joined the interstellar community, and began the road toward the founding of the United Federation of Planets.

====22nd and 23rd centuries====
In the year 2119, an aging [[Zefram Cochrane]] opens the Warp 5 Complex on Earth, hoping to build the fastest human starship at the time. His project would eventually yield the ''[[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' NX-01, humankind's first deep-space exploration vessel. In 2150 United Earth, a planetary government, was formed, which included nearly all the nations on Earth.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Although no single individual was responsible for the UFP's founding, the starship ''Enterprise'' NX-01 was a major catalyst. Under the command of her captain, [[Jonathan Archer]], the ship helped forge an alliance between the formerly belligerent [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]], [[Andorian]], and [[Tellarite]] worlds, and fostered a spirit of unity and cooperation in the region which culminated in a more formal union in 2161. The UFP's immediate predecessor was the Coalition of Planets, which was strongly opposed by the xenophobic group [[Terra Prime]].

The Federation was formed in the immediate aftermath of the [[Earth-Romulan War]] of the late 2150s, which underscored the dire need for interstellar unity to prevent the horrors of conflict. Archer signed the Federation Charter after giving a historic speech that was still being studied two centuries later. According to the database of the USS ''Defiant'' NCC-1764, originating from the 23rd century, Archer went on to become a Federation ambassador to Andoria, a Federation councillor, and the UFP president from 2184 to 2192.&lt;ref&gt;"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]], Part II" (''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 2223 tensions began rising between the UFP and the [[Klingon|Klingon Empire]], and in 2267, after efforts by captain James Kirk and the heavy cruiser ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701 at Organia failed to broker a truce, the native energy beings the [[Organian]]s imposed an enforced peace and a signed treaty which effectively ended major conflict. Over the next few decades the two interstellar powers remained in a state of cold war, with occasional minor skirmishes. In 2293, the Klingons [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]] after the destruction of their moon [[Praxis (moon)|Praxis]], which led to the eventual signing of the {{Visible anchor|Khitomer Accords}} (as depicted in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|Star Trek VI]]''). The accords not only ended the war—they ushered in seven decades of relative peace.

During the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] era, [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] noted (in the episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]") that humanity was on "a thousand planets and spreading out", a number that surely must include Earth's many offworld colonies as well as the far-flung worlds on which humans reside, and shouldn't be taken to mean the Federation had a thousand members at the time. Since many Federation members have many colonies like Earth does, the total number of planets within the Federation may be difficult to determine; still, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'' establishes "over one hundred and fifty" planets (and, implicitly, distinct sentient races native to said planets) as being in the Federation.

====Early 24th century====
In 2311, the Tomed incident saw thousands of Federation civilians and Starfleet personnel killed by Romulan forces. The unrest ended with the Treaty of Algeron, restoring the [[Romulan Neutral Zone|Neutral Zone]] and prohibiting Federation development of cloaking technology.

In 2344, the Romulan Star Empire assaulted the Klingon outpost at Narendra III. In an unexpected move, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-C)|USS ''Enterprise''-C]] under captain [[Rachel Garrett]] came to the Klingons' defense; while the ship was destroyed in the skirmish, the crew's sacrifice did great honor to the Klingons, and the resultant goodwill forged the path toward a formal alliance between the one-time rivals.

Exploration and expansion in the 2340s and 2350s brought the Federation into conflict with several new powers, including the Talarians, the [[Sheliak]], and, notably, the Cardassians.

=====Cardassian War =====
Federation contact with a race known as the [[Cardassian]]s sparked an extended conflict. A representative incident was the massacre, in 2347, of Federation civilians on Setlik III. In 2370, a truce formed a demilitarized zone in which many Federation and Cardassian colonies found themselves within each other’s territory. Although an agreement was reached that provided for the eventual transfer of such colonies, the accord was fiercely opposed by a number of Federation colonists, some of whom formed a rebel movement, the Maquis, which continued resisting the Cardassians.

====Mid 24th century====
In 2365 the Federation first contacted the Borg Collective, which presented an existential threat to the alliance at the [[Battle of Wolf 359]]. Era events included the Klingon civil war, first contact with the [[Q Continuum|Q]], the start of relations with the [[Ferengi]], and various time-travel incidents.

From 2363 to 2371, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] served as the Federation's flagship.  (The events of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.)

From 2371 to 2378, the [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] (NCC-74656) was lost in the Delta Quadrant after being taken in the Badlands by the Caretaker's Array. (The events of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''.)

From 2373 to 2375 (depicted in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''), the Federation fought the [[Dominion War]]. By far the largest conflict the Federation had ever faced, it began in alliance with the [[Klingon]]s and evolved to join with the [[Romulan]]s against the combined forces of the Dominion, the [[Cardassian]]s, and the [[Breen (Star Trek)|Breen]]. The F-K-R alliance, with substantial casualties on all sides, eventually triumphed—in no small part to a Cardassian switching-of-sides after officials belatedly saw how the Dominion had effectively, and bloodlessly, conquered them.

In 2379 (the events of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''), [[Remans|Reman]] [[praetor]] [[Shinzon]] seized control of the [[Romulan Star Empire|Romulan Empire]]. His coup was foiled by the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] with help from Romulan-military dissidents. The event spurred a likely thaw in UFP/RSE relations frozen by over two centuries of chill, but the warming came at a steep cost: the [[power vacuum]] left by the death of Shinzon.

====Future history====
Prominent in some timelines is the [[Temporal Cold War]], waged on a number of fronts throughout time, including the 28th and 31st centuries.

By the 29th century, the Federation explores time as it once did space.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Relativity (Star Trek: Voyager)]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternate timeline (2009 and 2013 films)====
In 2387, as shown in the ''Star Trek: Countdown'' comic series, the star Hobus neared its supernova phase in galaxy-threatening fashion, posing an end-stage threat to the Romulan Empire. On Romulus, Federation ambassador [[Spock]] created a plan to use volatile red matter to quell the nova, save billions of lives and halt the political destabilization of the [[Alpha Quadrant|Alpha]] and [[Beta Quadrant|Beta]] quadrants—but the empire didn't act quickly enough on it, and Romulus was destroyed.

To avenge the loss of his family and his world, the Romulan captain [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]] took to his augmented mining ship ''Narada'' and attacked Spock's craft as the ambassador sought to depart. (The captain blamed Spock, and the Federation in general, for the destruction of his homeworld and the death of his wife and child.) During the engagement, both ships were pulled into the Hobus nova's singularity and transported into a past altered by their very presence there. This blossomed into the alternate timeline seen in the eponymous 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, wherein the Narada, pulled further into the past than Spock, attacks the USS ''Kelvin'' with the resultant loss of its first officer, George Kirk, father of future captain James.

As portrayed in the 2013 sequel ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness|Into Darkness]]'', the Federation in the Kelvin timeline faces a similar Klingon Empire mobilizing for war as its counterpart in prime reality.

===Economics===
Federation society has been portrayed as an economic [[utopia]] made possible in part by the replicator technology available to all its member worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Lessons of Star Trek's Money-Free Society|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/geeks-guide-star-trek-economics/|website=Wired.com|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology produces consumer goods and material through recombinant subatomic arrangement of raw materials.

In the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' episode "[[Dark Frontier]]", [[Tom Paris]] describes replicator technology as the "new world economy" that from the late 22nd century onward would make money obsolete—a fact echoed by [[Jean-Luc Picard]] when explaining the future timeline to Cochrane-era fighter [[Lily Sloane]] in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]''.

First mention of the Federation's obsolescence of traditional money came in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]'' when Kirk, freshly arrived in 1980s San Francisco from 2286, observes that "these people still use money" and, when asked if his crew uses cash in the future, answers back that "We don't". In "[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]", Picard explains to cryogenically-preserved people from the 20th century that 24th-century Federation economics differ, and that money as they know it is not used, or needed.

Financial transactions are invoked in passing in several instances of the episodes and films. Mentioned early in the in-universe timespan is a monetary unit called the credit, though a physical example of one never appears. In one such example, on Space Station K-7 in the original episode "[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]" set in 2267, Uhura is offered a pet tribble for 10 credits. In ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|The Search for Spock]]'' in 2285, an earthbound McCoy tries to book transport to the Genesis planet and is warned it could be expensive, but it is never revealed how much it would cost, since he is quickly taken into custody for breach of Genesis secrecy. Genesis project creator Carol Marcus, in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|The Wrath of Khan]]'', references the Federation's decision whether to fund her project or not, although in this context—since costs are not mentioned − "fund" may involve something other than credits. In ''Deep Space Nine''{{'}}s "[[You Are Cordially Invited...]]", station commander Benjamin Sisko's son Jake tells Ferengi businessman Quark that he has sold his first book. When Quark asks him how much he has earned, Sisko counters that "It's just a figure of speech." Sisko's colloquial use of "selling" here echoes similar mentions of financial-like transactions elsewhere, as when ''Enterprise'' engineer Montgomery Scott, in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|The Undiscovered Country]]'', references having bought a boat—or when Kirk says he has sold his house in the film ''[[Star Trek Generations|Generations]]''.

Monetary topics abound in the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|''Next Generation'']] era. In the inaugural episode "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]" set in 2364, ''Enterprise'' medical officer [[Beverly Crusher]] buys a bolt of fabric and asks for it to be charged to her ship's account. Some officers are known to visit casinos, particularly near starbases, as in "[[Tapestry (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Tapestry]]", and poker is often depicted as a favorite of ''Enterprise''-D crewmembers, though actual money is never shown as part of the game. In ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]''{{'}}s episode "[[Explorers (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Explorers]]", [[Benjamin Sisko]] recounts how, upon first entering [[Starfleet Academy]] and transporting back to his [[New Orleans]] home many times, he quickly spent an entire month's allotment of "transporter credits" (though these may not be a form of money). Later, in "[[The Changing Face of Evil]]", Sisko arranges for his wife's employer (the Bajorans, a non-Federation race) to give her a month's paid vacation, a fact emphasized in the episode. In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''{{'}}s pilot, [[Tom Paris]] references having someone pay his bar bills.

"Credits" appear throughout ''Trek'' canon, yet are not cleanly defined. They may exist solely for financial transactions with races like the Ferengi that still use some form of currency. If so, the credit may hold its value primarily because the Federation says it does, and thereby be a kind of fiat money. In support of this view, ''Enterprise''-D first officer Riker is seen bartering for information with Quark in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Firstborn (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Firstborn]]" using vouchers won at a gambling table in Quark's bar.

Riker claims the vouchers are good for twelve bars of latinum, a Ferengi currency which he asserts can be spent "almost anywhere", while the vouchers themselves were only good in Quark's establishment. This suggests that while the Federation may not use money, currencies other than the "credit" can be given, paid out, amassed, and spent within Federation space.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDLq51joXPw&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altcanon references===
&lt;!-- [[Centauran]] and [[Centaurans]] redirect here --&gt;
In [[Star Trek canon#Non-canon|altcanon]] sources like the original 1975 ''[[Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual]]'' and Johnson's ''[[Worlds of the Federation]]'', as well as the Next Generation ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Role-playing Game|Last Unicorn]]'' and original ''[[Star Trek: The Role Playing Game|Fasa]]'' [[role-playing game|roleplaying]] games, the Federation's five founding members were Earth (or Terra), Vulcan, Tellar, Andor, and [[Alpha Centauri]] (known also as Al Rijil, or by the Terran astronomical abbreviation ACen). Fandom and various altcanon works assert that founding member Alpha Centauri is home to a human race (transplanted by the Preservers from classical third-century BC Greece) known as, variously, the Centaurans, the Centaurians, or the Centauri, a perspective supported by the description of [[Zefram Cochrane]], in the classic episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]", as "Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centauri". Altcanon explanations hold that Cochrane was either a Centauri himself or, more likely, a resident (the novel ''Federation'', for instance, sets his home on Alpha Centauri B II, the second planet orbiting the trinary's secondary star) of a Terran colony in the ACen system. The films have since cemented this in canonical truth, with Cochrane born on Earth but retiring to his final years on Alpha Centauri before his disappearance and presumed death.

The once-official but now altcanon 1980-to-2188 historical guide ''[[Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology]]'' posits the UFP as being incorporated at 'the first Babel Interplanetary Conference' in 2087.

''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' later portrays the Federation's actual founding in "[[Zero Hour (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Zero Hour]]" and "[[These Are the Voyages...]]", along with preparatory negotiations in "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]". Alpha Centauri never appears as a cofounder of the Federation, a compact initially and explicitly seen as being between only four peoples: mankind, Vulcans, Andorians, and Tellarites. The ACen colony could possibly have achieved independence between Terra Prime and These Are the Voyages..., and then helped form the wider Federation as a separate member; yet Alpha Centauri is only ever mentioned as an Earth colony on screen. In an alternate timeline in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode "[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]" in which the Federation is never founded, the Alpha Centauri colony is under Romulan control.

In the six related novels ''A Time to Kill'', ''A Time to Heal'', ''A Time For War'', ''A Time For Peace'', ''Errand of Vengeance: Seeds of Rage'', and ''Articles of the Federation'', the Federation Council occupies the floors below the UFP president's office in the Palais de la Concorde. (This may contradict elements of ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]''.)

In altcanon works such as the ''Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual'' and the novel ''Articles of the Federation'', the Federation's founding document is the Articles of Federation, in line with fan tradition. Yet in ''Voyager''{{'}}s "[[The Void (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Void]]", the founding document appears onscreen (its preamble a reworked version of the UN Charter's), with the heading "Charter of the United Federation of Planets", a founding document in accordance with [[Star Trek canon|canon]]. [[Charter]] also appears in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' and in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|DS9]]''{{'}}s "Accession" in  discussion of federation membership requirements. This episode intimates that while the timeframe for a planet's entry is ten years past the submission of its request, the Federation is willing to halve that time for Bajor, an exemption similarly seen in ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection|Insurrection]]''. In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]''{{'}}s "[[The Drumhead]]", Picard calls the founding document the Constitution, establishing that as an alternate designation. Novels like ''Articles of the Federation'' presume that it's known by all three names.

Various novels detail more fully the inner workings of Federation government, such as how member worlds choose their council members (it's up to each to decide how to do so) and how presidents are elected (candidates submit their names anonymously and are vetted by the Federation Council, which judges their qualifications for office; elections are by direct popular vote).

==Reception==
The optimistic view of the future present in the Federation has been highlighted as unique among most [[science fiction]], showing how "civilized" the future could conceivably be.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/opinion/global/24iht-june24-ihtmag-das-32.html?_r=0 |title=Astronomical!

'''Visual analytics''' is an outgrowth of the fields of [[information visualization]] and [[scientific visualization]] that focuses on analytical [[reasoning]] facilitated by interactive [[User interface|visual interface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pak Chung Wong and J. Thomas (2004). "Visual Analytics". in: ''IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'', Volume 24, Issue 5, Sept.-Oct. 2004 Page(s): 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Visual analytics is "the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces."&lt;ref name="JJT05"&gt;[[Jim Thomas (visualization)|James J. Thomas]] and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://vis.pnnl.gov ''Illuminating the Path: The R&amp;D Agenda for Visual Analytics''] National Visualization and Analytics Center.&lt;/ref&gt; It can attack certain problems whose size, complexity, and need for closely coupled human and machine analysis may make them otherwise intractable.&lt;ref name="RK 07"&gt;Robert Kosara (2007). [http://www.viscenter.uncc.edu/courses/visanalytics.html ''Visual Analytics'']. ITCS 4122/5122, Fall 2007. Retrieved 28 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Visual analytics advances science and technology developments in analytical reasoning, interaction, data transformations and representations for computation and visualization, analytic reporting, and technology transition.&lt;ref&gt;Kielman, J. and Thomas, J. (Guest Eds.) (2009). "Special Issue: Foundations and Frontiers of Visual Analytics". in: ''[[Information Visualization (journal)|Information Visualization]]'', Volume 8, Number 4, Winter 2009 Page(s): 239-314.&lt;/ref&gt; As a research agenda, visual analytics brings together several scientific and technical communities from computer science, information visualization, cognitive and perceptual sciences, interactive design, graphic design, and social sciences.

Visual analytics integrates new computational and theory-based tools with innovative interactive techniques and [[Representation (psychology)|visual representation]]s to enable human-information discourse. The design of the tools and techniques is based on [[cognitive science|cognitive]], [[design]], and [[visual perception|perceptual]] principles. This science of analytical reasoning provides the reasoning framework upon which one can build both strategic and tactical visual analytics technologies for threat analysis, prevention, and response. Analytical reasoning is central to the analyst’s task of applying human judgments to reach conclusions from a combination of evidence and assumptions.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

Visual analytics has some overlapping goals and techniques with [[information visualization]] and [[scientific visualization]]. There is currently no clear consensus on the boundaries between these fields, but broadly speaking the three areas can be distinguished as follows:

* Scientific visualization deals with data that has a natural geometric structure (e.g., MRI data, wind flows).
* Information visualization handles abstract data structures such as trees or graphs.
* Visual analytics is especially concerned with coupling interactive visual representations with underlying analytical processes (e.g., statistical procedures, [[data mining]] techniques) such that high-level, complex activities can be effectively performed (e.g., sense making, reasoning, decision making).

Visual analytics seeks to marry techniques from information visualization with techniques from computational transformation and analysis of data. Information visualization forms part of the direct interface between user and machine, amplifying human cognitive capabilities in six basic ways:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Card, J.D. Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman (1999). "Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think". Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

# by increasing cognitive resources, such as by using a visual resource to expand human working memory,
# by reducing search, such as by representing a large amount of data in a small space,
# by enhancing the recognition of patterns, such as when information is organized in space by its time relationships,
# by supporting the easy perceptual inference of relationships that are otherwise more difficult to induce,
# by perceptual monitoring of a large number of potential events, and
# by providing a manipulable medium that, unlike static diagrams, enables the exploration of a space of parameter values

These capabilities of information visualization, combined with computational data analysis, can be applied to analytic reasoning to support the sense-making process.

== Topics ==

=== Scope ===

Visual analytics is a multidisciplinary field that includes the following focus areas:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

* Analytical reasoning techniques that enable users to obtain deep insights that directly support assessment, planning, and decision making
* Data representations and transformations that convert all types of conflicting and dynamic data in ways that support visualization and analysis
* Techniques to support production, presentation, and dissemination of the results of an analysis to communicate information in the appropriate context to a variety of audiences.
* Visual representations and [[interaction technique]]s&lt;ref name="KS12"&gt;A. Kerren and F. Schreiber. Toward the Role of Interaction in Visual Analytics. In Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '12), pages 420:1-420:13, Berlin, Germany, 2012. IEEE Computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once.

=== Analytical reasoning techniques ===

Analytical reasoning techniques are the method by which users obtain deep insights that directly support situation assessment, planning, and decision making. Visual analytics must facilitate high-quality human judgment with a limited investment of the analysts’ time. Visual analytics tools must enable diverse analytical tasks such as:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

* Understanding past and present situations quickly, as well as the trends and events that have produced current conditions
* Identifying possible alternative futures and their warning signs
* Monitoring current events for emergence of warning signs as well as unexpected events
* Determining indicators of the intent of an action or an individual
* Supporting the decision maker in times of crisis.

These tasks will be conducted through a combination of individual and collaborative analysis, often under extreme time pressure. Visual analytics must enable hypothesis-based and scenario-based analytical techniques, providing support for the analyst to reason based on the available evidence.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

=== Data representations ===

Data representations are structured forms suitable for computer-based transformations. These structures must exist in the original data or be derivable from the data themselves. They must retain the information and knowledge content and the related context within the original data to the greatest degree possible. The structures of underlying data representations are generally neither accessible nor intuitive to the user of the visual analytics tool. They are frequently more complex in nature than the original data and are not necessarily smaller in size than the original data. The structures of the data representations may contain hundreds or thousands of dimensions and be unintelligible to a person, but they must be transformable into lower-dimensional representations for visualization and analysis.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

=== Theories of visualization ===
Theories of visualization include:&lt;ref name="RK 07" /&gt;
* [[Jacques Bertin]]'s ''[[Semiology of Graphics]]'' (1967)
* [[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''Languages of Art'' (1977)
* [[Jock D. Mackinlay]]'s ''Automated design of optimal visualization'' (APT) (1986)
* [[Leland Wilkinson]]'s ''Grammar of Graphics'' (1998)

=== Visual representations ===

Visual representations translate data into a visible form that highlights important features, including commonalities and anomalies. These visual representations make it easy for users to perceive salient aspects of their data quickly. Augmenting the cognitive reasoning process with perceptual reasoning through visual representations permits the analytical reasoning process to become faster and more focused.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2016/11/23/making-wikipedia-knowledge-visible/|title=Making Wikipedia Knowledge Visible—Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

The input for the data sets used in the visual analytics process are [[heterogeneous]] data sources (i.e., the internet, newspapers, books, scientific experiments, expert systems). From these rich sources, the data sets ''S = S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are chosen, whereas each ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , i ∈ (1, ..., m)'' consists of [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] A&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., A&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;. The goal or output of the process is insight ''I''. Insight is either directly obtained from the set of created visualizations ''V'' or through confirmation of [[hypotheses]] ''H'' as the results of automated analysis methods. This formalization of the visual analytics process is illustrated in the following figure. Arrows represent the transitions from one set to another one.

More formally the visual analytics process is a [[Data transformation|transformation]] ''F: S → I'', whereas ''F'' is a concatenation of functions ''f ∈ {D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;}'' defined as follows:

''D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;'' describes the basic data [[pre-processing]] functionality with ''D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; : S → S and W ∈ {T, C, SL, I}'' including data transformation functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'', data cleaning functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', data selection functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt;'' and data integration functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' that are needed to make analysis functions applicable to the data set.

''V&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, W ∈ {S, H}'' symbolizes the visualization functions, which are either functions visualizing data ''V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → V'' or functions visualizing hypotheses ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; : H → V''.

''H&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;, Y ∈ {S, V}'' represents the hypotheses generation process. We distinguish between functions that generate hyphotheses from data ''H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → H'' and functions that generate hypotheses from visualizations ''H&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; : V → H''.

Moreover, user interactions ''U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;, Z ∈ {V, H, CV, CH}'' are an integral part of the visual analytics process. User interactions can either effect only visualizations ''U&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; : V → V'' (i.e., selecting or zooming), or can effect only hypotheses ''U&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; : H → H'' by generating a new hypotheses from given ones. Furthermore, insight can be concluded from visualizations ''U&lt;sub&gt;CV&lt;/sub&gt; : V → I'' or from hypotheses ''U&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; : H → I''.

The typical data pre-processing applying data cleaning, data integration and data transformation functions is defined as ''D&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)))''. After the pre-processing step either automated analysis methods ''H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = {f&lt;sub&gt;s1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., f&lt;sub&gt;sq&lt;/sub&gt;}'' (i.e., statistics, data mining, etc.) or visualization methods ''V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → V, V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = {f&lt;sub&gt;v1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., f&lt;sub&gt;vs&lt;/sub&gt;}'' are applied to the data, in order to reveal patterns as shown in the figure above.&lt;ref name="VASC08"&gt;Daniel A. Keim, Florian Mansmann, Jörn Schneidewind, Jim Thomas, and Hartmut Ziegler (2008). "Visual Analytics: Scope and Challenges"&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the following paradigm is used to process the data:

''Analyse First – Show the Important – Zoom, Filter and Analyse Further – Details on Demand''&lt;ref&gt;Keim D. A, Mansmann F, Schneidewind J, Thomas J, Ziegler H: ''Visual analytics: Scope and challenges''. ''Visual Data Mining:'' 2008, S. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Conference Against Racism''' ('''WCAR''') is a series of international events organized by [[UNESCO]] to promote [[anti-racism|struggle against racism]] ideologies and behaviours. Four conferences have been held so far, in 1978, 1983, 2001, and 2009. Founded after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] as a dependent body of the United Nations, UNESCO started as soon as it was created to promote scientific studies concerning [[ethnic group]]s and their diffusion in [[public opinion]] to dispel [[scientific racism|pseudo-scientific rationalizations]] of racism. One of its first published works was ''[[The Race Question]]'' in 1950, signed by various internationally renowned scholars.

The 1978 World Conference Against Racism was held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.  A major focus on the conference was South Africa's [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid policies]] of racial segregation and discrimination.

== 1983 conference ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The 1983 World Conference Against Racism was also held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland

== 2001 conference ==
{{Main|World Conference against Racism 2001}}

The 2001 conference was held in [[Durban]], South Africa, under UN auspices, from 31 August until 8 September 2001. Former Irish president [[Mary Robinson]], then the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, presided as Secretary-General. 

Entitled "World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance," the conference was discussing unfair treatment of one group against another.  Significant time was focused specifically on Israeli treatment of Palestinians{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, treating violations of human rights and genocide in other parts of the world secondarily.

The 2001 meeting was marked by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery, and coincided with attacks on Israel and anti-Israel demonstrations at a parallel conference of non-governmental organizations. Canada, followed by the U.S. and Israel walked out midway through the 2001 conference over a draft resolution that, in their opinion, singled out Israel for criticism and likened [[Zionism]] to racism. The European Union also refused to accept demands by Arab states to criticize Israel for "racist practices."

Also in the conference, African countries, led by Nigeria and Zimbabwe, and African-American NGOs wanted individual apologies from each of the countries responsible for [[slavery]], recognition of it as a [[crime against humanity]], and reparations called as such. The Europeans pulled together behind the UK and the best the Africans could get was a call for support for the [[New African Initiative]], debt relief, funds to combat AIDS, the recovery of stolen government funds transferred to the West by former dictators and their cohorts, and an end to the [[human trafficking|trafficking in people]]. But the word 'reparations' did not survive.

Within a day of learning that the draft was not ready, they announced they were joining the boycott. See:

* [http://jta.org/news/article/2009/03/17/1003772/australia-ready-to-boycott-durban-ii Australia ready to boycott Durban II]&lt;/ref&gt; announced they would not participate in the conference.

Mark Mardell of the BBC news reported: On the Monday the Conference was to begin, Italian Foreign Minister [[Franco Frattini]] (who was until last year the [[European Commissioner]] for security and justice) had told the Italian newspaper ''Il Giornale'' that Europe's failure to agree on a common approach was "a very serious mistake, because it shows our inability, despite all the words uttered in this connection, to come up with at least a lowest common denominator on a basic problem: namely the struggle against discrimination, on behalf of which we in Brussels so often speak out".

Frattini continued, "I should imagine that a compromise was preferred at any price. And this, despite the fact that in the documents prepared for the rendezvous in Geneva, apart from a few minor improvements, a basic approach has been maintained equating Israel with a racist country rather than a democracy. There are still unacceptable phrases which, if there had been a smidgen of consistency with what was said at the EU ministers' meeting, should have convinced people to forgo attending the conference – as we have decided to do, and as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and The Netherlands have decided to do." (Mark Mardell, BBC News)

New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully said he was not satisfied that the wording of the review would prevent the conference from "descending into the same kind of rancorous and unproductive debate that took place in 2001," and he reported that he was concerned that it could be used by Muslim countries to criticize Israel and to limit free speech when it comes to criticizing their religion. (reported by the Associated Press on 20 April)

On the opening day of the conference, France said that Europeans would walk out if Ahmadinejad made any anti-Semitic remarks. "We will have to be very clear. We will not tolerate any slips," French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told France Info. "If he utters racist or anti-Semitic accusations, we will leave the room immediately."&lt;ref name="rfi.fr"/&gt;

Germany had decided to stay away from the meeting amid western concerns that the event may take on anti-Semitic overtones, a senior official confirmed in Berlin Thursday.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com" /&gt;

In his opening address, Secretary-General of UN [[Ban Ki-Moon]] said, "Some nations who by rights should be helping us to forge a path to a better future are not here. Outside these halls, interest groups of many political and ideological stripes shout against one another in acrimony."&lt;ref name="rfi.fr"/&gt;

Later in the day, about 40 delegates walked out during Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech after he described Israel as a "racist government" and attacked the creation of the state of Israel.  France, which had warned of a walkout, described it as "hate speech", the BBC reported.

The walkout was a public relations disaster for the United Nations,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; which had hoped the conference would be a shining example of what the UN is supposed to do best: uniting to combat injustice in the world, said the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva. Her colleague [[Jeremy Paxman]] described the walkout as a "stunt", arguing that people should have the right to criticise [[Zionism]].

President Ahmadinejad, the only major leader to attend the conference, said Jewish migrants from Europe and the United States had been sent to the Middle East after World War II "in order to establish a racist government in the occupied Palestine".  He continued, through an interpreter: "And in fact, in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe, they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in Palestine."  French Ambassador Jean-Baptiste Mattei said: "As soon as he started to address the question of the Jewish people and Israel, we had no reason to stay in the room."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Walkout at Iran leader's speech|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8008572.stm|accessdate=25 January 2011|publisher=BBC|date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

British ambassador [[Peter Gooderham]], also among those who left, said Mr Ahmadinejad's comments were "offensive and inflammatory".  "Such outrageous anti-Semitic remarks should have no place in a UN anti-racism forum", he announced to gathered reporters.  (BBC News)
