There are many known modeling [[paradigm]]s to describe the [[System dynamics|dynamics of system]] in [[Process-oriented programming|process-oriented]], [[Event-based programming|event-based]] and activity-based view points. Among those modeling paradigms, the activity-based modeling is a natural way to represent the activity paradigm of discrete event simulation and our knowledge about a system. In activity-based modeling,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc97papers/1127.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of system is represented as an ACD ('''activity cycle diagram''') which is a network model of the [[logic]]al and temporal relationships among the activities. An ACD is easily implemented with the activity scanning method of [[simulation]] execution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesimguy.com/articles/simModMeth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developing the activity cycle diagram ==

The methodology for constructing an activity cycle diagram consists of the following five steps :

#Specify the model domain.
#List all entities and their key attributes
#For each entity define its individual closed cycle of activity - queue - activity
#Merge the individual activity cycles
#Verify the logic of the diagram and amend as necessary.

==Description==
A-CRA is a variant of the adult CRA model, which has a history of development and effectiveness research starting in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, R.J., Roozen, H.G., &amp; Smith, J.E. (2011). The Community Reinforcement Approach: An update of the evidence. Alcohol Research and Health, 33(4), 380–388.&lt;/ref&gt; A-CRA was adapted to be developmentally appropriate for adolescents, which included adding sessions for parents/caregivers.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Godley, S.H., Smith, J.E., Meyers, R.J., &amp; Godley, M.D. (2009).

Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of A-CRA is to improve or increase access to social, familial, and educational/vocational reinforcers for adolescents to achieve and sustain recovery. That is, therapists assist adolescents with learning how to lead an enjoyable and healthy life without using alcohol or other drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, G.M., &amp; Azrin, N.H. (1973).

==Evidence-based outcomes==
As of 2017, five randomized clinical trials of A-CRA have been published. The Cannabis Youth Treatment (CYT) study, which was funded by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]]'s (SAMHSA's) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), was a randomized controlled study of five manual-guided treatment models for adolescents with cannabis-related disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, M.L., Titus, J.C., Diamond, G., Donaldson, J., Godley, S.H., Tims, F. ... et al.

Addiction, 97(Suppl. 1), S16-S34. doi:10.1046/j.1360-0443.97.s01.2.x&lt;/ref&gt;  All five models demonstrated significant pre-post treatment improvements in number of days abstinent and the percent of adolescents in recovery during the 12-month follow-up period.&lt;ref name="Dennis"&gt;Dennis, M. L., Godley, S. H., Diamond, G., Tims, F. M., Babor, T., Donaldson, J. … et al. (2004). The Cannabis Youth Treatment (CYT) Study: Main findings from two randomized trials. Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, 27(3), 197–213. doi:10.1016/j.jsat.2003.09.005&lt;/ref&gt;  Within its study arm, A-CRA was the most cost-effective model; across both study arms, A-CRA was the most cost-effective model to involve parents in treatment.&lt;ref name=Dennis /&gt; Additional randomized clinical trials have shown A-CRA to be effective for homeless, street-living youth and young adults,&lt;ref name=Slesnick /&gt; youth with juvenile justice involvement,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, C. E., Wevodau, A. L., Henderson, S. E., Colbourn, S. L., Gharagozloo, L., North, L. W., &amp; Lotts, V. A. (2016).

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 82(1), 40–51. doi:10.1037/a0035264&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary evaluation studies suggest that A-CRA shows potential to be an effective treatment for adolescents with co-occurring psychiatric disorders&lt;ref&gt;Godley, S.H., Smith, J.E., Passetti, L.L., Subramanian, G. (2014). The Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) as a model paradigm for the management of adolescents with substance use disorders and co-occurring psychiatric disorders.

''Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 174'', 9-16. doi:10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.12.029&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment cost==
In a 2002 article assessing the economic costs of A-CRA, the average cost per completed treatment event was $1,237 at one site and $1,608 at another site.&lt;ref&gt;French, M.T., Roebuck, M.C., Dennis, M.L., Diamond, G.S., Godley, S.H., Tims, F.M., Webb, C., &amp; Herrell, J.M.

Addiction, 97, S84-S97. doi:10.1046/j.1360-0443.97.s01.4.x&lt;/ref&gt; Using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to adjust for inflation, the 2017 cost per A-CRA treatment episode ranges from $1,683 to $2,188.&lt;ref&gt;[[c:\\Users\\kwright\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary InternetFiles\\Content.Outlook\\F6PIVG0U\\U.S|U.S]]. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2018). CPI Inflation Calculator. Retrieved on February 5, 2018 from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment manual==
The original A-CRA treatment manual was published in 2001.&lt;ref name="Godley" /&gt; An updated version of the A-CRA manual was published in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Therapist fidelity to A-CRA treatment manual ==
Although therapist fidelity to an evidence-based treatment manual is believed to predict treatment outcome, this relationship has been difficult to prove.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, C.A., DeRubeis, R.J., &amp; Barber, J.P. (2010). Therapist adherence/competence and treatment outcome: A meta-analytic review. ''Journal of'' ''Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 78,'' 200-211. doi:10.1037/a0018912&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found that higher ongoing fidelity (model competence) ratings of 91 A-CRA therapists' clinical sessions predicted improved adolescent substance use outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Campos-Melady, M., Smith, J.E., Meyers, R.J., Godley, S.H., &amp; Godley, M.D. (2017). The effect of therapists’ adherence and competence in delivering the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach on client outcomes. ''Psychology of Addictive Behavior'', ''31,'' 117-129. doi:10.1037/adb0000216&lt;/ref&gt; This finding suggests that the A-CRA model of clinical certification and supervision, which rates A-CRA counseling sessions using a standardized rubric, is a central part of model effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''' (also referred to as '''adult ADHD''', '''adult with ADHD''', or simply '''ADHD in adults''', formerly '''AADD''') is the [[clinical neuroscience|neurobiological]] condition of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) in [[adult]]s.

About one-third&lt;ref name="Anas2001"/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0m4MbrnqEWEC&amp;pg=PA44 44]}} to two-thirds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hechtman|first=Lily |chapter=ADHD in Adults|date=8 February 2009|title=ADHD Comorbidities: Handbook for ADHD Complications in Children and Adults|edition=1st|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Thomas E.|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781585628339|oclc=701833161|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cJyvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of children with [[symptom]]s from early childhood continue to demonstrate notable ADHD symptoms throughout life.

Three types of ADHD are identified in the [[DSM-5]] as:
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|Predominantly Inattentive]] Type (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)
* Predominantly Hyperactive or Hyperactive-Impulsive Type (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI)
* Combined Type (ADHD-C)
In later life, the hyperactive/impulsive subtype manifests less frequently.&lt;ref name="Anas2001"/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0m4MbrnqEWEC&amp;pg=PA44 44]}} The hyperactivity symptoms tend to turn more into "inner restlessness", starting in [[adolescence]] and carrying on in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt;

Adult ADHD is typically marked by inattentiveness, difficulty getting work done, procrastination and organizational problems. Specifically, adults with ADHD present with persistent difficulties in following directions, remembering information, concentrating, organizing tasks, completing work within specified time frames and appearing timely in appointments. These difficulties affect several different areas of an ADHD adult's life, causing emotional, social, vocational, marital, legal, financial and/or academic problems.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isItADHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psychiatrymmc.com" /&gt; As a result, low self-esteem is commonly developed. However, given the right guidance and coaching, these traits of ADHD could also lead to career success, and in some cases, unique advantages in [[critical thinking]] and [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="webmd.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/features/positives |title=Is There a Positive Side to Adult ADHD? |author =Eric Metcalf, MPH |publisher=WebMD, LLC |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis of the condition follows after one or several [[psychiatric assessment|assessment]] interviews by a [[clinician]] including:
* examination of personal history
* observational evidence from family members or close friends
* academic reports, often going back to school years&lt;ref name="Faraone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASP"/&gt;
as well as evaluation to diagnose additional possible conditions which [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder#Associated disorders|often coexist with ADHD]], called [[comorbidities]] or comorbid disorders.

==Classification==
[[File:Approximate prevalence distribution of the subtypes of adults with ADHD.PNG|thumb|Out of the 4.7% estimated adults with ADHD approximately 19% exhibit predominantly hyperactive symptoms.]]

The [[DSM-5]], or [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], 2013 edition, defines three types of ADHD:
# a [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|Predominantly Inattentive]] presentation
# a Predominantly Hyperactive-[[Impulsivity|Impulsive]] presentation
# a Combined Type, that displays symptoms from both presentation

To meet the [[diagnostic criteria]] of ADHD, an individual must display:
* at least six inattentive-type symptoms for the inattentive type
* at least six hyperactive-type symptoms for the hyperactive-impulsive type
* all of the above to have the combined type

The symptoms (see below) were required to have been present since before the individual was seven years old, and must have interfered with at least two spheres of his or her [[wikt:function|functioning]] (at home and at school or work, for example) over the last six months.&lt;ref name="neucur"/&gt; The DSM-IV criteria for ADHD were, however, tailored towards the type of symptoms that children would show, and might therefore have underestimated the prevalence of ADHD in adults.&lt;ref name=Anas2001/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=April 2015}} In 2013, the newer [[DSM-5]] reviewed some of these criteria, with more lenient requirements for the diagnosis, especially in adults, and the age limit for symptoms first arising raised to twelve years.&lt;ref name=cdc /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Signs and symptoms==
ADHD is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition, beginning in early childhood and persisting throughout a person's lifetime. It is estimated that 33–66% of children with ADHD will continue to have significant ADHD-related symptoms persisting into adulthood, resulting in a significant impact on education, employment, and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="psychiatrymmc.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="valdizan" /&gt;

Individuals with ADHD exhibit deficiencies in [[Self control|self-regulation]] and [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|self-motivation]] which in turn foster problematic characteristics such as [[distraction|distractibility]], [[procrastination]] and disorganization. They are often perceived by others as chaotic, with a tendency to need high [[stimulation]] to be less distracted and function effectively. The learning potential and overall intelligence of an adult with ADHD, however, are no different from the potential and intelligence of adults who do not have the disorder.

Whereas teachers and caregivers responsible for children are often attuned to the symptoms of ADHD, employers and others who interact with adults are less likely to regard such behaviors as a symptom. In part, this is because symptoms do change with [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]]; adults who have ADHD are less likely to exhibit obvious [[hyperactive]] behaviors. Instead, they may report constant mental activity and inner restlessness as their hyperactivity internalizes.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010" /&gt;

Symptoms of ADHD (see table below) can vary widely between individuals and throughout the lifetime of an individual. As the [[neurobiology]] of ADHD is becoming increasingly understood, it is becoming evident that difficulties exhibited by individuals with ADHD are due to problems with the parts of the brain responsible for [[executive functions]] (see below: [[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]). These result in problems with sustaining [[attention]], [[planning]], [[organization]], [[prioritization]], [[time blindness]], [[impulse control]] and [[decision making]].

The difficulties generated by these deficiencies can range from moderate to extreme, resulting in the inability to effectively structure their lives, plan daily tasks, or think of and act accordingly even when aware of potential consequences. These lead to poor performance in school and work, followed by underachievement in these areas. In young adults, poor driving record with [[traffic violation]]s&lt;ref name="stanfordtannock2012"/&gt; as well as histories of alcoholism or substance abuse may surface. The difficulty is often due to the ADHD person's observed behaviour (e.g. the impulsive types, who may insult their boss for instance, resulting in dismissal), despite genuinely trying to avoid these and knowing that it can get them in trouble. Often, the ADHD person will miss things that an adult of similar age and experience should catch onto or know. These lapses can lead others to label the individuals with ADHD as "lazy" or "stupid" or "inconsiderate".

As problems accumulate, a negativistic self-view becomes established and a [[vicious circle]] of failure is set up. Up to 80% of adults may have [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder#Associated disorders|some form]] of psychiatric [[comorbidity]]&lt;ref name="Katragadda 2007"/&gt; such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="psychiatrymmc.com"/&gt; Many with ADHD also have associated [[learning disabilities]], such as [[dyslexia]], which contributes to their difficulties.&lt;ref name="eden"/&gt;

Studies on adults with ADHD have shown that, more than often, they experience self [[Social stigma|stigma]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] in childhood, commonly resulting from feeling neglected and different from their peers.&lt;ref name=McKeague&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKeague|first1=Lynn|last2=Hennessy|first2=Eilis|last3=O'Driscoll|first3=Claire|last4=Heary|first4=Caroline|title=Retrospective Accounts of Self-Stigma Experienced by Young People With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Depression|journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal|date=2015|volume=38|issue=2|pages=158–163|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&amp;sid=1cd532eb-a5f2-4ec0-91de-b59622e78f4a%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4211|accessdate=15 October 2015|doi=10.1037/prj0000121|pmid=25799297}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems may play a role to the high levels of depression, substance abuse, and relationship problems that affect adults with ADHD later in life.&lt;ref name=Derrer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Derrer|first1=David|title=Conditions Similar to ADHD|url=http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd-conditions-similar|website=WebMD|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Over the last 30 years, research into ADHD has greatly increased.&lt;ref name="pubtrends"/&gt; There is no single, unified theory that explains the cause of ADHD. Genetic factors are presumed important, and it has been suggested that environmental factors may affect how symptoms manifest.&lt;ref name="Kooij-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="antadv"/&gt;

It is becoming increasingly accepted that individuals with ADHD have difficulty with "executive functioning". In higher organisms, such as humans, these functions are thought to reside in the frontal lobes. They enable recall of tasks that need accomplishing, organization to accomplish these tasks, assessment of consequences of actions, prioritization of thoughts and actions, keeping track of time, awareness of interactions with surroundings, the ability to focus despite competing stimuli, and adaptation to changing situations.

Several lines of research based on structural and/or functional imaging techniques, stimulant drugs, psychological interventions have identified alterations in the [[dopaminergic]] and [[adrenergic]] pathways of individuals with ADHD. In particular, areas of the [[prefrontal cortex]] appear to be the most affected. Dopamine and norepinephrine are [[neurotransmitters]] playing an important role in brain function. The uptake transporters for [[dopamine]]&lt;ref name="Madras"/&gt; and [[norepinephrine]]&lt;ref name="Bannon"/&gt; are overly active and clear these neurotransmitters from the synapse a lot faster than in normal individuals. This is thought to increase processing latency and [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]], and diminished [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="Schweitzer-2006"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name="Kim-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Missonnier-2013"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of ADHD in adults requires retrospectively establishing whether the symptoms were also present in childhood, even if not previously recognized. As with other [[mental disorder]]s such as [[schizophrenia]] there is no objective "test" that diagnoses ADHD.&lt;ref name="schlancet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nihcs"/&gt; Rather, it is a combination of a careful history of symptoms up to early childhood, including corroborating evidence from family members, previous report cards, etc. The screening tests also seek to rule out other conditions or [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]] such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[substance abuse]]. Other diseases such as [[hyperthyroidism]] may exhibit symptoms similar to those of ADHD, and it is imperative to rule these out as well. [[Asperger syndrome]], a condition on the [[autism spectrum]], is sometimes mistaken for ADHD, due to impairments in [[executive functioning]] found in some people with Asperger syndrome. However, Asperger syndrome also typically involves difficulties in social interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests, and problems with [[sensory processing]], including hypersensitivity. Along with this, the quality of diagnosing an adult with ADHD can often be skewed being that the majority of adults with ADHD also have other complications, ranging from anxiety and depression to substance abuse.&lt;ref name=Derrer /&gt;

Assessment of adult patients seeking a possible diagnosis can be better than in children due to the adult's greater ability to provide their own history, input, and insight. However, it has been noted that many individuals, particularly those with high intelligence, develop coping strategies that mask ADHD impairments and therefore they do not seek diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name="neuropsychiatryreviews.com"/&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=April 2015}}

Formal tests and assessment instruments such as IQ tests, standardized achievement tests, or [[neuropsychological tests]] typically are ''not helpful'' for identifying people with ADHD.&lt;ref name="NASP" /&gt; Furthermore, no currently available physiological or medical measure is definitive diagnostically. However, psycho-educational and medical tests are helpful in [[differential diagnosis|ruling in or out]] other conditions (e.g. learning disabilities, mental retardation, allergies) that may be associated with ADHD-like behaviors.

United States medical and mental health professionals follow the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]; the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is often used by health professionals elsewhere. Periodic updates incorporate changes in knowledge and treatments.&lt;ref name="dsmdev"/&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}} For example, under DSM-IV (published in 1994, with corrections and minor changes in 2000), the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adults broadly follow the same as in children,&lt;ref name="onset"/&gt; but the proposed revision for the DSM-5 differentiates the presentation of ADHD for children and adults for several symptoms.&lt;ref name="apadsm5"/&gt;

It should be noted that every normal individual exhibits ADHD-like symptoms occasionally (when tired or stressed, for example) but for a positive diagnosis to be received, the symptoms should be present from childhood and persistently interfere with functioning in multiple spheres of an individual's life: work, school, and interpersonal relationships. The symptoms that individuals exhibit as children are still present in adulthood, but manifest differently as most adults develop compensatory mechanisms to adapt to their environment.

==Treatment==
{{See also|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder management}}
Treatment for adult ADHD may combine medication and behavioral, cognitive, or [[vocational interventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faraone|first=F|date=|title=Efficacy of adderall for attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder: A meta-analysis|url=|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|volume=6|pages=69–75|doi=10.1177/108705470200600203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment often begins with medication selected to address the symptoms of ADHD, along with any [[comorbid]] conditions that may be present. Medication alone, while effective in correcting the physiological symptoms of ADHD, will not address the paucity of skills which many adults will have failed to acquire because of their ADHD (e.g., one might regain ''ability'' to focus with medication, but skills such as organizing, prioritizing and effectively communicating have taken others time to cultivate).&lt;ref name="Searight"/&gt;

===Medications===
Stimulants, the first line medications in adult ADHD, are typically formulated in immediate and long-acting formulations.

[[Methylphenidate]], a stimulant, with short and long-acting formulations, is often the first-line therapy and appears effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=T|last2=Patsopoulos|first2=NA|last3=Weiser|first3=M|title=Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Sep 18, 2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD005041|pmid=25230710|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005041.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, methylphenidate is well tolerated. However, long term studies have not been conducted in adults and concerns about increases in blood pressure have not been established.&lt;ref name="Safety of therapeutic methylphenidate in adults: a systematic review of the evidence"/&gt; Methylphenidate increases concentrations of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] in the synaptic cleft, promoting increased neurotransmission. It acts to block the [[Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters]], thus slowing the removal at which these [[neurotransmitters]] are cleared from the synapses.

[[Amphetamine]] and its derivatives, prototype stimulants, are likewise available in immediate and long-acting formulations. Amphetamines act by multiple mechanisms including reuptake inhibition, displacement of transmitters from vesicles, reversal of uptake transporters and reversible MAO inhibition. Thus amphetamines actively increases the release of these neurotransmitters into the [[synaptic cleft]].&lt;ref name="junginger"/&gt; They may have a better side-effect profile than methylphenidate [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascularly]] and potentially better tolerated.&lt;ref name="kolar"/&gt;

The non-stimulant [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera), is also an effective treatment for adult ADHD. Although atomoxetine has a half life similar to stimulants it exhibits delayed onset of therapeutic effects similar to antidepressants. Unlike the stimulants which are controlled substances, atomoxetine lacks abuse potential. It is particularly effective for those with the [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive concentration]] type of attention deficit due to being primarily a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]].&lt;ref name="atom"/&gt; It is often prescribed in adults who cannot tolerate the side effects of amphetamines or methylphenidate. It is also approved for [[ADHD]] by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]]. A rare but potentially severe side effect includes [[liver damage]] and increased [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="santosh"/&gt;

[[Bupropion]] and [[desipramine]] are two antidepressants that have demonstrated some evidence of effectiveness in the management of ADHD particularly when there is comorbid [[major depression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilens|first1=Timothy E. |last2=Morrison|first2=Nicholas R. |last3=Prince|first3=Jefferson |date=October 2011 |title=An update on the pharmacotherapy of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=1443–65 |doi=10.1586/ern.11.137 |pmid=21955201 |pmc=3229037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although antidepressants have lower treatment [[effect size]]s.&lt;ref name="Antidepressants in the treatment of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review."/&gt;

===Psychosocial therapy===
Treatment of adult ADHD may also include forms of [[stress management]] or relaxation training.

Research has shown that, alongside medication, [[psychological intervention]]s in adults can be effective in reducing symptomatic deficiencies.&lt;ref name="rosler"/&gt; Emerging evidence suggests a possible role for [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) alongside medication&lt;ref name="antadv"/&gt; in the treatment of adult ADHD.&lt;ref name="KnouseLE"/&gt;

For most adults, the psychosocial therapy is not effective.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For this reason, medications are the first line of therapies. The medications that are prescribed for adults come in both stimulant and non-stimulant form. Although the drug therapies are effective for adults, the benefits should be discussed with the patient’s physician to ensure the benefits of the medications outweigh the risk. If medication is unwanted or not an option, increasing exercise and changing one’s diet may help alleviate some of the symptoms such as hyperactivity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youexplained.com/4-important-habits-for-adhd-patients/|title=4 important habits for adults and children with ADHD {{!}} You Explained|website=You Explained|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise may alleviate some of the symptoms of ADHD for approximately 45 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Epidemiology==
{{Main|Epidemiology of attention deficit hyperactive disorder}}

In North America and Europe, it is estimated that three to five percent of adults have ADHD, but only about ten percent of those have received a formal diagnosis.&lt;ref name="whoprev"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;ref name="kessler"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2015}} It has been estimated that 5% of the global population has ADHD (including cases not yet diagnosed).&lt;ref name="The Worldwide prevalance of ADHD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willcutt|first=E|date=|title=The prevalence of DSM-IV attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A meta-analytic review|url=|journal=Neurotherapeutics|volume=9|pages=490–499|doi=10.1007/s13311-012-0135-8|pmc=3441936}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the [[World Health Organization]] World Mental Health Survey Initiative, researchers screened more than 11,000 people aged 18 to 44 years in ten countries in [[the Americas]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. On this basis they estimated the adult ADHD proportion of the population to average 3.5 percent with a range of 1.2 to 7.3 percent, with a significantly lower prevalence in low-income countries (1.9%) compared to high-income countries (4.2%). The researchers concluded that adult ADHD often co-occurs with other disorders, and that it is associated with considerable role disability. Although they found that few adults are treated for ADHD itself, in many instances treatment is given for the co-occurring disorders.&lt;ref name="fayyadcross"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2015}}

== History ==

{{Main|History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}

Early work on disorders of attention was conducted by [[Alexander Crichton]] in 1798 writing about "mental restlessness".&lt;ref name="berrios" /&gt; The underlying condition came to be recognized from the early 1900s by Sir [[George Frederic Still|George Still]].&lt;ref name="lange" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan2009" /&gt; Efficacy of medications on symptoms was discovered during the 1930s and research continued throughout the twentieth century. ADHD in adults began to be studied from the early 1970s and research has increased as worldwide interest in the condition has grown.

In the 1970s researchers began to realize that the condition now known as ADHD did not always disappear in adolescence, as was once thought.&lt;ref name="pubtrends" /&gt; The expansion of the definition for ADHD beyond only being a condition experienced by children was mainly accomplished by refocusing the diagnosis on inattention instead of [[Hyperactivity disorder|hyperactivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Medicalization of Society|last = Conrad|first = Peter|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0801885853|location = Baltimore, Maryland|pages = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, some of the symptoms were also noted in many parents of the children under treatment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The condition was formally recognized as affecting adults in 1978, often informally called ''adult ADD'', since symptoms associated with hyperactivity are generally less pronounced.&lt;ref name="doctorlisafairweather_dot_com" /&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}}

==Society and culture==
{{see also|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies}}
ADHD in adults, as with children, is recognized as an impairment that may constitute a disability under U.S. federal disability nondiscrimination laws, including such laws as the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] and the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008|Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA, 2008 revision), if the disorder substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities. For adults whose ADHD does constitute a disability, workplaces have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations, and educational institutions have a duty to provide appropriate academic adjustments or modifications, to help the individual work more efficiently and productively.&lt;ref name="eoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="disdis"/&gt;

In a 2004 study it was estimated that the yearly income discrepancy for adults with ADHD was $10,791 less per year than high school graduate counterparts and $4,334 lower for college graduate counterparts. The study estimates a total loss in productivity in the United States of over $77 billion USD.&lt;ref name=AMA_Economics&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking News: The Social and Economic Impact of ADHD|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12869.html|website=American Medical Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022150521/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12869.html|archivedate=22 October 2004|date=7 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}} By contrast, loss estimations are $58 billion for drug abuse, $85 billion for alcohol abuse and $43 billion for depression.&lt;ref name="hw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinberg|first1=Steven|title=Adult ADHD Costs Billions in Lost Income|url=http://news.healingwell.com/index.php?p=news1&amp;id=521145|website=HealingWell|date=9 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=April 2015}}

==Controversy==
{{Main|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies}}
[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies|ADHD controversies]] include concerns about its existence as a disorder, its causes, the methods by which ADHD is diagnosed and treated including the use of stimulant medications in children, possible overdiagnosis, misdiagnosis as ADHD leading to undertreatment of the real underlying disease, alleged [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] practices of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and negative stereotypes of children diagnosed with ADHD. These controversies have surrounded the subject since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref name=lange/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Cormier E |title=Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a review and update |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=345–57 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18804015 |doi=10.1016/j.pedn.2008.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashtamangala.jpg|thumb|Ashtamangala: first row (left to right): parasol, pair of golden fish, conch; second row: treasure vase, lotus; Last row: infinite knot, victory banner and wheel.]]

The '''Ashtamangala''' are a sacred suite of ''Eight Auspicious Signs'' endemic to a number of [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The symbols or "symbolic attributes" ({{bo|t=ཕྱག་མཚན་|s=chaktsen}}) are [[yidam]] and teaching tools. Not only do these attributes (or energetic signatures) point to qualities of enlightened [[mindstream]], but they are the investiture that ornaments these enlightened "qualities" (Sanskrit: ''[[guṇa]]''; {{bo|t=ཡོན་ཏན་|s=yönten}}). Many cultural enumerations and variations of the Ashtamangala are extant.
{{quote|Groupings of eight auspicious symbols were originally used in India at ceremonies such as an investiture or coronation of a king. An early grouping of symbols included: [[throne]], [[swastika]], handprint, hooked [[knot]], [[bumpa|vase of jewels]], water libation flask, pair of fishes, lidded bowl. In Buddhism, these eight symbols of good fortune represent the offerings made by the gods to [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni Buddha]] immediately after he gained enlightenment.&lt;ref name="buddhistinformation.com"&gt;Source: [http://www.buddhistinformation.com/about_the_eight_auspicious_symbo.htm] (accessed: January 18, 2008) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113213231/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/about_the_eight_auspicious_symbo.htm |date=13 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Buddhism ==
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] make use of a particular set of eight auspicious symbols, ''ashtamangala'', in household and public art. Some common interpretations are given along with each symbol although different teachers may give different interpretations:

=== Conch ===
[[File:Ashtamangala right whorl conch.svg|thumb|150px|[[shankha|Śaṅkha]]]]
The right-turning white [[conch]] shell (Sanskrit: [[shankha|{{IAST|śaṅkha}}]]; {{bo|t=དུང་དཀར་གཡས་འཁྱིལ་|s=dungkar yénkhyil}}) represents the beautiful, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of the [[dharma]], which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare and the welfare of others.
{{quote|The conch shell is thought to have been the original horn-trumpet; ancient Indian mythical epics relate heroes carrying conch shells. The Indian god Vishnu is also described as having a conch shell as one of his main emblems; his shell bore the name Panchajanya meaning "having control over the five classes of beings".&lt;ref name="buddhistinformation.com"/&gt;}}
In Hinduism, the conch is an attribute of [[Vishnu]] along with the [[Sudarshana Chakra]]. [[Vaishnavism]] holds that Gautama Buddha is an [[avatar]] of Vishnu.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Endless knot ===
[[File:8signs-PELBEU.svg|thumb|left |150px|[[Endless knot]]]]
The [[endless knot]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Srivatsa|śrīvatsa]]''; {{bo|t=དཔལ་བེའུ་|s=pelbeu}})&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/dpal_be'u Dpal be'u]&lt;/ref&gt; denotes "the auspicious mark represented by a curled noose emblematic of love".&lt;ref name="Sarat Chandra Das 1902 p.69"&gt;Sarat Chandra Das (1902). ''Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms''. Calcutta, India: mainly used in buddhismBengal Secretariat Book Depot, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; It is a symbol of the ultimate unity of everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=198 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it represents the intertwining of wisdom and compassion, the mutual dependence of religious doctrine and secular affairs, the union of wisdom and method, the inseparability of [[śūnyatā]] "emptiness" and [[pratītyasamutpāda]] "interdependent origination", and the union of [[prajñā (Buddhism)|wisdom]] and [[Karuṇā|compassion]] in enlightenment (see [[namkha]]). This knot, net or web metaphor also conveys the Buddhist teaching of [[Buddhist philosophy#Interpenetration|interpenetration]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Fish ===
[[File:8signs-SERNYA.svg|thumb|150px|Pair of golden fish]]
The two golden fish (Sanskrit: [[matsya|gaurmatsya]]; {{bo|t=གསེར་ཉ་|s=sernya}}&lt;ref&gt;Source: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/gser_nya gser nya]''&lt;/ref&gt;) symbolise the auspiciousness of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] in a state of fearlessness without danger of drowning in saṃsāra.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The two golden fishes are linked with the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] [[nadi (yoga)|nadi,]]  [[prana]] and [[carp]]: {{quote|The two fishes originally represented the two main sacred rivers of India - the Ganges and Yamuna. These rivers are associated with the lunar and solar channels, which originate in the nostrils and carry the alternating rhythms of breath or prana. They have religious significance in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions but also in Christianity (the sign of the fish, the feeding of the five thousand). In Buddhism, the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water. They represent fertility and abundance. Often drawn in the form of carp, which are regarded in the Orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty, size, and life-span.&lt;ref name="buddhistinformation.com"/&gt;}}In Islam the (alive) fish has a significant role in the meeting between [[Moses_in_Islam#Meeting_with_Khidr|Moses]] and [[Khidr]].

=== Lotus ===
[[File:8-Signs PADMA.svg|thumb|160px|left|The lotus flower, or [[padma (attribute)|padma]].]]

The [[sacred lotus|lotus flower]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Padma (attribute)|padma]]''; {{bo|t=པད་མ་|s=péma}}), represent the primordial purity of [[Three Vajras|body, speech, and mind]], floating above the muddy waters of [[Upādāna|attachment]] and desire. The lotus symbolizes purity and renunciation. Although the lotus has its roots in the mud at the bottom of a pond, its flower lies immaculate above the water. The Buddhist lotus bloom has 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 100, or 1,000 petals. The same figures can refer to the body's 'internal lotuses', that is to say, its energy centres ([[chakra]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=197 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Powers |first=John |title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism: revised edition |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |pages=23 |isbn=978-1-55939-282-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parasol ===
[[File:8signs-DUK.svg|thumb|200px|Jewelled parasol]]
The jewelled parasol (Sanskrit: ''[[Chhatra|chatraratna]]''; {{bo|t=རིན་ཆེན་གདུགས་|s=rinchenduk}}&lt;ref name="Sarat Chandra Das 1902 p.69"/&gt;), which is similar in ritual function to the [[baldachin]] or [[wikt:canopy|canopy]]: represents the protection of beings from harmful forces and illness. It represents the canopy or [[firmament]] of the sky and therefore the expansiveness and unfolding of [[space]] and the element [[Aether (classical element)|æther]]. It represents the expansiveness, unfolding and protective quality of the [[sahasrara]]: all take [[refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the dharma under the auspiciousness of the parasol.

=== Vase ===

[[File:8-Signs BUMPA.svg|thumb|160px|left|Treasure vase]]

The [[Bumpa|treasure vase]]  ({{bo|t=གཏེར་ཆེན་པོའི་བུམ་པ་|s=terchenpo'i bumpa}}) represents health, longevity, wealth, prosperity, wisdom and the phenomenon of space. The treasure vase, or pot, symbolizes the Buddha's infinite quality of teaching the dharma: no matter how many teachings he shared, the treasure never lessened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=196 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconography representation of the treasure vase is often very similar to the [[kumbha]], one of the few possessions permitted a [[bhikkhu]] or [[bhikkhuni]] in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. The wisdom urn or treasure vase is used in many [[empowerment (Vajrayana)]] and initiations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Dharmachakra ===
[[File:8-Signs KHORLO.svg|thumb|130px|The [[dharmachakra]]]]
The [[dharmachakra]] or "Wheel of the Law" (Sanskrit; {{bo|t=ཆོས་ཀྱི་འཁོར་ལོ་|s=chö kyi khorlo}}) represents [[Gautama Buddha]] and the Dharma teaching. This symbol is commonly used by Tibetan Buddhists, where it sometimes also includes an inner wheel of the [[Gankyil]] (Tibetan). [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepalese Buddhists]] don't use the Wheel of Law in the eight auspicious symbols.

Instead of the dharmachakra, a [[fly-whisk]] may be used as one of the ashtamangala to symbolize Tantric manifestations. It is made of a [[yak]]'s tail attached to a silver staff, and used in ritual recitation and during fanning the deities in [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]]s. [[Prayer wheel]]s take the form of a dharmachakra guise. The [[Sudarshana Chakra]] is a Hindu wheel-symbol.

=== Victory Banner ===
[[File:8signs-GYALTSEN.svg|thumb|130px|[[Dhvaja]]]]
The [[dhvaja]] (Sanskrit; {{bo|t=རྒྱལ་མཚན་|s=gyeltsen}}) "banner, flag" was a military standard of ancient Indian warfare. The symbol represents the Buddha's victory over the four māras, or hindrances in the path of enlightenment. These hindrances are pride, desire, disturbing emotions, and the fear of death. Within the Tibetan tradition, a list of eleven different forms of the victory banner is given to represent eleven specific methods for overcoming defilement. Many variations of the dhvaja's design can be seen on the roofs of Tibetan monasteries to symbolise the Buddha's victory over four māras. Banners are placed at the four corners of monastery and temple roofs. The cylindrical banners placed on monastery roofs are often made of beaten copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyytiäinen |first=Tiina |editor-last=Saloniemi |editor-first=Marjo-Riitta |title=Tibet: A Culture in Transition |publisher=Vapriikki |pages=198–199 |chapter=The Eight Auspicious Symbols |isbn=978-951-609-377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequences of symbols ==
Different traditions order the eight symbols differently.

Here is the sequential order of the Eight Auspicious Symbols of [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepali Buddhism]]:
# Endless knot
# Lotus flower
# Dhvaja
# Dharmachakra (fly-whisk in Nepali Buddhism)
# Bumpa
# Golden Fish
# Parasol
# Conch

The sequential order for [[Buddhism in China|Chinese Buddhism]] was defined&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Lili. "A Summary of Porcelains' Religious and Auspicious Designs." ''The Bulletin of the Shanghai Museum 7'' (1996), p.133&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Qing dynasty]] as:
# Dharmachakra
# Conch
# Dhvaja
# Parasol
# Lotus flower
# Bumpa
# Golden Fish
# Endless knot

== Hindu symbols ==
In [[India]]n and Hindu tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend ({{ISBN|0-500-51088-1}}) by Anna Dallapiccola&lt;/ref&gt; the Ashtamangala may be used during certain occasions including: [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s, [[wedding]]s (of Hindus), and [[coronation]]s. The ashtamangala finds wide mention in the texts associated with [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. They have been depicted in decorative [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] and cultural artifacts.

* The [[Hindu]] tradition lists them as:
** [[lion]] called ''raja''
** [[bull]] called ''vrishaba''
** [[snake|serpent]] called ''naga''
** [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]] called ''kalasa''
** [[necklace]] called ''vijayanti''
** [[kettle]] called ''bher''
** [[Hand fan|fan]] called ''vyajana''
** [[oil lamp|lamp]] called ''deepa''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 70|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hindu]] tradition lists them as:
** [[fly-whisk]]
** full [[vase]]
** [[mirror]]
** [[elephant goad]]
** [[drum]]
** [[Oil lamp|lamp]]
** [[flag]]
** a pair of fish.
* The list also differs depending on the place, region, and the social groups.

==Jain symbols==
[[File:Adinath bilahri ashta.jpg|thumb|Adinath image with Ashtamangala placed in front of it, according to Digambara tradition]]
[[File:A Jain Manuscript Cover LACMA M.72.53.22 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|Ashtamangala, according to Svetambara tradition, on Jain manuscript cover, [[LACMA]] M.72.53.22&lt;br/&gt;(from left) : [[Swastika]], Vardhmanaka (food vessel), Pair of fish, [[Kalasha]] (pot), Bhadrasana (seat), [[Srivatsa]], [[Nandavarta]], Darpan (mirror)
]]
In [[Jainism]] too, the '''Ashtamangala''' are a set of eight auspicious symbols. There is some variation among different traditions concerning the eight symbols.{{Sfn|Titze|Bruhn|1998|p=234}}

In the [[Digambara]] tradition, the eight symbols are:
# Parasol
# Dhvaja
# [[Kalasha]]
# Fly-whisk
# [[Mirror]]
# Chair
# [[Hand fan]]
# Vessel

In the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition, the eight symbols are:
# [[Swastika]]
# [[Srivatsa]]
# [[Nandavarta]]
# Vardhmanaka (food vessel)
# Bhadrasana (seat)
# [[Kalasha]] (pot)
# Darpan (mirror)
# Pair of fish

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">[[Image:Bioretention cell rain garden US winter.jpg|thumb|A bioretention cell, also called a [[rain garden]], in the [[United States]]. It is designed to treat polluted [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from an adjacent parking lot. Plants are in winter dormancy.]]

'''Bioretention''' is the process in which contaminants and [[sedimentation]] are removed from [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Stormwater is collected into the treatment area which consists of a grass buffer strip, sand bed, ponding area, [[organic matter|organic]] layer or [[mulch]] layer, planting [[soil]], and plants. Runoff passes first over or through a sand bed, which slows the runoff's velocity, distributes it evenly along the length of the ponding area, which consists of a surface [[organic matter|organic]] layer and/or [[groundcover]] and the underlying planting soil. The ponding area is graded, its center depressed. Water is ponded to a depth of {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and gradually infiltrates the bioretention area or is [[Evapotranspiration|evapotranspired]]. The bioretention area is graded to divert excess runoff away from itself. Stored water in the bioretention area planting soil exfiltrates over a period of days into the underlying soils.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Bioretention |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=200044BE.txt |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-832-F-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filtration==
Each of the components of the bioretention area is designed to perform a specific function. The grass buffer strip reduces incoming runoff velocity and filters [[particulate]]s from the runoff. The sand bed also reduces the velocity, filters particulates, and spreads flow over the length of the bioretention area. [[Aeration]] and drainage of the planting soil are provided by the {{convert|0.5|m|in|abbr=on}} deep sand bed. The ponding area provides a temporary storage location for runoff prior to its [[evaporation]] or [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]. Some particulates not filtered out by the grass filter strip or the sand bed settle within the ponding area.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact" /&gt;

The [[organic matter|organic]] or [[mulch]] layer also filters [[Water pollution|pollutants]] and provides an environment conducive to the growth of [[microorganism]]s, which degrade [[petroleum]]-based products and other [[organic matter|organic]] material. This layer acts in a similar way to the [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] in a forest and prevents the [[erosion]] and drying of underlying soils. Planted [[groundcover]] reduces the potential for erosion as well, slightly more effectively than mulch. The maximum sheet flow velocity prior to erosive conditions is 0.3 meters per second (1 foot per second) for planted groundcover and 0.9 meters per second (3 feet per second) for mulch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Clar |first1=M.L. |last2=Barfield |first2=B.J. |last3=O’Connor |first3=T.P. |date=2004 |title=Stormwater Best Management Practice Design Guide, Volume 2: Vegetative Biofilters |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901X0B00.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati, OH |id=EPA-600/R-04/121A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[clay]] in the planting soil provides [[adsorption]] sites for [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[nutrient]]s and other pollutants. Stormwater storage is also provided by the voids in the planting soil. The stored water and nutrients in the water and soil are then available to the plants for uptake. The layout of the bioretention area is determined after site constraints such as location of utilities, underlying soils, existing vegetation, and drainage are considered. Sites with [[loam]]y sand soils are especially appropriate for bioretention because the excavated soil can be backfilled and used as the planting soil, thus eliminating the cost of importing planting soil. An unstable surrounding soil stratum and soils with a clay content greater than 25 percent may preclude the use of bioretention, as would a site with slopes greater than 20 percent or a site with mature trees that would be removed during construction of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009 |title=Bioretention Manual |url=http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108182559/http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-date=2011-01-08 |publisher=Prince George's County Department of Environmental Resources |location=Largo, MD |pages=6, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy metal remediation==
Contaminant trace metals such as [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[copper]] are found in [[stormwater runoff]] from impervious surfaces (e.g. roadways and sidewalks). Treatment systems such as rain gardens and stormwater planters utilize a bioretention layer to remove heavy metals in stormwater runoff. Dissolved forms of heavy metals may bind to sediment particles in the roadway that are then captured by the bioretention system. Additionally, heavy metals may adsorb to soil particles in the bioretention media as the runoff filters through.&lt;ref&gt;Li, H., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2008). {{doi|10.1021/es702681j}} "Heavy metal capture and accumulation in bioretention media." Environmental science &amp; technology, 42(14), 5247-5253.&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory experiments, bioretention cells removed 94%, 88%, 95%, and &gt;95% of zinc, copper, lead, and [[cadmium]], respectively from water with metal concentrations typical of stormwater runoff. While this is a great benefit for water quality improvement, bioretention systems have a finite capacity for heavy metal removal. This will ultimately control the lifetime of bioretention systems, especially in areas with high heavy metal loads.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, X., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2007).[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0045653506010927/1-s2.0-S0045653506010927-main.pdf?_tid=325fb1ca-8149-11e4-9703-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1418311390_040bf304a2459b6fcaaeff49731195a6 "Heavy metal fates in laboratory bioretention systems."] Chemosphere, 66(9), 1601-1609.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Metal removal by bioretention cells in cold climates was similar or slightly lower than that in warmer environments. Plants are less active in colder seasons, suggesting that most of the heavy metals remain in the bioretention media rather than being taken up by plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;Muthanna, T. M., Viklander, M., Gjesdahl, N., &amp; Thorolfsson, S. T. (2007).[http://search.proquest.com/docview/746872016/ "Heavy metal removal in cold climate bioretention."] Water, air, and soil pollution, 183(1-4), 391-402.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, removal and replacement of the bioretention layer will become necessary in areas with heavy metal pollutants in stormwater runoff to extend the life of the treatment system.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Chidākāsha''' in which all gross and subtle activities of the consciousness take place; it is the sky of consciousness, everything dies and evaporates in this space of consciousness, everything is reduced to its essence in this space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iyngar:The Yoga Master|publisher=Shambala Publications|page=199|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=92c7BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the mind (conditioned consciousness), along with intellect and ego, merges in this space of unconditioned Pure Consciousness through the paths of devotion, knowledge and action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self Unfoldment|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=142|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-ia18fu2rEAC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bj6hVJDXDI7luQTF5oLgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with the [[Ajna|ajna chakra]], the guru chakra, positioned in the stomata behind the centre of the forehead.

[[Yoga Vasistha]] speaks about the ''bhutākāsha'' – dealing with gross matter, ''chittākāsha'' – dealing with mental concepts and ''chidākāsha'' with the '' [[Atman (Hinduism)|ātman]] ''. These are spaces projected by the mind but all spaces are reduced to one, that is, to the ultimate space which is one’s own true self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Twirling of a Lotus|publisher=Lulu.com|page=104|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gnxGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mj2hVObuNdOQuATX3IHoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chittākāsha'' is the field of the mind which provokes a deeper enquiry because there is in it still the duality of the 'seer' (''drg'')  and the 'seen' (''drshya''); this duality ceases to exist in ''chidākāsha'' which is the field of Pure Consciousness viewed by the mind non-casually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Being in Depth|author=Swami Ranganathananda|publisher=SUNY Press|page=86|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=P0vfFZh9BIIC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ej-hVLGKDtSOuATkjoDoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different mental spaces are seen when the mind ventures outwards to see all that which exists externally, but what already exists externally exists within contained in the inner mental space whose nature is different in different planes, and because consciousness functions variously in varying dimensions depending upon fineness of matter, the number of dimensions and the varying subtlety of the mind. ''Chidākāsha'' is the result of Divine Ideation which makes the world a mental projection that functions within time and space to give itself a semblance of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, God, and the Universe|author=I.K.Taimni|publisher=Quest Books|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ4qn61v_UAC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chidākāsha'' also means the space of consciousness and the space behind the forehead which is the seat of visualization that links man with the conscious, subconscious and super-conscious and also the object of meditation or ''[[iṣṭa-devatā|ishta deva]]''; it helps gain insight into the connection between the two confronting worlds – the higher that is beyond all objects and thought and the lower which is the material world of senses. Subtle vision is developed though practice of ''Chidākāsha dhāranā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual Art and Education|author=Janis Lander|publisher=Routledge|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IH5iAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mj2hVObuNdOQuATX3IHoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhutākāsha'' is the space outside, the outside world of objects that the senses meet and a mere reflection of the infinite within; ''Chidākāsha'' is the space within which having turned the mind inwardly the sublime objectless infinite is to be realized through ''Adhyātma Vidyā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts of Space Ancient and Modern|author=Kapila Vatsyayan|publisher=Abhinava Publications|page=47|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=T9B0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Vivekachudamani]], [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] reminds that the first means to [[yoga]] is control of speech, then cessation of sense organ activity, control of mind and control of intellect. He states:-

:समाहितायां सति चित्तवृत्तौ परात्मनि ब्रह्मणि निर्विकल्पे |
:न दृश्यते कश्चिदयं विकल्पः प्रजल्पमात्रः परिशिष्यते ततः ||

: "If the mental functions are established in the true, unchanging, Higher Self, Brahman, this awareness of the phenomenal world is not experienced. What remains thereafter is merely a matter of meaningless word. " – ([[shloka]] 399)

Then all wrong identifications and knowledge of the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]] cease to survive, there is complete removal of sorrow, and all that remains is the Infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=270|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Vivekacudamani.html?id=J-U3twAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yama]] tells [[Nachiketa]]:-

:हँसः शुचिषद्वसुरान्तरिक्षसद्-होता वेदिषदतिथिर्दुरोणसत् |
:नृषद्वरसदृतसद्व्योमसद् अब्जा गोजा ऋतजा अद्रिजा ऋतं बृहत् ||

: "The Immortal Self (Ātman) is the sun shining in the sky, he is the breeze blowing in space, he is the fire burning on the altar, he is the guest dwelling in the house; he is in all men, he is in the gods, he is in the ether, he is wherever there is truth; he is the fish that is born in waters, he is the plant that grows in the soil, he is the river that gushes from the mountain, - he is the changeless reality, the illimitable. " – ([[Katha Upanishad]] II.ii.2) 
and,

:अग्निर्यथैको भुवनं प्रविष्टो रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बभूव |
:एकस्तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बहिश्च || २.२.९

:"As the one fire, after it has entered the world, though one, takes different forms according to whatever it burns, so does the internal Atman of all beings, though one, takes a form according to whatever He enters and is outside all forms. " - ([[Katha Upanishad]] II.ii.9)

In other words, Nachiketa is told about the pre-eminence of the all-encompassing Brahman who is everything and who pervades all things. He is told about [[Brahman]] shining brightly in the sky ('' [[akasha]] '') in subtle ether, in the sky of the ''Chidākāsha'' the infinite all –pervading subtle space of Consciousness ; the Self which produces all movement in the universe, shines in the ''Chidākāsha'' lighting up all worlds gross and subtle because of the emanation of [[Om]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads|publisher=Islamkotob|pages=118–119|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FNzTC6Nmy6gC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chữ khoa đẩu''' is a doubtful{{Dubious|date=December 2017}} obsolete script for the [[Vietnamese language]]. It is supposed to have been used in the [[Hồng Bàng]] period, and it is believed to have disappeared later during the [[Chinese domination of Vietnam]]. However, it is note-worthy  that the term "chữ khoa đẩu" itself comes from "[[tadpole script]]" ({{zh|t=蝌蚪字|p=kēdǒu zì}}) in Chinese texts produced in Vietnam while the ones produced elsewhere refers to ''kēdǒu zì'' as variants of the ancient [[Chinese characters]].{{Clarify|reason=|date=December 2017}}

"Chữ khoa đẩu" is also considered a distinct [[Muong language]] script similar to [[Thai alphabet]] and [[Lao alphabet]]. The script has 30 basic consonant signs.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Rutherford ''Vietnam'' 2003 p230 "Although the lowland Vietnamese, the Kinh, lost their original written script after 1,000 years of Chinese domination, the Muong have nonetheless retained theirs. Known as khoa dau van, it is similar to Thai and Lao, which have Sanskrit ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a book by Đỗ Văn Xuyền was published in which he claimed to have deciphered "chữ khoa đẩu" used by the Vietnamese ancient.&lt;ref name=xuyen&gt;"[http://vietnamnews.vn/life-style/235928/researcher-deciphers-ancient-script.html Researcher deciphers ancient script]", ''Viet Nam News'', January 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Xuyền's claim, like the earlier ones by Bửu Cầm or Lê Trọng Khánh, lacks of scientific basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Phan Anh Dũng|title=Về chữ Thái Việt Nam trong tác phẩm Thanh Hóa quan phong|url=http://hannom.vass.gov.vn/noidung/TapChi/Pages/baiviet.aspx?ItemID=289|publisher=Institute of Hán Nôm Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the script is indeed based on the [[Brahmic scripts]] used by [[Tai peoples]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;An Chi, [http://petrotimes.vn/chu-viet-co-cua-ong-do-van-xuyen-112177.html "Chữ 'Việt cổ' của ông Đỗ Văn Xuyền"] [http://petrotimes.vn/chu-viet-co-cua-ong-do-van-xuyen-tiep-113045.html "(tiếp)"] ''petrotimes.vn''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5001">'''Clinamen''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|aɪ|ˈ|n|eɪ|m|ən}}; plural ''clinamina'', derived from ''clīnāre'', to incline) is the [[Latin language|Latin]] name [[Lucretius]] gave to the unpredictable swerve of [[ancient atom|atom]]s, in order to defend the [[atomism|atomistic]] doctrine of [[Epicurus]]. In modern English it has come more generally to mean an inclination or a bias.

==Epicureanism==
According to Lucretius, the unpredictable swerve occurs "at no fixed place or time":
&lt;blockquote&gt;When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they deflect a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, just enough that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through the depths of the void, like drops  of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced anything.&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''[[De rerum natura]]'' ii. 216–224. Translation from Brad Inwood, L. P. Gerson, (1994), ''The Epicurus Reader'', page 66. Hackett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This swerving, according to Lucretius, provides the "[[Hylozoism|free will which living things]] throughout the world have".&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ii. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Lucretius never gives the primary cause of the deflections. 

==Modern usage==
In modern English clinamen is defined as an inclination or a bias. It implies that one is inclined or biased towards introducing a plausible but unprovable ''clinamen'' when a specific mechanism cannot be found to refute a credible argument against one's hypothesis or theory. The [[OED]] gives its first recorded use in English by [[Jonathan Swift]] in his 1704 ''[[Tale of a Tub]]'' ix.166, satirizing the atomistic theory of [[Epicurus]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Epicurus modestly hoped that one time or other, a certain fortuitous concourse of all men's opinions—after perpetual justlings, the sharp with the smooth, the light and the heavy, the round and the square—would, by certain clinamina, unite in the notions of atoms and void, as these did in the originals of all things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Swift|title=A Tale of a Tub|date=1704|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_2/A_Tale_of_a_Tub/Section_9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term has been taken up by [[Harold Bloom]] to describe the inclinations of writers to "swerve" from the influence of their predecessors; it is the first of his "Ratios of Revision" as described in ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;in "[[The Anxiety of Influence]]: A Theory of Poetry" (1973), Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA; 2 edition (April 10, 1997) {{ISBN|0-19-511221-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', [[Gilles Deleuze]] employs the term in his description of "multiplicities".&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, Paul Patton, (1994), ''Difference and repetition'', page 232&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, other French writers such as [[Simone de Beauvoir]],&lt;ref&gt;in "The Ethics of Ambiguity" (1948), trans. Bernard Frechtman; Publisher: Citadel Press, {{ISBN|0-8065-0160-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]],&lt;ref&gt;in "The four fundamental concepts of psycho-analysis" (1973), Publisher: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. (April 17, 1998), {{ISBN|0-393-31775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Derrida]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Jean-Luc Nancy]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Alain Badiou]],&lt;ref&gt;in "Theory of the Subject" (1982), trans. Bruno Bosteels; (New York: Continuum, 2009): {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9673-7}} (hardcover)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Serres]]&lt;ref name="berressem"&gt;Hanjo Berressem in Abbas, N. (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=AD7w2L8EOv0C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=the+birth+of+physics+michel+serres+clinamen&amp;source=web&amp;ots=rfZixqhJE_&amp;sig=VyrhqbVTFuR_LIujJKuBE1Xym_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA53,M1 ''Mapping Michel Serres'', page 53] University of Michigan Press&lt;/ref&gt; have made extensive use of the word 'clinamen' in their writings, albeit with very different meanings.

Lucretius' concept is central to the book ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]'', written by [[Stephen Greenblatt]].

"Clinamen" is defined by [[Alfred Jarry]] in Chapter 33 of his ''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician]]''.  The notion later figured{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} in the imaginary science of the Jarry-inspired College of [[Pataphysics]] and the experimental literature of [[OuLiPo]].

There is a record of the castle at "Castrum Caucoliberi" having been mentioned as early as 673, indicating that the settlement here was of strategic and commercial importance during the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoth]] ascendancy.

Collioure used to be divided into two villages separated by the river Douy, the old town to the south named ''Port d'Avall'' (in French known as ''Le Faubourg'') and the upstream port, ''Port d'Amunt'' (in French known as ''La Ville'').

Collioure was taken in 1642 by the French troops of [[Maréchal de la Meilleraye]]. A decade later, the town was officially surrendered to [[France]] by the 1659 [[Treaty of Pyrenees]]. Because of its highly strategic importance, the town's fortifications, the [[Château Royal de Collioure]] and the [[Fort Saint-Elme (France)|Fort Saint-Elme]] stronghold, were improved by the military engineer [[Vauban]] during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Nevertheless, Collioure was besieged and occupied by the Spanish troops in 1793, marking the last Spanish attempt to take the city. The blockade was broken a year later by general [[Jacques François Dugommier]].

In 1823, the territory of [[Port-Vendres]] became a commune, taking parts from the communes of Collioure and [[Banyuls-sur-Mer]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Pélissier, Paroisses et communes de France : dictionnaire d'histoire administrative et démographique, vol. 66 : Pyrénées-Orientales, Paris, CNRS, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 1870, an exceptional climatic phenomenon occurred in Collioure, as observed by [[Charles Naudin]] at the time; more than {{convert|1|m|in|0|spell=in|abbr=off}} of snow fell in one day on the town. Many orchards as well as [[cork oak]] woodlands were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{66 PHPC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demography ===
[[File:Population - Municipality code 66053.svg|thumb|center|300px|Population of Collioure (1962-2008)]]

== Economy ==
'''Collioure''' is the name of an [[Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée]] (AOC) situated around the town, ([[Collioure AOC]]), producing red, [[rosé]] and a few white wines.
The ancient terraced vines in the hills behind the town also provide grapes for the apéritif and dessert wines of the ([[Banyuls AOC|Banyuls]]) appellation, which shares its boundaries with the Collioure appellation.

Collioure is also famous for its [[anchovies]], and its once-thriving fisheries is referenced in [[Mark Kurlansky]]'s book ''Salt''.

==Culture==

As the town has a strong [[Catalonia|Catalan]] culture, its own motto has been adopted by one of the local Catalan rugby teams ([[USA Perpignan]], France):  ''Sempre endavant, mai morirem'' (''Always forward, We'll never die''). Under {{Interlanguage link multi|Michel Moly|fr}}'s leadership, the town has an alternative motto, ''Collioure sera toujours Collioure'' (''Collioure shall always be Collioure'') quoting French singer [[Maurice Chevalier]]'s famous song titled ''Paris sera toujours Paris''.

The annual Saint Vincent festival is held around August 15, attracting twice the town's population in visitors for several days of celebration with music and fireworks.&lt;ref name=Lesitecatalan01&gt;{{cite web|title=Festival programme 2012|url=http://www.lesitecatalan.com/sortir/fetes/item/3056-f%C3%AAtes-de-la-saint-vincent-%C3%A0-collioure|accessdate=9 June 2012|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108162251/http://www.lesitecatalan.com/sortir/fetes/item/3056-f%C3%AAtes-de-la-saint-vincent-%C3%A0-collioure|archivedate=8 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century Collioure became a center of artistic activity, with several [[Fauvism|Fauve]] artists making it their meeting place.  [[André Derain]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], [[James Dickson Innes]] and [[Tsuguharu Foujita|Tsuguharu Fujita]] have all been inspired by [[Château Royal de Collioure|Collioure's royal castle]], medieval streets, its lighthouse converted into the church of Notre-Dame-des-Anges and its typical Mediterranean bay. Collioure's cemetery contains the tomb of  Spanish poet [[Antonio Machado]], who fled here to escape advancing [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]ist troops at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939.

The British novelist [[Patrick O'Brian]], lived in the town from 1949 until his death in 2000, and his novel ''The Catalans'' graphically describes Collioure life before major changes took place. He also wrote a biography of Picasso, who was an acquaintance. O'Brian and his wife Mary are also buried in the town cemetery.

Part of the action in [[Stephen Clarke (writer)|Stephen Clarke]]'s fourth comic novel featuring Paul West, ''Dial M for Merde'', takes place in Collioure.

Ninety-eight reproductions of [[Matisse]]’s and [[Derain]]’s works are exposed exactly where these two masters of Fauvism painted the originals, in the early 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">In law, a '''commanding precedent''' is a [[precedent]] whose facts are "on all fours" with the case at hand. In other words, it almost exactly tracks it, sharing near-identical facts and issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Precedent: What it is and What it Isn't; When Do We Kiss it and When Do We Kill it?|author=Ruggero J. Aldisert|publisher=Pepperdine Law Review|volume=17|number=605|date=1990|ssrn=1410783}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commanding precedent is also referred to as a "Goose" case in [[Louisiana]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v. Gaber|vol=745|reporter=F.2d|opinion=952|court=5th Cir.|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Spotted Horse" or "Spotted Dog" cases in [[Alabama]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Hand v. International Chemical Workers Union|vol=681|reporter=F.2d|opinion=1308|court=11th Cir.|date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cow" case in [[Kansas]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Somers v. Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank|vol=566|reporter=P.2d|opinion=775|court=Kan.Ct.App.|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "White Horse" or "White Pony" cases in [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Wood v. Texas|vol=632|reporter=S.W.2d|opinion=734|court=Tex.Crim.App.|date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legal rule can be "clearly established" without commanding precedent existing. For example, in the United States, a governmental official is generally protected by [[qualified immunity]] if his acts were objectively legally reasonable, but such protection may not apply if, in light of pre-existing law, the unlawfulness of his conduct would have been apparent to a reasonably competent official, even if no commanding precedent applicable to his specific behavior existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Morris v. Dearborne|date=July 16, 1999|url=http://openjurist.org/181/f3d/657/jim-morris-gloria-morris-v-charlotte-hawkins-dearborne-et-al|vol=181|reporter=F3d|opinion=657|court=5th Cir.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a precedent is called '''on all fours''' when all four parts of the instant (or present) case are essentially the same as the mandatory precedent, or are very similar:
# The parties are the same, or have such great similarities as to have exactly the same standing.
# The circumstances involving the two cases are materially the same, or are so similar as not to matter.
# The issue is exactly the same, or if more than one issue exists, they are materially the same types.
# The remedy the plaintiff or petitioner seeks is of the same kind as in the past case.

By comparison, a '''case on point''' is one in which a case has factual circumstances and issues similar to the case being researched, but which has different parties seeking somewhat different remedies.

[[File:Composition5r.jpg|thumb|Composition 1920x1080]]
'''Composition studies''' (also referred to as '''composition and [[rhetoric]]''', '''rhetoric and composition''', '''writing studies''', or simply '''composition''') is the professional field of [[writing]], research, and instruction, focusing especially on writing at the college level in the [[United States]]. In many American colleges and universities, undergraduate [[students]] must take [[freshman]]—sometimes even higher—composition courses. 

Over seventy American universities offer doctoral study in rhetoric and composition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccccdoctoralconsortium.org/members/ Doctoral Consortium in Rhetoric and Composition]&lt;/ref&gt; programs which usually include study of [[Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|composition pedagogical theory]], [[research methodologies in rhetoric and composition]], and [[Rhetoric|the history of rhetoric]]. Many composition [[scholars]] study not only the [[theory]] and practice of post-secondary [[writing]] instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and [[genres]] on writers' composing processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genreacrossborders.org/ Genre Across Borders]&lt;/ref&gt; Composition scholars also publish in the fields of teaching [[English as a second or foreign language]] (TESOL), [[writing center]]s, and [[new literacies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://compfaqs.org/CompFAQs/Home?from=Main.HomePage Comp FAQs from CompPile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-year composition==
{{Main|First-year composition}}
Most US universities have a required [[first-year composition]] course, also referred to as FYC. This is not the same as a [[literature]] course, which focuses on literary analysis and interpretation, although some colleges and universities do incorporate literature and other humanities into their composition courses; often, however, composition courses offer intensive instruction in writing [[non-fiction]], expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize many stages of different writing processes (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc.), along with different modalities of composing to expand the concept of 'writing'. Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies.

==Advanced composition==

Some universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition. Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see {{section link||Writing across the curriculum}} below). For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs.

==Graduate studies==

Doctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at more than seventy universities and Masters's programs are available in over 170 universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdcwss.com Master's Degree Consortium of Writing Studies Specialists]&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs. However, recently there are an increasing number of departments specifically dedicated to this field of study (e.g. Composition Studies, Writing &amp; Rhetoric, Composition &amp; Linguistics, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/04/cccc|title=What Is a Composition and Rhetoric Doctorate?|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second-language writing==
{{Main|Second language writing}}
Second language writing is the practice of teaching English composition to non native speakers and writers of English. Teaching writing to ESL students does not receive much attention because even in ESL classes teachers focus on speaking, listening and reading, not just writing. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]] in his article "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context" stresses the importance of teaching writing specifically with understanding the needs of ESL students to help them improve their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul K. "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context." Written Communication, Sage Publications, 1998, 15 (1), pp 99-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching writing has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States. ESL teachers might need to explore common methods which are the cognitive, social and expressive theories to create an approach that meets the needs of ESL writers and help them to overcome their difficulties.

The first one of these approaches is the cognitive view which says that writing is progressing from one stage to another in a series of single steps. That means "good" writing is a planned process, which includes planning, translating and reviewing. "Understanding Composing" by Sondra Perl explains in detail this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. "Understanding Composing" Handout, Composition Theories, University of Akron, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that the composition of writing occurs as a recursive process. She took this idea from her observation of different writers. She thinks that writers return to "backwards" parts of the process in order to move "forward" with the overall composition. ESL teachers may find this approach helpful at first in teaching beginning ESL students because at this level students do not have large amounts of vocabulary and grammar or knowledge of the style of essays which is the basis of writing English. Al-Buainain Haifa in her article "Student Writing Errors in EFL," points out that, when a researcher asked ESL students by using a survey what they would like to have learned or learned better in their writing classes, they found that the largest percentages expressed specific needs in vocabulary and grammar &lt;ref&gt;Al-Buainain, Haifa. "Student Writing Errors in EFL." Qatar University, 2006, pp 1 -37.&lt;/ref&gt;(17). Many kinds of grammar make ESL students confused, especially because there are many exceptions. Because writing styles are different in different languages, ESL students need time to master them. Therefore, ESL teachers should find an effective way to teach ESL students vocabulary, grammar and style because the writing of English requires them. The cognitive approach can meet these needs because it emphasizes the steps, organization and process of writing.

Another approach is the social view which shows the importance of teaching writing by making students learn the different languages of discourse communities. This is what David Bartholomae emphasizes in his article "Inventing the University".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David "Inventing the University," Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp. 523- 555.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses "Inventing the University" as a phrase that describes the writing process that a student will experience when writing teachers ask them to write about a topic that relates with a discourse community which is new for them. Discourse community can be thought of as members of an academic discipline or a select audience. When the ESL students have become good at grammar and style, they face a large problem when they enter their chosen academic field. Bartholomae in this article illustrates that each academic community has a particular language or vocabulary. The problem is that any academic field has its own language, even jargon, that differs from one to another. This problem is faced not only by ESL students, but all American students will struggle with this when they begin the first year of their academic life. The social approach can be used by ESL teachers as a second step but they should make sure that their students master the basics of English writing such as grammar and style.

Moreover, the expressive view which is represented in Donald Murray's article "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product", allows for wittier creating and freer movement.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald M. "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product." Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests three elements for "good" writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, it is difficult to evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess "good" writing. ESL teachers might use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they possess limited vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach.

ESL teachers may use these common ways of teaching writing, but they need first to understand their student's difficulties. Learning writing is one of the essential difficulties that ESL students find in studying English, especially since writing is important in an academic community. Some ESL students may need to jump from being a student who does not speak English ever to a student who uses academic language in a short time which may put a large burden on their shoulders. Hence, teaching writing to ESL students is different than teaching native speakers. ESL teachers need to choose an effective way to meet the needs of ESL students. It would be helpful if ESL teachers look at these different ways of teaching writing to see which one addresses ESL students' difficulties in the best way or if a combination of these theories may be better.

=== Multicultural pedagogies ===

==== Basis in composition studies ====
While multicultural pedagogies are not specifically tied to second-language writing pedagogies, compositionists have often considered how students' cultural knowledge and use of idioms, dialects, and/or languages other than American Edited English (AEA) can enhance their instruction in English composition. For example, Maxine Hairston's "Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing" advocates for students' expressivist writing to be central in a composition course, and believes students "need to write to find out how much they know and to gain confidence in the ability to express themselves effectively" (186).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hairston|first=Maxine|year=1992|title=Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=43.3|pages=178–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hairston also believes that teachers can design writing assignments to encourage "cross-cultural awareness" (191).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Beth Daniell's approach in "Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture" describes how studies in "little narratives [that] almost all examine literacy in particular local settings" championed by scholars who "seldom make theoretical statements that claim to be valid for literate cultures in general or literate cultures in general," which would allow students to engage in cultural critique (403).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniell|first=Beth|year=1999|title=Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=50|pages=393–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Schutz and Anne Ruggles Gere's article for ''College English'', "Service Learning and English Studies," described how Schutz's course, while it was mainly focused in service learning and local activism, engaged students in collaborative research and writing surrounding campus-wide issues, such as an instance of racial discrimination that occurred in the local student union; this allowed students to engage in cultural awareness as well as cultural critique (129-39).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Aaron|last2=Anne|first2=Gere|year=1998|title=Service Learning and English Studies: Rethinking 'Public Service|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=129–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, In ''Empowering Education,'' Ira Shor delineates a pedagogy in which the teacher facilitates discussion of generative themes produced by the students, using the example of his basic writing course with working-class students at "a low-budget college in New York City" several decades ago (10).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empowering Education: Critical Teaching for Social Change|last=Shor|first=Ira|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-226-14786-4|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=Google Play Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freirean approach for teaching literacy and writing that Shor reviews in ''Empowering Education'' demonstrates how the generative words manifested themselves "[through] researching local issues and language in the students' communities. From the many linguistic and sociological items…the educators selected some key concerns—generative themes expressed through generative words" (55).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this framework, teachers and students research these items collaboratively, and once students have presented their research on problems in their community, they may begin to decide how they might analyze and upend power structures or rhetorical situations that contribute to and exacerbate such issues. For Shor's classroom, "[t]he generative themes [that have] emerg[ed]…from student culture have most often related to sex, abortion, drugs, family, education, careers, work, and the economic crisis" (56).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shor believes it is important to allow students to build a basis for problem-posing upon their prior knowledge and experiences to make it multicultural.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shor also reviews Paolo Freire's literacy project in Brazil as described in Freire's ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'', which enforces the idea that all people are creators of culture through visuals, oral discussion, and creation of word lists that are the basis for which the people begin to use language to express how the dominant culture operates, how their home culture operates, and how these systemic actions impact themselves and the world (Freire 87-124).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 30th Anniversary Edition|last=Freire|first=Paolo|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|translator-last=Ramos|translator-first=Myra|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, both Freire and Shor believe problem-posing education can be situated in multicultural practices as well as critical literacy practices. Shor insists "subject matter is best introduced as problems related to student experience, in language familiar to them" (63).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Critical reception ====
Overall, previous scholars' discussion of multiculturalism in the classroom seems to privilege "cross-cultural interactions" and valuing students' home languages as well as their cultural ideologies. However, in Donald Lazere's ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'', Lazere criticizes Hairston, Daniell, Schutz, Gere, and other scholars for their approaches because of their singular focus on localism in lieu of more "global" and critical approaches to the study of culture in the composition classroom (152-153).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric: Defending Academic Discourse Against Postmodern Pluralism|last=Lazere|first=Donald|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8093-3428-5|location=Carbondale|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lazere was critical of scholars' tendency to diminish the power of Edited American English (EAE) and misrepresent the power of the students' regional code (116).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Lazere supports Shor's approach to multicultural critical pedagogy, he admits some level of discomfort with applying it in his own classroom especially with respect to how much responsibility and stock Shor places in students (39).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Current approaches ====
Lazere's critique of previous scholarship related to multiculturalism pedagogies, in ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'' and elsewhere, has prompted current composition theorists, both in second-language writing and in the field of composition in general, to consider how multicultural pedagogies can embrace globalism as much as localism.

For example, Lisa Eck's "Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally" describes how Eck teaches world literature courses in which students read cultural narratives and problematize them—in the article, she references her use of Tsitsi Dangarembga's ''Nervous Conditions'' in her composition classroom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eck|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=578–598|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her teaching, she is attempting to answer the question of how multicultural pedagogical practices could still be based in research, critical literacy, and problem-posing education. In her approach, she engages students in the kind of literary criticism that is necessary for analyzing and evaluating critical discourse: "I work to make hybrid postcolonial identities familiar, even analogous at times, to what we understand as the process of identity formation for the average postmodern college student….I [also] use the Otherness of the cultures reproduced in foreign texts to estrange the American familiar" (579).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The kinds of inquiry students are using to analyze the text are to show how the text is ''both'' "not about you" and "about you," and how these processes of identity formation are the kinds of processes necessary to critically evaluate public discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Furthermore, Jennifer S. Wilson's approach to critical pedagogy in second-language writing as she describes it in her article, "Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach," utilizes a perspective that provides opportunities for the types of writing necessary for students to critically analyze and evaluate ideologies entrenched in the dominant discourse, even as they are learning English as their second language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Jennifer|year=2010|title=Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach|url=|journal=Composition Forum|volume=22|pages=1–14|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the four major elements of the course that Wilson describes, especially with respect to the ideas she offers for critical writing assignments, create alternative pathways for students to produce writing that has the potential to disrupt cultural and political ideologies represented in various avenues and niches of the dominant public discourse. For example, in addition to incorporating "local topics," Wilson provides options for students to "investigate language use in certain communities, societies, or cultures" as well as "investigating" the relationships between language and power (8-9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even more important, she insists that "[c]ritical pedagogy is concerned with minimizing the power differential between student and teacher; in composition classrooms one way for students to maximize their voices is to publish their work in authentic ways" (9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Writing across the curriculum==
{{Main|Writing across the curriculum}}
Because academic discourse is not monolithic (in other words, there are curricula that address that the concept of academic discourse can be applied to specific parts of a writing curriculum), many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic [[discourse]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/composing-a-community-a-history-of-writing-across-the-curriculum/oclc/318390431&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Composing a community: a history of writing across the curriculum|last=McLeod|first=Susan H|last2=Soven|first2=Margot Iris|date=2006|publisher=Parlor Press|isbn=1932559175|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing in the disciplines==

Many university writing programs include writing in the disciplines (WID) courses, which focus on the genres and writing procedures that occur within specific fields of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/intro/pop2e.cfm|title=The WAC Clearinghouse|website=wac.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing center==
{{Main|Writing center}}
Many colleges and universities have a writing center, which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eataw.eu/ |title=European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing |website=eataw.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, specifically concerns itself with the study and advancement of writing centers in Europe.

Since [[multimodality]] has resonated with Composition Studies, many writing centers have developed associated centers to support students' multimodal, multimedia composing. Some models for this work include the [[digital studio]] and the multiliteracy center.

'''Conditioned taste aversion''' occurs when an animal associates the [[taste]] of a certain food with symptoms caused by a [[toxicity|toxic]], spoiled, or [[poison]]ous substance. Generally, taste aversion is developed after ingestion of food that causes [[nausea]], [[disease|sickness]], or vomiting. The ability to develop a taste aversion is considered an [[Adaptation|adaptive trait]] or survival mechanism that trains the body to avoid poisonous substances (e.g., poisonous berries) before they can cause harm. The association reduces the probability of consuming the same substance (or something that tastes similar) in the future, thus avoiding further poisoning. It is an example of [[classical conditioning|classical or "Pavlovian" conditioning]].

Studies on conditioned taste aversion which involved irradiating rats were conducted in the 1950s by [[John Garcia (psychologist)|Dr. John Garcia]],&lt;ref&gt;Garcia J, Kimeldorf DJ, Koelling RA. Conditioned aversion to saccharin resulting from exposure to gamma radiation. ''Science'' 1955; 122(3160): 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to it sometimes being called the '''Garcia effect'''.

Conditioned taste aversion sometimes occurs when sickness was merely coincidental and not related to the substance that caused the sickness. For example, a person who becomes very sick after consuming vodka-and-orange-juice cocktails may then become averse to the taste of orange juice, even though the sickness was caused by the over-consumption of alcohol. Under these circumstances, conditioned taste aversion is sometimes known as the '''"[[Sauce Bearnaise|Sauce-Bearnaise]] Syndrome"''', a term coined by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Hager.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P. &amp; Hager, J. L. (1972, August). Biological boundaries of learning. The sauce-bearnaise syndrome. ''Psychology Today'', ''V6'', 59-61, 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Garcia's study ==

While studying the effects of radiation on various behaviors in the mid to late 1950s, Dr. John Garcia noticed that rats developed an aversion to substances consumed prior to being irradiated. To examine this, Garcia put together a study in which three groups of rats were given sweetened water followed by either no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation. When rats were subsequently given a choice between sweetened water and regular tap water, rats who had been exposed to radiation drank much less sweetened water than those who had not. Specifically, the total consumption of sweetened water for the no-radiation, mild radiation and strong radiation rats was 80%, 40% and 10%, respectively.

This finding ran contrary to much of the learning literature of the time in that the aversion could occur after just a single trial and over a long delay. Garcia proposed that the sweetened water became regarded negatively because of the nausea inducing effects of the radiation, and so began the study of conditioned taste aversion.

Many scientists were skeptical of Garcia's findings because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning. However, Garcia replicated his results multiple times. He demonstrated that the particular stimulus used in classical conditioning does matter. An internal stimulus produced an internal response while an external stimulus produced an external response; but an external stimulus would not produce an internal response and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hockenbury|first=Don H. Hockenbury, Sandra E.|title=Discovering psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4292-1650-0|pages=197|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==

Taste aversion does not require cognitive awareness to develop&amp;mdash;that is, the subject does not have to consciously recognize a connection between the perceived cause (the taste) and effect (the negative feeling). In fact, the subject may ''hope'' to enjoy the substance, but the body handles it reflexively. Conditioned taste aversion illustrates the argument that in classical conditioning, a response is elicited.

Also, taste aversion generally only requires one trial.  The experiments of [[Ivan Pavlov]] required several pairings of the neutral stimulus (e.g., a ringing bell) with the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., meat powder) before the neutral stimulus elicited a response. With taste aversion, after one association between sickness and a certain food, the food may thereafter elicit the response. In addition, lab experiments generally require very brief (less than a second) intervals between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. With taste aversion, however, the hotdog a person eats at lunch may be associated with the vomiting that person has in the evening.

If the flavor has been encountered before the subject becomes ill, the effect will not be as strong or will not be present. This quality is called [[latent inhibition]]. Conditioned taste aversion is often used in laboratories to study gustation and learning in rats.

Aversions can also be developed to odors as well as to tastes.

Common vampire bats (''Desmodus rotundus'') do not learn taste aversions despite being closely related to other species of bats that do.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe2002&gt;{{Ratcliffe John. [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0003347203920598/1-s2.0-S0003347203920598-main.pdf?_tid=f60c7f4e-ffd7-11e7-af92-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1516669047_f53b3148c97194c238a9a7088848404c "An exception to the rule: common vampire bats do not learn taste aversions"], ''[[Animal Behaviour]]'', Ontario, 21 May 2002. Retrieved on 22 January 2018.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet of common vampire bats only consists of vertebrate blood and therefore it is hypothesized that the development of a taste aversion to their only food source would not be advantageous for these animals.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe2002 /&gt;

== In humans ==

Taste aversion is fairly common in humans. When humans eat bad food (e.g., spoiled meat) and get sick, they may find that food aversive until [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] occurs, if ever. Also, as in nature, a food does not have to ''cause'' the sickness for it to become aversive. A human who eats [[sushi]] for the first time and who happens to come down with an unrelated stomach virus may still develop a taste aversion to sushi. Even something as obvious as riding a roller coaster (causing nausea) after eating the sushi will influence the development of taste aversion to sushi. Humans might also develop aversions to certain types of alcohol because of vomiting during intoxication.

Taste aversion is a common problem with [[chemotherapy]] patients, who become nauseated because of the drug therapy but associate the nausea with consumption of food.

==  Applications ==

Taste aversion has been demonstrated in a wide variety of both captive and free-ranging predators.  In these studies, animals that consume a bait laced with an undetectable dose of an aversion agent avoid both baits and live prey with the same taste and scent as the baits.  When predators detect the aversion agent in the baits, they quickly form aversions to the baits, but discriminate between these and different-tasting live prey.

== Stimulus generalization ==

Stimulus generalization is another learning phenomenon that can be illustrated by conditioned taste aversion. This phenomenon demonstrates that we tend to develop aversions even to types of food that resemble the foods which cause us illness. For example, if one eats an orange and gets sick, one might also avoid eating [[tangerine]]s and [[clementine]]s because they look similar to oranges, and might lead one to think that they are also dangerous.

Stimulus generalization operates in most facets of animal and human life far beyond food tastes and aversion. Trauma and negative reinforcement of all kinds create aversion of other negative reaction to generalizations from the adverse event or events.  And like taste aversion, the generalization may or not be conscious.  Stimulus generalization is a factor in most "superstitious behavior", racism and prejudice of all kinds.

== Compared with taste avoidance==

Although the terms "taste avoidance" and "taste aversion" are often used interchangeably, studies with rats indicate they are not necessarily synonymous. "Aversion" is defined as "a strong dislike or disinclination"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/aversion "Aversion"]. Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and "avoidance" is defined as "stopping oneself from doing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/avoid "Avoid"]. Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that in avoidance, the organism is controlling its behavioural responses. Taste avoidance and taste aversion can at times go hand in hand, but they cannot be looked at or be defined the same way.

Studies on rats to determine how they react to different tasting liquids and injections indicate this difference. Scientists measured the facial and somatic reactions of rats after exposure to a flavored solution (sucrose or salt) which do not induce abnormal feelings. However, immediately after the rat ingests the solution, the rat is injected with a drug that induces nausea. The rat subsequently expresses a disgust reaction towards the solution, seen by mouth gaping. This is a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioned response]] as the rat is associating the disgust with the solution that it drank immediately before the injection. The rat experiences taste ''aversion''.  This is similar to when a human, for example, eats a steak that is perfectly safe and edible and coincidentally contracts a stomach bug and starts vomiting within a few hours of eating the steak. Although the human may know that the vomiting was due to a virus and not from eating the steak, the conditioned response in the brain associates the steak with vomiting due to the timing and the human may avoid steak because he has developed a learned taste aversion to the steak.

When examining taste avoidance, however, the rat may avoid a food yet still enjoy it and choose it over others. In further tests, the rats were tested with another sucrose solution but this time it was paired with a drug that gave positive, euphoric effects, such as [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]], and [[morphine]].  The rats showed positive reactions to the drugs.  However, rats react to any change in physiological state as a sign of danger  and avoided approaching these solutions. When one of these euphoric solutions was placed next to another solution that had a learned taste aversion, the rat would choose the substance that it had a taste avoidance towards. Scientists theorize that in terms of evolution, because rats are unable to vomit and immediately purge toxins, rats have developed a strong "first line of defense", which is their sense of taste and smell. This further shows the importance of taste and the correlation between taste and any change in physiological state, whether it be good or bad. Because rats rely upon taste and pairing it with a reaction rather than relying on later responses that involve the [[gastrointestinal tract]], taste avoidance is just as prevalent as taste aversion, though the two don't necessarily go hand in hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linda A. Parker|title=Taste Avoidance and Taste Aversion: Evidence for Two Different Processes|journal= Animal Learning &amp; Behavior|volume= 31|number=2|year=2003|pages=165-172|accessdate=December 4, 2013|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03195979#|doi=10.3758/BF03195979|pmid=12882375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cue reactivity''' is a type of learned response which is observed in individuals with an [[addiction]] and involves significant physiological and subjective reactions to presentations of drug-related stimuli (i.e., '''drug cues''').&lt;ref name="Meta-analysis"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carter, B.L.  |author2=Tiffany, S.T. |year=1999 |title=Meta-analysis of cue reactivity in addiction research |journal=Addiction |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=327–340 |doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.1999.9433273.x |pmid=10605857|ref=refCarterTiffany1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In investigations of these reactions in drug addicts, changes in self-reported drug craving, physiological responses, and drug use are monitored as they are exposed to drug-related cues (e.g., cigarettes, bottles of alcohol, drug paraphernalia) or drug-neutral cues (e.g., pencils, glasses of water, a set of car keys).

==Scientific findings==
A meta-analysis of 41 cue reactivity studies with people that have an alcohol, heroin, or cocaine addiction strongly supports the finding that people who have addictions have significant cue-specific reactions to drug-related stimuli.&lt;ref name="Meta-analysis" /&gt; In general, these individuals, regardless of drug of abuse, report robust increases in craving and exhibit modest changes in autonomic responses, such as increases in heart rate and skin conductance and decreases in skin temperature, when exposed to drug-related versus neutral stimuli. Surprisingly, despite their obvious clinical relevance, drug use or drug-seeking behaviors are seldom measured in cue reactivity studies. However, when drug-use measures are used in cue reactivity studies the typical finding is a modest increase in drug-seeking or drug-use behavior.

==Development==
{{Further|Incentive salience#Clinical significance}}
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}

==Clinical implications==
Because people with a substance addiction are highly reactive to environmental cues previously associated with drug use, a common treatment strategy is to advise them to avoid people and situations formerly associated with drug use.  For example, a smoker attempting to quit should avoid other smokers and places where smoking is prevalent (like bars in places where smoking is allowed in bars). Although the relationship between cue reactivity in the laboratory and relapse to drug use in the real world is still poorly understood, considerable anecdotal evidence from drug treatment programs and smoking cessation counselors suggests that people with an addiction who seek treatment are more successful at remaining abstinent if they take special care to avoid cues associated with prior drug use.

== Requirements for product durability ==
Product durability is predicated by good reparability and [[Regenerative design|regenerability]] in conjunction with [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]].&lt;ref name="durabilityBook"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=201–203|chapter=New Design Strategy – Product Durability|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every durable product must be capable of adapting to technical, technological and design developments.&lt;ref name=durabilityBook/&gt; This must be accompanied by a willingness on the part of consumers to forego having the "very latest" version of a product.

Durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods that can be demanded by consumers was not clearly established in the United Kingdom until an amendment of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]  relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Ervine|first=Cowan|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=187-188|chapter=Durability and the Law|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electromagnetic''' or '''magnetic induction''' is the production of an [[electromotive force]] (i.e., voltage) across an [[electrical conductor]] in a changing [[magnetic field]].

[[Michael Faraday]] is generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831, and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] mathematically described it as [[Faraday's law of induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] describes the direction of the induced field. Faraday's law was later generalized to become the Maxwell–Faraday equation, one of the four [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]] in his theory of [[electromagnetism]].

Electromagnetic induction has found many applications, including electrical components such as [[inductor]]s and [[transformer]]s, and devices such as [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generator]]s.

[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Faraday's disk (see [[homopolar generator]])]]

Electromagnetic induction was discovered by [[Michael Faraday]], published in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulaby|first=Fawwaz|title=Fundamentals of applied electromagnetics|edition=5th|year=2007|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0132413264/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;v=glance|publisher=Pearson:Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-241326-4|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/history/members/henry.html|title=Joseph Henry|accessdate=2006-11-30|work=Distinguished Members Gallery, National Academy of Sciences|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213121232/http://www.nas.edu/history/members/henry.html|archivedate=2013-12-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered independently by [[Joseph Henry]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Electromagnetism|url=http://web.hep.uiuc.edu/home/serrede/P435/Lecture_Notes/A_Brief_History_of_Electromagnetism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Smithsonian Institution Archives|title=Electromagnetism|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Faraday's first experimental demonstration (August 29, 1831), he wrapped two wires around opposite sides of an iron ring or "[[torus]]" (an arrangement similar to a modern [[toroidal transformer]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a [[galvanometer]], and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it.&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; This induction was due to the change in [[magnetic flux]] that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected.&lt;ref name=Giancoli/&gt; Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady ([[direct current|DC]]) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 191–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday explained electromagnetic induction using a concept he called [[lines of force]]. However, scientists at the time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly because they were not formulated mathematically.&lt;ref name=Williams510&gt;''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; An exception was [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory.&lt;ref name=Williams510/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, James Clerk (1904), ''A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Vol. II, Third Edition. Oxford University Press, pp. 178–9 and 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm "Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday", The Institution of Engineering and Technology.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Maxwell's model, the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation, which [[Oliver Heaviside]] referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's original formulation and does not describe [[#Faraday's law as two different phenomena|motional EMF]]. Heaviside's version (see [[#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation below]]) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]].

In 1834 [[Heinrich Lenz]] formulated the law named after him to describe the "flux through the circuit". [[Lenz's law]] gives the direction of the induced EMF and current resulting from electromagnetic induction.

The magnetic field lines are indicated, with their direction shown by arrows. The magnetic flux corresponds to the 'density of field lines'.

Faraday's law of induction makes use of the [[magnetic flux]] Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; through a region of space enclosed by a wire loop. The magnetic flux is defined by a [[surface integral]]:&lt;ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Phi_\mathrm{B} = \int\limits_{\Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot d \mathbf{A}\ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'''''A''' is an element of the surface Σ enclosed by the wire loop, '''B''' is the magnetic field. The [[dot product]] '''B'''·''d'''''A''' corresponds to an infinitesimal amount of magnetic flux. In more visual terms, the magnetic flux through the wire loop is proportional to the number of [[field line|magnetic flux lines]] that pass through the loop.

When the flux through the surface changes, [[Faraday's law of induction]] says that the wire loop acquires an [[electromotive force]] (EMF).{{refn|group=note|The EMF is the voltage that would be measured by cutting the wire to create an [[Electric circuit|open circuit]], and attaching a [[voltmeter]] to the leads. Mathematically, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the energy available from a unit charge that has traveled once around the wire loop.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;

To increase the generated EMF, a common approach is to exploit [[flux linkage]] by creating a tightly wound [[inductor|coil of wire]], composed of ''N'' identical turns, each with the same magnetic flux going through them. The resulting EMF is then ''N'' times that of one single wire.&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = -N {{d\Phi_\mathrm{B}} \over dt} &lt;/math&gt;

Generating an EMF through a variation of the magnetic flux through the surface of a wire loop can be achieved in several ways:
# the magnetic field '''B''' changes (e.g. an alternating magnetic field, or moving a wire loop towards a bar magnet where the B field is stronger),
# the wire loop is deformed and the surface Σ changes,
# the orientation of the surface ''d'''''A''' changes (e.g. spinning a wire loop into a fixed magnetic field),
# any combination of the above

===Maxwell–Faraday equation===
{{See also|Faraday's law of induction#Maxwell–Faraday equation}}
In general, the relation between the EMF &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; in a wire loop encircling a surface &amp;Sigma;, and the electric field '''E''' in the wire is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = \oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'''''ℓ''' is an element of contour of the surface &amp;Sigma;, combining this with the definition of flux
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_\mathrm{B} = \int\limits_{\Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot d \mathbf{A}\ , &lt;/math&gt;

we can write the integral form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation
:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = -\frac{d}{d t} { \int_{\Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}} &lt;/math&gt;

It is one of the four [[Maxwell's equations]], and therefore plays a fundamental role in the theory of [[classical electromagnetism]].

===Faraday's law and relativity===
Faraday's law describes two different phenomena: the ''motional EMF'' generated by a magnetic force on a moving wire (see [[Lorentz force#Force on a current-carrying wire|Lorentz force]]), and the ''transformer EMF'' this is generated by an electric force due to a changing magnetic field (due to the differential form of the [[#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation]]). [[James Clerk Maxwell]] drew attention to the separate physical phenomena in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Einstein]] noticed that the two situations both corresponded to a relative movement between a conductor and a magnet, and the outcome was unaffected by which one was moving. This was one of the principal paths that led him to develop [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Electrical generator===
[[Image:Spindle.PNG|thumb|293x293px|Rectangular wire loop rotating at angular velocity ω in radially outward pointing magnetic field '''B''' of fixed magnitude. The circuit is completed by brushes making sliding contact with top and bottom discs, which have conducting rims. This is a simplified version of the ''drum generator''.]]
{{Main article|Electric generator}}
The EMF generated by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and a magnetic field is the phenomenon underlying [[electrical generator]]s. When a [[magnet|permanent magnet]] is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an [[electrical load]], current will flow, and thus [[electrical energy]] is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the ''drum generator'' is based upon the figure to the bottom-right. A different implementation of this idea is the [[Homopolar generator|Faraday's disc]], shown in simplified form on the right.

In the Faraday's disc example, the disc is rotated in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. Mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through [[Ampère's circuital law]] (labelled "induced B" in the figure). The rim thus becomes an [[electromagnet]] that resists rotation of the disc (an example of [[Lenz's law]]). On the far side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the far side of the rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to ''decrease'' the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the ''increase'' in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field ''increases'' the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the ''decrease'' in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to [[friction]], [[Joule heating]], and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting [[mechanical energy]] to electrical energy.

===Electrical transformer===
{{Main article|Transformer}}
When the electric current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience this change in magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, ''d'' Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; / ''d t''. Therefore, an electromotive force is set up in the second loop called the induced EMF or transformer EMF. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.

====Current clamp====
[[File:Current Clamp.jpg|thumb|150px|A current clamp]]
{{Main article|Current clamp}}

A current clamp is a type of transformer with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make electrical contact with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.

===Magnetic flow meter===
{{Main article|Magnetic flow meter}}
Faraday's law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage ℇ generated in the magnetic field ''B'' due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity ''v'' is thus given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}= - B \ell v,&lt;/math&gt;

where ℓ is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.

==Eddy currents==
{{main article|Eddy current}}
Conductors (of finite dimensions) moving through a uniform magnetic field, or stationary within a changing magnetic field, will have currents induced within them. These induced eddy currents can be undesirable, since they dissipate energy in the resistance of the conductor.
There are a number of methods employed to control these undesirable inductive effects.
* Electromagnets in electric motors, generators, and transformers do not use solid metal, but instead use thin sheets of metal plate, called ''laminations''. These thin plates reduce the parasitic eddy currents, as described below.
* Inductive coils in electronics typically use [[magnetic core]]s to minimize parasitic current flow. They are a mixture of metal powder plus a resin binder that can hold any shape. The binder prevents parasitic current flow through the powdered metal.

===Electromagnet laminations===
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 292 - Eddy currents in a solid armature.jpg|300px|left]]
Eddy currents occur when a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal cuts more lines of force than the inner portion, hence the induced electromotive force not being uniform, tends to set up currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.&lt;ref name="Imagesand"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Images and reference text are from the public domain book: [[Hawkins Electrical Guide]], Volume 1, Chapter 19: Theory of the Armature, pp. 270–273, Copyright 1917 by Theo. Audel &amp; Co., Printed in the United States&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 293 - Armature core with a few laminations showing effect on eddy currents.jpg|300px|left]]
Only five laminations or plates are shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch, and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.&lt;ref name="Imagesand" /&gt;
{{clear}}
[[File:Small DC Motor pole laminations and overview.jpg|300px|left]]
This is a rotor approximately 20mm in diameter from a DC motor used in a {{nowrap|CD player.}} Note the laminations of the electromagnet pole pieces, used to limit parasitic inductive losses.
{{clear}}

===Parasitic induction within conductors===
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 291 - Formation of eddy currents in a solid bar inductor.jpg|300px|left]]
In this illustration, a solid copper bar conductor on a rotating armature is just passing under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.&lt;ref name="Imagesand"/&gt;

High current power-frequency devices, such as electric motors, generators and transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel to break up the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] and the [[intermediate frequency]] coupling transformers of radio receivers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">'''Elsa Gindler''' (19 June 1885 – 8 January 1961) was a somatic [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] pioneer in [[Germany]].

Born in [[Berlin]], [[gymnastics]] teacher, student of Hedwig Kallmeyer (who, in turn, had been a student of [[Genevieve Stebbins]]).

From her personal experience of recovering from tuberculosis (by concentrating on breathing only with her healthy lung and resting the diseased lung), Gindler originated a school of movement education, in close collaboration with [[Heinrich Jacoby]].&lt;ref name="Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] |pages= 226–8 |isbn= 978-0-307-57550-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Gindler had called ''Arbeit am Menschen'' (work on the human being) emphasised self-observation and growing understanding of one's individual physically related condition. Simple actions such as sitting, standing, and walking were explored, as well as other everyday movements.

This became one of the bases of [[body psychotherapy]] since many of the most influential body psychotherapists studied with her or "Sensory Awareness" with [[Charlotte Selver]] at the [[Esalen Institute]] around 1962.

During the [[Nazi]]-period of Germany, Gindler used these investigations and experimental exercises with her students to covertly help people who were persecuted by the regime.&lt;ref name="Knaster" /&gt; For her assistance to the [[Jewish]] population of Berlin, she was distinguished as a [[righteous among the nations]] and a tree was planted in [[Yad Vashem]] in her honour.

== Students and Collaborators ==

Gindler's collaborators included
* [[Emmi Pikler]]
* [[Heinrich Jacoby]] (whose students included [[Moshe Feldenkrais]])

Several of Gindler's students went on to become influential teachers themselves:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Gindler's student [[Charlotte Selver]] emigrated to the United States in 1938, and later became one of the first teachers at
[[Esalen Institute]] where she would frequently credit Gindler. Through Selver's [[Sensory Awareness]] workshops
at Esalen and elsewhere, Gindler's work indirectly influenced most of the [[Somatics|somatic]] teachers in the United States, including [[Ida P. Rolf]], founder of [[Rolfing|Rolfing Structural Integration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=E.|title=Structural Integration: Origins and Development.|journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|date=2011|pages=775–780|url=http://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2011.0001|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional reasoning''' is a [[cognitive]] process by which a person concludes that his/her emotional reaction proves something is true, regardless of the observed evidence.  For example, even though a spouse has shown only devotion, a person using emotional reasoning might conclude, "I know my spouse is being unfaithful because I feel jealous."

Emotional reasoning amplifies the effects of other [[cognitive distortion]]s. For example, a test-taker may feel insecure about their understanding of the material even though they are perfectly capable of answering the questions. If he (or she) acts on his insecurity about failing the written test he might assume that he misunderstands the material and therefore might guess answers randomly, causing his own failure in a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].

==Origin==
Emotional reasoning, as a concept, was first introduced by psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]].&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckinstitute.org/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/#q-n-a-71|title=Frequently asked questions|work=Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907234420/http://www.beckinstitute.org/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/#q-n-a-71|archivedate=September 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included as a part of Beck's broader research topic: cognitive distortions and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. To counteract cognitive distortions, Beck developed a type of therapy formally known as cognitive therapy, which became associated with [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Cognitive Therapy|url=http://www.beckinstitute.org/history-of-cbt/|work=Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214021139/http://www.beckinstitute.org/history-of-cbt/|archivedate=December 14, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, emotional reasoning was attributed to automatic thinking. Beck believed that emotional reasoning stemmed from negative thoughts that were uncontrollable and happened without effort.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; This reasoning has been commonly accepted over the years. Most recently, a new explanation states that an "activating agent" or sensory trigger from the environment increases emotional arousal.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite web|author=Shona Adams|url=http://www.hgi.org.uk/downloads/HG_Theory_of_Cognitive_Distortions_by_Shona_Adams.pdf|format=PDF|title=Human Givens Theory of Cognitive Distortions|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010114238/http://www.hgi.org.uk/downloads/HG_Theory_of_Cognitive_Distortions_by_Shona_Adams.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this increase in arousal, certain areas of the brain are inhibited.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; Combining the increase in emotional arousal with the inhibition of parts of the brain leads to emotional reasoning.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

==Treatment==
Before seeking professional help, an individual can influence the effect that emotional reasoning has on them based on his or her [[Coping (psychology)|coping method]]. Using a proactive problem-focused coping style leads to more effectiveness at reducing stress and stressful events.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/2007_Coping%20Resources,%20Coping%20Processes,%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf|authors=Shelley E. Taylor, Annette L. Stanton|title=Coping Resources, Coping Processes, and Mental Health|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|year=2007|volume=3|pages=377–401|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719175833/http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/2007_Coping%20Resources%2C%20Coping%20Processes%2C%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf|archivedate=July 19, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091520|pmid=17716061|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, having good social support also leads to lower psychological stress.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; If one has to seek professional help, the most common therapy method is cognitive-behavioral therapy. In this approach, the automatic thoughts that control emotional reasoning are studied and realistically reasoned by the patient.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; In doing so, the psychologist hopes to change the automatic thoughts of the patient and reduce his/her stress levels.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; Cognitive behavioral therapy has been generally regarded as the most effective method of treatment for emotional reasoning. Most recently, a new therapeutic approach uses the RIGAAR method to reduce emotional stress.&lt;ref name=HumanGivens&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Linda Hoggan, Carmen Kane|title="Just what we need"|url=http://pragmaticresearchnetwork.org.uk/just_what_we_need.pdf|journal=Human Givens Journal|year=2008|format=PDF|volume=15|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RIGAAR''' stands for: 
*rapport building
*information gathering
*goal setting
*accessing resources
*agreeing strategies
*rehearsing success&lt;ref name=HumanGivens/&gt;

Additionally, reducing emotional arousal is also suggested by the [[human givens]] approach as a way to stop emotional reasoning.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; As seen above, high emotional arousal inhibits brain regions necessary for logical complex reasoning. With less emotional arousal, cognitive reasoning is not diminished and the potential to not associate oneself with his or her emotions is stronger.

==Implications==
If not treated, debilitating effects can occur, the most common being depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knaus|first1=William|title=The Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression: A Step-by-Step Program|date=1 June 2012|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|page=255|edition=Second|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, emotional reasoning has the potential to be good when used to appraise the outside world and not ourselves. It is useful when one has to emotionally appraise something. Judging by how one feels when assessing the object, person, or event, it can be an instinctual survival response and a way to adapt to our world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazarus|first1=Richard|title=Passion and Reason: Making Sense of our Emotions|date=11 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=3|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The amygdala buried deep in the limbic system serves as an early warning device for novelty, precisely so that attention can be mobilized to alert the mind to a potential danger and to prepare for a potential of flight or fight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kellogg|first1=Ronald|title=The Making of the Mind: The Neuroscience of Human Nature|date=16 July 2013|publisher=Prometheus Books|page=176|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3395">The '''end-of-the-day betting effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] reflected in the tendency for bettors to take gambles with higher risk and higher reward at the end of their betting session to try to make up for losses. William McGlothlin (1956) and Mukhtar Ali (1977) first discovered this effect after observing the shift in betting patterns at horserace tracks. Mcglothlin and Ali noticed that people are significantly more likely to prefer longshots to conservative bets on the last race of the day. They found that the movement towards longshots, and away from favorites, is so pronounced that some studies show that conservatively betting on the favorite to show (to finish first, second, or third) in the last race is a profitable bet despite the track’s take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=Mukhtar M.|year=1977|title=Probability and utility estimates for racetrack bettors|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=85|number=4|pages=803–815|doi=10.1086/260600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlothlin|first=William H.|year=1956|title=Stability of choices among uncertain alternatives|journal=American Journal of Psychology|volume=69|number=4|pages=604–615|doi=10.2307/1419083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[Expected utility hypothesis]] cannot explain the shift in risk preferences across the day if bettors integrate their wealth because the last race of the day is not fundamentally different from the first. [[Prospect theory]] can explain the shift by assuming people open a mental account at the beginning of the day, close it at the end, and hate closing an account in the red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Choices, Values, and Frames. New York|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|year=2000|page=296|isbn=978-0-521-62749-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end-of-the-day betting effect is consistent with the [[risk aversion]]/[[risk seeking]] behaviors associated with prospect theory, which state that people are more likely to be risk averse in the case of gains and risk seeking in the case of losses. Prospect theory claims that people begin with zero daily profit as a reference point and gamble in the domain of losses to break even. Because the racetrack takes a hefty bite out of each dollar, most people are down money when the last races near. Anything below this target is regarded as a loss and triggers risk-seeking behavior in an attempt to break even. Diminishing sensitivity to successive losses means that the cost of the last bet is relatively trivial compared to what has already been spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardman|first=David|title=Judgment and Decision Making. Malden, MA|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|page=70|isbn=978-1-4051-2398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betters refrain from making bets that would not recoup their losses if successful.

==Example==
John and Bob go to the casino to play [[roulette]]. After two hours of playing their wives tell them that they must leave after one more spin. John is up $200. Bob is down $320. The end-of-the-day betting effect says that John is more likely to make a low risk bet, such as betting on red or black (1:1 odds), while Bob is more likely to make a bet that can recoup his losses if he is successful, such as betting $10 on 3 single numbers (35:1 odds each).

'''Ethnic cleansing''' is the systematic forced removal of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or racial groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically [[homogeneous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Rubenstein |title=The Cultural Landscape: An Introduction to Human Geography |publisher=Pearson, |year=2008 |isbn=9780131346819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} The forces applied may be various forms of [[forced migration]] ([[deportation]], [[population transfer]]), intimidation, as well as [[genocide]] and [[genocidal rape]].

Ethnic cleansing is usually accompanied with efforts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.

Initially used by the perpetrators during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and cited in this context as a euphemism akin to that of Nazi Germany's "[[Final Solution]]", by the 1990s, the term gained widespread acceptance due to journalism and the media's heightened use of the term in its generic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thum |first1= Gregor |year= 2006–2007 |title= Ethnic Cleansing in Eastern Europe after 1945 |journal= Contemporary European History |volume= 19 |issue=1 |pages= 75–81 |doi=10.1017/S0960777309990257 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
An antecedent to the term is the Greek word ''andrapodismos'' ({{lang-gr|ανδραποδισμός}}; lit. "enslavement"), which was used in ancient texts to describe atrocities that accompanied [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in 335 BC.&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Booth|year=2012|title=The Kosovo Tragedy: The Human Rights Dimensions|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-13633-476-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4MsBgAAQBAJe|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, regional variants of the term could be found among the Czechs ''(očista)'', the Poles ''(oczyszczanie)'', the French ''(épuration)'' and the Germans ''(Säuberung)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Ther |editor1=Rainer Munz |editor2=Rainer Ohliger |year=2004 |title=Diasporas and Ethnic Migrants: Germany, Israel and Russia in Comparative Perspective |chapter=The Spell of the Homogeneous Nation State: Structural Factors and Agents of Ethnic Cleansing |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-13575-938-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEOQAgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} A 1913 [[Carnegie Endowment]] report condemning the actions of all participants in the [[Balkan Wars]] contained various new terms to describe brutalities committed toward ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://balkanologie.revues.org/2365|title=The Two Carnegie Reports: From the Balkan Expedition of 1913 to the Albanian Trip of 1921|first=Nadine|last=Akhund|date=December 31, 2012|publisher=|journal=Balkanologie.

[[File:Lipikach.jpg|thumb|right|[[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia]] in 1943. Most [[Poles]] of Volhynia (now in Ukraine) had either been murdered or had fled the area.]]

In its complete form, the term appeared for the first time in the Romanian language (''purificare etnică'') in an address by Vice Prime Minister [[Mihai Antonescu]] to cabinet members in July 1941.

The official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or [[intimidation]] to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Robert M.

As a category, ethnic cleansing encompasses a continuum or spectrum of policies. In the words of [[Andrew Bell-Fialkoff]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with deportation and genocide. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html "A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203000000/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html |date=February 3, 2004 }}, ''Foreign Affairs'' 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993.

[[Terry Martin (publisher)|Terry Martin]] has defined ethnic cleansing as "the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory" and as "occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end".&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, Terry (1998). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/235168 "The Origins of Soviet Ethnic Cleansing"]. ''[[The Journal of Modern History]]'' 70 (4), 813–861. pg. 822&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] in the judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on July 12, 2007 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide'':
{{quote|The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are the subject of this case ... [UN] General Assembly resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of "ethnic cleansing", which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [i.e., ethnic cleansing] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [Genocide] Convention, if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area "ethnically homogeneous", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can ''as such'' be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is "to destroy, in whole or in part" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''dolus specialis''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the ICTY has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' (''Krstić'', IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide.' |ECHR quoting the ICJ.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-81608 ''Jorgic v. Germany''] §45 citing ''Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro'' ("Case concerning application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found under the heading of “intent and ‘ethnic cleansing’” (at § 190)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a crime under international law==

There is no international treaty that specifies a specific crime of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ward |last=Ferdinandusse |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |title=The Interaction of National and International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705180121/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=5 |year=2004 |p=1042, note 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense—the forcible deportation of a population—is defined as a [[crime against humanity]] under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm "Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113100723/http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm |date=January 13, 2008 }}, Article 7; [https://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under public international law of [[crimes against humanity]] and in certain circumstances [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daphna |last=Shraga |first2=Ralph |last2=Zacklin |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |title=The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233818/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=3 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however situations, such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]], where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see [[Preussische Treuhand v. Poland|''Preussische Treuhand'' v. Poland]]). [[Timothy V. Waters]] argues therefore that similar ethnic cleansing could go unpunished in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy V. Waters, [http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&amp;context=expresso "On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing"], Paper 951, 2006, [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law. Retrieved on 2006, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there – thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity". For example, the post-WWII [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--&gt;

==Genocide==
[[File:Armenianvictimsassault.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Genocide]] victims]]
Academic discourse considers both [[genocide]] and ethnic cleansing to exist in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or population transfer whereas genocide is the intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic, racial, religious, or national group. While ethnic cleansing and genocide may share the same goal and the acts used to perpetrate both crimes may often resemble each other, ethnic cleansing is intended to displace a persecuted population from a given territory, while genocide is intended to destroy a population.&lt;ref name=Schabas&gt;{{cite book |last=Schabas |first=William |year=2000 |title=Genocide in International Law |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=199–201 |isbn=9780521787901}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some academics consider genocide as a subset of "murderous ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |year=2005 |title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Dark+Side+of+Democracy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=17 |isbn=9780521538541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these concepts are different, but related, as Norman Naimark writes: "literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people".&lt;ref name=MassVio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Naimark |first=Norman |date=4 November 2007 |url=http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |title=Theoretical Paper: Ethnic Cleansing |encyclopedia=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306173512/http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |archivedate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Schabas adds, "Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come.

In 1946 [[Königsberg]] was renamed [[Kaliningrad]]. The survivors of the German population were forcibly expelled and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens.

In the 1990s [[Bosnian war]], ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon. It typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group, as well as the destruction or removal of key physical and cultural elements. These included places of worship, cemeteries, works of art and historic buildings. According to numerous ICTY verdicts, both Serb&lt;ref name="ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414072922/http://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Croat&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627000306/http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forces performed ethnic cleansing of their intended territories in order to create ethnically pure states ([[Republika Srpska]] and [[Herzeg-Bosnia]]).

Based on the evidence of numerous attacks by Croat forces against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993, the Croat leadership from Bosnia and Herzegovina had a designated plan to ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley in Central Bosnia. Dario Kordić, the local political leader, was found to be the instigator of this plan.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict - IV. Attacks on towns and villages: killings - C.

In the same year (1993), ethnic cleansing was also occurring in another country. During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], the armed [[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]] [[separatist]] insurgency implemented a campaign of [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] against the large population of ethnic Georgians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an NEUTRAL expert opinion this sentence is OR.

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of systemic impacts. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians—recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany]] after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had encouraged Nazi [[jingoism]] before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} It thus establishes "[[facts on the ground]]"—radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.

==Silent ethnic cleansing==

Silent ethnic cleansing is a term coined in the mid-1990s by some observers of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Apparently concerned with Western media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict—which generally focused on those perpetrated by the Serbs—atrocities committed against [[Serbs]] were dubbed "silent" on the grounds that they did not receive adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthammer, Charles: "When Serbs Are 'Cleansed,' Moralists Stay Silent", ''International Herald Tribune'', August 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some incidents in [[Northern Ireland]] and during [[the Troubles]] between Protestants and Catholics were considered to be "ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/10/northernireland.race|title=Racist war of the loyalist street gangs|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=January 10, 2004|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/06/07/news/unionist-react-angrily-to-ira-ethnic-cleansing-plan-550226/|title=Unionists react angrily to IRA ‘ethnic cleansing' border plan|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included events after the [[Holy Cross dispute]] in 2001 when Protestant paramilitaries were accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing of Catholics in north [[Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1974017.stm|title=Fresh trouble in Belfast|date=May 8, 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/09/northernireland.rosiecowan|title='Ethnic cleansing' claim over Ulster attacks|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|date=September 9, 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases where accusations of ethnic cleansing have circulated, partisans have fiercely disputed such an interpretation and the details of the events which have been described as ethnic cleansing by academic or legal experts. This often leads to the promotion of vastly different versions of the event in question.

==Criticism of the term==
[[Gregory Stanton]], the founder of [[Genocide Watch]], has criticised the rise of the term and its use for events that he feels should be called "genocide": as "ethnic cleansing" has no legal definition, its media use can detract attention from events that should be prosecuted as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blum |first=Rony |last2=Stanton |first2=Gregory H. |last3=Sagi |first3=Shira |last4=Richter |first4=Elihu D. |title='Ethnic cleansing' bleaches the atrocities of genocide |journal=European Journal of Public Health |year=2007 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=17513346 |pages=204–209 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Intent: A Failure of Judicial Interpretation?", ''Genocide Studies and Prevention'' 5, 1 (April 2010), Douglas Singleterry&lt;/ref&gt; Because of widespread acceptance after media influence, it has become a term used legally, but carries no legal repercussions as there is no legal definition.

The conference was the fourth in the series of Conferences on [[environmental education]] held since the first international conference in [[Tbilisi]] (former [[USSR]]). The second conference was organised in 1977 in [[Moscow]]; and the third conference was held in [[Thessaloniki]] in 1997. The United Nations has declared the decade 2005 to 2014 as the "Decade of Education for Sustainable Development" (DESD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenerbuildings.com/event_detail.cfm?LinkAdvID=91593 |title=4th International Conference on Environmental Education: 'Environmental Education towards a Sustainable Future – Partners for the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development' |accessdate=2007-11-23 |work=Green Buildings |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019231309/http://greenerbuildings.com/event_detail.cfm?LinkAdvID=91593 |archivedate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference underlined the key role of education in achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.icnb.pt/ICNPortal/vPT/Agenda/Files/EA.htm?res=1280x800 |title=Environmental Education towards a Sustainable Future - Partners for DESD |accessdate=2007-11-24 |work=Instituto da Conservacao da Natureza }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants and delegates from countries across the globe came together to bridge the gap between environmental education and [[Education for Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref name="french" /&gt; They examined the development of environmental education since the first conference, thirty years ago, and set a global agenda for the DESD. This will be a platform for sharing practices and ideas on initiatives in environmental education throughout the world.&lt;ref name="eGov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/16024 |title=Promoting environmental education towards a sustainable future |accessdate=2007-11-24 |work=eGov Monitor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710173338/http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/16024 |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a significant amount of participation in workshops on topics including "Education for Sustainable Development" and "Teacher Education," research for DESD, "DESD Monitoring and Evaluation," "ESD and Media," "Man and [[Biosphere Reserves]]" and "[[World Heritage Sites]]" as learning sites for environmental development, "Floods and Disaster Reduction" and "Education for Sustainable Consumption".&lt;ref name="eGov" /&gt;

The '''Fundación Mujeres en Igualdad''' ('''MEI'''), known in English as the '''Women in Equality Foundation''', is an Argentine [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] created in March 1990. It has been awarded consultative status with [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/quienes-somos.html|title=Women in Equality Foundation|website=|publisher=Women in Equality Foundation|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation sets out to combat gender based violence and discrimination against women by promoting welfare, participation and empowerment in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/nuestros-temas.html|title=Mujeres en Igualdad. Nuestros Temas.|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception Women in Equality promoted the use of the [[Information and communications technology|new technologies]] intensively, being the first women´s NGO in Argentina to have a website. Through such initiatives it has networked and created partnerships with NGOs and with the women's movement both at the national and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entremujeres.clarin.com/genero/toda-clase-maltrato_0_1334869890.html|title=Contra toda clase de maltrato|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Mujeres en Igualdad Foundation has its offices in Florida, [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;Not the US state of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Women in Equality was Zita Montes de Oca,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apdh-argentina.org.ar/sites/default/files/Las%20conquistas%20de%20las%20mujeres.pdf|title=Las conquistas de las mujeres. APDH|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Monique Thiteux- Altschul as its executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/integrantes-del-consejo.html|title=Consejo MEI|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I had the privilege to accompany her in the creation of Mujeres en Igualdad in 1990, when the women´s movement set out to enact an electoral quota law: a tough goal to attain but which would ensure critical changes for women in the political field. Since then, we shared eight years of feminism, friendship and hard work, as well as the discovery of the digital world into which we dived with a passion, seeing how the networks that Zita had built from within the public sphere, grew, tied together, were enriched both in the way we communicated as well as on the issues we discussed.| Monique Thiteux-Altschul&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zita Montes de Oca: la funcionaria y la feminista=|url=http://www.apdh-argentina.org.ar/sites/default/files/Las%20conquistas%20de%20las%20mujeres.pdf|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Fields of advocacy ==
* [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights): "For the human rights of the LGBT community" Project, sponsored by the Embassy of the United States of America in Buenos Aires.
* Gender violence: "Seven voices against gender based violence" Project, coordinated by MEI and executed with the Office of Domestic Violence, the Office of Women in the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice, and the Women Judges Association of Argentina, with the Office of Victims against Violence of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, Vital Voices of Argentina and the Avon Foundation. With the support of International Avon Foundation and Vital Voices Partnership.
* Clothes sizes law in Argentina: Mujeres en Igualdad was and is a consultant for National and Provincial laws on clothes sizes, and organizes monitoring and broadcasting campaigns.
* Gender and corruption: : Mujeres en Igualdad participated in the 1st Encuentro del Comité de Estrategia de la Coordinación de la Coalición [[UNCAC]] (United Nations Convention against Corruption) held in  Vienna in June 2014, and became Regional Site for the Americas, UNCAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeranticorrupcion.org.ar/|title=Mujer anticorrupción.|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender and sports: Mujeres en Igualdad has developed a team specially devoted to reverse cases of discrimination in sports. In 2012 the Foundation presented a draft for a law at the Women´s Parliament of the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires dealing with a compulsion for non profit civil associations, sports clubs and sports federations to include equality of gender considerations in the Ruling Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/litigios-contra-la-discriminacion.html|title=Género y deportes|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human trafficking: In 2003 Mujeres en Igualdad created the No to Trafficking Network that it coordinated through 2005, and organized numerous seminars and training workshops, with strong media support. The “Empowering Young women in the frontiers: Gender violence and human trafficking” project, financed by UN Women 2010-11 focused on young women in borderland regions (Jujuy/La Quiaca; Posadas/Encarnación) for them to become familiar with and exercise their rights and organize to prevent gender violence and human trafficking. They were qualified to carry out basic strategies in participative democracy with an emphasis on gender equality: requests for valid information (access to information), advocacy campaigns and claims and grievances were presented to accountable office holders in the light of non compliance with their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/notas/238953-alertan-sujeto-que-busca-chicas-una-red-trata|title=Trata de personas en Argentina|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Woman and politics: Mujeres en Igualdad was and continues to promote the warranties awarded by the Quota Law, by considering it a critical factor that explains the high degree of representation of women in Argentina´s political life. Internationally, Argentina occupies the fifth place with 39,1% of women in parliamentary duties. In this field, MEI continues to deepen its activities in order to generate reforms to guarantee equality of men and women citizens and carries out campaigns to achieve parity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/mujer-y-pol%C3%ADtica.html|title=Mujer y política|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Litigation on discrimination: The Freddo case, and Instituto Romero Brest case. In both, MEI acted as a litigant in both the Freddo company, as well as Physical Education institution, which included the criteria of Non Discrimination and Gender Equality in their policies and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/litigios-contra-la-discriminacion.html|title=Freddo-Mujeres se buscan|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''[[fundamental theorem]] of [[linear algebra]]''' makes several statements regarding [[vector space]]s. Those statements may be given concretely in terms of the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] ''r'' of an {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''A'' and its [[singular value decomposition]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A=U\mathit\Sigma V^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;

First, each matrix &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; rows and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; columns) induces four ''fundamental [[linear subspace|subspaces]]''. These ''fundamental subspaces'' are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!name of subspace
!definition
!containing space
![[Hamel dimension|dimension]]
![[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]
|-
|[[column space]], range or [[image (mathematics)|image]]
|&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}(A)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{range} (A)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; ([[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]])
|The first &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; columns of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[nullspace]] or [[Kernel (matrix)|kernel]]
|&lt;math&gt;\ker(A)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{null} (A)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;n - r&lt;/math&gt; (nullity)
|The last &lt;math&gt;(n - r)&lt;/math&gt; columns of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[row space]] or [[coimage]]
|&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}(A^\mathrm{T})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{range} (A^\mathrm{T})&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; ([[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]])
|The first &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; columns of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[left nullspace#Left null space|left nullspace]] or [[cokernel]]
|&lt;math&gt;\ker(A^\mathrm{T})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{null} (A^\mathrm{T})&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;m - r&lt;/math&gt; (corank)
|The last &lt;math&gt;(m - r)&lt;/math&gt; columns of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Secondly:

# In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ker(A) = (\operatorname{im}(A^\mathrm{T}))^\perp&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the nullspace is the [[orthogonal complement]] of the row space
# In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ker(A^\mathrm{T}) = (\operatorname{im}(A))^\perp&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the left nullspace is the orthogonal complement of the column space.
[[File:The four subspaces.svg|center|600px|thumb|The four subspaces associated to a matrix ''A''.]]

The dimensions of the subspaces are related by the [[rank–nullity theorem]], and follow from the above theorem.

Further, all these spaces are intrinsically defined—they do not require a choice of basis—in which case one rewrites this in terms of abstract vector spaces, operators, and the [[dual space]]s as &lt;math&gt;A\colon V \to W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A^* \colon W^* \to V^*&lt;/math&gt;: the kernel and image of &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt; are the cokernel and coimage of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5285">The '''gravitational metric system''' (original French term {{lang|fr|Système des Méchaniciens}}) is a non-standard system of units, which does not comply with the [[International System of Units]] (SI). It is built on the three [[base quantity|base quantities]] [[length]], [[time]] and [[force]] with [[base unit (measurement)|base units]] [[metre]], [[second]] and [[kilopond]] respectively. Internationally used abbreviations of the system are '''MKpS''', '''MKfS''' or '''MKS''' (from French {{lang|fr|mètre–kilogramme-poids–seconde}} or {{lang|fr|mètre–kilogramme-force–seconde}}).&lt;ref name="cardarelli"&gt;

|page=19
|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media
|year=2003
|ISBN=185233682X
|url={{google books|BookID=6KCx8Ww75VkC|page=17}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the abbreviation MKS is also used for the [[MKS system of units]], which, like the SI, uses [[mass]] in [[kilogram]] as a base unit.

== Disadvantages ==

Nowadays, the mass as a property of an object and its weight, which depends on the gravity of the earth at its position are strictly distinguished. However historically, the kilopond was also called kilogram, and only later the kilogram-mass (today's kilogram) was separated from the kilogram-force (today's kilopond). A kilopond originally referred to the weight of a mass of one kilogram. Since the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the earth can differ, one gets different values for the unit kilopond and its derived units at different locations. To avoid this, the kilopond was first defined at sea-level and a [[latitude]] of 45 degrees, since 1902 via the [[standard gravity]] of {{val|9.80665|u=m/s2}}.

Further disadvantages are inconsistencies in the definition of derived units such as [[horsepower]] (1&amp;nbsp;PS = 75&amp;nbsp;kp⋅m/s) and the missing link to electric, magnetic or thermodynamic units.&lt;ref name="cardarelli" /&gt;

In Germany, the kilopond lost its legal status as a unit of force on the first of January 1978 and is replaced by SI units. A kilopond can be converted to the SI unit Newton by multiplication with the standard acceleration ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:
:1 kp = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ 1&amp;nbsp;kg = {{val|9.80665|u=kg⋅m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{val|9.80665|u=N}}

== Units ==

===Force===
In English contexts the unit of force is usually formed by simply appending the suffix "force" to the name of the unit of mass, thus ''gram-force'' (gf) or ''[[kilogram-force]]'' (kgf, which follows the tradition of [[pound-force]] (lbf). In other, international contexts the special name ''pond'' (p) or ''kilopond'' (kp) respectively is more frequent.
; 1 p = 1 gf := 1 g ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.80665 g⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 980.665 g⋅cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 980.665 [[Dyne|dyn]]
; 1 kp = 1&amp;nbsp;kgf := 1&amp;nbsp;kg ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.80665&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 980665 g⋅cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

===Mass===
The hyl, metric slug (mug), or TME (German: technische Masseneinheit, technical mass unit), is the mass that accelerates at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; under a force of 1&amp;nbsp;kgf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numericana.com/answer/units.htm#slug Measurements, Units of Measurement, Weights and Measures – Numericana]&lt;/ref&gt; The hyl has also been used as the unit of mass in a metre–gram-force–second (mgfs) system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/units/sys_MKGFS.htm metre–kilogram-force–second systems of units]&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1 TME := 1 kp / 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 kp⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m = {{val|9.80665|u=kg}}
; 1 hyl := 1 kp⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m = {{val|9.80665|u=kg}} ''or''
; 1 hyl (alternate definition – mgfs) := 1 p⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m = {{val|9.80665|u=g}}

===Pressure===
The (only) gravitational unit of pressure is the [[technical atmosphere]] (at). It is the gravitational force of one kilogram, i.e. 1&amp;nbsp;kgf, exerted on an area of one square centimetre.
; 1 at := 1 kp/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&amp;nbsp;000 × ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 98&amp;nbsp;066.5&amp;nbsp;kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 98.066&amp;nbsp;5 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]

===Energy===
There is no dedicated name for the unit of energy, “metre” is simply appended to “[[Kilogram-force|kilopond]]”, but usually the symbol of the kilopond-metre is written without the middle dot.
; 1 kpm := 1 kp⋅m = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg⋅m = 9.806&amp;nbsp;65&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9.806&amp;nbsp;65 J

===Power===
In 19th-century France there was as a unit of power, the [[poncelet]], which was defined as the power required to raise a mass of 1 [[quintal]] (1 q = 100&amp;nbsp;kg) at a velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. The German or metric [[horsepower]] (PS, ''Pferdestärke'') is arbitrarily selected to be three quarters thereof.
; 1 p&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; := 1 q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;⋅m/s = 100 kp⋅m/s = 100 × ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg⋅m/s = 980.665&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.980&amp;nbsp;665&amp;nbsp;kW
; 1 PS := {{sfrac|3|4}} p&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; = 75 kp⋅m/s = 75 × ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg⋅m/s = 735.498&amp;nbsp;75&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.735&amp;nbsp;498&amp;nbsp;75&amp;nbsp;kW

==Overview==
According to literary theorist [[Rita Felski]], it is "a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"{{bracket|Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche}} share a commitment to unmasking 'the lies and [[illusion]]s of [[consciousness]]'; they are the architects of a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths ... Ricoeur's term has sustained an energetic after-life within religious studies, as well as in philosophy, intellectual history, and related fields."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = Media culture | url = http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/431 | first = Rita | last = Felski | authorlink=Rita Felski |title = Critique and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion | journal = M/C Journal | volume = 15 | number = 1 | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Felski also notes that "The 'hermeneutics of suspicion' is the name usually bestowed on [a] technique of reading texts against the grain and between the lines, of cataloging their omissions and laying bare their contradictions, of rubbing in what they fail to know and cannot represent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felski |first=Rita |title=Context Stinks |url=http://kclunc19.web.unc.edu/files/2014/10/FelskiRita-Context-Stinks.pdf |journal=[[New Literary History]] |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location=[[Baltimore, Maryland]] |date=Autumn 2011 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=573-591 |doi=10.1353/nlh.2011.0045}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, it can be seen as being related to [[Critique of ideology|ideology critique]].

==Types==
[[Ruthellen Josselson]] explains that "Ricoeur distinguishes between two forms of hermeneutics: a hermeneutics of faith which aims to restore meaning to a text and a hermeneutics of suspicion which attempts to decode meanings that are disguised."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://ruthellenjosselson.com/articles/josselson.ni.14-1.1e.pdf |first=Ruthellen |last=Josselson |authorlink=Ruthellen Josselson |title=The Hermeneutics of Faith and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion |journal=Narrative Inquiry |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |location=[[Amsterdam]] |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=1 July 2004 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1075/ni.14.1.01jos |ISSN=1387-6740 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206142102/http://ruthellenjosselson.com/articles/josselson.ni.14-1.1e.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7849">The '''Kripke–Platek axioms of set theory''' ('''KP'''), pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|p|k|i|_|ˈ|p|l|ɑː|t|ɛ|k}}, are a system of [[axiomatic set theory]] developed by [[Saul Kripke]] and [[Richard Platek]].

KP is considerably weaker than [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC), and can be thought of as roughly the [[impredicativity|predicative]] part of ZFC.  The consistency strength of KP with an axiom of infinity is given by the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]]. Unlike ZFC, KP does not include the [[power set axiom]], and KP includes only limited forms of the [[axiom of separation]] and [[axiom of replacement]] from ZFC.  These restrictions on the axioms of KP lead to close connections between KP, [[Mathematical logic#Recursion theory|generalized recursion theory]], and the theory of [[admissible ordinal]]s.

== The axioms of KP ==
* [[Axiom of extensionality]]: Two sets are the same if and only if they have the same elements.
* [[Epsilon-induction|Axiom of induction]]: φ(''a'') being a [[well-formed formula#Predicate logic|formula]], if for all sets ''x'' the assumption that φ(''y'') holds for all elements ''y'' of ''x'' entails that φ(''x'') holds, then φ(''x'') holds for all sets ''x''.
* [[Axiom of empty set]]: There exists a set with no members, called the [[empty set]] and denoted {}.  (Note: the existence of a member in the universe of discourse, i.e., ∃x(x=x), is implied in certain formulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A course in model theory: an introduction to contemporary mathematical logic |last=Poizat |first=Bruno |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-98655-3}}, note at end of §2.3 on page 27: &amp;ldquo;Those who do not allow relations on an empty universe consider (∃x)x=x and its consequences as theses; we, however, do not share this abhorrence, with so little logical ground, of a vacuum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/ref&gt; of first-order logic, in which case the axiom of empty set follows from the axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-separation, and is thus redundant.)
* [[Axiom of pairing]]: If ''x'', ''y'' are sets, then so is {''x'', ''y''}, a set containing ''x'' and ''y'' as its only elements.
* [[Axiom of union]]: For any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' such that the elements of ''y'' are precisely the elements of the elements of ''x''.
* [[Axiom schema of predicative separation|Axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-separation]]: Given any set and any Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-formula φ(''x''), there is a [[subset]] of the original set containing precisely those elements ''x'' for which φ(''x'') holds. (This is an axiom schema.)
* [[Axiom of collection|Axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-collection]]: Given any Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-formula φ(''x'', ''y''), if for every set ''x'' there exists a set ''y'' such that φ(''x'', ''y'') holds, then for all sets ''u'' there exists a set ''v'' such that for every ''x'' in ''u'' there is a ''y'' in ''v'' such that φ(''x'', ''y'') holds.
Here, a Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, or Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, or Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; formula is one all of whose quantifiers are [[bounded quantifier|bounded]]. This means any quantification is the form &lt;math&gt;\forall u \in v&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\exist u \in v.&lt;/math&gt;  (More generally, we would say that a formula is Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; when it is obtained by adding existential quantifiers in front of a Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; formula, and that it is Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; when it is obtained by adding universal quantifiers in front of a Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; formula: this is related to the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] but in the context of set theory.)
*Some but not all authors include an [[axiom of infinity]] (in which case the empty set axiom is unnecessary).

These axioms are weaker than ZFC as they exclude the axioms of powerset, choice, and sometimes infinity.  Also the axioms of separation and collection here are weaker than the corresponding axioms in ZFC because the formulas φ used in these are limited to bounded quantifiers only.

The axiom of induction in KP is stronger than the usual [[axiom of regularity]] (which amounts to applying induction to the complement of a set (the class of all sets not in the given set)).

== Proof that Cartesian products exist ==
'''Theorem:'''

If ''A'' and ''B'' are sets, then there is a set ''A''&amp;times;''B'' which consists of all [[ordered pair]]s (''a'', ''b'') of elements ''a'' of ''A'' and ''b'' of ''B''.

'''Proof:'''

The set {''a''} (which is the same as {''a'', ''a''} by the axiom of extensionality) and the set {''a'', ''b''} both exist by the axiom of pairing. Thus 
:&lt;math&gt;(a,b) := \{ \{a\}, \{a,b\} \} &lt;/math&gt;
exists by the axiom of pairing as well.

A possible Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; formula expressing that ''p'' stands for (''a'', ''b'') is:

:&lt;math&gt;\exist r \in p\, (a \in r\, \land\, \forall x \in r\, (x = a))\, \land\, \exist s \in p\, (a \in s \,\land\, b \in s\, \land\, \forall x \in s\, (x = a \,\lor\, x = b))\, \land\, &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\forall t \in p\, ((a \in t\, \land\, \forall x \in t\, (x = a))\, \lor\, (a \in t \land b \in t \land \forall x \in t\, (x = a \,\lor\, x = b))).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a superset of ''A''&amp;times;{''b''} = {(''a'', ''b'') | ''a'' in ''A''} exists by the axiom of collection.

Denote the formula for ''p'' above by &lt;math&gt;\psi (a, b, p)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following formula is also Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\exist a \in A \,\psi (a, b, p) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''A''&amp;times;{''b''} itself exists by the axiom of separation.

If ''v'' is intended to stand for ''A''&amp;times;{''b''}, then a Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; formula expressing that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A\, \exist p \in v\, \psi (a, b, p)\, \land\, \forall p \in v\, \exist a \in A\, \psi (a, b, p) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a superset of {''A''&amp;times;{''b''} | ''b'' in ''B''} exists by the axiom of collection.

Putting &lt;math&gt;\exist b \in B&lt;/math&gt; in front of that last formula and we get from the axiom of separation that the set {''A''&amp;times;{''b''} | ''b'' in ''B''} itself exists.

Finally, ''A''&amp;times;''B'' = &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;{''A''&amp;times;{''b''} | ''b'' in ''B''} exists by the axiom of union.

QED

== Admissible sets ==
A set &lt;math&gt; A\, &lt;/math&gt; is called [[admissible set|admissible]] if it is [[transitive set|transitive]] and &lt;math&gt;\langle A,\in \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[model theory|model]] of Kripke–Platek set theory.

An [[ordinal number]] α is called an [[admissible ordinal]] if [[constructible universe|L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;]] is an admissible set.

The ordinal α is an admissible ordinal if and only if α is a limit ordinal and there does not exist a γ&lt;α for which there is a Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) mapping from γ onto α.  If M is a standard model of KP, then the set of ordinals in M is an admissible ordinal.

If L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a standard model of KP set theory without the axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-collection, then it is said to be an "'''amenable set'''".

A '''low-carbon economy''' ('''LCE'''), '''low-fossil-fuel economy''' ('''LFFE'''),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://nanoparis.blogspot.com/2006/03/dye-sensitized-solar-cells.html Nanomech in Photovoltaics: Dye Sensitized Solar Cells&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''decarbonised economy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/Decarbonised-Economy1/|title=Decarbonised Economy|work=Greenpeace India|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[economy]] based on [[low carbon power]] sources that therefore has a minimal output of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions into the [[biosphere]], but specifically refers to the greenhouse gas [[carbon dioxide]]. GHG emissions due to anthropogenic (human) activity are the dominant cause of observed [[global warming]] ([[climate change]]) since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf |title= IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report.

Shifting to low-carbon economy on a global scale could bring substantial benefits both for developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018). ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects''. London: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-3-319-71769-2}}. &lt;/ref&gt; Many countries around the world are designing and implementing low emission development strategies (LEDS). These strategies seek to achieve social, economic and environmental development goals while reducing long-term greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to climate change impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_global_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally implemented low-carbon economies are therefore proposed by those having drawn this conclusion, as a means to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid catastrophic climate change]], and as a precursor to the more advanced, zero-carbon economy.

==Rationale and aims==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
Nations may seek to become low-carbon or decarbonised economies as a part of a national [[climate change mitigation]] strategy.  A comprehensive strategy to mitigate [[climate change]] is through [[carbon neutrality]].

The aim of a LCE is to integrate all aspects of itself from its manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and power-generation, etc. around technologies that produce energy and materials with little GHG emission, and, thus, around populations, buildings, machines, and devices that use those energies and materials efficiently, and, dispose of or recycle its wastes so as to have a minimal output of GHGs. Furthermore, it has been proposed that to make the transition to an LCE economically viable we would have to attribute a cost (per unit output) to GHGs through means such as [[emissions trading]] and/or a [[carbon tax]].

Some nations are presently low carbon: societies that are not heavily industrialised or populated. In order to avoid climate change on a global level, all nations considered [[carbon intensity|carbon intensive]] societies, and societies that are heavily populated might have to become zero-carbon societies and economies. Several of these countries{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} have pledged to cut their emissions by 100% via [[Carbon offset|offset]]ting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions ([[carbon neutrality]]); in other words, emitting will not cease but will continue and will be ''offset'' to a different geographical area. EU emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits, thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low-carbon developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU Emission Trading System(EU ETS) Factsheet |url=http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |website=European Commission |publisher=European Union |accessdate=27 Oct 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715223057/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of low-carbon economies===
Low-carbon economies present multiple benefits to ecosystem resilience, trade, employment, health, energy security, and industrial competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/2016/06/presenting-co-benefits-of-leds/?loclang=en_gb|title=Presenting the benefits of low emission development strategies|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits to ecosystem resilience====
Low emission development strategies for the land use sector can prioritize the protection of carbon rich ecosystems to not only reduce emissions, but also to protect [[biodiversity]] and safeguard local livelihoods to reduce rural poverty - all of which can lead to more climate resilient systems, according to a report by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]. [[REDD+]] and blue carbon initiatives are among the measures available to conserve, sustainably manage, and restore these carbon rich ecosystems, which are crucial for natural carbon storage and sequestration, and for building climate resilient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-boost-ecosystem-resilience/?loclang=en_gb|title=Boost ecosystem resilience to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Job creation====
Transitioning to a low-carbon, environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation, job upgrading, social justice, and poverty eradication if properly managed with the full engagement of governments, workers, and employers’ organizations.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-green-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=Create green jobs to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates from the [[International Labour Organization]]’s Global Economic Linkages model suggest that unmitigated climate change, with associated negative impacts on enterprises and workers, will have negative effects on output in many industries, with drops in output of 2.4% by 2030 and 7.2% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/docs/WCMS_192582/lang--en/index.htm|title=Global Economic Linkages Model|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will cause shifts in the volume, composition, and quality of employment across sectors and will affect the level and distribution of income. Research indicates that eight sectors employing around 1.5 billion workers, approximately half the global workforce, will undergo major changes: agriculture, forestry, fishing, energy, resource intensive manufacturing, recycling, buildings, and transport.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"/&gt;

====Business competitiveness====
Low emission industrial development and [[resource efficiency]] can offer many opportunities to increase the competitiveness of economies and companies. According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], there is often a clear business case for switching to lower emission technologies, with payback periods ranging largely from 0.5–5 years, leveraging financial investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-gain-competitive-edge/?loclang=en_gb|title=Gain the competitive edge to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improved trade policy====
Trade and trade policies can contribute to low-carbon economies by enabling more efficient use of resources and international exchange of climate friendly goods and services. Removing tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade in [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies is one such measure. In a sector where finished products consist of many components that cross borders numerous times - a typical [[wind turbine]], for example, contains up to 8,000 components - even small tariff cuts would reduce costs. This would make the technologies more affordable and competitive in the global market, particularly when combined with a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-use-trade-policy/?loclang=en_gb|title=Use trade policy to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===

====Renewable energy and energy efficiency====
{{See also|Renewable energy commercialization}}
[[Image:Total Installed Wind Capacity 1997-2020-MW.jpg|thumb|Worldwide installed wind power capacity 1997–2020 [MW], history and predictions. Data source: [http://www.wwindea.org/ WWEA]]]

Recent advances in technology and policy will allow [[renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] to play major roles in displacing fossil fuels, meeting global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable energy technologies are being rapidly commercialized and, in conjunction with efficiency gains, can achieve far greater emissions reductions than either could independently.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009&gt;Janet L. Sawin and William R. Moomaw. [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Renewable%20Revolution.pdf Renewable Revolution:Low-Carbon Energy by 2030] Worldwatch Report, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy is [[energy]] that comes from [[natural resource]]s such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]], which are [[Renewable resource|renewable]] (naturally replenished). In 2008, about 19% of global final energy consumption came from renewables.&lt;ref name=r2010&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; During the five years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years.&lt;ref name=ren15/&gt; More wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected [[photovoltaics]] increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60 percent annual average growth rate for the five-year period.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy for power, heat, cooling, and mobility is the key ingredient for development and growth, with energy security a prerequisite economic growth, making it arguably the most important driver for energy policy. Scaling up renewable energy as part of a low emission development strategy can diversify a country's energy mixes and reduces dependence on imports. It can also lower geopolitical risks and exposure to fuel price volatility, and improve the balance of trade for importing countries (noting that only a handful of countries export oil and gas). Renewable energy offers lower financial and economic risk for businesses through a more stable and predictable cost base for energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-ensure-energy-security/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Ensure energy security to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency gains in recent decades have been significant, but there is still much more that can be achieved. With a concerted effort and strong policies in place, future energy efficiency improvements are likely to be very large. Heat is one of many forms of "energy wastage" that could be captured to significantly increase useful energy without burning more fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009/&gt;

====Sustainable biofuels====
{{Main|Sustainable biofuel}}
[[Biofuels]], in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials, are entering the market, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]]. However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

The challenge is to support biofuel development, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008). ''Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges'',  {{ISBN|978-0-85403-662-2}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sol&gt;Gordon Quaiattini. [http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=e08c8e19-4a95-491c-9386-d30afeab5cdf&amp;sponsor= Biofuels are part of the solution]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Canada.com'', April 25, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPFL Energy Center (c2007). ''[http://www.webcitation.org/5luiZYDX8?url=http://www.its.berkeley.edu/sustainabilitycenter/RSB_Intro.pdf Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels]'' Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of [[alternative energy]] sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, especially in the transport sector.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a [[sustainable transport]] strategy.

====Nuclear power====
[[Nuclear power]] has been offered as the primary means to achieve a LCE. In terms of large [[industrialized]] nations, mainland France, due primarily to [[nuclear power in France|75% of its electricity being produced by nuclear power]], has the [[List of countries by ratio of GDP to carbon dioxide emissions|lowest carbon dioxide production]] per unit of [[GDP]] in the world and it is the [[List of countries by electricity exports|largest exporter of electricity in the world]], earning it approximately €3 billion annually in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|title=Privacy policy|work=Business &amp; Finance|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302010428/http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern is often expressed with the matter of spent nuclear fuel storage and security; although the physical issues are not large, the political difficulties are significant. The [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]] (LFTR) has been suggested as a solution to the concerns posed by conventional nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = N. | last2 = Minakata | first2 = D. | last3 = Begovic | first3 = M. | last4 = Crittenden | first4 = J. | title = Should We Consider Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors for Power Generation? | doi = 10.1021/es2021318 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 15 | pages = 6237 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2011EnST...45.6237C }} "LFTR can mean a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly [[sustainable energy]] sources solving a huge portion of mankind’s negative [[environmental impact]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

France reprocesses their spent nuclear fuel at the [[La Hague site]] since 1976 and has also treated spent nuclear fuel from France, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.

====Smart grid====
One proposal from Karlsruhe University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR8gEMpzos4|title=Fully renewable: biogas + wind + solar|date=29 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/index.php?id=27 Combined Power Plant&lt;/ref&gt; developed as a virtual power station is the use of solar and wind energy for base load with hydro and biogas for make up or peak load. Hydro and biogas are used as [[grid energy storage]]. This requires the development of a smart intelligent grid hopefully including local power networks than use energy near the site of production, thereby reducing the existing 5% grid loss.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon-neutral hydrocarbons===
{{main|Carbon-neutral fuel}}

====Methane cycle====
A further development of this is the use of the carbon capture, hydrogen and its conversion into methane (SNG synthetic natural gas) to act as a storage for intermittent renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-kassel.de/upress/online/frei/978-3-89958-798-2.volltext.frei.pdf Bioenergy and renewable power methane in integrated 100% renewable energy system]&lt;/ref&gt;

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Sabatier reaction

This involves the use of the existing natural gas (methane) grid as the store. In this case, the carbon dioxide is given economic value as a component of energy carrier. This "solar fuel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solar-fuel.net/en/the-challenge|title=Solar Fuel|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy that cannot be used instantaneously in the grid, which otherwise would be wasted to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water. The hydrogen is then combined with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create synthetic or substitute natural gas SNG and stored in the natural gas network. The natural gas is used to create electrical energy (and the heat used as well in CHP) on demand when there is not enough sun (photovoltaic, CSP...) or wind (turbines) or water (hydro, ocean current, waves,...).  The German natural gas grid, for example, has two months of storage, more than enough to outlast renewable energy low production points.

====Ocean derived hydrocarbon fuels====
The concentration of [[Ocean acidification|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the upper layer of the world's oceans]] is higher than is found in air, and thus it is the most concentrated "[[mining|mine]]" from which zero-net carbon fuels can be produced. The U.S. Navy estimates that a typical nuclear propelled aircraft carrier [[A4W reactor|which generates 100 megawatts]] of electricity can produce 41,000 [[US gallon]]s(155,202 [[litre]]s) of [[jet fuel]] per day and production from the onboard nuclear reactor would cost about $6 per gallon($1.58 per liter). While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a [[carrier battle group]] costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive.&lt;ref name="jetsea"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Willauer |first=Heather D. |last2=Hardy |first2=Dennis R. |last3=Williams |first3=Frederick W. |date=September 29, 2010 |title=''Feasibility and Current Estimated Capital Costs of Producing Jet Fuel at Sea'' |publisher=Chemistry Division, Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |type=memorandum report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA539765 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heather Willauer]] of the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] proof-tested the technology in 2013, fueling an internal combustion engine equipped [[model airplane]] with the [[synthetic fuel]].&lt;ref name=Parry2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2014/scale-model-wwii-craft-takes-flight-with-fuel-from-the-sea-concept |title=Scale Model WWII Craft Takes Flight With Fuel From the Sea Concept |last=Parry |first=Daniel |date=April 7, 2014 |work=Naval Research Laboratory News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbon capture and storage ====
The proposed strategy of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) - continued use of non-renewable fossil fuels but without allowing carbon dioxide to reach the atmosphere - has also been considered as a means to achieve a LCE, either in a primary or supporting role. Major concerns include the uncertainty of costs and time needed to successfully implement CCS worldwide and with guarantees that stored emissions will not leak into the [[biosphere]].

====Combined heat and power====

[[Cogeneration|Combined Heat and Power]] (CHP) is a technology which by allowing the more efficient use of fuel will at least reduce carbon emissions; should the fuel be [[biomass]] or [[biogas]] or hydrogen used as an energy store then in principle it can be a zero carbon option. CHP can also be used with a nuclear reactor as the energy source; there are examples of such installations in the far North of the Russian Federation.

==Primary sector==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Low carbon diet}}

Most of the agricultural facilities in the developed world are mechanized due to rural electrification.  Rural electrification has produced significant productivity gains, but it also uses a lot of energy.  For this and other reasons (such as transport costs) in a low-carbon society, rural areas would need available supplies of renewably produced electricity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Irrigation can be one of the main components of an agricultural facility's energy consumption.  In parts of California, it can be up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fypower.org/agri/|title=Thank You|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the low carbon economy, irrigation equipment will be maintained and continuously updated and farms will use less irrigation water.

====Crops====
Different crops require different amounts of energy input.  For example, glasshouse crops, irrigated crops, and orchards require a lot of energy to maintain, while row crops and field crops do not need as much maintenance.  Those glasshouse and irrigated crops that do exist will incorporate the following improvements:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;New Zealand Energy Intensive Business Initiative, {{cite web |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232041/http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasshouse crops
*environmental control systems
*heat recovery using condensers
*heat storage using buffer tanks
*heat retention using thermal screens
*alternative fuels (e.g., waste wood and trees)
*cogeneration (heat and power)
Irrigated arable crops
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*variable-speed drives on pumps

====Livestock====
Livestock operations can also use a lot of energy depending on how they are run.  Feed lots use animal feed made from corn, soybeans, and other crops.  Energy must be expended to produce these crops, process, and transport them.  Free-range animals find their own vegetation to feed on.  The farmer may expend energy to take care of that vegetation, but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops.

Many livestock operations currently use a lot of energy to water their livestock.  In the low-carbon economy, such operations will use more water conservation methods such as rainwater collection, water cisterns, etc., and they will also pump/distribute that water with on-site renewable energy sources (most likely wind and solar).

Due to rural electrification, most agricultural facilities in the developed world use a lot of electricity.  In a low-carbon economy, farms will be run and equipped to allow for greater energy efficiency.  The dairy industry, for example, will incorporate the following changes:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Irrigated Dairy
*heat recovery on milk vats
*variable speed drives on motors/pumps
*heat recovery from hot water wash
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*biodigester with cogen (heat &amp; power)
*vat wrap
*solar water heating
*ripple control
*ice bank
*chemical substitute for hot-water wash

===Hunting and fishing===
Fishing is quite energy intensive.  Improvements such as heat recovery on refrigeration and trawl net technology will be common in the low-carbon economy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}

===Forestry===
{{Main|Wood economy}}
Protecting forests provides integrated benefits to all, ranging from increased food production, safeguarded local livelihoods, protected [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystems]] provided by forests, and reduced rural poverty. Adopting low emission strategies for both agricultural and forest production also mitigates some of the effects of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_Forestry_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the low-carbon economy, forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil-based carbon reserves too much.  Specialized tree farms  will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
{{Main|Gas flare}}
Flaring and venting of [[natural gas]] in oil wells is a significant source of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three-quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the 1970s of approximately 110 million metric tons/year, and in 2004 accounted for about 1/2 of one percent of all [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm Global, Regional, and National CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711043835/http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm |date=2007-07-11 }}. In ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change'', Marland, G., T.A. Boden, and R. J. Andres, 2005, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] estimates that 134 billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually (2010 datum), an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of [[Germany]] and [[France]] or enough to supply the entire world with gas for 16 days.
This flaring is highly concentrated: 10 countries account for 70% of emissions, and twenty for 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=worldbank.org |publisher=The [[World Bank]] |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=previous redirect from web.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top-ten leading contributors to world gas flaring in 2010, were (in declining order): [[Russia]] (26%), [[Nigeria]] (11%), [[Iran]] (8%), [[Iraq]] (7%), [[Algeria]] (4%), [[Angola]] (3%), [[Kazakhstan]] (3%), [[Libya]] (3%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (3%), and [[Venezuela]] (2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,contentMDK:22137498~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:578069,00.html|title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction - Estimated Flared Volumes from Satellite Data, 2007-2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tertiary sector==

===Retail===
Retail operations in the low-carbon economy will have several new features.  One will be high-efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent, halogen, and eventually LED light sources.  Many retail stores will also feature roof-top solar panel arrays.  These make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer.  These are the same times that electricity is the most expensive and also the same times that stores use the most electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=35633 Grocery Store Sets California Solar Standard], Renewable Energy World, 22 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation services===
Sustainable, low-carbon transport systems are based on minimizing travel and shifting to more environmentally (as well as socially and economically) sustainable mobility, improving transport technologies, fuels and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_transport_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Transport Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decarbonisation of (urban) mobility by means of:
* More energy efficiency and alternative propulsion:
** Increased focus on fuel efficient vehicle shapes and configurations, with more [[vehicle electrification]], particularly through [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) or [[all-electric vehicle]]s
** More alternative and flex-fuel vehicles (based on local conditions and availability)
** Driver training for more fuel efficiency.
** Low-carbon [[biofuel]]s [[cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic]] ([[biodiesel]], [[bioethanol]], [[biobutanol]])
** Petroleum fuel [[fee|surcharge]]s will be a more significant part of consumer costs.
* Less international trade of physical objects, despite more overall trade (as measure by value of goods)
* Greater use of marine and [[electric rail transport]], less use of air and truck transport.
* Increased non-motorised transport (i.e. walking and cycling) and public transport usage, less reliance on private motor vehicles.
* More [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] capacity for common fluid commodities such as water, ethanol, butanol, natural gas, petroleum, and hydrogen (in addition to gasoline and diesel). See&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy Information Administration]] Industry Analysis Briefs, http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/mecs/iab/index5e.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, http://www.carbontrust.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf BERR - Redirect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925194653/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many co-benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], low carbon transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people’s time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

===Health services===
There have been some moves to investigate the ways and extent to which health systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and how they may need to change to become part of a low-carbon world.  The Sustainable Development Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nhs.uk/|title=Sustainable Development Unit|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NHS in the UK is one of the first official bodies to have been set up in this area, whilst organisations such as the Campaign for Greener Healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenerhealthcare.org/|title=Munin :: overview|author=Auto-generated Munin|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also producing influential changes at a clinical level.   This work includes
* Quantification of where the health services emissions stem from.
* Information on the environmental impacts of alternative models of treatment and service provision
Some of the suggested changes needed are:
* Greater efficiency and lower ecological impact of energy, buildings, and procurement choices (e.g., in-patient meals, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment).
* A shift from focusing solely on cure to prevention, through the promotion of healthier, lower-carbon lifestyles, e.g. diets lower in red meat and dairy products, walking or cycling wherever possible, better town planning to encourage more outdoor lifestyles.
* Improving public transport and liftsharing options for transport to and from hospitals and clinics.

=== Tourism ===
Low-carbon tourism includes travels with low energy consumption, and low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pollution emissions. Change of personal behavior to more low-carbon oriented activities is mostly influenced by both individual awareness and attitudes, as well as external social aspect, such as culture and environment. Studies indicate that educational level and occupation influence an individual perception of low-carbon tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Wenjie|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaolei|last3=Yang|first3=Zhaoping|last4=Wall|first4=Geoffrey|last5=Wang|first5=Fang|date=2017-06-04|title=Creating a low carbon tourism community by public cognition, intention and behaviour change analysisa case study of a heritage site (Tianshan Tianchi, China)|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0017/geo-2017-0017.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=197-210|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0017|issn=2391-5447|via=|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...17W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial steps==
A good overview of the history of international efforts towards a low-carbon economy, from its initial seed at the inaugural UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972, has been given by David Runnals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1150 Runnals, D. (2011) “Environment and economy: joined at the hip or just strange bed-fellows?”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
On the international scene, the most prominent early step in the direction of a low-carbon economy was the signing of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on February 16, 2005, under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2050.nies.go.jp/|title=Low-Carbon Society Research Project|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Towards a low carbon economy | author = Margot Wallström | date = 11 March 2004 | location = Brussels | url = http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921222229/http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | archivedate = 21 September 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, all member nations of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] except the [[Energy policy of the United States|United States]] have ratified the protocol.
Europe is the leading geopolitical continent in defining and mobilising decarbonisation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/climate-change/decarbonisation-challenge-us-european-perspectives/article-162796|title=The decarbonisation challenge - US and European perspectives|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] - an organisation advocating [[sustainable mobility]] and [[public transport]] - has an EU office, but less well developed contacts with, for example, the US. The European Union Committee of the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] wants to promote decarbonisation of urban mobility in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitp.org/news/pics/pdf/PR_Decarbonisation.pdf|title=News|work=UITP|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Europe is nowadays the leading geopolitical continent with regard to lowering emissions, Europe is quickly losing ground to Asia, with countries such as China and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|title=E3G — Third Generation Environmentalism - Action on climate and energy|author=E3G, Third Generation Environmentalism|work=E3G - Third Generation Environmentalism|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730155101/http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the 2014 ''Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI)'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-Report2014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ranks 60 nations on their green economic performance, finding that the Nordic countries and Switzerland have the best combined performance around climate change and green economy.

===Countries===

====Australia====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Australia}}
Australia has implemented schemes to start the transition to a low-carbon economy but [[carbon neutrality]] has not been mentioned and since the introduction of the schemes, emissions have increased. The [[Second Rudd Government]] pledged to lower emissions by 5-15%. In 2001, The Howard Government introduced a Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) scheme. In 2007, the Government revised the MRET - 20 percent of Australia's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. Renewable energy sources provide 8-10% of the nation's energy, and this figure will increase significantly in the coming years. However coal dependence and exporting conflicts with the concept of Australia as a low-carbon economy. Carbon-neutral businesses have received no incentive; they have voluntarily done so. Carbon-offset companies offer assessments based on lifecycle impacts to businesses that seek carbon neutrality. In Australia the only true certified carbon neutral scheme is the Australian government's National Carbon Offset Standard (NCOS) which includes a mandatory independent audit. Three of the four of Australia's top banks are now certified under this scheme and full list of compliant companies can be seen here http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/carbon-neutral/carbon-neutral-program/accredited-businesses#Certified_organisations . Businesses are now moving from unaccredited schemes such as noco2 and transitioning to NCOS as the only one that is externally audited. Most of leading carbon management companies have also aligned with NCOS such as Net Balance https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125415/http://www.netbalance.com/ , Pangolin Associates (who themselves are independently certified under NCOS) http://pangolinassociates.com/sustainability-services/ncos-carbon-neutrality/, Energetics http://energetics.com.au/home and the big four accounting firms.

In 2011 the Gillard Government introduced a price on carbon dioxide emissions for businesses. Although often characterised as a tax, it lacked the revenue-raising nature of a true tax. In 2013, on the election of the Abbott government, immediate legislative steps were taken to repeal the so-called carbon tax. The price on carbon was repealed on the 17th July 2014 by an act of parliament. As it stands Australia currently has no mechanism to deal with climate change.

====China====

====Iceland====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Iceland}}
Iceland began utilising renewable energy early in the 20th century and so since has been a low-carbon economy. However, since dramatic economic growth, Iceland's emissions have increased significantly per capita. As of 2009, Iceland energy is sourced from mostly [[geothermal energy]] and [[hydropower]], [[renewable energy in Iceland]] and, since 1999, has provided over 70% of the nation's [[primary energy]] and 99.9% of Iceland's [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |title=Gross energy consumption by source 1987–2005 |publisher=''[http://www.statice.is/?PageID=583 Statistics Iceland]'' |accessdate=2007-05-14 |format=XLS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125021947/http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |archivedate=2007-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, Iceland's carbon emissions per capita are 62% lower than those of the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals Indicators |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2006-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite using more primary energy per capita,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |title=Energy in Iceland |publisher=Icelandic Ministries of Industry and Commerce |accessdate=2007-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305070726/http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |archive-date=2007-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that it is renewable and low-cost. Iceland seeks [[carbon neutrality]] and expects to use 100% renewable energy by 2050 by generating [[hydrogen fuel]] from renewable energy sources.

====Peru====
The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that economic losses related to climate change for Peru could reach over 15% of national gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economics of Climate Change in Peru|url=http://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/climate-change-peru-seen-affecting-fishing-high-andes-livestock-and-agricultural|website=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a large country with a long coastline, snow-capped mountains and sizeable forests, Peru's varying ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Several mountain glaciers have already begun to retreat, leading to [[water scarcity]] in some areas. In the period between 1990 and 2015, Peru experienced a 99% increase in per capita carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production, marking one of the largest increases amongst South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forging low emission development paths in Latin America and the Caribbean: Multi-level dynamics in the world’s most urbanized region |url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GIP01771-CDKN_LEDS_LAC_Urbanization_final_updated_5-6-17_proof.pdf|website=LEDS GP|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peru brought in a National Strategy on Climate Change in 2003. It is a detailed accounting of 11 strategic focuses that prioritize scientific research, mitigation of climate change effects on the poor, and creating Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) mitigation and adaptation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/legislation/countries/peru/|website=London School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Environment published a Plan of Action for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Plan for Adaptation and Mitigation Against Climate Change (Peru)|url=http://theredddesk.org/countries/plans/action-plan-adaptation-and-mitigation-against-climate-change-peru|website=The REDD Desk|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan categorises existing and future programmes into seven action groups, including: reporting mechanisms on GHG emissions, mitigation, adaptation, research and development of technology of systems, financing and management, and public education. It also contains detailed budget information and analysis relating to climate change.

In 2014, Peru hosted the Twentieth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP20) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP20|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/lima_dec_2014/meeting/8141.php|website=UNFCCC COP20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Peru enacted a new climate law which provides for the creation of a national greenhouse gas inventory system called INFOCARBONO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEDS GP Peru's National Climate Law|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CDKN_LEDS_PB_INFOCARBONO_FINAL_WEB.pdf|website=LEDS Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], INFOCARBONO is a major transformation of the country's greenhouse gas management system. Previously, the system was under the sole control of the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment. The new framework makes each relevant ministry responsible for their own share of greenhouse gas management.

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Climate Change Act 2008]] outlining a framework for the transition to a low-carbon economy became law on November 26, 2008.  This legislation requires an 80% cut in the UK's [[carbon emissions]] by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm|title=New Bill and strategy lay foundations for tackling climate change|publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]|date=2007-03-13|accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000610/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the UK became the first country to set such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target into law.

A meeting at the [[Royal Society]] on 17–18 November 2008 concluded that an integrated approach, making best use of all available technologies, is required to move toward a low-carbon future. It was suggested by participants that it would be possible to move to a low-carbon economy within a few decades, but that 'urgent and sustained action is needed on several fronts'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/document.asp?tip=0&amp;id=8174 Towards a low carbon future], [[Royal Society]], 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the UK [[coalition government]] announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting, requiring around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies to report their [[greenhouse gas emissions]] every year. [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines|title=Rio's reprise must set hard deadlines for development|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-06-19|accessdate=2012-07-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120730141206/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines |archivedate = July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1643/contents/made |title=The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme Regulations 2014 |publisher=UK Government |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires all large businesses in the UK to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at least once every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/esos |title=ESOS: Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low carbon economy has been described as a "UK success story", accounting for more than £120 billion in annual sales and employing almost 1 million people. A 2013 report suggests that over a third of the UK's economic growth in 2011/12 was likely to have come from green business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/technology/low-carbon-entrepreneurs |title=Low Carbon Entrepreneurs: the new engines of growth |date=May 2013 |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cities===
Companies are planning large scale developments without using fossil fuels. Development plans such as those by [[World Wide Assets LLC]] for entire cities using only [[geothermal energy]] for electricity, [[geothermal desalination]], and employing full recycling systems for water and waste are under development (2006) in Mexico and Australia.

{{No footnotes|section|date=November 2012}}
{{Criminal defenses}}
'''Mistaken identity''' is a defense in [[criminal law]] which claims the [[actual innocence]] of the [[criminal defendant]], and attempts to undermine evidence of guilt by asserting that any [[eyewitness identification|eyewitness]] to the crime incorrectly thought that they saw the defendant, when in fact the person seen by the witness was someone else. The defendant may question both the memory of the witness (suggesting, for example, that the identification is the result of a [[false memory]]), and the perception of the witness (suggesting, for example, that the witness had poor eyesight, or that the crime occurred in a poorly lit place).

Because the [[prosecution]] in a criminal case must prove the guilt of the accused beyond a [[reasonable doubt]], the defendant must convince the [[jury]] that there is reasonable doubt about whether the witness actually saw what he or she claims to have seen, or recalls having seen. Although scientific studies have shown that mistaken identity is a common phenomenon, jurors give very strong credence to [[eyewitness testimony]], particularly where the eyewitness is resolute in believing that their identification of the defendant was correct.

== Studies ==
Researchers like [[Elizabeth Loftus]] have challenged eyewitness testimony based on the fact that people's memory can be distorted. In her study she questioned eyewitnesses about a videotape of a car accident. Witnesses were asked "How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?" However, some witnesses were asked the same question with the verb "hit" replaced by the verb "smashed". Those who were asked the question with "smashed" as the verb said the cars were moving faster than those who were asked the same question with the verb "hit." Additionally, when asked if there was broken glass at the scene, those who heard "smashed" were more likely to say there was than those who heard "hit." There was no broken glass in the videotape. Hers is only one example of studies that show memory can be susceptible to distortions.

== Case studies ==
With [[genetic fingerprinting]] and DNA evidence now commonplace, many convictions based on eyewitness testimony are being re-examined. According to statistics, over 75% of the cases of DNA exonerations have involved mistaken [[eyewitness identification]].

[[Abraham Lincoln]] used mistaken identity to defend [[William "Duff" Armstrong]] in 1858. He used a farmer's almanac to prove that a witness could not have seen Armstrong in the moonlight, as the position of the moon that night would not have provided sufficient illumination. Armstrong was acquitted.

===Adolf Beck===
A famous case of mistaken identity in the United Kingdom is the case of [[Adolf Beck]], who served several years in prison as a swindler, was released upon completion of his sentence, and then arrested again on the same charges before the actual swindler of similar appearance was apprehended.

===Ronald Cotton===
Another case demonstrating mistaken identity is the case of Ronald Cotton. In 1984, Jennifer Thompson was raped. During the attack, she studied the attacker's face, determined to identify him if she survived the attack. When presented with a photo lineup, she identified Cotton as her attacker. Twice, she testified against him, even after seeing Bobby Poole, the man who boasted to fellow inmates that he had committed the crimes for which Cotton was convicted. After Cotton's serving 10.5 years of his sentence, [[DNA testing]] conclusively proved that Poole was indeed the rapist.

Thompson has since become a critic of the reliability of eyewitness testimony. She was remorseful after learning that Cotton was an innocent man who was sent to prison. Upon release, Cotton was awarded $110,000 in compensation from the [[state of North Carolina]]. Cotton and Thompson have reconciled to become close friends and tour in support of eyewitness testimony reform.

After Cotton's release, Poole pleaded guilty to raping Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commondreams.org/views/062500-103.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but never responded to any of her letters.  He died in prison in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20132017,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==SODDI Defense==
The '''SODDI Defense''' ("Some Other Dude Did It" or "Some Other Dude Done It") is often used when there is no question that a crime occurred, such as in murder or assault cases, where the defendant is not asserting [[self-defense]].  The SODDI defense in a murder, rape or assault case is often accompanied by a mistaken identity defense and/or an [[alibi]] defense.  Another common scenario where the SODDI defense is available is where the police find contraband in a car or residence containing multiple people.  In this scenario, each person present could assert that one of the other people possessed the contraband.

The defense does carry a risk: It may be legal in some jurisdictions to falsely assert ones innocence while it is illegal to falsely blame another person for the crime.

In [[Holmes v. South Carolina]], 547 U.S. 319, 126 S. Ct. 1727, 1731, 164 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2006), the Supreme Court held that a [[South Carolina]] statute that prohibited putting on a SODDI defense when the state's case was "strong" violated the Sixth Amendment right to put on a defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://west.thomson.com/store/filingandshelvingdownload.aspx?file=131720_2007187_72649.pdf Professional Responsibility in Criminal Defense Practice.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of SODDI defense was the case of [[Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], who was indicted for obstructing justice and making false statements to a government agent and a grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/11/19/libby/  Lewis Libby's "some other dude did it" defense. Salon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

One variation of the SODDI defense is the [[Trojan horse defense]] in [[cybercrime]] cases. The main argument is that a virus or [[malware]] is responsible for the defendant's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/symposium/2005/materials/pdfs/21F-371.pdf] The Trojan Horse Defense in
Cybercrime Cases. Purdue University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/20/the_giant_wooden_horse_did/ The Giant Wooden Horse Did It! The Register]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term often connotes an attempt to impress others; it is usually regarded negatively,&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and under certain circumstances may constitute a breach of [[professional ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=‘Yeah, I work with Beckham’: Issues of confidentiality, privacy and privilege in sport  psychology service delivery|first=Mark B.|last=Anderson|pages=3–13|journal=Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology Review|volume=1|issue=2|year=2005|url=https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005164006/https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-05|deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When used as part of a logical [[argument]] it can be an example of the [[false authority]] [[fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Understanding arguments|first1=Donald|last1=Evans|first2=Humphrey|last2=Palmer|publisher=Drake Educational Associates|year=1986|page=286}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'shout-out' can be regarded as a type of name-dropping where someone's name, or a list of names, is spoken out in order to direct attention towards these groups or individuals, often as a means of expressing [[wikt:kudos|kudos]] or making a referral.

==Purposes==
Name-dropping is used to position oneself within a [[social hierarchy]].  It is often used to create a sense of superiority by raising one's status.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  By implying (or directly asserting) a connection to people of high status, the name-dropper hopes to raise his or her own [[social status]] to a level closer to that of those whose names he or she has dropped, and thus elevate himself or herself above, or into, present company.

Name-dropping can also be used to identify people with a common bond.  By indicating the names of people one knows, one makes known his or her [[social circle]], providing an opportunity for others with similar connections to relate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Name-Dropping|title=5 steps to professional presence: how to project confidence, competence, and credibility at work|first1=Susan|last1=Bixler|first2=Lisa Scherrer|last2=Dugan|publisher=Adams Media|year=2000|isbn=978-1-58062-442-8|pages=154–155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of [[appeal to authority]], name-dropping can be an important form of informal [[argument]]ation, as long as the name being dropped is of someone who is an expert on the subject of the argument and that person's views are accurately represented.

==Methods==
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
Use of the first name may be effective, as in the case of "Kingsley" for [[Kingsley Amis]].&lt;ref name="Knack"&gt;Joseph Epstein, "A Nice Little Knack for Name Dropping" in ''Narcissus Leaves the Pool'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, p. 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Name-dropping is also sometimes used in works of fiction to place a story in a certain historical timeframe, or to imply the involvement of a historical figure in the action (for example, in a story set during World War II, mentioning [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Winston Churchill]]). {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In individual psychological trauma, fundamental assumptions about how the individual relates to the world, such as that the world is benevolent and meaningful and that the individual has worth in the world, are overturned by overwhelming life experiences.&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman" /&gt;  Similarly, national trauma overturns fundamental assumptions of social identity – something terrible has happened and social life has lost its predictability.&lt;ref name="Neal2005" /&gt; The causes of such shatterings of assumptions are diverse and defy neat categorization.  For example, wars are not always national traumas; while the Vietnam War is experienced by Americans as a national trauma&lt;ref name="Kiernan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiernan|first1=David|title=Why Americans still can’t move past Vietnam|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/10/10/why-americans-still-cant-move-past-vietnam/|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=Washington Post|date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] famously titled the closing volume of his history of the [[The Second World War (book series)|Second World War]] ''Triumph and Tragedy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston|last2=Keegan|first2=John|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War, Volume 6|date=1954|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=978-0304929733|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar types of natural disasters can also provoke different responses.

Responses to national trauma also vary.  A nation that experiences clear defeat in war which had mobilized the nation to a high degree will almost inevitably also experience national trauma but the way in which that defeat is felt can change the response.&lt;ref name="Schivelbusch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schivelbusch|first1=Wolfgang|title=The culture of defeat : on national trauma, mourning, and recovery|date=2004|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0312423193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcUTAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former peoples of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South]] in the [[American Civil War]] and the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]] both created post-war mythologies (the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] in the former and the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|Stab-in-the-back Myth]] in the latter) of "glorious" defeat in unfair fights.&lt;ref name="Schivelbusch" /&gt;  The post-war experience of Germany after World War Two, however, is much more complex and provoked reactions from a sense of [[German collective guilt|German national guilt]]&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Mark|title=How World War II shaped modern Germany|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/05/05/how-world-war-ii-shaped-modern-germany|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=euronews|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collective ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowie|first1=Laura|title=The Impact of World War Two on the Individual and Collective Memory of Germany and its Citizens|url=https://www.societies.ncl.ac.uk/pgfnewcastle/files/2015/05/Bowie-The-Impact-of-World-War-Two.pdf|publisher=Newcastle University|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common national response to these traumas is repeated calls for national unity and moral purification, as in the post-9/11 United States&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman&amp;Sheikh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|last2=Sana|first2=Sheikh|title=From national trauma to moralizing nation."

In [[mathematics]], a '''negative number''' is a [[real number]] that is [[inequality (mathematics)|less than]] [[0 (number)|zero]]. Negative numbers represent opposites. If positive represents a movement to the right, negative represents a movement to the left. If positive represents above sea level, then negative represents below sea level. If positive represents a deposit, negative represents a withdrawal. They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency. A [[debt]] that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset, a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase. If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses, then one may choose to distinguish between those senses—perhaps arbitrarily—as ''positive'' and ''negative''. In the medical context of fighting a tumor, an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and [[Fahrenheit]] scales for temperature. The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic. For example, −(−3) = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original value.

Negative numbers are usually written with a [[Plus and minus signs|minus sign]] in front. For example, −3 represents a negative quantity with a magnitude of three, and is pronounced "minus three" or "negative three". To help tell the difference between a [[subtraction]] operation and a negative number, occasionally the negative sign is placed slightly higher than the [[minus sign]] (as a [[superscript]]). Conversely, a number that is greater than zero is called ''positive''; zero is usually ([[signed zero|but not always]]) thought of as neither positive nor [[negative zero|negative]].&lt;ref&gt;The convention that zero is neither positive nor negative is not universal. For example, in the French convention, zero is considered to be ''both'' positive and negative. The French words [[:fr:Nombre positif|positif]] and [[:fr:Nombre négatif|négatif]] mean the same as English "positive or zero" and "negative or zero" respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; The positivity of a number may be emphasized by placing a plus sign before it, e.g. {{math|+3}}. In general, the negativity or positivity of a number is referred to as its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]].

Every real number other than zero is either positive or negative. The positive whole numbers are referred to as [[natural number]]s, while the positive and negative whole numbers (together with zero) are referred to as [[integer]]s.

In [[bookkeeping]], amounts owed are often represented by red numbers, or a number in parentheses, as an alternative notation to represent negative numbers.

Negative numbers appeared for the first time in history in the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', which in its present form dates from the period of the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – AD 220), but may well contain much older material.&lt;ref name=struik33&gt;Struik, page 32–33. "''In these matrices we find negative numbers, which appear here for the first time in history.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Hui]]  (c. 3rd century) established rules for adding and subtracting negative numbers.&lt;ref name="Hodgkin"/&gt; By the 7th century, Indian mathematicians such as [[Brahmagupta]] were describing the use of negative numbers. [[Islamic mathematicians]] further developed the rules of subtracting and multiplying negative numbers and solved problems with negative [[coefficients]].&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; Western mathematicians accepted the idea of negative numbers by the 17th century. Prior to the concept of negative numbers, mathematicians such as [[Diophantus]] considered negative solutions to problems "false" and equations requiring negative solutions were described as absurd.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diophantus]], ''[[Arithmetica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

===As the result of subtraction===
Negative numbers can be thought of as resulting from the [[subtraction]] of a larger number from a smaller. For example, negative three is the result of subtracting three from zero:
: {{math| 0 − 3  {{=}}  −3.}}
In general, the subtraction of a larger number from a smaller yields a negative result, with the magnitude of the result being the difference between the two numbers.  For example,
: {{math| 5 − 8  {{=}}  −3}}
since {{math|8 − 5 {{=}} 3}}.

===The number line===
{{Main|Number line}}
The relationship between negative numbers, positive numbers, and zero is often expressed in the form of a '''number line''':
[[File:Number-line.svg|center|The number line]]
Numbers appearing farther to the right on this line are greater, while numbers appearing farther to the left are less. Thus zero appears in the middle, with the positive numbers to the right and the negative numbers to the left.

Note that a negative number with greater magnitude is considered less. For example, even though (positive) {{math|8}} is greater than (positive) {{math|5}}, written
: {{math|8 &gt; 5}}
negative {{math|8}} is considered to be less than negative {{math|5}}:
: {{math|−8 &lt; −5.}}
(Because, for example, if you have £-8, a debt of £8, you would have less after adding, say £10, to it than if you have £-5.) 
It follows that any negative number is less than any positive number, so
: {{math|−8 &lt; 5}} &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;{{math|−5 &lt; 8.}}

===Signed numbers===
{{main|Sign (mathematics)}}
In the context of negative numbers, a number that is greater than zero is referred to as '''positive'''. Thus every [[real number]] other than zero is either positive or negative, while zero itself is not considered to have a sign. Positive numbers are sometimes written with a [[plus sign]] in front, e.g. {{math|+3}} denotes a positive three.

Because zero is neither positive nor negative, the term '''nonnegative''' is sometimes used to refer to a number that is either positive or zero, while '''nonpositive''' is used to refer to a number that is either negative or zero. Zero is a neutral number.

==Everyday uses of negative numbers==

===Sport===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Spanish Grand Prix, 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Negative sector and lap times during the [[2014 Spanish Grand Prix]]]] --&gt;

* [[Goal difference]] in [[association football]] and [[hockey]]; points difference in [[rugby football]]; [[net run rate]] in [[cricket]]; [[golf]] scores relative to [[Golf#Scoring and handicapping|par]].
* [[Plus-minus]] differential in [[ice hockey]]: the difference in total goals scored for the team (+) and against the team (−) when a particular player is on the ice is the player’s +/− rating. Players can have a negative (+/−) rating.
* [[Run differential]] in [[baseball]]: the run differential is negative if the team allows more runs than they scored.
* British football clubs are deducted points if they enter [[Administration (British football)|administration]], and thus have a negative points total until they have earned at least that many points that season.
* Lap (or sector) times in [[Formula 1]] may be given as the difference compared to a previous lap (or sector) (such as the previous record, or the lap just completed by a driver in front), and will be positive if slower and negative if faster.
* In some [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] events, such as [[sprint (running)|sprint race]]s, the [[110 metres hurdles|hurdles]], the [[triple jump]] and the [[long jump]], the [[wind assistance]] is measured and recorded,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805042254/http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/athletics/event/men-long-jump/index.html BBC website] &lt;/ref&gt; and is positive for a [[tailwind]] and negative for a headwind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elitefeet.com/how-wind-assistance-works-in-track-field Elitefeet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arithmetic involving negative numbers==
The [[Plus and minus signs|minus sign]] "−" signifies the [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] for both the binary (two-[[operand]]) [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] of [[subtraction]] (as in {{math|y − z}}) and the unary (one-operand) operation of [[negation]] (as in {{math|−x}}, or twice in {{math|−(−x)}}). A special case of unary negation occurs when it operates on a positive number, in which case the result is a negative number (as in {{math|−5}}).

The ambiguity of the "−" symbol does not generally lead to ambiguity in arithmetical expressions, because the order of operations makes only one interpretation or the other possible for each "−". However, it can lead to confusion and be difficult for a person to understand an expression when operator symbols appear adjacent to one another. A solution can be to parenthesize the unary "−" along with its operand.

For example, the expression {{math|7 + −5}} may be clearer if written {{math|7 + (−5)}} (even though they mean exactly the same thing formally). The [[subtraction]] expression {{math|7–5}} is a different expression that doesn't represent the same operations, but it evaluates to the same result.

Sometimes in elementary schools a number may be prefixed by a superscript minus sign or plus sign to explicitly distinguish negative and positive numbers as in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding by design|author1=Grant P. Wiggins|author2=Jay McTighe|page=210|year=2005|publisher=ACSD Publications|isbn=1-4166-0035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;2 + &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;5}} &amp;nbsp;gives&amp;nbsp;{{math|&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;7}}.

===Addition===
[[File:AdditionRules.svg|right|thumb|A visual representation of the addition of positive and negative numbers. Larger balls represent numbers with greater magnitude.]]
Addition of two negative numbers is very similar to addition of two positive numbers. For example,
:{{math|(−3) + (−5)  {{=}}  −8}}.
The idea is that two debts can be combined into a single debt of greater magnitude.

When adding together a mixture of positive and negative numbers, one can think of the negative numbers as positive quantities being subtracted. For example:
:{{math|8 + (−3)  {{=}}  8 − 3  {{=}}  5}} &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;{{math|(−2) + 7  {{=}}  7 − 2  {{=}}  5}}.
In the first example, a credit of {{math|8}} is combined with a debt of {{math|3}}, which yields a total credit of {{math|5}}. If the negative number has greater magnitude, then the result is negative:
:{{math|(−8) + 3  {{=}}  3 − 8  {{=}}  −5}} &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;{{math|2 + (−7)  {{=}}  2 − 7  {{=}}  −5}}.
Here the credit is less than the debt, so the net result is a debt.

===Subtraction===
As discussed above, it is possible for the subtraction of two non-negative numbers to yield a negative answer:
: {{math| 5 − 8  {{=}}  −3}}
In general, subtraction of a positive number yields the same result as the addition of a negative number of equal magnitude. Thus
: {{math| 5 − 8  {{=}}  5 + (−8)  {{=}}  −3}}
and
: {{math| (−3) − 5  {{=}}  (−3) + (−5)  {{=}}  −8}}

On the other hand, subtracting a negative number yields the same result as the addition a positive number of equal magnitude. (The idea is that ''losing'' a debt is the same thing as ''gaining'' a credit.) Thus
: {{math| 3 − (−5)  {{=}}  3 + 5  {{=}}  8}}
and
: {{math| (−5) − (−8)  {{=}}  (−5) + 8  {{=}}  3}}.

===Multiplication===
When multiplying numbers, the magnitude of the product is always just the product of the two magnitudes. The [[sign (mathematics)|sign]] of the product is determined by the following rules:
* The product of one positive number and one negative number is negative.
* The product of two negative numbers is positive.
Thus
: {{math| (−2) × 3  {{=}}  −6}}
and
: {{math| (−2) × (−3)  {{=}}  6}}.
The reason behind the first example is simple: adding three {{math|−2}}'s together yields {{math|−6}}:
: {{math| (−2) × 3  {{=}}  (−2) + (−2) + (−2)  {{=}}  −6}}.
The reasoning behind the second example is more complicated. The idea again is that losing a debt is the same thing as gaining a credit. In this case, losing two debts of three each is the same as gaining a credit of six:
: {{math| (−2}} debts {{math|) × (−3}} each{{math|)  {{=}}  +6}} credit.
The convention that a product of two negative numbers is positive is also necessary for multiplication to follow the [[distributive law]].  In this case, we know that
: {{math| (−2) × (−3)  +  2 × (−3)  {{=}}  (−2 + 2) × (−3)  {{=}}  0 × (−3)  {{=}}  0}}.
Since {{math|2 × (−3) {{=}} −6}}, the product {{math|(−2) × (−3)}} must equal {{math|6}}.

These rules lead to another (equivalent) rule—the sign of any product ''a'' × ''b'' depends on the sign of ''a'' as follows:
* if ''a'' is positive, then the sign of ''a'' × ''b'' is the same as the sign of ''b'', and
* if ''a'' is negative, then the sign of ''a'' × ''b'' is the opposite of the sign of ''b''.
The justification for why the product of two negative numbers is a positive number can be observed in the analysis of [[complex numbers]].

===Division===
The sign rules for [[Division (mathematics)|division]] are the same as for multiplication.  For example,
:{{math|8 ÷ (−2)  {{=}}  −4}},
:{{math|(−8) ÷ 2  {{=}}  −4}},
and
:{{math|(−8) ÷ (−2)  {{=}}  4}}.
If dividend and divisor have the same sign, the result is always positive. Another method of dividing negative numbers is that if one of the numbers being divided is a negative, the answer will be negative.

==Negation==
{{main|Additive inverse}}
The negative version of a positive number is referred to as its [[Additive inverse|negation]]. For example, {{math|−3}} is the negation of the positive number {{math|3}}.  The [[addition|sum]] of a number and its negation is equal to zero:
:{{math|3 + (−3)  {{=}}  0}}.
That is, the negation of a positive number is the [[additive inverse]] of the number.

Using [[algebra]], we may write this principle as an [[algebraic identity]]:
:{{math|''x'' + (−''x'' ) {{=}}  0}}.
This identity holds for any positive number {{math|''x''}}. It can be made to hold for all real numbers by extending the definition of negation to include zero and negative numbers.  Specifically:
* The negation of 0 is 0, and
* The negation of a negative number is the corresponding positive number.
For example, the negation of {{math|−3}} is {{math|+3}}.  In general,
:{{math|−(−''x'')  {{=}}  ''x''}}.

The [[absolute value]] of a number is the non-negative number with the same magnitude. For example, the absolute value of {{math|−3}} and the absolute value of {{math|3}} are both equal to {{math|3}}, and the absolute value of {{math|0}} is {{math|0}}.

==Formal construction of negative integers==
{{See also|Integer#Construction}}
In a similar manner to [[rational number]]s, we can extend the [[natural number]]s '''N''' to the integers '''Z''' by defining integers as an [[ordered pair]] of natural numbers (''a'', ''b''). We can extend addition and multiplication to these pairs with the following rules:
:(''a'', ''b'') + (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'')
:(''a'', ''b'') × (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' × ''c'' + ''b'' × ''d'', ''a'' × ''d'' + ''b'' × ''c'')

We define an [[equivalence relation]] ~ upon these pairs with the following rule:
:(''a'', ''b'') ~ (''c'', ''d'') if and only if ''a'' + ''d'' = ''b'' + ''c''.
This equivalence relation is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above, and we may define '''Z''' to be the [[quotient set]] '''N'''²/~, i.e. we identify two pairs (''a'', ''b'') and (''c'', ''d'') if they are equivalent in the above sense. Note that '''Z''', equipped with these operations of addition and multiplication, is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], and is in fact, the prototypical example of a ring.

We can also define a [[total order]] on '''Z''' by writing
:(''a'', ''b'') ≤ (''c'', ''d'') if and only if ''a'' + ''d'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c''.

This will lead to an ''additive zero'' of the form (''a'', ''a''), an ''[[additive inverse]]'' of (''a'', ''b'') of the form (''b'', ''a''), a multiplicative unit of the form (''a'' + 1, ''a''), and a definition of [[subtraction]]
:(''a'', ''b'') − (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' + ''d'', ''b'' + ''c'').
This construction is a special case of the [[Grothendieck group#Explicit construction|Grothendieck construction]].

===Uniqueness===
The negative of a number is unique, as is shown by the following proof.

Let ''x'' be a number and let ''y'' be its negative.
Suppose ''y′'' is another negative of ''x''. By an [[axiom]] of the real number system

:&lt;math&gt;x + y \prime = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x + y\,\, = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

And so, ''x'' + ''y′'' = ''x'' + ''y''. Using the law of cancellation for addition, it is seen that
''y′'' = ''y''. Thus ''y'' is equal to any other negative of ''x''. That is, ''y'' is the unique negative of ''x''.

For a long time, negative solutions to problems were considered "false". In [[Hellenistic Egypt]], the [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Diophantus]] in the 3rd century AD referred to an equation that was equivalent to 4''x'' + 20 = 4 (which has a negative solution) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation was absurd.&lt;ref name="Needham volume 3 p90"&gt;{{cite book|author=Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 3; Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC|year=1995|orig-year=1959|edition=reprint|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-05801-5|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative numbers appear for the first time in history in the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (''Jiu zhang suan-shu''), which in its present form dates from the period of the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – AD 220), but may well contain much older material.&lt;ref name="struik33"/&gt; The mathematician [[Liu Hui]] (c. 3rd century) established rules for the addition and subtraction of negative numbers.

During the 7th century AD, negative numbers were used in India to represent debts. The [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta]]'' (written c. AD 630), discussed the use of negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today.&lt;ref name="Needham volume 3 p90"/&gt; He also found negative solutions of [[quadratic equation]]s and gave rules regarding operations involving negative numbers and [[0 (number)|zero]], such as ''"A debt cut off from nothingness becomes a credit; a credit cut off from nothingness becomes a debt. "'' He called positive numbers "fortunes," zero "a cipher," and negative numbers "debts."&lt;ref&gt;Colva M. Roney-Dougal, Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, stated this on the BBC Radio 4 programme "In Our Time," on 9 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Knowledge Transfer and Perceptions of the Passage of Time'', ICEE-2002 Keynote Address by Colin Adamson-Macedo. "''Referring again to Brahmagupta's great work, all the necessary rules for algebra, including the 'rule of signs', were stipulated, but in a form which used the language and imagery of commerce and the market place. Thus 'dhana' (= fortunes) is used to represent positive numbers, whereas 'rina' (= debts) were negative''".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Islamic mathematicians]] were familiar with negative numbers from the works of Indian mathematicians, but the recognition and use of negative numbers during this period remained timid.&lt;ref name=Rashed&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer| isbn = 9780792325659| last = Rashed| first = R.| title = The Development of Arabic Mathematics: Between Arithmetic and Algebra| date =1994-06-30|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Khwarizmi]] in his ''Al-jabr wa'l-muqabala'' (from which we get the word "algebra") did not use negative numbers or negative coefficients.&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; But within fifty years, [[Abu Kamil]] illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication &lt;math&gt;(a \pm b)(c \pm d)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Ismail&gt;{{citation | author = Mat Rofa Bin Ismail | title = Algebra in Islamic Mathematics | work = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | volume = 1 | year = 2008 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 9781402045592 | editor = [[Helaine Selin]] | page=115 | edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[al-Karaji]] wrote in his ''al-Fakhrī'' that "negative quantities must be counted as terms".&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; In the 10th century, [[Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī]] considered debts as negative numbers in ''A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen''.&lt;ref name=Ismail /&gt;

By the 12th century, al-Karaji's successors were to state the general rules of signs and use them to solve [[polynomial division]]s.&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt; As [[al-Samaw'al]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the product of a negative number — ''al-nāqiṣ'' — by a positive number — ''al-zāʾid'' — is negative, and by a negative number is positive. If we subtract a negative number from a higher negative number, the remainder is their negative difference. The difference remains positive if we subtract a negative number from a lower negative number. If we subtract a negative number from a positive number, the remainder is their positive sum. If we subtract a positive number from an empty power (''martaba khāliyya''), the remainder is the same negative, and if we subtract a negative number from an empty power, the remainder is the same positive number.&lt;ref name=Rashed /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 12th century in India, [[Bhāskara II]] gave negative roots for quadratic equations but rejected them because they were inappropriate in the context of the problem. He stated that a negative value is "''in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.''"

European mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th century, although [[Leonardo of Pisa#Important publications|Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debits (chapter 13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', AD 1202) and later as losses (in ''[[Leonardo of Pisa|Flos]]'').

In the 15th century, [[Nicolas Chuquet]], a Frenchman, used negative numbers as [[Exponentiation|exponents]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nicolas Chuquet, Renaissance Mathematician: a study with extensive translations of Chuquet's mathematical manuscript completed in 1484|first1=Graham|last1=Flegg|first2=C.|last2=Hay|first3=B.|last3=Moss|publisher=D.

In 1545, [[Gerolamo Cardano]], in his [[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|''Ars Magna'']], provided the first satisfactory treatment of negative numbers in Europe.&lt;ref name="Needham volume 3 p90"/&gt; He did not allow negative numbers in his consideration of [[cubic equation]]s, so he had to treat, for example, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' separately from ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' (with ''a'',''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 in both cases). In all, Cardano was driven to the study of thirteen different types of cubic equations, each expressed purely in terms of positive numbers.

In A.D. 1759, [[Francis Maseres]], an English mathematician, wrote that negative numbers "darken the very whole doctrines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple". He came to the conclusion that negative numbers were nonsensical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maseres |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Maseres |title=A dissertation on the use of the negative sign in algebra: containing a demonstration of the rules usually given concerning it; and shewing how quadratic and cubic equations may be explained, without the consideration of negative roots.

In the 18th century it was common practice to ignore any negative results derived from equations, on the assumption that they were meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alberto A. |last=Martinez |title=Negative Math: How Mathematical Rules Can Be Positively Bent |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2006 }} a history of controversies on negative numbers, mainly from the 1600s until the early 1900s.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] was the first mathematician to systematically employ negative numbers as part of a coherent mathematical system, the [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Calculus made negative numbers necessary and their dismissal as "absurd numbers" quickly faded.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Open-source appropriate technology''' ('''OSAT''') is [[appropriate technology]] developed through the principles of the [[open-design movement]]. OSAT refers to, on the one hand, technology designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economic aspects of the community it is intended for. On the other hand, OSAT is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used, modified and distributed freely.&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. (2014). Free and open source appropriate technology. in ''The Routledge Companion to Alternative Organization'', 308. {{ISBN|9780415782265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Open source is a development method for [[appropriate technology]] that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. [[appropedia:|Appropedia]] is an example of open-source appropriate technology. There anyone can both learn how to make and use AT free of concerns about patents. At the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive [[applied sustainability]] is enormous.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt; The built in continuous [[peer-review]] can result in better quality, higher reliability, and more flexibility than conventional design/patenting of technologies. The free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs, particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture. Finally, OSAT also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in. This is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the [[developing world]].

The "open-source" model can act as a driver of [[sustainable development]]. Reasons include:

* It enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products. It thus minimizes the need to ship materials over long distances and organizes material activities accordingly;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;Kostakis, Vasilis. Roos, Andreas. [https://hbr.org/2018/06/new-technologies-wont-reduce-scarcity-but-heres-something-that-might New Technologies Won’t Reduce Scarcity, but Here’s Something That Might]. ''Harvard Business Review'', 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local manufacturing also makes maintenance easier and also encourages manufacturers to design products to last as long as possible;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;
* It can be free as in "gratis" as well as free as in "libre", an important consideration for developing communities.&lt;ref&gt;

Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/9013667/Innovation_Through_Collaboration_Scaling_up_Technological_Solutions_for_Sustainable_Development Innovation Through Collaboration: Scaling up Technological Solutions for Sustainable Development], ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'' 16(6): 1299-1316 (2014). {{doi|10.1007/s10668-014-9528-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the lateral scaling concepts of [[Jeremy Rifkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy. The zero marginal cost society: The internet of things, the collaborative commons, and the eclipse of capitalism. Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1137278463}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus optimizes the sharing of knowledge and design as there are no patent costs to pay for.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==

For solutions, many researchers, companies, and academics do work on products meant to assist [[sustainable development]]. [[Vinay Gupta]] has suggested that those developers agree to three principles:&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

# I will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive.
# Any works that I patent I will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free, except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities.
# I will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances.

The ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, P. (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133/1/Phillipa_Shea_Thesis.pdf Community arts and appropriate internet technology: participation, materiality, and the ethics of sustainability in the digitally networked era].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, C. M. (2014). [http://www.ejisdc.org/Ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/viewFile/1233/510 Exploring information ethics for inclusive open development]. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support in the literature ==

* It has been investigated how open sharing of designs, specifications, and technical information can enhance effectiveness, widespread use, and innovation of appropriate technology.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt;
* OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Zelenika" /&gt;
* OSAT has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world.&lt;ref name="Kapczynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sali" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, S.R. and Barry, M., 2011. Health technologies and innovation in the global health arena. New England Journal of Medicine, 365(9), pp.779-782.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been claimed that the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt; In addition, it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt;
* OSAT can be used to generate [[renewable energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Louie H. Experiences in the construction of open source low technology off-grid wind turbines. In2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011 Jul 24 (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==

* At the university level, the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging  the connection between physics and social benefit:&lt;ref name="Pearce-2" /&gt;  This approach has the potential to use university students' access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology. Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving [[service learning]].&lt;ref name="Pearce-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saleh" /&gt; [[MIT]] has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using [[appropriate technology]] education and its relation to OSAT.&lt;ref name="Grue" /&gt;
* It has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source [[3D printer]]s can enable a new method of development for OSAT&lt;ref name="Villumsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Zovko" /&gt;

==Open source scientific equipment==
* [[Open source hardware]] for science can also be considered OSAT. Hundreds of scientific tools have already been developed and shared. Recently (2014) [[Open Source Lab (book)|open source labs]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, [[Open Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs]], Elsevier, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Appropriate technology is designed to promote [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[labor-intensive]], [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] and [[environmentally sound]] businesses.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll Pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985, due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness, large private utilities, and multinational construction companies.&lt;ref name="Pursell" /&gt; Recently (2011), several barriers to OSAT deployment have been identified:&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Pearce" /&gt;
* AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology
* Technical transferability and robustness of AT
* Insufficient funding
* Weak institutional support
* The challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.

'''Operating deflection shape''' (ODS), is a term often used in the structural [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]], known as ODS analysis. ODS analysis is a method used for visualisation of the vibration pattern of a machine or structure as influenced by its own operating forces. This is as opposed to the study of the vibration pattern of a machine under an (known) external force analysis, which is called [[modal analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/hsl_pdf/2006/hsl06104.pdf | title=The use of Operating Deflection Shapes (ODS) to model the vibration of sanders and polishers | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7386">'''Political Terror Scale''' is a yearly measure of state inflicted political terror. It was developed in the early 1980s by researchers at [[Purdue University]] and is currently managed by Mark Gibney of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=369}}

==Introduction==
The Political Terror Scale is a yearly measure of terror inflicted upon a population. "Terror" is defined as state terror, or violations of physical and personal integrity rights carried out by the state or its agents. Examples of political terror include extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and political imprisonment.

Originally, only 59 countries were coded for within the database between 1976 and 1983. In 1984, Mark Gibney took over as manager of the database and expanded the list of countries coded to 180 and the range of years to the most recent years available (currently 2012).{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=369}}The Political Terror Scale uses three sources to code each country: [[State Department|The State Department's]] ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,'' the ''Annual Report'' from [[Amnesty International]] and most recently the ''World Report'' from [[Human Rights Watch]].{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=372}}The database can be viewed and downloaded from its [http://www.politicalterrorscale.org website].

==The Coding Process==
===The Scale===
The Political Terror Scale is a five-point fixed scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/Data/Documentation.html|title=Documentation: Coding Rules|work=The Political Terror Scale|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Countries are under a secure rule of law, people are not imprisoned for their views, and torture is rare or exceptional. Political murders are rare
# There is a limited amount of imprisonment for nonviolent  political activity. However, a few persons are affected; torture and beating are exceptional. Political murder is rare.
# There is extensive political imprisonment. Execution or other political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited detention, with or without trial, for political views is accepted.
# The practices of Level 3 are expanded to larger numbers. Murders, disappearances, and torture are part of life. In spite of its generality, on this level terror affects primarily those who interest themselves in politics or ideas.
# The terrors of Level 4 have been extended to the whole population. The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals.

The scale is based on the assessment of violence along three dimensions:scope, intensity, and range. '''Scope''' is the type of violence carried out by the state, '''Intensity''' refers to the frequency at which the state employs a given type of violence, and '''Range''' is the portion of the population targeted for abuse (can also be thought of as the selectivity of violence).&lt;ref&gt;Wood and Gibney 2010, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=373}}

===The Coders===
The principle researchers consist of professors from several universities.
* '''Mark Gibney''' - Belk Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Linda Cornett''' - Chair and Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Reed Wood''' - Assistant Professor of the School of Politics and Global Studies at [[Arizona State University]].
* '''Peter Haschke''' - Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Daniel Arnon''' - PhD Student at [[Emory University]].

Coding is also supplemented by undergraduate and graduate students from several universities. Research assistants for the 2012-2013 year are: Daniel Arnon, Gray Barrett, Minori Hinds, and Kelsey Tavares of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]], Alexander Liffiton and Rachel Olson of Arizona State University, Max Scott of the [[London School of Economics]], and Shea Streeter, a recent graduate of the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/About/Researchers/|title=Researchers|work=The Political Terror Scale|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Process===
The data for each country is analyzed by at least two senior coders and undergraduate assistants. Each nation receives two scores - one from the State Department's report and one from Amnesty International's report. Coders agree with each other regarding a country's score at a rate of roughly 85%. If coders cannot come to an agreement than a third coder will settle the dispute. Due to the contextual nature of the source data, coding is highly subjective, and coders are instructed to ignore their own personal biases or knowledge when determining a country's score. Coders are also instructed to give countries the benefit of any doubt when scoring. If a coder cannot decided between two numbers, they are instructed to use the lower number when scoring.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=|pp=372-374}}

===Challenges and Examples===
The Political Terror Scale only measures acts of political terror inflicted by the state. Due to this fact, it may be difficult to score countries when it is not immediately clear which groups are committing acts of violence. [[Colombia]] is a perfect example of this dilemma, as although overall violence has decreased since 2000, violence from local militias and paramilitary groups has continued at a relatively stable rate. Although the government has attempted to mitigate the violence, certain actors within the government have either allowed the violence to continue or contributed to it in some way. Therefore, Colombia's score reflects the close level of involvement between government and private actors.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=371}}

Another challenge is that the Political Terror Scale only measures actual violations of physical or integrity rights or acts of violence and therefore countries ruled by truly repressive and coercive regimes may receive low scores. Nations who are successful at oppressing their citizens or who have committed acts of violence in the past to deter resistance generally do not have to commit many acts of violence in order to maintain control. For example, the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] would score low on the Political Terror Scale and that score would not reflect the overall level of oppression present in that society.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=370}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10608">'''Posthegemony''' or '''post-hegemony''' is a period or a situation in which [[hegemony]] is no longer said to function as the organizing principle of a national or post-national [[social order]], or of the relationships between and amongst [[nation state]]s within the global order.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|p=327|ps=: "Posthegemony&amp;nbsp;... is no longer a name for the hegemony of transnational capital, but the name of those 'places in which hegemony ceases to make sense' (Jean Franco)."}} The concept has different meanings within the fields of [[political theory]], [[cultural studies]], and [[international relations]].

==In cultural studies==
In the field of [[cultural studies]], posthegemony has been developed as a concept by a number of critics whose work engages with and critiques the use of [[cultural hegemony]] theory within the writings of [[Ernesto Laclau]] and within [[subaltern studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{harvp|Yúdice|1995}}, {{harvp|Moreiras|2001}}, {{harvp|Williams|2002}}, and {{harvp|Beasley-Murray|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; George Yúdice, in 1995, was one of the first commentators to summarize the background to the emergence of this concept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Flexible accumulation, consumer culture, and the "new world information order" are produced or distributed (made to flow) globally, to occupy the space of the nation, but are no longer "motivated" by any essential connections to a state, as embodied, for example, in a "national-popular" formation. Their motivations are both infra- and [[Supranational union|supranational]]. '''We might say that, from the purview of the national proscenium, a posthegemonic situation holds.''' That is, the "compromise solution" that culture provided for Gramsci is not now one that pertains to the national level but to the local and transnational. Instead, the "culture-ideology of consumerism" serves to naturalize global capitalism everywhere [emphasis added].{{sfnp|Yúdice|1995|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of posthegemony is related to the rise of the "[[multitude]]" as a social force which, unlike the "people", cannot be captured by [[hegemony]], together with the roles of [[affect (philosophy)|affect]] and [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]] in mechanisms of social control and agency.&lt;ref&gt;These ideas are discussed extensively in {{harvp|Hardt|Negri|2000}}, {{harvp|Hardt|Negri|2004}}, and {{harvp|Beasley-Murray|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Posthegemony and its related terms are influenced by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]]’s accounts of the supra- and infra-national forces that are said to have rendered obsolete the national-popular forms of coercion and consent through which, for [[Antonio Gramsci]], hegemony structured and constituted society.

The features of posthegemony as a concept correspond closely to those of [[postmodernity]]. Thus, posthegemony theory argues that ideology is no longer a political driving force in mechanisms of social control and that the modernist theory of hegemony, which depends on ideology, therefore no longer accurately reflects the [[social order]].{{sfnp|Beasley-Murray|2003|p=119}} Some commentators also argue that history is not, as [[Karl Marx]] described it, a [[class struggle]], but rather a "struggle to produce class".{{sfnp|Beasley-Murray|2003|p=120}}

The concept of posthegemony also resonates with the work of post-[[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] theorists such as [[Giorgio Agamben]]. Nicholas Thoburn, drawing on Agamben's discussion on the "state of exception", writes that "it is, perhaps, with the recasting of the relationship between law and politico-military and economic crises and interventions that is instituted in the state of exception that the time of hegemony is most revealed to have passed."{{sfnp|Thoburn|2007|p=89}}

== In international relations ==
In [[international relations]], ''posthegemony'' refers to the decline of the US [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] hegemony. This has likely been the result of the difficulties that have arisen out of the unilateral style [[foreign policy]]. These difficulties predominantly include disdain from; those directly affected by the, sometimes forceful, hegemonic actions of the US, those who spectated the actions, and even Americans themselves who view the actions of their government as immoral. For example, after the [[Vietnam War]], in 1978, 72 per cent of Americans thought the war was not a mistake but fundamentally wrong and immoral.{{sfnp|Hagopian|2009|p=13}} This exemplifies the hegemonic decline: how could the US maintain the legitimacy of their interventions if their own citizens find them wrong and immoral?{{tone inline|date=June 2018}}

The dominant power(s) of the world is/are fluid, the initial period of US unilateralism can be loosely pinpointed to their interventions during the world wars.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following this period of rising US dominance on the world stage,
{{quote|there have been no shortage of people who, from the rise of the [Soviet Union's] space programme in the 1950s, through to the third world revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam, Iran and elsewhere, and to the emergence of Japan, Europe and now China as major economic powers, have predicted that US dominance, predominance, hegemony or, in more recent, [[post–Cold War era|post–Cold War]] terms, "unipolarity", are ebbing away.{{sfnp|Halliday|2008|p=12}}}}
The predictions of these individuals represent the fluidity of power over time, through the idea that, during the period where the US was unequivocally dominant, people could still see the inevitable future, of a change in power and authority, on the world stage.

==Criticism==

Among the criticisms of the theory of posthegemony is Richard Johnson's, that it involves "a marked reduction of social complexity."{{sfnp|Johnson|2007|p=102}} Johnson concedes that "one considerable achievement of 'the post-hegemony project' is to draw many observable [[post-9/11]] features into a single imaginative picture, while also synthesizing different currents in contemporary social theory." But he argues that "it is strange, however, that the result is viewed as the end of hegemony rather than as a new hegemonic moment."{{sfnp|Johnson|2007|p=102}} He, therefore, calls for a rejuvenation of the concept of hegemony, rather than its abandonment.

[[File:HP garage front.JPG|thumb|David Packard's garage in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded their company.]]

The '''rules of the garage''' are a set of eleven rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that [[William Redington Hewlett|Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] when they founded [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of [[Silicon Valley]].

== Etymology ==
The Rules were first articulated in 1999 by then HP CEO Carly Fiorina - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and they were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/rules-of-the-ga/ |title=Rules of the Garage, And Then Some |work=Wired |first=John C |last=Abell |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to [[HP Garage|David Packard's garage]] in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded the company after graduating from nearby [[Stanford University]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="isbn1-59184-152-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bill &amp; Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio |location=New York |first=Michael S |last=Malone |year=2007 |pages=39–41 |isbn=1-59184-152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Eleven "Rules of the Garage" ==
The eleven rules are:&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
# Believe you can change the world.
# Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.
# Know when to work alone and when to work together.
# Share — tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.
# No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage.)
# The customer defines a job well done.
# Radical ideas are not bad ideas.
# Invent different ways of working.
# Make a contribution every day. If it doesn’t contribute, it doesn’t leave the garage.
# Believe that together we can do anything.
# Invent.

'''Shooting sports''' is a collective group of [[competitive sport|competitive]] and [[recreation]]al [[sport]]ing activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy, precision and speed in [[shooting]], using various types of [[ranged weapon]]s, mainly referring to [[small arms|man-portable]] [[guns]] ([[firearm]]s and [[airgun]]s, in forms such as [[handgun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nssf.org/shooting/handgun/ Handgun Sports • NSSF | National Shooting Sports Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; [[rifle]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nssf.org/shooting/rifle/ Rifle Sports • NSSF | National Shooting Sports Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[shotgun]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nssf.org/shooting/shotgun/ Shotgun Sports • NSSF | National Shooting Sports Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[bow and arrow|bows]]/[[crossbow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archery360.com/archery-101/ Archery 101 by Archery 360]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldarchery.org/Archery Archery | World Archery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different disciplines of shooting sports can be categorized by equipment, shooting distances, [[shooting target|targets]], [[time limit]]s and degrees of [[sport of athletics|athleticism]] involved. Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition, and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members.

== History ==
The [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom]] (NRA) was founded in 1860 to raise the funds for an annual national rifle meeting "for the encouragement of Volunteer Rifle Corps and the promotion of Rifle-shooting throughout Great Britain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchpress.co.uk/wimbledon/wimbledon.htm "Volunteers &amp; The NRA"], researchpress.co.uk {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423040445/http://www.researchpress.co.uk/wimbledon/wimbledon.htm |date=April 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For similar reasons, concerned over poor marksmanship during the [[American Civil War]], veteran Union officers Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the [[National Rifle Association]] of America in 1871 for the purpose of promoting and encouraging rifle shooting on a "scientific" basis.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ssaa.org.au/|title={{!}} Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (SSAA)|last=Australia|first=Sporting Shooter's Association of|website=ssaa.org.au|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, with financial help from New York state, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named [[Creedmoor Rifle Range|Creedmoor]], the range opened in 1872, and became the site of the first [[National Matches]] until New York politics forced the NRA to move the matches to [[Sea Girt, New Jersey]]. The popularity of the [[National Matches]] soon forced the event to be moved to its present, much larger location: [[Camp Perry]]. In 1903, the U.S. Congress created the [[National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice]] (NBPRP), an advisory board to the Secretary of the Army, with a nearly identical charter to the NRA. The NBPRP (now known as the [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]]) also participates in the National Matches at Camp Perry.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/shooting-equipment-and-history|title=Shooting Equipment and history - Olympic Sport History|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-08-12|date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Washington DC Girls' Rifle Team.jpg|right|thumb|Girls' rifle team at Central High, Washington, DC. November 1922.]]

In 1903, the NRA began to establish rifle clubs at all major colleges, universities, and military academies. By 1906, youth programs were in full swing with more than 200 boys competing in the [[National Matches]]. Today, more than one million youth participate in shooting sports events and affiliated programs through groups such as [[4-H]], the [[Boy Scouts of America]], the [[American Legion]], U.S. [[Jaycees]], [[NCAA]], The [[USA High School Clay Target League]], the Scholastic Clay Target Program, [[National Guard Bureau]], [[ROTC]], and [[JROTC]].

[[France|French]] pistol champion and founder of the modern Olympics, [[Pierre de Coubertin]], participated in many of these early competitions. This fact certainly contributed to the inclusion of five shooting events in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]]. Over the years, the events have been changed a number of times in order to keep up with technology and social standards. the targets that formerly resembled humans or animals in their shape and size have are now a circular shape in order to avoid associating the sport with any form of violence. At the same time, some events have been dropped and new ones have been added. The 2004 Olympics featured three shooting disciplines (rifle, pistol, and shotgun) where athletes competed for 51 medals in 10 men's and 7 women's events—slightly fewer than the previous Olympic schedule.&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt;

In the Olympic Games, the shooting sport has always enjoyed the distinction of awarding the first medals of the Games. Internationally, the [[International Shooting Sport Federation]] (ISSF) has oversight of all Olympic shooting events worldwide, while National Governing Bodies (NGBs) administer the sport within each country.

Having originally established shooting as an organized sport in the USA, the NRA was the obvious choice to administer the United States participation in the Olympic games. The NRA dutifully managed and financially supported international and conventional shooting sports (i.e., [[National Matches]]) for over 100 years until the formation of [[USA Shooting]].

== Gun shooting sports ==
[[File:Bullet coming from S&amp;W.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-speed photography]] of the smoke of burnt [[smokeless powder|gunpowder]] and a [[.38 Special]] bullet fired out of a [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686]] revolver.]]
Gun shooting sports are shot with either [[firearm]]s or [[air gun]]s, which can be either [[handgun]]s, [[rifle]]s and/or [[shotgun]]s.

Handguns are handheld [[small arms]] designed to be shot off-hand without needing a [[shoulder stock]]. The two main subtypes of handguns are [[pistol]]s and [[revolver]]s. They are much more convenient to carry in general, but usually have a shorter effective range and less [[accuracy]] compared to [[long gun]]s such as rifles. In shooting sports, revolvers and [[semi-automatic pistol]]s are the most commonly used.

A [[rifle]] is a [[long gun]] with a [[rifling|rifled]] [[gun barrel|barrel]], and requires the use of both hands to hold and brace against the shoulder via a [[stock (firearms)|stock]] in order to shoot steadily. They generally have a longer range and greater accuracy than handguns, and are popular for hunting. In shooting sports, [[bolt action rifle|bolt action]] or [[semi-automatic rifle]]s are the most commonly used.

A [[shotgun]] is similar to a rifle but often [[smoothbore]] and larger in [[caliber]], and typically fires either a [[shotgun shell|shell]] containing many smaller scattering sub-projectiles called [[shot (pellet)|shots]], or a single large projectile called a [[slug (projectile)|slug]]. In shooting sports, shotguns are more often [[double-barreled shotgun#Barrel configuration|over/under]]-type [[break action]] or [[semi-automatic shotgun]]s, and the majority of shotgun events are included in [[clay pigeon shooting]].

=== Bullseye shooting ===
[[File:Target 223 Savage 10FP 25 shot.jpg|thumb|right|A round [[shooting target]] with several hits in the center, which is called "bullseye".]]
''[[Bullseye shooting]]'' is a term used to describe several pistol and rifle shooting disciplines where the objective is to achieve as many points as possible by hitting a round shooting target as close to the middle as possible with slow precision fire. These disciplines place a large emphasis on precision and accuracy through sight picture, breath and trigger control.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Fixed and relatively long time limits give the competitors time to concentrate for a perfect shot. An example of bullseye shooting is the [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]] pistol and rifle disciplines, but there are also many other national and international disciplines which can be classified as bullseye shooting. The shooting distances are typically given in round numbers, such as 10 15, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 meters depending on firearm type and discipline. Competitions are usually shot from permanent [[shooting range]]s and with the same target arrangement and distance from match to match. Usually the competitors each have their own [[shooting target]] and shoot beside each other simultaneously. Because of the relatively simple match format, beginners are often recommended bullseye shooting in order to learn the fundamentals of marksmanship.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Bullseye shooting is part of the [[Summer Olympic Games]], and a considerable amount of training is needed to become proficient.

==== Bullseye shooting with handguns ====
* The six [[ISSF shooting events]] with pistols (four Olympic events plus two events not included in the Olympics program but are contested in World Cups and World Championships), its roots date back to the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, consist of both precision slow-fire and rapid-fire target shooting from distances of 10, 25, and 50 meters. The pistols are unique in appearance compared to normal guns and each events has its own pistols designed specifically for the job. Shooters must use one hand only to shoot at small "bullseye" target downrange. In the UK (except for Northern Ireland), it is no longer possible to practice for some of the Olympic events following the [[Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997]], legislation brought in after the [[Dunblane Massacre]].
* The [[International Military Sports Council|CISM]] Rapid Fire match is similar to the ISSF [[25 m Rapid Fire Pistol]] event.
* [[NRA Precision Pistol]], also called conventional pistol shooting, is a bullseye shooting where up to 3 handguns of differing calibers are used. Its history is almost as old as ISSF events. Shooters must fire the pistol one-handed at 6- and 8-inch bullseye targets placed 25 and 50 yards downrange respectively.
* [[Precision Pistol Competition]] (PPC), was originally a police shooting program started in 1960 by the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2015 |title=NRA Law Enforcement Division: Police Pistol Combat Competition |url=http://ppc.nra.org/ppc.aspx |website=ppc.nra.org |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bullseye shooting with rifles ====
* Four position [[small bore]] is a popular sport in the U.S.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt;
* The six rifle [[ISSF shooting events]] (including three Olympic events) consist of long-time target shooting from distances of {{convert|10|or|50|or|300|m}}.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt;
* [[Gallery rifle shooting]] is popular in the UK and was introduced as a substitute for many pistol shooting disciplines following the 1997 [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom|handgun ban]].
* [[High Power Rifle]] (also known as "Across the Course" or 'traditional' High power) in the United States is a format that shoots 3-position (standing, kneeling, or sitting, and prone) at 200, 300, and 600 yards. The term "Across the Course" is used because the match format requires the competitors to shoot at different distances to complete the course of fire.
* Military [[Service Rifle shooting]] is a shooting discipline that involves the use of rifles that are used by military forces and law-enforcement agencies, both past and present use. Ex-military rifles, sniper rifles (both past and present) and civilian versions of current use service rifles are commonly used in the Military Service Rifle shooting competitions. It is popular in the United States and culminates each year with the National Matches being held at [[Camp Perry]], Ohio. Some countries have outlawed civilian shooting at human-silhouette targets; silhouette targets are not used in the National Match Course of Fire. Bullseye targets are used. High Power Rifle competition often is held at the same events as Service Rifle, such as the U.S. national championships each year at Camp Perry. High Power competitors generally are civilians using whatever rifles they prefer within the rules, whereas Service Rifle entrants are limited to current or previous U.S. armed forces weapons. Although according to NRA rules only certain matches allow optical sights, normally those conducted at ranges over 600 yards.
* [[Project Appleseed]] is a rifle marksmanship program by The Revolutionary War Veterans Association that teaches both rifle marksmanship and oral history regarding the American Revolutionary War. It shoots 3-position (standing, sitting, and prone) at 25 meters at reduced scale targets, simulating shooting at 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards. The techniques taught easily apply to transitioning to [[High Power Rifle]].
* Full bore and small bore rifle shooting in the United Kingdom.
* [[Three positions|Three position]] airgun competitions, popular in the [[United States]].

=== Field shooting ===
[[Field shooting|Field-Shooting]] or Terrain-Shooting &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalborg-skyttekreds.dk/component/eventlist/categoryevents/2-terraenskydning Danish: Aalborg Skyttekreds af 1862 - Terrænskydning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/feltskyting Norwegian: feltskyting – Store norske leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt; refer to a set of pistol and rifle shooting disciplines that usually are shot from temporary shooting ranges in the terrain at varying (and sometimes unknown) distances, rather than at permanent shooting ranges at fixed distances.

==== Field shooting with handguns ====
* Nordic Handgun Field-Shooting competitions are shot with pistol and revolver in different classes depending on equipment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pistolskytteforbundet.se/om-pistolskytte/faltskjutning Swedish: Svenska Pistolskytteförbundet-Om pistolskytte-Fältskjutning]&lt;/ref&gt; with classes up from small-bore .22 LR to large-bore [[.500 S&amp;W Magnum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://haugesund-pistolklubb.no/?page_id=283 Norwegian: Litt om feltskyting – Haugesund Pistolklubb (''English: A little about field shooting - Haugesund Pistol Club'')]&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are held outdoor throughout the year with varied [[shooting target]]s and distances, and are arranged by the [[Norwegian Shooting Association]] (NSF), the [[Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations]] (DGI Shooting) and the [[Swedish Pistol Shooting Association]] (SPSF).

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Field shooting with rifles ====
* Nordic Rifle Field-Shooting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandvikensskyttegille.se/fs_info.php Swedish: Fältskytte gevär förklarat | Sandvikens Skyttegille]&lt;/ref&gt; are shot with either small-bore .22 LR cartridge at 100 meters, or [[intermediate cartridge|intermediate]] (such as [[.223 Remington]] or [[6mm BR]]) or battle rifle cartridges (such as the [[6.5×55mm]], [[.308 Winchester]] or the [[.30-06 Springfield]]) at distances from 100 to 650 meters. With 200 and 300 meters being ordinary shooting distance in Nordic Bullseye Rifle-Shooting, those targets placed well beyond 300 meters in Rifle Field-Shooting means that the competition format also can be classified as a [[long range shooting]] discipline. Matches are usually held in the winter season with varied targets, and are arranged by the [[National Rifle Association of Norway]] (DFS), the [[Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations]] (DGI Shooting) and the [[Swedish Shooting Sport Association]] (SvSF). 
* [[Precision rifle competition]]s, like the [[Precision Rifle Series]] (PRS), is both a field and long range shooting discipline where rifles with intermediate or battle rifle cartridges are shot in the terrain at varying distances from about 10 to 1000 meters.
* [[Field Target]] is an outdoor [[air gun]] discipline originating in the United Kingdom, but gaining popularity worldwide.

=== Rapid fire ===
==== Rapid fire with handguns ====
* [[The Bianchi Cup]], a fusion of [[International Practical Shooting Confederation|IPSC]] (without the "run and gun" element) and bullseye shooting (except shot with two hands and going prone whenever rules allow it) where accuracy under tight time limits in four simulated scenarios, known as the "Event(s)", is the basis of this competition. Shooters must start with gun in the holster on every strings of fire and distances range from 10 to 50 yards.
* [[Fast draw]], also known as quick draw, a form of pistol action shooting from North America, based on the romanticized art of the gunslingers in the American Old West, using traditional single action revolvers. But unlike Cowboy action shooting, Fast Draw is done with special blanks or wax bullets. While some competitions are strictly against the clock, with the fastest time winning, many are set up as head to head single or double elimination matches.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Clay target ===
[[Clay pigeon shooting]] are shotgun disciplines shot at flying [[shooting target|clay pigeon targets]].

* The three Shotgun ISSF/ Olympic shooting events are all are based on quick reaction to clay targets thrown by a machines called "Traps".
** [[Skeet shooting|Skeet]]: Targets are either thrown in singles or doubles from two throwers called "traps" placed 40 meters apart.&lt;ref name ="topend"&gt;[http://www.topendsports.com/sport/shooting-sports.htm Topend Sports | About Shooting Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Trap shooting|Trap and Double Trap]]: Either one (trap) or two targets (double trap) are thrown from 15 meters in front of the shooter.&lt;ref name ="topend"/&gt;
* The [[Fédération Internationale de Tir aux Armes Sportives de Chasse]] (FITASC) [[Compak Sporting]] is a type of shotgun sport shooting similar to sporting clays, trap and skeet.
* Other shotgun sports with (at least partial) international recognition include [[Sporting Clays (shooting)|Sporting Clays]], [[Down-The-Line]]/ATA and [[Five stand]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Running target ===
[[Running target shooting]] refers to a number of disciplines involving a shooting target—sometimes called a [[boar]], [[moose]], or [[deer]]—that is made to move as if it is a running animal. Events of this type include:

* [[ISSF 10 meter running target]]
* [[ISSF 10 meter running target mixed]]
* [[ISSF 50 meter running target]]
* [[ISSF 50 meter running target mixed]]
* [[Running moose shooting|Running moose]], popular in Scandinavia both as a sport and hunting exercise. Competitions in Sweden are held at 80 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jagareforbundet.se/en/utbildning/jagarexamen/the-hunters-exam-huntsman-examination/swedish-hunting-examination/ "jagareforbundet.se"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Running deer shooting|Running deer]], also somewhat popular in Scandinavia and Great Britain.

=== Practical shooting ===
[[Practical shooting]], also known as [[action shooting]] or [[dynamic shooting]], is a generic term applicable to shooting sports where speed is of equal importance as precision. Many of the disciplines involve movement, and when using handguns they are often drawn from a [[handgun holster|holster]].
* The [[International Practical Shooting Confederation]] (IPSC) is the oldest and largest sanctioning body within practical shooting. IPSC is sometimes considered the "Formula One" of shooting sports, and is shot with handguns, rifles and shotguns. While the [[United States Practical Shooting Association]] (USPSA) is the U.S. regional affiliate of IPSC, many of USPSA's rules differ slightly from those used internationally. IPSC was developed by former police and civilian marksmen and later used as a basis for modern military and police exercises. It is a variation where the shooter often moves during shooting, and hits scored and shooting time are equally important. Stage procedure is generally not dictated (freestyle) and the shooter is allowed to determine the order and manner in which he or she engages the targets.
* [[International Defensive Pistol Association]] (IDPA) is an action shooting sport that uses semi-automatic handguns and revolvers with a strong emphasis on concealed shooting. Many aspects of stage engagement are dictated to competitors and penalties are given to competitors whom the safety officer determines attempted to gain a competitive advantage or engaged in a forbidden action with a "guilty mind" - that he knowingly failed to do right.
* [[Multigun]] are practical shooting events where each of the stages generally require the competitor to use and transition between a combination of rifles, handguns, and/ or shotguns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=DeJesus |first=Ivey |date=January 8, 2015 |title=A pistol, rifle and shotgun sport part of the lineup at NRA's Great American Outdoor Show |url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/nra_guns_great_american_outdoo.html |publisher=PA Media Group |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other types of firearms. 3-Gun has a lot in common with ordinary IPSC/USPSA matches, having courses of fire where the shooter must move through different stages and engage targets in a variety of different positions.
* [[Steel Challenge]] is a speed shooting championship solely about shooting steel targets as fast as possible, and is governed by the Steel Challenge Shooting Association (SCSA). There are eight standardized courses of fire, and a special "stop plate" must be shot last to stop the timer.
* [[International Confederation of Revolver Enthusiasts]] (ICORE) is an international community which promotes action shooting competitions with revolvers. Founded in 1991, the sport has elements from the Bianchi Cup, IPSC, and the Steel Challenge.&lt;ref name="AboutICORE"&gt;[http://www.icore.org/About_ICORE.html ICORE History and Information]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IPSC Action Air]] follows the same principle of [[International Practical Shooting Confederation|IPSC]], using [[airsoft]] instead of real firearms. The ranges, paper targets and poppers are scaled down to suit airsoft, and the sport enjoys popularity in countries such as [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]] where civilian ownership of real firearms are either illegal or extremely difficult to obtain.
* [[Bowling pin shooting]] (primarily shot with handguns) has the competitors race against one another to knock standard bowling pins from a table in the shortest elapsed time.
* [[ActionAirgun]] is an indoor action shooting sport using semi-automatic airsoft pistols and courses of fire downloaded from a central hub. Shooters upload shooting times to a website to resolve competitions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Long range ===
[[Long range shooting]] is a term used to describe shooting disciplines held at such distances that sight adjustment based from judging atmospherical conditions become critical.

* [[Fullbore target rifle|Fullbore target shooting]] is concerned with shooting at targets at ranges of 300–1200 yards. The sport is internationally governed by [[International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations|ICFRA]], and is popular in the UK, USA, Germany and Commonwealth countries. Similar disciplines called bullseye and field shooting are popular in Scandinavia, although fired at shorter distances.
** [[Palma rifle|Palma]] is an ICFRA fullbore competition format that dates from 1876, featuring long-range rifle shooting, out to 1,000 yards. The first Palma match was contested by teams from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Scotland and Ireland (with muzzle loaded rifles at that time). The matches continued to the late 1920s, and the trophy was eventually lost in Washington DC around the outbreak of WW2. The match was revived in the modern era in 1966 in Canada, and continues between teams from around the world. The PALMA bolt action rifles are 7.62mm NATO caliber (Winchester .308) and fire Match Grade ammunition using a 155 grain bullet using micrometer aperature (iron) sights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=  Palma USA|url=http://www.palma.org/palma-basics |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last two International Long-range Target Rifle Matches were held in Australia in 2011 and the U.S. in 2015, were won by Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://competitions.nra.org/documents/pdf/compete/nat-trophy/tro-090.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[F-Class (shooting sport)|F-Class]] is another ICFRA fullbore competition format shot with Fullbore Target Rifles at ranges up to 1000 yards, the rifles being fitted with telescopic sights and the use of fore-end and butt rests being permitted. This is a fast-growing variant of Fullbore Target Rifle. The 'F' honours George Farquharson, the Canadian inventor of F-Class.
*[[Precision Rifle Competition]]s, a relatively new long range competition format which seeks to find a balance between speed and precision, often involving movement and shooting from unusual positions with a time limit, at both known and unknown distances.
**National Rifle League (NRL) is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the growth and education of precision rifle shooting in the United States.  Their match format allows any caliber between .224 to .308 and not to exceed {{convert|3200|ft/s|m/s}}, involving at least 50 shooters with each firing minimum 140 rounds in at least 12 individual stages, over the course of at least two days.  Since its debut in 2017, currently 11 clubs from eight states are involved in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalrifleleague.org/clubs/clubs_shooters/|title=Participating Clubs/Matches|publisher=National Rifle League}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**National Rifle League 22 (NRL22) is a sub-league under the National Rifle League dedicated to [[.22 Long Rifle]] [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] rifles.  It was established to address the fact that most localities do not have access to 1000 yard ranges, but nearly all localities have 100-yard ranges and most shooters own .22 rifles.  Their championship match consist of minimum 170 rounds fired in at least 15 individual stages.  Currently 68 clubs from 31 states in the US participate in NRL22 matches, with addition to two overseas clubs from UK and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrl22.org/clubs/|title=Clubs|publisher=NRL 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* T-Class Shooting Sport Competitions. Practical sniping with precision rifle systems is a shooting sport, which gains tremendous popularity worldwide over a short period of time. It concentrates on shooting onto static or dynamic targets of various distances (known and unknown), from different positions, under artificially created, but realistic stressful circumstances. It proves to be extremely interesting both for implementation and observation, due to its demanding level of difficulty. [http://t-class.org The International T-Class Confederation] (ITCC) is a non-profit organization, which is founded in 2014 for the purpose of promotion of the T-Class shooting sport internationally, with headquarters residing in Bulgaria. It offers a Set of Rules for designing and managing T-Class Competitions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Benchrest ===
[[Benchrest shooting]] is concerned with shooting small groups with the rifleman sitting on a chair (bench) and the rifle supported from a table. Of all shooting disciplines, this is the most demanding equipment-wise. Depending on equipment class, international benchrest competitions are governed by either the [[World Benchrest Shooting Federation]] or [[World Rimfire and Air Rifle Benchrest Federation]].

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Metallic silhouette ===
[[Metallic silhouette]] competitors shoot at animal-shaped steel silhouettes (chickens, pigs, turkeys and rams) that must be knocked down to score. Banks of 5 targets are placed at up to 500 meters, with distance and size of target determined by firearm class. Classes include Handguns, Small Bore Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), High Power Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), air rifle and black powder rifle. Handguns used in the Unlimited Categories are rifle-like in appearance; [[Thompson Contender]], [[Remington XP-100]], and other pistols are chambered in rifle calibers with the power, [[aerodynamic]] efficiency, and [[external ballistics]] required for precise shooting at 200 meters. There are silhouette categories appropriate for virtually all types of adjustable sight pistols and rifles, only excluding high-velocity armor-piercing rounds that would damage targets. Targets for open sighted guns are placed between 25 and 200 meters, and are designed to provide a usable size of the hit zone of about 1.5 [[milliradian]]s (or 5 [[minutes of arc]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Western ===
* [[Cowboy action shooting]] (CAS), almost identical to USPSA and IDPA stage design but with Western cowboy themed props, shot with long guns and revolvers of the same era. Mere act of shooting itself is not enough. Competitors must choose and go by a cowboy nickname or alias and are required to look the part by donning authentic cowboy and cowgirl garments.
* [[Cowboy mounted shooting]], also called Western Mounted Shooting or simply Mounted Shooting, is a competitive equestrian sport involving the riding of a [[horse]] to negotiate a shooting pattern. Rule sets vary between shooting sport organizations, it can be based on the [[historical reenactment]] of historic shooting events held at [[Wild West Shows]] in the late 19th century. Modern events use [[blank ammunition]] instead of live rounds, certified to break a target balloon within twenty feet.&lt;ref name="Taffin2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taffin|first=John|authorlink=John Taffin|title=Single Action Sixguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vrK2zj7V3cC&amp;pg=PA299|date=28 September 2005|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-2694-6|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Para shooting ===
[[Paralympic shooting]], also known as "shooting Para sport", is an adaptation of shooting sports for competitors with disabilities. Paralympic shooting first appeared in the [[Summer Paralympics]] at the [[1976 Summer Paralympics|1976 Toronto Games]]. Para shooting is internationally governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]]. To help establish fair competition, a shooting classification called [[Para-shooting classification]] in place for the [[Paralympic Games]].

=== Competitions using factory and service firearms ===
[[Shooting competitions for factory and service firearms]], usually called Service Rifle, Service Pistol, Production, Factory or Stock, describe a set of disciplines or equipment classes where the types of permitted firearms are subject to [[type approval]] and few aftermarket modifications are permitted. Thus the terms refer to permitted equipment and modifications rather than the type of shooting format itself. The names Service Rifle and Service Pistol stem from that the equipment permitted for these types of competitions traditionally were based on [[service rifle|standard issue]] firearms used by one or several armed forces and civilian versions of these, while the terms Production, Factory and Stock often are applied to more modern disciplines with similar restrictions on equipment classes. Factory and service classes are often ''restrictive'' in nature, and the types of firearms permitted are usually rugged, versatile and affordable. In comparison, more expensive custom competition equipment are popular in more ''permissive'' equipment classes. Both types of equipment classes can be found within many disciplines, such as [[bullseye shooting|bullseye]], [[field shooting|field]], [[practical shooting|practical]] and [[long range shooting]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Plinking ===
[[Plinking]] refers to informal [[target shooting]] done for pleasure or practice typically at non-standard targets such as [[tin can]]s, [[Log (wood)|log]]s, [[carton]]s, [[fruit]]s, or any other homemade or naturally occurring objects like rocks or tree branches. The primary appeals of plinking as a sport are the broad variety of easily available locations, minimal costs, freedom in practice styles, and more relaxing and less restrictive shooting experience.

The flexibility of target choice is also why plinking is popular. A small, three-dimensional target in an outdoors setting is much more akin to a real-world [[hunting]] and [[varminting]] scenario, presenting a better simulated opportunity to practice shooting skills. A plinking target will also often react much more positively to a hit than a [[shooting target#paper or electronic|paper target]] used in formal competitions, either audibly with a sharp impact sound (hence the name "plink") or visually by bouncing, splattering or falling over. [[Steel target]]s used for formal [[action shooting|action]] and [[long range shooting]] competitions are also popular for plinking due to the ease of setting up and confirming good hits.

== Bow shooting sports ==
=== Archery ===
[[Archery|Modern competitive archery]] involves shooting [[arrow]]s at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. A person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman, and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite. The most popular competitions worldwide are called [[target archery]]. Another form, particularly popular in Europe and America, is [[field archery]], which generally is shot at targets set at various distances in a wooded setting. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games. Note that the tournament rules vary from organization to organization. [[World Archery Federation]] rules are often considered normative, but large non-WA-affiliated archery organizations do exist with different rules. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors. [[Run archery]] is a shooting discipline connecting archery with running.

The [[International Crossbow Shooting Union]] (''Internationale Armbrustschützen Union'' or IAU) was founded in [[Landshut]], [[Germany]] on June 24, 1956 as the world governing body for [[crossbow]] target shooting. The IAU supervises World, Continental and International crossbow shooting championships in 3 disciplines; 30 m Match-crossbow, 10 m Match-crossbow and Field-crossbow shooting. IAU World Championships take place every two years with Continental Championships on intervening years. Other International and IAU-Cup events take place annually.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt;

== Athletic shooting sports==
* [[Modern pentathlon]] is a [[Summer Olympic]] [[Olympic sport|sport]] includes timed shooting with an [[air pistol]] as the first of its five parts.
* [[Biathlon]] is a [[Winter Olympic]] sport combining [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] (normally freestyle skate skiing) and shooting with .22 LR rifles.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt; In Scandinavia the discipline is simply known as "Ski Shooting" (Swedish: ''skidskytte'', Danish: ''skiskydning'', Norwegian: ''skiskyting'').
* Summer biathlon, with skiing replaced by running, popular in [[Germany]].
* Ski Field Shooting (Norwegian: ''DFS skifeltskyting'') is a Norwegian discipline arranged by the [[National Rifle Association of Norway]] which is based on the origins of modern biathlon. It is normally held in a classic (in-track) format, but competitions can also be held in a freestyle skate skiing format. Furthermore, the shooting is done with fullbore calibers and usually in the field from temporary shooting ranges. The discipline is considered as a near precursor to modern biathlon.
* Field running (Norwegian: ''DFS skogsløp'') is a Norwegian discipline arranged by the [[National Rifle Association of Norway]] combining running with shooting. It is considered the summer edition of Ski Field Shooting. Running distances are usually between 2 and 3 kilometers with 2 to 3 shooting series.
* [[Target sprint]] combines medium-range run (3 × 400 m) and [[airgun]] shooting.
* [[Military patrol]] was a team [[winter sport]] in which athletes competed in cross-country skiing, [[ski mountaineering]] and [[rifle shooting]]. It was usually contested between countries or [[military unit]]s. 
* [[Underwater target shooting]] is a combined [[underwater sports|underwater]] and shooting sport that tests a competitors’ ability to accurately use a [[speargun]] via a set of individual and team events conducted in a [[swimming pool]] using [[free diving]] or Apnoea technique.

== Confrontational shooting sports ==
Confrontational shooting sports is a set of relatively new [[team sport]]s using non-lethal ranged weapons that are safe enough to shoot at other people. Previously such games were not possible due to safety concerns since bows and guns are generally too lethal and dangerous for human targets, but the development of newer [[airgun]] and [[infrared]] technologies allowed for the development of safe confrontational disciplines. While initially only for sport and recreations, professional sport competitions are now held. These type of games are also used for tactical [[gunfight]] training by military and law enforcement agencies to some extent.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Paintball ===
[[Paintball]] is a competitive sport in which players from opposing teams eliminate opponents out of play by hitting them with round, breakable, [[dye]]-filled [[oil]] and [[gelatin]] pellets ("paintballs"), shot from gas-powered [[air gun|air weapon]]s called [[paintball marker]]s. It can be played on indoor or outdoor fields scattered with natural or artificial terrain, which players use for tactical [[cover (military)|cover]]. Paintball game types vary, but can include [[capture the flag]], elimination, ammunition limits, defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from seconds to hours, or even days in scenario play. The game is developed in the 1980s and now is regularly played at a formal sporting level with organized competition involving major tournaments, professional teams and players.
* [[NXL|National Xball League]] is the [[United States]]' professional paintball circuit. The league consists of a Professional Division, consisting of the best players the sport has to offer, that extends down to the beginner ranks of "Division 5" for those newer to the tournament atmosphere. The league hosts five national events across the country in places such as [[Las Vegas]], [[Dallas]], [[Nashville]], [[Cleveland]], [[Chicago]], [[Atlantic City]] and [[Orlando]] throughout the year, starting in March and ending their season in early November. The league's largest event each year is the season finale known as the World Cup, with the 2016 World Cup hosted 3,554 players from 35 countries.
* [[NCPA (paintball)|National Collegiate Paintball Association]] is an all-volunteer, [[non-profit organization]] created by United States college players. The goal of the NCPA is to promote the positive aspects of the sport in an intercollegiate manner. The NCPA consists of two distinct classes which competes separately — Class AA is an open-class division where any college may enter and compete in regional and national tournaments. Class A is a closed-class division where only certain colleges may compete after securing a bid in the previous season, and represents the best talent of college paintball and includes universities such as [[Drexel University]], [[University of Maryland]], [[Illinois State University]], [[Purdue University]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[Penn State University]] and 10 other teams across three conferences all fighting for a national title. The association's 2007 playoff tournament was aired on [[Fox Sports Net]]'s digital cable college sports network, [[Fox College Sports]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Airsoft ===
[[Airsoft]] is a competitive sport similar in concept to paintball, in which participants from opposing teams eliminate opponents by hitting each other with [[airsoft pellet|solid round plastic pellet]]s launched from low-powered [[smoothbore]] [[air gun]]s called [[airsoft gun]]s. It is different to paintball in that airsoft pellets do not visibly mark the targets like paintballs, and thus the sport relies heavily on an [[honor system]] where a hit player has the ethical duty to call himself out of play, regardless of whether anyone else sees it happen. Most airsoft guns are also magazine-fed (unlike the commonly top-mounting pellet loader of paintball markers) with mounting platforms compatible with real firearm accessories, and tend to more closely resemble real guns in appearance, making them more popular for [[MilSim|military simulation]] and [[historical reenactment]]s. The greater toughness of airsoft pellets also allows the use of better powerplants and apparatus such as [[hop-up (airsoft)|hop-up device]] for improved [[external ballistics]], making the gameplay more accurately resemble real gunfights. They are also much cheaper for casual players to participate than paintball.

Airsoft gameplay varies in style and composition just like paintball and is played in both indoor and outdoor courses. Situations on the field frequently involve the use of real-life [[military tactic]]s to achieve objectives, and it is not uncommon for participants to emulate the uniforms and equipment of real military and police organizations for a sense of realism. Games are normally supervised (and sometimes umpired) by trained on-site administrators, and players' airsoft guns are usually checked through a [[chronograph]] to enforce power output restrictions.

There are currently no formal national or international [[Sports governing body|governing bodies]] for the airsoft sport. Competitive tournaments are usually organized by private clubs or among enthusiasts and [[professional]]/[[semi-professional]] teams (often referred to as "clans"), with rules and restrictions varying from event to event.

=== Laser tag ===
[[Laser tag]] (despite the name, [[laser]] is actually not used due to [[laser safety|safety concern]]s) is a [[tag (game)|tag game]] played with gun-shaped [[infrared]] illuminators and sensors worn on the body of the players. Since its birth in 1979, laser tag has evolved in both indoor and outdoor games, each with gameplay styles such as annihilation, [[capture the flag]], domination, VIP protection, (usually [[sci-fi]]) [[role playing]], etc. When compared to [[paintball]] and [[airsoft]], laser tag is painless and very safe because it involves no [[projectile]] impacts, and indoor games may be considered less physically demanding because most indoor venues prohibit running or roughhousing.
* Zone Laser Tag World Championships were international tournaments among professional/semi-professional teams from North American, Europe and Australia, hosted every few years since 2003.
* Bi-lateral international championships have included USA vs. Australia and Australia vs. South Africa.
* National tournaments in various countries including Australia, USA, Sweden, Finland, UK, etc.
* Private club-level events such as TagCon (annual in UK and USA), Tagfest (annual in USA), Dropzone (annual in UK), LaserStorm (annual in Australia), etc.

=== Archery Tag ===
[[Archery Tag]] is a form of combat archery sport where participants shoot one another using a bow with arrows with large [[foam]] tips. The game's rules closely resemble [[dodgeball]]. The game begins with a number of arrows in the center of the arena. At the whistle, players race to collect them, before firing them at one another across the playing field. A player is eliminated if struck by an arrow, and a player can bring an eliminated teammate back into play by catching an arrow. To avoid injury, participants wear [[Mask#Protective|protective facemask]]s and use bows with less than {{convert|30|lb|kg}} draw weight. It was invented in 2011 by John Jackson of [[Ashley, Indiana]], and experienced a boost in popularity from the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' books and [[The Hunger Games (film series)|film series]], which feature a bow-wielding protagonist [[Katniss Everdeen]]. Jackson staged Archery Tag games at local premieres of the films. By 2014, Jackson had licensed the game to 170 locations, mostly in the [[United States]], but also in [[Russia]], [[Peru]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].

[[Battle gaming]] variants of Archery Tag also exist, such as [[Dagorhir]], [[Amtgard]], [[Belegarth]] and [[Darkon Wargaming Club|Darkon]], where archers are pitted among [[melee]] players welding [[foam weapon]]s to simulate [[medieval]] battles.

{{Sociology}}
'''Social construction of technology''' (also referred to as '''SCOT''') is a theory within the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]]. Advocates of SCOT—that is, [[Social constructionism|social constructivists]]—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to [[technological determinism]] and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.

SCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], and its subtopics include [[actor-network theory]]  (a branch of the [[sociology of science and technology]]) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see [[strong program]]). Leading adherents of SCOT include [[Wiebe Bijker]] and [[Trevor Pinch]].

SCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is "the best"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being "the best" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.

SCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.

==Legacy of the Strong Programme in the sociology of science==

At the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the [[strong programme]] in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the ''Principle of Symmetry'' as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.

===Symmetry===

The ''Principle of Symmetry'' holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same ''kind'' of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, EM García, et al. "Introdução aos estudos CTS (Ciência, Tecnologia e Sociedade)." Cadernos de Ibero America (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their "objective truth", or inherent "technical superiority", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its "advanced technology" compared to the "primitiveness" of the [[Penny farthing|Penny Farthing]], but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing – in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven [[History of the bicycle|Safety Bicycle]]. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.

A weak reading of the ''Principle of Symmetry'' points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.

A strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.

== Core concepts ==

The following concepts and 'stages' of SCOT are adapted from the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR).&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, Trevor J. and Wiebe E. Bijker.  "The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other."  ''Social Studies of Science'' 14 (August 1984): 399-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretative flexibility===
''Interpretative flexibility'' means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly [[aesthetics]] to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker2.pdf | title=The Social Constructions of Technological Systems | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker | editor2= Thomas P. Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |year=1987|isbn=0-262-02262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative interpretations generate different ''problems'' to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the "best" tradeoff between traction and speed?

====Relevant social groups====
The most basic relevant groups are the ''users'' and the ''producers'' of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated – users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. [[Trevor Pinch]] has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinch|first=Trevor|title=How Users Matter: The Co-Construction of Users and Technology|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-15107-3|pages=247–269|authorlink=Trevor Pinch|editor=Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.

====Design flexibility====
Just as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.

====Problems and conflicts====
The different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the "Anti-cyclists" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.

The first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.

===Closure&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closure]] --&gt;===
Over time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:

#'''Rhetorical closure''': When social groups ''see'' the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.
#'''Redefinition of the problem''': A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the "speed problem", and this overrode previous concerns.

Closure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the "green" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)

The second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.

===Relating the content of the technological artifact to the wider sociopolitical milieu===
This is the third stage of the SCOT methodology, but the seminal article of Pinch and Bijker does not proceed to this stage. Many other historians and sociologists of technology nevertheless do. For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book "The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America | publisher=The MIT Press | author=Paul N. Edwards | year=1997 | isbn=978-0262550284 | series=Inside Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.

==Criticism==
In 1993, [[Langdon Winner]] published an influential critique of SCOT entitled "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=Summer 1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=362–378|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.
# It examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.
# It is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.
# It actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.
Other critics include [[Stewart Russell]] with his letter in the journal "[[Social Studies of Science]]" titled "The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59983">'''Soviet montage theory''' is an approach to understanding and creating [[film|cinema]] that relies heavily upon [[film editing|editing]] (''[[wikt:montage#French|montage]]'' is [[French language|French]] for "assembly" or "editing"). It is the principal contribution of [[Soviet]] film theorists to global cinema, and brought [[Formalist film theory|formalism]] to bear on [[filmmaking]].

Although [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet filmmakers]] in the 1920s disagreed about how exactly to view montage, [[Sergei Eisenstein]] marked a note of accord in "A Dialectic Approach to Film Form" when he noted that montage is "the nerve of cinema", and that "to determine the nature of montage is to solve [[Medium specificity|the specific problem]] of cinema". Its influence is far reaching commercially, academically, and politically. Alfred Hitchcock cites editing (and montage indirectly) as the lynchpin of worthwhile filmmaking. In fact, montage is demonstrated in the majority of narrative fiction film available today. Post-Soviet film theories relied extensively on montage's redirection of film analysis toward language, a literal grammar of film. A semiotic understanding of film, for example, is indebted to and in contrast with Sergei Eisenstein's wanton transposition of language "in ways that are altogether new."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Film Language; A Semiotics of Cinema|last = Metz|first = Christian|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = |pages = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several Soviet filmmakers, such as [[Lev Kuleshov]], [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Esfir Shub]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] put forth explanations of what constitutes the montage effect, Eisenstein's view that "montage is an idea that arises from the collision of independent shots" wherein "each sequential element is perceived not ''next'' to the other, but on ''top'' of the other" has become most widely accepted.

The production of films—how and under what conditions they are made—was of crucial importance to Soviet leadership and filmmakers. Films that focused on individuals rather than masses were deemed counterrevolutionary, but not exclusively so. The collectivization of filmmaking was central to the programmatic realization of the Communist state. [[Kino-Eye]] forged a film and newsreel collective that sought the dismantling of bourgeois notions of artistry above the needs of the people. Labor, movement, the machinery of life, and the everyday of Soviet citizens coalesced in the content, form, and productive character of Kino-eye repertoire.

The bulk of influence, beginning from the [[October 1917 Revolution]] until the late 1950s (oftentimes referred to as the Stalin era), brought a cinematic language to the fore and provided the groundwork for contemporary editing and documentary techniques, as well as providing a starting point for more advanced theories.

== Montage ==
Montage theory, in its rudimentary form, asserts that a series of connected images allows for complex ideas to be extracted from a sequence and, when strung together, constitute the entirety of a film's ideological and intellectual power. In other words, the editing of shots rather than the content of the shot alone constitutes the force of a film. Many directors still believe that montage is what defines cinema against other specific media.

=== Background === 
Confined to the project of Soviet expansion, film theorists of the USSR cared little for questions of meaning. Instead, the writing sought the praxis of filmmaking and theory. The pragmatic and revolutionary application of these movements stands in harsh contrast to ideas being developed simultaneously in Western Europe. Socialist Realism characterized the emergence of art within the constraints of communism. Constructivism, an extension of Futurism, sought a pre-modern integration of art into the everyday. Soviet theorists had a clear job before them: theorize in order to aid the cause of the Communist Party. The ethical and ontological dimensions explored in the West were tabled in lieu of film's potential to reach the millions in far reaches of Soviet territory, where literacy was scarce. Film was a tool with which the state could advance the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was no surprise that most of the Soviet film theorists were also filmmakers.

=== History ===
* ''[[Continuity editing]]'' – Continuity, like montage, situates editing as the driving formal element of narrative film making. DW Griffith developed and implemented a grammar of film through his use of continuity editing by establishing a logical progression of shots as to make a story intelligible to the audience. Continuity differs from montage in both its production, effect and intention. 
** ''Production'' – Continuity maintains a subservience to a predetermined narrative. For example, in Griffith's pinnacle film ''Birth of a Nation'', the editing was completely determined in reaction to the script's narrative. Montage, on the other hand, holds that the dialectical collision of images creates a film's meaning, and thus is less concerned with a script than it is the synthesis of associations between shots. 
** ''Effect and Intention'' – Continuity editing is oriented spatially; meaning it fills gaps between locations and moments in a film's narrative progression. The 180 degree rule, in which an imaginary straight line is imposed by a director in order to create logical association between characters/objects that require a shot-reverse shot, is used to solidify the spectator in a relation to the image in a way that makes visual sense. Montage may include these elements as well, but is not determined by them. Space can be discontinuous in order to disorient a spectator. For example, Dziga Vertov's ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' documents the everyday activities of people from various locations in the Soviet Union, but never gives priority to a continuity of action.
* ''[[Sergei Eisenstein]]'' – Though not the inventor of montage, Eisenstein codified its use in Soviet and international film making and theory. Beginning with his initial work in the Proletkult, Eisenstein adapted montage to the cinema and expanded his theories throughout his career to encompass the internal nature of the image. He was the most outspoken and ardent advocate of montage as revolutionary form. His work has been divided into two periods. The first is characterised by "mass dramas" in which his focus is on formalizing Marxist political struggle of the proletariat. His films, ''Strike'' and ''The Battleship Potemkin'' among the most noted of the period, centered on the capacity for the masses to revolt. The second period is characterized by a shift to individualized narratives that sprang from a synchronic understanding of montage inspired by his foray into dialectical materialism as a guiding principle. The shift between the two periods is indicative of the evolution of Marxist thinking writ large, culminating in an understanding of the material underpinning of all social and political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Dialectical Image: Eisenstein In The Soviet Cinema|last = Mircea|first = Eugenia|date = 2012|journal = Scientific Journal of Humanistic Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though largely uncredited by contemporary filmmakers, Eisenstein's theories are constantly demonstrated in films across genres, nations, languages and politics.
* ''The [[Kuleshov Effect]]'' - Lev Kuleshov's work is largely considered the basis from which all montage theory is derived. The Kuleshov Group, composed of Kuleshov and his students, set out to determine the essence of cinema. Rote repetition of the components of the cinema plagued their initial findings: competent acting, provocative lighting and elaborate scenery were not intrinsic to the filmic form. In a study of two films- "an American and a comparable Russian one"- the group identified the American film as extraordinary given the short average shot time. They then inferred that the American organization of shots was perceptually appealing to audiences. Lengthy shots, as seen in the Russian film, make the task of mentally interpreting a pattern difficult. In an essay published in ''Vestnik Kinematografii'' in 1916, Kuleshov first coined the term montage to explain the phenomena of shot succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kuleshov on Film: Writings|last = Kuleshov|first = Lev|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pinnacle experiment, Kuleshov combined independent shots of Ivan Mosjoukine, a bowl of soup, a woman in a coffin, and a woman on a sofa. The strategic ordering of the shots had a marked effect on audience interpretation of the Mosjoukine's neutral expression. This experiment demonstrated cinema's unique capacity as an art form to conjure specific reactions from the relationship between indexical images. It further demonstrated that montage is dialectical in nature, and that the synthesis of images creates unique political meanings. Recently, Kuleshov's conclusions have been brought into question. In ''The Kuleshov Effect: Recreating the Classic Experiment'', Stephen Prince and Wayne E. Hensley contest Kuleshov's findings as unscientific and merely a product of cinematic myth. They conclude that "Kuleshov's effect- understood in terms of shot juxtapositions rather than associational cues- may tell us little about film or visual communication, but its lingering power tells us a lot about the symbolic uses of the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Kuleshov Effect: Recreating the Classic Experiment|last = Hensley|first = Wayne E.|date = 1992|journal = Cinema Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adoption abroad ====
Distance, lack of access, and regulations meant that the formal theory of montage was not widely known until well after its explosion in the Soviet Union. It was only until 1929, for example, that Eisenstein's theories reached Britain in ''Close Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = That Magic Force That Is Montage': Eisenstein's Filmic Fourth Dimension, Borderline And H. D.|last = Maclean|first = Caroline|date = 2012|journal = Literature &amp; History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, filmmakers in Japan during the 1920s were "quite unaware of montage" according to Eisenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Eisenstein Reader|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = British Film Institute|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, both nations produced films that used something tantamount to continuity editing. According to Chris Robé, the internal strife between Soviet theories of montage mirrored the liberal and radical debates in the West. In his book ''Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture'', Robé illustrates the Western Left's attempts to tone-down revolutionary language and psychoanalyze characters on the screen. Hanns Sach's essays "Kitsch"(1932) and "Film Psychology" (1928) are used here to demonstrate Kitsch's aesthetic distinction from the Realist project of the Soviet Union, and also to affirm Kitsch's ability to create a more powerful affect than realism ever could. As such, Sach argued, a psychological montage was recognizable in all films, even abstract ones which held no resemblance to classic Soviet cinema. Robé also cites Zygmunt Tonecky's essay "The Preliminary of Art Film" as a reformulation of montage theory in service of abstract cinema. Zygmunt's argument centers around his disagreement with Eisenstein that montage was logical, but rather psychological. As such, abstract films defamiliarize objects and have the potential to create critical spectators. Defamiliarization was seen a catalyst for revolutionary thinking. Clearly, the adoption of Montage Theory was rarely hard and fast, but rather a stepping stone for other theories.

The split between the West and Soviet filmmaking became readily apparent with André Bazin's dismissal of montage and Cahiers du Cinéma's assertion of the primacy of auteurs. The belief that a still, highly composed, and individuated shot marked cinema's artistic significance was an affront to the dialectical method. That individual directors could compose and produce films by themselves (at least in terms of credit and authorship) made impossible the collectivization of filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Eisenstein Reader|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = British Film Institute|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 134–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's later work (''Alexander Nevsky'' [1938] and ''Ivan the Terrible'' [1944-1946]), would undercut his earlier film's appeal to masses by locating the narrative on a single individual.

==== Contemporary uses ====

The term montage has undergone radical popular redefinition in the last 30 years. It is commonly used to refer to a sequence of short shots used to demonstrate the passage of prolonged time. A famous example is the training sequence in ''Rocky'' (Avildsen 1976) in which weeks of preparation on represented through a sequence of disparate exercise footage. ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' (Hughes 1986) demonstrates the same concept in order to collapse several hours into a few short minutes of footage throughout Chicago. This differs entirely from even the most conservative interpretations of montage in the Soviet Union, wherein time is subordinate to the collision of images and their symbolic meaning.

=== Terms and concepts ===

* ''Dialectic'' – A relationship of conflict that results in a new form. This is taken explicitly and directly from Marx's explanation of the dialectic as the process by which social and political change occurs. There are varying and competing interpretations of how this was to be practiced in Soviet cinema, but the embedding of a dialectical process to montage was an understood goal of most notable Soviet filmmakers. The dialectic traditionally is composed thus: 
** ''Thesis'' – An initial force, statement, or mode. For film, thesis could be narrative, as in the foregrounded social harmony that is later disrupted; visual, like an opening shot of a sequence; or historical presumption, an economic and political situation which carries particular assumptions about the film's context. 
** ''Antithesis'' – A conflictual force, statement, or mode designed to negate or otherwise amend the thesis in some way.It is at the point of antithesis that some disagreement occurs. Pudovkin's belief that images build upon one another over the course of the film functions differently than Eisenstein's theory of collision. These two interpretations situate antithesis as either negation (Eisenstein) or addition (Pudovkin). The implication is that the synthetic result is either product (here product is used in the mathematical sense; the multiplication of syntheses) or cumulative, respectively.
** ''Synthesis'' – The result of the conflict between the antithesis and thesis, which possess within it the mechanics of its own undoing. Montage was an editorial process whereby new concepts were possible only through the relating of two or more shots, and/or the relationship of elements within a single shot. The affective result might be best demonstrated through the cattle slaughter scene in Strike, in which images of violence inflicted on workers is cut within images of a cow being slaughtered in an abattoir. These images work dialectically to produce revulsion and disgust at the notion of the oppression of the proletariat.
* ''Stimulants'' – A formal element whose combination with other elements produces the sum total of montage's effect. Its modifiers "Dominant" and "Secondary" are taken from musical composition theory in which harmonic and melodic resonances are reactions to dominant and secondary notes, chords, beats and time signatures.
** ''Dominant'' – The element or stimulus that determines all subsequent and subordinate elements or stimuli. For films that implement Montage Theory, these dominant elements are determined prior to shooting and inform the script and editing process. Not all dominants are singular elements (lighting, allusion, timing, etc.) but can be the product or sum total of all stimulants. For example, in ''The General Line'', Eisenstein determined dominant stimulants based on the composition of single shots "by the method of 'democratic' equal rights for all the stimulants, viewed together as a complex".&lt;ref name="Eisenstein 17"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Eisenstein Reader|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = British Film Institute|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Eisenstein's attempt to parallel Japanese Kabuki theater, which composed movement in a simultaneously fragmented but hierarchal fashion. More frequently, however, dominants took overt and singular form. In ''Man with a Movie Camera'', Vertov constructs one sequence- scarcely definable as a "scene"- through the dominant movement of circularity, displaying industrial threading machines and human movements that performed circularly.
** ''Secondary/Subordinate'' – The elements or stimuli that support and highlight the dominant. In film, as in music, these create a harmony between and through shots. Without secondary/subordinate stimuli, the internal shot structure lacked the requisite dialectical composition necessary for Socialist Realism's revolutionary form. Eisenstein asserted that competing and complementary secondary stimuli were useful in conjuring particular psychic responses from the audience. Overtonal analysis of sound in ''The General Line'', for example, reveals that there is an "orchestral counterpoint" to almost every shot, coaxing a texture from the film, rather than a purely visual or aural experience.&lt;ref name="Eisenstein 17"/&gt;
* ''Theme'' – The generalizable content of a film. Here, we draw primarily from Vsevolod Pudovkin's work in ''Film Technique'', in which he argues that the foundational work of montage is realized by first determining a theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pudovkin's Films And Film Theory|last = Dart|first = Peter|publisher = Arno Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Eisenstein, Pudovkin believed that all necessary elements in recognizing a theme must be evident in a single shot rather than a collision of shots. The catch, however, is that the phenomenon chosen to represent a theme should be shot from different angles and perspectives in order to portray the "superficial and the profound interrelationships of actuality". Theme is not, however, a matter of spectatorial interpretation. Rather, it is meant to arrive organically at the conclusion of a given film due exclusively to the control wielded by the director.&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. pg. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In a mild critique of DW Griffith's ''Intolerance'', Pudovkin advocated for a shortening of the film (3 hours and 30 minutes) in order to crystallize and condense the film's theme. As it was presented, Griffith's film dilutes its own political potential by attempting create visual themes from non-phenomenological concepts. Instead, as Pudovkin elaborated, a filmmaker should choose concepts that are depictable in images rather than language.
** ''Analysis'' takes place when a theme is explored from sufficient perspectives. Analysis is derived by examination of individual shots, but is only relevant when synthesized. Peter Dart, in his description of Pudovkin's concept of analysis, defines it.

{{quote|An object or an event becomes "vivid and effective" on the screen only when the necessary details are correctly found and arranged [...] Pudovkin referred to a hypothetical street demonstration. An actual observer of a demonstration can get only one point of view at a time. To a get a broad view he would have to climb to the roof of a building adjacent to the demonstration, but then he might not be able to read the banners. If he mingled with the crowd he could only see a small portion of the demonstration. A filmmaker, however, can photograph the demonstration from several different points of view and edit the shots to present the spectator with a view of the demonstration, which transforms from a "spectator" into an "observer".&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}
** Identification is the capacity for the audience to fully comprehend the theme of a film. Pudovkin was concerned here with the capacity for spectators to follow his films and hedged against breaks in continuity. As such, identification was mainly concerned with calculating a consistent theme structure and making sure images were smoothly shot and seamlessly edited. Pudovkin achieved both of these tasks by "[cutting] on action", or editing shots together through a unified movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pudovkin, ''Film Technique'' p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Affect, Emotion and Pathos'' – Often used interchangeably by many Soviet filmmakers and theorists, these are the impressions felt by a(n) audience/spectator from a film or parts of a film. The central problem of Eisenstein's book ''Nonindifferent Nature'' is the relationship between pathos/affect and the method by which art coaxes it. In the chapter ''On the Structure of Things'', Eisenstein begins with the supposition that represented phenomena depict material elements which explicates a system of structuration between those elements and the phenomena itself. The composition of music is a case-in-point. From the emotional affect of verbalized speech comes the tonal and rhythmic qualities expressed in a given composition. Cinematography generates a similar relational dialectic with images and referents, and through the logic of montage. In short, when one structures the succession of images by its emotional referent, the result is affective moving images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nonindifferent Nature|last = Eisenstein|first = Sergei|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic unity of ''Battleship Potemkin'', for example, sustains particular pathos in particular instances. In the "Odessa Steps" scene, dramatic tension rises not from individuated elements, but the organization of elements (shots, composition, lighting, etc.) from natural model of tension. This model, from which Eisenstein theorizes all forms of organic growth and unity, is that of a logarithmic spiral. This spiral, in which the smaller point corresponds to its larger counterpoint in the same ratio that the larger point corresponds to the figure as whole, explains organic growth within nature, the relations of parts to evolutionary growth, and the process by which transformation takes place.  Platonic scholars and art theorists have identified this spiral and formula as a central figure of classical beauty. It can located in classical architecture and painting, as well as contemporary photographic composition (the rule of thirds). For Eisenstein, the capacity for a film (or any art, but specifically "plastic arts") to work affectively/emotionally, organic unity must be achieved, the growth of its constituent parts resembling the logarithmic spiral. When organic unity is realized, one can observe clear pathos. Eisenstein defines pathos as "...what forces the viewer to jump out of his seat. It is what forces him to flee from his place. It is what forces him to clap, to cry out. It is what forces his eyes to gleam with ecstasy before tears of ecstasy appear in them. In word, it is everything that forces the viewer to "be beside himself".&lt;ref&gt;Nonindifferent Nature p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Odessa Steps" scene, the collision of contrary movements- e.g. up and down stairs, from many guns to one muzzle- exemplifies an organic growth concept, and is informed by the pathos of the shooting; one of horror. The ex stasis (out of a state) is observed in viewers who trace the logic of organic unity- the compositional and narrative growth of the scene- to its foundational pathos. The affective pay-off is a synthesis of a spectator's experience with the radicalized representations on the screen.

In ''The General Line'' (referred in the text as ''The Old and the New'') the pathos of the milk separator is localized in order to examine the (in)voluntary contamination of pathos by themes and supposedly neutral elements. Like ''Potemkin'', ''The General Line'' invoked the theme of "collective unity" within a community.&lt;ref name="Nonindifferent 46"&gt;''Nonindifferent Nature'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; "And all this because the scheme 'of a chain reaction'- buildup of intensity- explosion- leaps from explosion to explosion- gives a clearer structural picture of the leaps from one state to another, characteristic for the ecstasy of particulars accumulating into the pathos of the whole."&lt;ref name="Nonindifferent 46"/&gt; However, a number of factors separate the scenes' pathos. The use of a new 28-inch lens allowed for a simultaneous splitting and unifying effect in The General Line. Also, milk's transformation to cream was a metaphorical device used to stand-in for the peasants' own transformation. These, and other examples, illustrate that pathos, as determined by exterior features, is incomplete. Rather, pathos and emotion were self-determined and intrinsic to form. The example of several painterly renderings of Christ's expulsion of the moneylenders and his eventual resurrection demonstrate a consistent pathos, despite different artists and moments. This suggests a parallel "inner discovery" process embedded in thematic works. Finally, Eisenstein identifies the dialectical process as the precipitating force for unearthing pathos. "The law of construction of processes- the basis of their form- in these cases will be identical. The effectiveness of the results in the norms of each area is equally 'transported beyond the limits' of these norms and the areas themselves as well. The actual processes- according to the same formula of ex stasis- is 'being beside oneself'. And this formula is nothing but the moment (instant) of the culmination of the dialecti law of transition of quantity into quality[...]The areas of application are different. But the stages are identical. The nature of the effects achieved is different. But the 'formulas' at the basis of these highest stages of manifestation, independent of the areas themselves, are identical."&lt;ref&gt;''Nonindifferent Nature'', p. 198-99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
* '''Attractions''' – The montage of attractions asserts that an audience is moved emotionally, psychically, and politically by sudden bursts of aggressive movement. Eisenstein adapted this theory from the Proletkult to the cinema in his 1923 essay The Montage of Attractions. Attractions are a molecular unit of a theatrical whole that is independent of narrative and setting. In his 1924 essay The Montage of Film Attractions, Eisenstein makes explicit linkage of film and theater through a common audience. Here, an attraction is "...any demonstrable fact (an action, an object, a phenomenon, a conscious combination, and so on) that is known and proven to exercise a definite effect on the attention and emotions of the audience and that, combined with others, possess the characteristics of concentrating the audience's emotions in any direction dictated by the production's purpose."&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstein Reader'', pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to ground attractions in revolutionary ideology in order coax the audience into a sympathetic position.
* '''Metric''' – where the editing follows a specific number of frames (based purely on the physical nature of time), cutting to the next shot no matter what is happening within the image.  This montage is used to elicit the most basal and emotional of reactions in the audience. Metric montage was based on the absolute length of shots. The schema of connection is based on the necessity of rapidity. Eisenstein clarifies its implementation by comparing it to beat structures in music, which dictates that structures that fail to follow the "law of prime numbers (relationships)" are incapable of causing any physiological effect. He favors, instead, very basic and simple beat structures (3:4, 2:4, 1:4).&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstein Reader'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;
** [http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T112/EditingIllustrations02.htm Metric montage example] from Eisenstein's [[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|''October'']].
* '''Rhythmic''' – Rhythmic montage seeks an editorial and compositional relationship in which movements within frames are as important as lengths of shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/330034|title=Film form; essays in film theory,|last=Sergei|first=Eisenstein|date=|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|others=Leyda, Jay, 1910–1988,|year=1949|isbn=0156309203|edition=[1st ed.]|location=New York,|pages=73|oclc=330034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity that was cautioned against for metric montage is praised for rhythmic. Since the content of the shot is a dominant element of the shot length, the ascending or descending meter of the shots makes intuitive visual sense.

* '''Tonal''' – a tonal montage uses the emotional meaning of the shots—not just manipulating the temporal length of the cuts or its rhythmical characteristics—to elicit a reaction from the audience even more complex than from the metric or rhythmic montage.  For example, a sleeping baby would emote calmness and relaxation.
** [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207102817/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/98-99/9505060m/sounds/mourn.mov Tonal example] from Eisenstein's ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''. This is the clip following the death of the revolutionary sailor Vakulinchuk, a martyr for sailors and workers.
* '''Overtonal/Associational''' – the overtonal montage is the cumulation of metric, rhythmic, and tonal montage to synthesize its effect on the audience for an even more abstract and complicated effect.
** [http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T112/EditingIllustrations05.htm Overtonal example] from Pudovkin's ''Mother''. In this clip, the men are workers walking towards a confrontation at their factory, and later in the movie, the [[protagonist]] uses ice as a means of escape.[http://amicus.collectionscanada.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;d=2&amp;v=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;itm=25787857].
* '''Intellectual''' – uses shots which, combined, elicit an intellectual meaning.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071110162540/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/98-99/9505060m/objects/intellectual.htm] Intellectual montage seeks to use few images, but images that are rich in cultural, symbolic, and political history. Their collision brings about complex concepts that traditional montage could not achieve. It was at this time (1929) that Eisenstein sought to distance filmmaking from an adherence to positivist realism. Intellectual montage sought to present things not as they were, but as they functioned in society. In his examination of Japanese and Chinese language, Eisenstein determined a linguistic link between language and montage. Hieroglyphs endemic to either country's language were highly contextual. The combination of two characters created concepts, but when separated were neutral. The example Eisenstein gives is the combination of the symbols 'eye' and 'water' produce the concept 'crying'. This logic was extended to Japanese Kabuki theater, which used a montage technique of acting, wherein parts of the body were moved in relation and collision to the whole and other parts of the body. Film, similarly, could collide objects within the frame just as readily as it could between frames. Intellectual montage seeks to capitalize on an internal frame as well as the composition and content of the image itself, without sacrificing a dialectical approach, which Eisenstein ultimately concluded was the downfall of Japanese cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein Reader, pp. 82–92&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual montage was most notably used as a productive model in Eisenstein's The General Line (1929). Here, dominants- shots and elements within the shot that mark the schema of all adjacent shots and elements- are not foregrounded, but delayed in an attempt to mimic musical resonance. Resonances are secondary stimuli that help to highlight the dominant. It is here that one should note the understandable conflation of overtonal and intellectual montage. In fact, overtonal montage is a kind of intellectual montage, since both attempt to elicit complex ideas from the collision of cinematic stimulants.
** [https://tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T112/EditingIllustrations06.php Intellectual montage examples] from Eisenstein's [[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|''October'']] and [[Strike (1925 film)|''Strike'']]. In ''Strike'', a shot of striking workers being attacked cut with a shot of a bull being slaughtered creates a film metaphor suggesting that the workers are being treated like cattle. This meaning does not exist in the individual shots; it only arises when they are juxtaposed.
** At the end of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' the execution of Colonel Kurtz is juxtaposed with the villagers' ritual slaughter of a water buffalo.
* '''Vertical''' montage focuses on the a single shot or moment, rather than across (horizontal) various shots. Indelibly, vertical montage provides a closer reading of images and their content, as well as permits non-visual phenomena to be considered alongside the image proper.
** ''Moving Camera'' – A dynamic rather than static camera is often used for the same effect as editing. Though not expressly a form of montage, since editing isn't required, a moving camera can cover movement across space continuously. Dynamic action, in which characters or objects move across protracted distances, was the motivating factor in choosing to move the camera. Peter Dart identifies relatively few uses of a moving camera in his analysis of Pudovkin's ''Mother'' (1926), ''The End of St. Petersburg'' (1928), ''Storm Over Asia'' (1928), and Eisenstein's ''Battleship Potemkin'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these films and scenes, the moving camera captures movement. One reason for so few moving shots was that it provided undue continuity and forfeited the discontinuity demanded by the dialectical method of montage.&lt;ref&gt;Pudovkin, ''Film Technique'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Moving camera and mise en scene culminates in what we call the "Inner Montage".
** ''Audio/Visual'' – The synaesthetic mode, characterised by a total sensory analysis of film, transforms montage from a purely visual category to one incorporating visual and audio elements. This theory's foundation can be seen in Eisenstein's essay "The Fourth Dimension in Cinema", in which Japanese Kabuki Theater and Haiku are examined as in their fragmented totality. Leonard C. Pronko connects Eisenstein's sensory analysis to a formalized synaesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theater East And West; Perspectives Toward A Total Theater|last = Pronko|first = Leonard Cabell|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1967|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication was threefold. First, this grounded montage theory within a non-western language, which gave credibility to Montage Theory as a universal principle. Second, as Steve Odin illustrates, it provided an opening for Japanese art and culture to be examined within a modern context.&lt;ref&gt;Odin, Steve. pp. 69–81&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the integration of other senses into the theory of montage laid the groundwork for Montage Theory's persistence throughout historical and technological changes in cinema.

== Intellectual montage ==

In his later writings, Eisenstein argues that montage, especially intellectual montage, is an alternative system to [[continuity editing]]. He argued that "Montage is conflict" (dialectical) where new ideas, emerge from the collision of the montage sequence (synthesis) and where the new emerging ideas are not innate in any of the images of the edited sequence. A new concept explodes into being. His understanding of montage, thus, illustrates Marxist dialectics.

Concepts similar to intellectual montage would arise during the first half of the 20th century, such as [[Imagism]] in poetry (specifically [[Pound's Ideogrammic Method]]), or [[Cubism|Cubism's]] attempt at synthesizing multiple perspectives into one painting. The idea of associated concrete images creating a new (often abstract) image was an important aspect of much early [[Modernism|Modernist]] art.

Eisenstein relates this to non-literary "writing" in pre-literate societies, such as the ancient use of pictures and images in sequence, that are therefore in "conflict". Because the pictures are relating to each other, their collision creates the meaning of the "writing". Similarly, he describes this phenomenon as [[dialectical materialism]].

Eisenstein argued that the new meaning that emerged from conflict is the same phenomenon found in the course of historical events of social and revolutionary change. He used intellectual montage in his feature films (such as ''Battleship Potemkin'' and ''October'') to portray the political situation surrounding the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

He also believed that intellectual montage expresses how everyday thought processes happen. In this sense, the montage will in fact form thoughts in the minds of the viewer, and is therefore a powerful tool for propaganda.

Intellectual montage follows in the tradition of the ideological Russian [[Proletcult Theatre]] which was a tool of political agitation. In his film ''Strike'', Eisenstein includes a sequence with cross-cut editing between the slaughter of a bull and police attacking workers. He thereby creates a film metaphor: assaulted workers = slaughtered bull. The effect that he wished to produce was not simply to show images of people's lives in the film but more importantly to shock the viewer into understanding the reality of their own lives. Therefore, there is a revolutionary thrust to this kind of film making.

Eisenstein discussed how a perfect example of his theory is found in his film ''October'', which contains a sequence where the concept of "God" is connected to class structure, and various images that contain overtones of political authority and divinity are edited together in descending order of impressiveness so that the notion of God eventually becomes associated with a block of wood. He believed that this sequence caused the minds of the viewer to automatically reject all political class structures.

== Counter theories and criticism ==
Though montage was widely acknowledged in principle as the mechanism that constitutes cinema, it was not universally believed as cinema's essence. Lev Kuleshov, for example, expressed that though montage makes cinema possible, it does not hold as much significance as performance, a type of internal montage. Additionally, Kuleshov expressed the subservience of montage to the will of those who deploy it.&lt;ref&gt;Kuleshov, ''Kuleshov on Film'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; In his comparisons between Russian, European, and American cinema prior to the Russian Revolution, Kuleshov could not identify a unifying theory between them and concluded a relativistic approach to filmmaking, opting for something similar to later auteur theories. The implication of an exclusive focus on montage is one in which performances become unconvincing given the actors jilted belief in his/her own significance.

Kino-eye, composed of various newsreel correspondents, editors, and directors, also took indirect aim at montage as the overarching principle of cinema. Kino-eye was interested in capturing life of the proletariat and actualizing revolution, and was accused by Eisenstein of being devoid of ideological method. Films like Dziga Vertov's ''The Man with a Movie Camera'' utilized montage (almost all films did at the time), but packaged images without discernible political connection between shots. Vertov, on the other hand, saw the fictional revolutions represented in Eisenstein's films as lacking the visceral weight of unscripted action.

== Other Soviet film theories and practices ==

=== Socialist Realism ===
Socialist Realism speaks to the project of art within Stalin's period. Art, inherently implosive when funded and regulated by the state, requires form and content to avoid neutrality. The five-year plan, which demanded workers to "overfill the plan" required filmmakers to exceed baseline standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pudovkin, Socialist Realism, And The Classical Hollywood Style|last = Kepley Jr.|first = Vance|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Film &amp; Video|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalism, in which art can only express its subject singularly rather than relationally, is incapable of exposing the structural and systemic characteristics of phenomena. Realism, on the other hand, is concerned with relationships, causality, and the production of informed spectators. As such, Socialist Realism was primarily a literary movement, characterized by works such as Maxim Gorky's novel ''Mother''. Filmmakers took cues from their literary counterparts, implementing a narrative and character style reminiscent of communist cultural values. Below are some factors that influenced the cinematic Socialist Realist approach.
* ''Synchronized sound'' was a contentious issue with Soviet film theorist. Pudovkin railed against its use given its capacity for commodification within capitalist society and, primarily, its propensity to move film toward naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Peter. p.137&lt;/ref&gt; In his reasoning, since sync sound was conditioned to the image, it could only lend itself toward enhanced continuity. Continuity, a process that mitigates the dialectical collision of concepts, would dilute the radical potential of films. Further, any dialectical potential for sound had already been explored in cinema, since musical accompaniment had a well established history by the time synchronized sound had been introduced. However, Pudovkin later reversed his position on sync-sound. Joining Eisenstein and others, Pudovkin came to understand sound not a complementary, but as a counterpoint capable of imbuing films with additional conflictual elements. The inherent tension between this position and the State's mandate for narrative clarity and continuity would be a source of confusion and stagnation for much of this period. Kino-eye took the problem of sound from a documentary/newsreel perspective. In the essays ''Let's Discuss Ukrainfilm's First Sound Film: Symphony of the Donbas'' (1931) and ''First Steps'' (1931) Vertov identifies and dismantles the technical, logistical and political hurdles to sync-sound in newsreel cinema. By using his film ''Enthusiasm'' (1931), Vertov demonstrated that sound was not only possible, but essential to the evolution of newsreel. Vertv writes
{{quote|And finally, the most important observation. When, in ''Enthusiasm'', the industrial sounds of the All-Union Stokehold arrive at the square, filling the streets with their machine music to accompany the gigantic festive parades; when on the other hand, the sounds of military bands, of parades [...] fuse with the sounds of the machines, the sounds of competing factory shops; when the work of bridging the gape in the Donbas passes before us as an endless "Communist Sabbath", as "the days of industrialization", as a red star, red banner campaign. We must view this not as a shortcoming, but as a serious, ''long-range experiment''.&lt;ref&gt;Vertov p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* ''Narration'' – Story clarity was an overriding principle of [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realist]] filmmaking, grounding it in accessibility to a wide array of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley Jr. p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vance Kepley Jr., this was a response to the emerging belief that early montage films unnecessarily confined cinema's appeal to highly competent film audiences rather than a general public.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley Jr., p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Hollywood's influence'' – Over the course of the 1930s, the shift toward Socialist Realism became Party policy and was modeled after Hollywood's popularity with the general public. Ironically, the continuity style that had been the divergent point for Montage Theorists asserted itself as the paramount editing technique of the new Soviet filmmaking mandate. Kepley, in a case study regarding Pudovkin's ''The Return of Vasilii Bortnikov'' (1953), explains the narrative, editorial, and compositional influence Hollywood had over Soviet Realist filmmaking at the time. In short, not only did Pudovkin willingly amend the concept of montage to exclude an intellect-centric model to suit audience reception, but was also under strict regulation to meet the Stalinist standard of Socialist Realism that came to define the 1940s and 1950s. Such strict regulation, combined with the presumptive Hollywood model, ultimately led to a dearth of films produced in the subsequent decades in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Kepley Jr., pp 3–12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kino-eye ===
Kinoks ("cinema-eye men") / Kinoglaz ("Kino-eye") – The group and movement founded by Dziga Vertov. The Council of Three was the official voice of Kino-eye, issuing statements on the group's behalf. The demands, elaborated in films, conferences, and future essays, would seek to situate Kino-eye as the preeminent Soviet filmmaking collective. In the Art of the Cinema, Kuleshov issues a challenge to non-fiction filmmakers: "Ideologues of the non-fictional film!- give up convincing yourselves of the correctness of your viewpoints: they are indisputable. Create or point out methods of creating genuine, exciting newsreels. ... When it is possible to film easily and comfortably, without having to consider either location, or the light conditions, then the authentic flowering of the non-fictional film will take place, depicting our environment, our construction, our land."&lt;ref&gt;Kuleshov on Film, p. 122-23&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Manifesto''' – In their introductory statement ''We: Variant of a Manifesto'' (1922), Vertov lays the groundwork for Kino-eye's interpretation of cinema and the role of each component of the cinematic apparatus (producer, spectator, exhibit). The manifesto demanded:
** The death of cinematography "so that the art of cinema may live." Their objection, spelled out in "To Cinematographers – The Council of Three", criticised the old guard of holding to prerevolutionary models which had ceased their useful function. Routine, rooted in the rote reliance on a six-act psychodrama, had doomed film to stagnation. In ''The Resolution of the Council of Three,'' April 10, 1923, Kino-eye identified newsreel as the necessary correction to devolution of film practice. 
** The purity of cinema and its undue conflation with other art forms. Here, they are combating a premature synthesis of forms. Theater, which had long been the center of revolutionary art, was condemned for its desperate integration of elemental objects and labors in order to stay relevant. Film, and more specifically newsreel, encountered life as it happened and created synthesis from life, rather than an assemblage of representational objects that approach but never capture life.
** The exclusion of man as a subject for film and toward a poetry of machines. In a follow up to The Resolution of the Council of Three, April 10, 1923, Kino-eye published an excerpt decrying American cinema's reliance on humanness as a benchmark for filmmaking, rather than treating the camera as an eye itself. "We cannot improve the making of our eyes, but we can endlessly perfect the camera." The reproduction of human perception was the implicit project of film until this point, which Kino-eye saw as a hamstrung endeavor for cinema. Rather than assume the position of humanness, Kino-eye sought to breakdown movement in its intricacies, thereby liberating cinema from bodily limitations and providing the basis from which montage could fully express itself.
** The determination and essence of systems of movement. Analyzing movement was a step in the reconstitution of the body and the machine. "I am kino-eye, I create a man more perfect than Adam, I create thousands of different people in accordance with preliminary blueprints and diagrams of different kinds. I am kino-eye. From one person I take the hands, the strongest and most dexterous; from another I take the legs, the swiftest and most shapely; from a third, the most beautiful and expressive head- and through montage I create a new, perfect man. I am kino-eye, I am a mechanical eye. I, a machine, show you the world as only I can see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kino-Eye : The Writings Of Dziga Vertov|last = Vertov|first = Dziga|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Radio-pravda''' was an attempt to record sounds of life. Vertov published ''Kinopravda'' &amp; ''Radiopravda'' in 1925. In the service of capturing average life, the sounds of life was left unaccounted for in cinema. The integration of audio-visual technologies had already taken place by the time Kino-eye published its statement. The intent was to fully integrate both technologies to be broadcast to a worldwide proletariat audience. "We must prepare to turn these inventions of the capitalist world to its own destruction. We will not prepare for the broadcast of operas and dramas. We will prepare wholeheartedly to give the workers of every land the opportunity to see and hear the whole world in an organized form; to see, hear, and understand one another."&lt;ref&gt;Vertov, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Critique of Art''' – Art, as conceptualized in various essays but most explicitly in ''Kino-Eye'' (Vertov, 1926), confronts fiction as "Stupefaction and suggestion…"&lt;ref name="Vertov 63"&gt;Vertov, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to critique was thought to reside exclusively within realistic documentation alone. As such, art-drama's weakness was its inability to excite protest; its danger the capacity to deceive like "hypnosis".&lt;ref name="Vertov 63"/&gt; Kino-eye believed that the illusion created by art-drama could only be combated by consciousness. In section 3, ''Very Simple Slogans'' of the ''Kino-Eye'' essay, Vertov details the following axioms of Kinoks:
** "Film-drama is the opium of the people.
** Down with the immortal kings and queens of the screen! Long live the ordinary mortal, filmed in life at his daily tasks!
** Down with the bourgeois fairy-tale script! Long live life as it is!
** Film-drama and religion are deadly weapons in the hands of capitalists. By showing our revolutionary way of life, we will wrest that weapon from the enemy's hands.
** The contemporary artistic drama is a vestige of the old world. It is an attempt to pour our revolutionary reality into bourgeois molds.
** Down with the staging of everyday life! Film us as we are.
** The scenario is a fairy tale invented for us by a writer. We live our own lives, and we do not submit to anyone's fictions.
** Each of us does his task in life and does not prevent anyone else from working. The film workers' task is to film us so as not to interfere with our work.
** Long live the kino-eye of proletarian revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Vertov, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Constructivism and Kino-eye''' – Though Vertov considered himself a constructivist, his practices and those of Aleskei Gan, perhaps the most vocal of the movement, diverged. Gan and other constructivists took the statements of the Kino-Eye essay to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the worker's purpose and usefulness. While Vertov understood the labor of art to be culprit of mass illusion, to Gan, ''artistic labor'' was a highly valuable endeavor with which workers could ultimately dismantle ''artistry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Labor Demonstrations: Aleksei Gan's "Island Of The Young Pioneers," Dziga Vertov's "Kino-Eye," And The Rationalization Of Artistic Labor|last = Romberg|first = Kristin|date = 2013|journal = October|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Constructivism does not strive to create new types of art. It develops forms of artistic labor through which workers can actually enter into artistic labor without losing touch with their material labor. ... Revolutionary Constructivism wrenches photography and cinematography from the hands of art-makers. Constructivism digs art's grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Konstruktivizm mogil'shchik iskusstva|last = Gan|first = Aleskei|date = March 1924|journal = Zrelishcha|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gan's film ''Island of the Young Pioneers'' follows a community of children who live self-sustaining lives in the countryside. The film, lost or destroyed over time, was produced in the hope of marrying artistic performance and reality in a way that meets the standards of Party leadership and the Socialist Realist movement. The result was a productive process that mirrored the summer camps already enjoyed by many Russian youth of the time. The camera captured Gan's ability to elicit performance as a ''practice'' not a ''product''.

"Above all, I constructed a true cinema-object not on top of everyday life, but out of everyday life. The story offered by comrade Verevkin's script did not weigh life down in my work. Instead, the everyday life of the Young Pioneers absorbed the story, making it possible to capture the essence of the young Leninists in their spontaneous actuality [or immediate reality, neposredstvennoi deistvitel'nosti]. This materialist approach freed us from art cinema's bourgeois illustration of a literary text, overcame the "government-issue" formalism of the newsreel, and allowed us to productively establish devices for filming with a socialist character."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Da zdravstvuet demonstratsiia byta|last = Gan|first = Aleskei|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristin Romberg mediates the conflictual but parallel nature of Kino-eye and Gan's constructivism by identifying empathy as the central dividing element. ''Island of the Young Pioneers'' enters into a role-playing relationship between and with children that seeks to build an understanding between them. This, along with the focus on radicalizing children specifically, was inconceivable within Kino-eye's framework. Vertov, concerned with machinery, movement and labor, universalized Kino-eye's strategy of constant critique, with little room for empathy and nuance.

== "The Dramaturgy of Film Form" ("The Dialectical Approach of Film Form") ==
In this essay, Eisenstein explicates how art is created and sustained through a dialectical process. He begins with this supposition:

{{quote|According to Marx and Engels the system of the dialectic is only the conscious reproduction of the dialectical course (essence) of the external events of the world. (Razumovsky, The Theory of Historical Materialism, Moscow, 1928)

Thus:

the projection of the dialectical system of objects into the brain

-into abstraction creation-

-into thought-

produces dialectical modes of thought- dialectical materialism-

PHILOSOPHY

Similarly:

the projection of the same system of objects- in concrete creation- in form- produces

ART

The basis of this philosophy is the dynamic conception of objects: being as a constant evolution from the interaction between two contradictory opposites. Synthesis that evolves from the opposition between thesis and antithesis. It is equally of basic importance for the correct conception of art and all art forms.

In the realm of art this dialectical principle of the dynamic is embodied in

CONFLICT

as the essential basic principle of the existence of every work of art and every form.&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstein Reader'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this, the form an art takes grants it its dialectical and political dimension. The material from which it is created is inherently conflictual and holds the seeds of its own destruction (antithesis). Without this understanding, montage is merely a succession of images reminiscent of DW Griffith's continuity editing. Here, it is important to note that, for Eisenstein, art form is inherently political. The danger is in claiming it's neutral until a story or interpretation are attached. While theories of montage prior to this sought political mobilization, Dramaturgy took montage beyond the cinema and implicated film form in broader Marxist struggle.

'''Starrett City Associates''' is a group of investors, led by [[Disque Deane]], that owned the [[Starrett City, Brooklyn|Starrett City]] housing complex in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] until 2008. The firm is best known for unsuccessfully defending a landmark civil rights lawsuit that concerned "[[reverse discrimination]]" and [[racial quota]]s in the housing complex, and for controversy during the sale of the development in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="JacksonKeller2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth T.

==History==
[[Starrett City, Brooklyn|Starrett City]] was constructed from 1972 to 1975, as part of the Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Act to develop the area now known as [[Spring Creek, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=JacksonKeller2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GatewayIIFEIS-2009&gt;{{cite web|author1=AKRF, Inc., Eng-Wong Taub &amp; Associates, Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, Inc.|title=FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT for GATEWAY ESTATES II|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/developers/environmental-review.page|website=[[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|publisher=[[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development]]|accessdate=November 16, 2015|date=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was built, Starrett City was the largest housing development in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4lawschool.com/property/us.shtml U.S. v. Starrett City Associates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the largest federally subsidized apartment complex.&lt;ref name=JacksonKeller2010 /&gt;

===Discrimination charges===
In 1980, the [[NAACP]] initiated a class-action suit against Starrett City Associates and charged that the owner of the housing complex attempted to maintain racial quotas by selective approval of tenants based on racial and ethnic profiles.  The quotas caused minority applicants to wait longer than white applicants for spaces in the complex.  Starrett City Associates argued that the quotas were necessary to maintain racial balance.  In other words, if the quotas had not been in place, the population would have been disproportionately non-white. The [[New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal]] was also named as a defendant in the suit because it had oversight of the public money spent to build the project and allowed the quotas to exist. The case was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the fall of 1988, and the court ruled against Starrett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/1988/sg880385.txt United States Department of Justice, Supreme Court Brief No. 88-82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Starrett proposed to make apartments available to Soviet Jews who came to the United States in order to maintain racial diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Finder | first=Alan | title=Brooklyn Landlord, To Keep Racial Mix, Looks to Soviet Jews | website=The New York Times | date=1990-07-24 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/24/nyregion/brooklyn-landlord-to-keep-racial-mix-looks-to-soviet-jews.html | access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of Starrett City===

In early 2007, Starrett City Associates attempted to sell Starrett City for $1.3 billion to [[Clipper Equity LLC]], a partnership of [[David Bistricer]] and Sam Levinson.  The sale was ultimately unsuccessful due to public opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NY State Housing Chief Rejects New Starrett City Bid

For example, before the invention of the [[printing press]], possession of a large collection of laboriously hand-copied [[book]]s was a symbol of wealth and scholarship. In later centuries, books (and literacy) became more common, so a [[private library]] became less-rarefied as a status symbol, though a sizable collection still commands respect.

In some past cultures of East Asia, [[pearl]]s and [[jade]] were major status symbols, reserved exclusively for royalty. Similar legal exclusions applied to the [[toga]] and its variants in [[ancient Rome]], and to [[cotton]] in the [[Aztec Empire]].  Special colors, such as [[Imperial yellow jacket|imperial yellow]] (in China) or [[royal purple]] (in ancient Rome) were reserved for royalty, with severe penalties for unauthorized display. Another common status symbol of the European medieval past was [[heraldry]], a display of one's family name and history.

==Societal recognition==
Status symbols also indicate the cultural values of a society or a subculture. For example, in a [[commerce|commercial]] society, having money or wealth and things that can be bought by wealth, such as cars, houses, or fine clothing, are considered status symbols. Where warriors are respected, a [[scar]] can represent honor or courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.missedinhistory.com/blogs/real-men-have-dueling-scars.htm|title=Real Men Have Dueling Scars|date=2009-05-04|work=Stuff You Missed in History Class|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[intellectual]]s being able to think in an intelligent and educated way is an important status symbol regardless of material possessions.  In academic circles, a long list of publications and a securely [[tenure]]d position at a prestigious university or research institute are a mark of high status. It has been speculated that the earliest foods to be domesticated were luxury feast foods used to cement one's place as a "rich person".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden B 2003. Were luxury foods the first domesticates? Ethnoarchaeological perspectives from Southeast Asia. World Archaeology 34(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[uniform]] symbolizes membership in an organization, and may display additional insignia of rank, specialty, tenure and other details of the wearer's status within the organization. A state may confer [[award|decoration]]s, medals or [[badge]]s  that can show that the wearer has heroic or official status. Elaborate [[color-coded]] [[academic regalia]] is often worn during [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremonies, indicating [[academic rank]] and specialty.

In many cultures around the world, diverse [[visual markers of marital status]] are widely used. [[Coming of age]] rituals and other [[rites of passage]] may involve granting and display of symbols of a new status. [[Dress code]]s may specify who ought to wear particular kinds or styles of clothing, and when and where specific items of clothing are displayed.

== Body modifications ==
{{sources|section|date=November 2017}}
The condition and appearance of one's body can be a status symbol. In times past, when most workers did physical labor outdoors under the sun and often had little food, being pale and fat was a status symbol, indicating wealth and prosperity (through having more than enough food and not having to do manual labor). Now that workers usually do less-physical work indoors and find little time for exercise, being tanned and thin is often a status symbol in modern cultures.

[[Dieting]] to reduce excess body fat is widely practiced in Western society, while some traditional societies still value [[obesity]] as a sign of prosperity.  Development of [[muscle]]s through [[exercise]], previously disdained as a stigma of doing heavy [[manual labor]], is now valued as a sign of personal achievement.  Some groups, such as extreme [[bodybuilder]]s and [[sumo wrestler]]s use special exercise and diet to "bulk up" into an impressive appearance.

Status symbols are also used by persons of much more modest means. In the [[Soviet Union]] before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], possession of American-style [[jeans|blue jeans]] or [[rock music]] recordings (even pirated or bootlegged copies) was an important status symbol among rebellious [[teenagers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10489">'''Strategic sustainable investing''' ('''SSI''') is an [[investment strategy]] that recognizes and rewards leading companies that are moving society towards [[sustainability]]. SSI relies on a consensus-based scientific definition of [[sustainability]], and the assumption that ‘''[[Backcasting]] from Principles of Sustainability''’,&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J and Robèrt, K-H “Backcasting from non-overlapping sustainability principles – a framework for strategic planning”, International .Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 7:1–18. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a vision of a sustainable future is set as the reference point for developing strategic actions, is the preferred approach to strategically move a company towards sustainability. It was developed by researchers at the [[Blekinge Institute of Technology]] in Sweden.

==The strategic sustainable investment system==
SSI outlines that the financial investment will offer a competitive risk-adjusted return, while providing investment capital to companies that are actively attempting to become more sustainable. It implies lower exposure to sustainability-related risks and it considers financial metrics together with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, as well as strategy analyses to educate investment decision-making.&lt;ref name="SSI"&gt;[http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/535439ccd73cc824c1256608004f0529/a6dcb300241ca812c125746000500631!OpenDocument Blandford, Nick, Timothy Nash and André Winter “Strategic Sustainable Investing: Recognizing Value in Transitional Leadership.” Master's thesis, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of SSI:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Lower sustainability risk exposure &lt;br /&gt;
•	A definition of sustainability based on scientific consensus&lt;ref name= "tools and concepts"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFX-44KVV9J-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=214b19c668891d8b85307af38cb9017c Robèrt, K.-H. “Tools and concepts for sustainable development, how do they relate to a framework for sustainable development, and to each other?” Journal of Cleaner Production 8: 243–254. 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
•	Primarily driven by movement towards sustainability&lt;br /&gt;
•	Considers financial, ESG, and strategy analysis

SSI operates by prioritizing investment capital allocation to companies that are taking the lead in shifting away from unsustainable behaviour towards new ways of doing business. This capital allocation will provide an incentive for companies to move forward in a sustainable direction. This movement is reported in [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and other extra-financial reports, but is also recorded in traditional areas of a firm’s financial [[balance sheets]].

By incorporating sustainability investment and returns into traditional financial reporting, a clearer picture of the bottom-line impact of a company’s actions towards sustainability is made available. In this positive reinforcing loop, greater investor returns and [http://plilend.com/ increased movement towards sustainability] are generated with every cycle.

[[Image:Economic analysis chart of movement towards sustainability.jpg|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''[[Causal loop diagram]] illustrating the strategic sustainable investment''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

[[Institutional investor]]s, such as mutual and pension funds, take a longer-term position on investments and are thus ideally suited to incorporate SSI strategies.

==Theory background==
The theoretical foundation of SSI is strongly linked to ''strategic sustainable development'', made popular by [[The Natural Step]] and its founder Dr. [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]].

This strategy resembles [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI), a growing practice amongst ethical investors. Nevertheless, SSI recognizes the gaps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.responsibleinvesting.org/database/dokuman/SRI%20Report%2010-04_word.pdf Hawken, P. “How the SRI industry has failed to respond to people who want to invest with conscience and what can be done to change it.” Natural Capital Institute. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; of SRI pointed by several academics and practitioners and presents some alternatives.

==SSI analysis tool==
In order to evolve current SRI and traditional investment practices into Strategic Sustainable Investment, two gaps must be considered:

a.	The recognition of companies with true leading strategies for a sustainable future&lt;br /&gt;
b.	A robust and well defined link must be made between movement towards sustainability and higher investment returns

The SSI analysis tool addresses the first gap by measuring a company’s strategy for addressing sustainability. It allows investors to recognize which companies are leading the transition in a new direction, and which are most likely to be strong performers in tomorrow’s market.

This tool is divided in two main parts: the emerging sustainability issue (esi) chart and the strategy analysis component:

===ESI chart===
[[Image:ESI Chart.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ESI Chart Sample&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]
The Sectoral Emerging Sustainability Issue (ESI) chart is used to identify which aspects of a determined market sector will become a socio-environmental problem. In the common sense, an issue is called ‘emergent’ when it gets media exposure. Instead, the Tool relies on scientific [[The_Natural_Step#System_conditions_of_sustainability|Principles of sustainability]]&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., and K.-H. Robèrt “The Rationale behind the System Conditions”. Department of Physical Resource Theory, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, J., K-H. Robèrt, and K-E. Eriksson “Socio-ecological principles for sustainability”. Getting down to earth — Practical applications of ecological economics. Washington, DC: Island Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to identify what is emergent.

It exposes which Sustainability Issues present high risks for companies within that sector in the short-term; as well as which Issues will be emerging in the medium and long-terms. Due to differences within a sector, the Sectoral ESI Chart should be made as specific as needed, being flexible to account for various geographical locations and sub-sector subtleties.

The process of composing an ESI chart follows:

Once a sector is selected for an ESI analysis, a list of relevant sustainability issues is assembled. This baseline analysis will result in a list of issues outlining the subject sector’s strengths and concerns that impact society and the environment. Next, prioritization colours are assigned to each sustainability issue: red for very high priority; orange for high priority; yellow for medium priority, and green for low priority according to its assessment in each of three categories: urgency, severity, and systematic contribution.

''Urgency'' assesses the time frame pressing each Issue. The ''severity'' assesses the seriousness of the Issue, in terms of its potential consequences for the environment, society, and companies within that sector. The ''systematic contribution'' is used to gauge the sector’s contribution to the overall Issue.

[[Image:ESI WF.jpg|none|350px]]&lt;br /&gt;''To fill out the Chart, Researchers follow this process flow.''&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

===Strategy analysis component===
====Strategic plan====
The Strategic Plan element assesses the subject company’s planned goals in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI). The qualitative description includes, but is not limited to, information regarding:  public commitments planned operational and business initiatives, political action/ lobbying, and third party partnerships (with NGOs, consultative firms etc.). There is also a comment on the subject company’s core business in relation to the ESI; as this will assist in determining the subject company’s exposure to the emerging risk.

====Strategic actions====
The strategic actions element looks at assessing the subject company’s recent actions taken in relation to the emerging sustainability issue (ESI), thus determining whether the subject company is ‘walking the talk’ in comparison to the vision and goals outlined.
The subject company’s actions are seen through the lens of [[strategic sustainable development]], and thus three questions are emphasized as a mental guideline:

a.	Does this action provide a competitive return on investment (ROI)?&lt;br /&gt;
b.	Is this action taking the subject company in the right direction?&lt;br /&gt;
c.	Is this action a versatile platform?

====Strategy analysis graph====
The strategy analysis graph shows the subject company’s planned path for dealing with the ESI, tangible progress made, and if existent, government regulations. The trajectory of the subject company’s planned path reveals the extent of their future risk exposure. This graph is placed in the center of the strategy analysis page.

[[Image:Strategy Analysis Graph.jpg|none|thumb|300px|Sample of strategy analysis graph&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;]]

====Assurance assessment====
The assurance assessment provides an overall impression of the validity of the information gathered. This assessment may be applied if the data is verified by an external third party, or if discrepancy is evident between different sources of information used on the report.

In [[espionage]] and [[counterintelligence]], '''surveillance''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|.|ə|n|s}} or {{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|l|ə|n|s}})&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt; is the monitoring of [[behavior]], activities, or other changing information for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting people.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, David. 2007. Surveillance Studies: An Overview. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) cameras)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/surveillance-cameras-and-crime |title=The effect of CCTV on public safety: Research roundup |authors=Leighton Walter Kille and Martin Maximino |date=11 February 2014 |work=Journalists Resource |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center and the Carnegie-Knight Initiative |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as [[Internet traffic]] or phone calls). It can also include simple no- or relatively low-technology methods such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence agent]] and [[postal interception]]. The word ''[[Wikt:surveillance|surveillance]]'' comes from a [[French language|French]] phrase for "watching over" (''sur'' means "from above" and ''veiller'' means "to watch") and is in contrast to more recent developments such as [[sousveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eyetap.org/papers/docs/IEEE_ISTAS13_Sensularity_Minsky_etal.pdf Minsky M, Kurzweil R, Mann S (2013).

Surveillance is used by governments for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. It is also used by criminal organisations to plan and commit crimes, such as robbery and kidnapping, by businesses to gather intelligence, and by [[private investigator]]s.

Surveillance can be viewed as a violation of [[privacy]], and as such is often opposed by various [[civil liberties]] groups and activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/oppose-video-surveillance-our-nations-capital |title=Oppose video surveillance in our nation's capital |publisher=ACLU. org |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rally.stopwatching.us/ |title=Stop watching us – A rally against mass surveillance |publisher=stopwatching.us |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal democracy|Liberal democracies]] have laws which restrict domestic government and private use of surveillance, usually limiting it to circumstances where public safety is at risk. [[Authoritarian]] government seldom have any domestic restrictions, and international [[espionage]] is common among all types of countries.

The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="sciam-internet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|author2=Susan Landau |date=August 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="eff-calea-archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive – Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503035053/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|archivedate=May 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is far too much data on the Internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it. Therefore, automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic to identify and report to human investigators the traffic that is considered interesting or suspicious. This process is regulated by targeting certain "trigger" words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or online chat with suspicious individuals or groups.&lt;ref name="usatoday-chatroom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies, such as the [[NSA]], the [[FBI]] and the now-defunct [[Information Awareness Office]], to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], [[Narus (company)|NarusInsight]], and [[ECHELON]] to intercept and analyze all of this data to only extract the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059 |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers can be a surveillance target because of the personal data stored on them. If someone is able to install software, such as the FBI's [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]] and [[CIPAV]], on a computer system, they can easily gain unauthorized access to this data. Such software could be installed physically or remotely.&lt;ref name="teen-busted-in-wired"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/07/fbi_spyware |title = FBI's Secret Spyware Tracks Down Teen Who Made Bomb Threats |date = July 18, 2007 |publisher = Wired Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of computer surveillance, known as [[van Eck phreaking]], involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters.&lt;ref name="emr"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Eck, Wim | title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk? | journal=Computers &amp; Security | volume=4 | year=1985 | pages=269–286 | url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf | doi=10.1016/0167-4048(85)90046-X | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhn2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | year = 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA runs a database known as "[[Pinwale]]", which stores and indexes large numbers of emails of both American citizens and foreigners.&lt;ref name="nytimes-email-surveillance"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/us/17nsa.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;hp|title=E-Mail Surveillance Renews Concerns in Congress |date=June 16, 2009 |work=New York Times|pages=A1|accessdate=June 30, 2009 | first1=James | last1=Risen | first2=Eric | last2=Lichtblau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic-pinwale"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/06/pinwale-and-the-new-nsa-revelations/19532/ |title=Pinwale And The New NSA Revelations|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|date=June 16, 2009|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the NSA runs a program known as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], which is a data mining system that gives the United States government direct access to information from technology companies. Through accessing this information, the government is able to obtain search history, emails, stored information, live chats, file transfers, and more. This program generated huge controversies in regards to surveillance and privacy, especially from U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/articles/2013-06-06-NSA-Prism-program-taps-in-to-user-data-of-Apple-Google-and-others-The-Guardian-Jun-06-2013.pdf|title=NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others|last=Greenwald; Ewen|first=Glen; MacAskill|date=June 6, 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet|title=Everything you need to know about PRISM|last1=Sottek|first1=T.C.|last2=Kopfstein|first2=Janus|date=July 17, 2013|work=The Verge|access-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephones===
{{Main|Phone surveillance|Lawful interception}}
The official and unofficial tapping of telephone lines is widespread. In the [[United States]] for instance, the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)]] requires that all telephone and VoIP communications be available for real-time wiretapping by Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="eff-calea-archive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-summary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-faq"/&gt; Two major telecommunications companies in the U.S.—[[AT&amp;T Inc.]] and [[Verizon]]—have contracts with the FBI, requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for Federal agencies, in return for $1.8 million per year.&lt;ref name="threatlevel-exigent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/09/rogue-fbi-lette.html#previouspost|title=Rogue FBI Letters Hint at Phone Companies' Own Data Mining Programs – Updated|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=September 10, 2007|work=Threat Level|publisher=Wired|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2005, the FBI sent out more than 140,000 "[[National Security Letter]]s" ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers' calling and Internet histories. About half of these letters requested information on U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="fbi-national-letters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aBd9Zzld22w0&amp;refer=home|title=Mueller Orders Audit of 56 FBI Offices for Secret Subpoenas |last=Roland|first=Neil|date=March 20, 2007|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human agents are not required to monitor most calls. [[Speech-to-text]] software creates machine-readable text from intercepted audio, which is then processed by automated call-analysis programs, such as those developed by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], or companies such as [[Verint]], and [[Narus (company)|Narus]], which search for certain words or phrases, to decide whether to dedicate a human agent to the call.&lt;ref name="latimes-fbi-intel-analysis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/29/nation/na-technology29|title=FBI Plans to Fight Terror With High-Tech Arsenal|last=Piller|first=Charles|author2=Eric Lichtblau |date=July 29, 2002|work=LA Times|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement and intelligence services in the United Kingdom and the United States possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely, by accessing phones' diagnostic or maintenance features in order to listen to conversations that take place near the person who holds the phone.&lt;ref name="schneier-roving-bugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/remotely_eavesd_1.html|title=Remotely Eavesdropping on Cell Phone Microphones|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|date=December 5, 2006|work=Schneier On Security|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roving-bugs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/FBI-taps-cell-phone-mic-as-eavesdropping-tool/2100-1029_3-6140191.html |title=FBI taps cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |author2=Anne Broache |date=December 1, 2006 |work=CNet News |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110182623/http://news.cnet.com/FBI-taps-cell-phone-mic-as-eavesdropping-tool/2100-1029_3-6140191.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk-mobile-bug"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7166b8a2-02cb-11da-84e5-00000e2511c8.html|title=Use of mobile helped police keep tabs on suspect |last=Odell|first=Mark|date=August 1, 2005|work=Financial Times|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa-phone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrc.noaa.gov/wrso/security_guide/telephon.htm|title=Telephones|year=2001|work=Western Regional Security Office (NOAA official site)|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="can-you-hear-me"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/12/can_you_hear_me.html |title=Can You Hear Me Now? |work=ABC News: The Blotter |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825102123/http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/12/can_you_hear_me.html |archivedate=August 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seattle-times-roving"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003474824_bugs130.html|title=Even if they're off, cellphones allow FBI to listen in|last=Coughlin|first=Kevin|date=December 13, 2006|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stingray phone tracker|StingRay]] tracker is an example of one of these tools used to monitor cell phone usage in the United States and the United Kingdom. Originally developed for counterterrorism purposes by the military, they work by broadcasting powerful signals that cause nearby cell phones to transmit their [[Mobile identification number|IMSI number]], just as they would to normal cell phone towers. Once the phone is connected to the device, there is no way for the user to know that they are being tracked. The operator of the stingray is able to extract information such as location, phone calls, and text messages, but it is widely believed that the capabilities of the StingRay extend much further. A lot of controversy surrounds the StingRay because of its powerful capabilities and the secrecy that surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hampton|first=Brittany|year=2012|title=From Smartphones to Stingrays: Can the Fourth Amendment Keep up with the Twenty-First Century Note|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/branlaj51&amp;amp;div=8&amp;amp;g_sent=1&amp;amp;collection=journals|journal=University of Louisville Law Review|volume=Fifty One|pages=159–176|via=Law Journal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily even when the phone is not being used, using a technique known as [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by mobile phone|date=August 3, 2005|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509211,00.html|title=Cell Phone Tracking Can Locate Terrorists – But Only Where It's Legal|last=Miller|first=Joshua|date=March 14, 2009|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of such techniques has been questioned in the United States, in particular whether a court warrant is required.&lt;ref name="nyu-lawrev"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1092293|title=Warrantless Location Tracking|year=2008|work=N.Y.U.

In response to customers' privacy concerns in the post [[Edward Snowden]] era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://snowdenarchive.cjfe.org/greenstone/cgi-bin/library.cgi/|title=Greenstone Digital Library Software|website=snowdenarchive.cjfe.org|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's iPhone 6 has been designed to disrupt investigative [[wiretapping]] efforts. The phone encrypts e-mails, contacts, and photos with a code generated by a complex mathematical algorithm that is unique to an individual phone, and is inaccessible to Apple.&lt;ref name="new-iphone-locks-out-nsa"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html?r=0=home|title=Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A|last=Sanger|first=David|date=Sep 26, 2014|work=New York Times|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[encryption]] feature on the iPhone 6 has drawn criticism from FBI director James B. Comey and other law enforcement officials since even lawful requests to access user content on the iPhone 6 will result in Apple supplying "gibberish" data that requires law enforcement personnel to either break the code themselves or to get the code from the phone's owner.&lt;ref name="new-iphone-locks-out-nsa" /&gt; Because the Snowden leaks demonstrated that American agencies can access phones anywhere in the world, privacy concerns in countries with growing markets for smart phones have intensified, providing a strong incentive for companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to address those concerns in order to secure their position in the global market.&lt;ref name="new-iphone-locks-out-nsa" /&gt;

Although the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]] requires [[telecommunication]] companies to build into their systems the ability to carry out a lawful wiretap, the law has not been updated to address the issue of smart phones and requests for access to [[e-mails]] and [[metadata]].&lt;ref name="nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html?r=0=home|title=NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show|last=Gellman|first=Barton|date=Dec 4, 2013|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Snowden leaks show that the [[NSA]] has been taking advantage of this ambiguity in the law by collecting metadata on "at least hundreds of millions" of "incidental" targets from around the world.&lt;ref name="nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations"/&gt; The NSA uses an analytic tool known as CO-TRAVELER in order to track people whose movements intersect and to find any hidden connections with persons of interest.&lt;ref name="nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations"/&gt;

The Snowden leaks have also revealed that the British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) can access information collected by the NSA on American citizens. Once the data has been collected, the GCHQ can hold on to it for up to two years. The deadline can be extended with the permission of a "senior UK official".&lt;ref name="british-spies-can-go-through-americans-calls"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2812728/British-spies-American-s-telephone-calls-emails-without-warrant-reveals-legal-challenge-UK.html?r=0=home|title=British spies can go through Americans' telephone calls and emails without warrant revelas legal challenge in the UK |last=Nye|first=James|date=Oct 26, 2014|work=Mail Online|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cameras===
{{Main|Closed-circuit television}}
[[File:Cairns-Lagoon.JPG|thumb|right|A surveillance camera in [[Cairns, Queensland]]]]
[[File:Three Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Surveillance cameras such as these are installed by the millions in many countries, and are nowadays monitored by automated computer programs instead of humans.]]
Surveillance cameras are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area. They are often connected to a recording device or [[IP network]], and may be watched by a [[security guard]] or [[law enforcement officer]]. Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable [[database]], and by video analysis software (such as [[VIRAT]] and [[Human Identification at a Distance|HumanID]]). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected. With cheaper production techniques, surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems, and for everyday surveillance.

There are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.&lt;ref name="SDM2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmmag.com/articles/92407-rise-of-surveillance-camera-installed-base-slows|title=Rise of Surveillance Camera Installed Base Slows|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017|publishersdm magazine=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, China was reported to have a huge surveillance network of over 170 million CCTV cameras with 400 million new cameras expected to be installed in the next three years, many of which use [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43751276|title=Smart cameras catch man in 60,000 crowd|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Department of Homeland Security]] awards billions of dollars per year in [[Homeland Security grants]] for local, state, and federal agencies to install modern video surveillance equipment. For example, the city of [[Chicago]], Illinois, recently used a $5.1 million Homeland Security grant to install an additional 250 surveillance cameras, and connect them to a centralized monitoring center, along with its preexisting network of over 2000 cameras, in a program known as [[Operation Virtual Shield]]. Speaking in 2009, Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley|Richard Daley]] announced that Chicago would have a surveillance camera on every street corner by the year 2016.&lt;ref name="sun-times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/1440402,|title=Surveillance cams help fight crime, city says|last=Spielman|first=Fran|date=February 19, 2009|work=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="were-watching"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/05/five_years/main1968121.shtml|title=We're Watching: How Chicago Authorities Keep An Eye On The City|last=Schorn|first=Daniel|date=September 6, 2006|work=CBS News|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of video surveillance cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.&lt;ref name=BBW2012&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Privacy: How local authorities spent £515m on CCTV in four years|url=http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/files/priceofprivacy/Price_of_privacy_2012.pdf|publisher=Big Brother Watch|accessdate=4 February 2015|date=February 2012|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of video surveillance in the UK is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/factcheck+how+many+cctv+cameras/2291167|title=FactCheck: how many CCTV cameras?|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian2011&gt;{{cite news|title=You're being watched: there's one CCTV camera for every 32 people in UK – Research shows 1.85m machines across Britain, most of them indoors and privately operated|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/02/cctv-cameras-watching-surveillance|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2011|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=In the press: How the media is reporting the 1.85 million cameras story|url=http://www.securitynewsdesk.com/in-the-press-how-the-media-is-reporting-the-1-85-million-cameras-story/|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Security News Desk|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example one report in 2002 extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the UK at 4.2 million (of which 500,000 in [[London|Greater London]]{{refn|group=Note|Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the local government and police operated cameras in the [[City of London]], which was about 650 in 2011.&lt;ref name=BBW2012 /&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbaneye.net/results/ue_wp6.pdf|title=CCTV in London|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom at around 1.85 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|title=How many cameras are there?|publisher=CCTV User Group|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023191646/http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|archive-date=October 23, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, one example city where there are cameras is The Hague. There, cameras are placed in city districts in which the most illegal activity is concentrated. Examples are the [[red-light district]]s and the train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/relocation-and-settling/to/Camera-surveillance.htm|title=Camera surveillance|first=Den|last=Haag|date=|publisher=|accessdate=December 2, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008030841/http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/relocation-and-settling/to/Camera-surveillance.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of China's [[Golden Shield Project]], several U.S. corporations, including [[IBM]], [[General Electric]], and [[Honeywell]], have been working closely with the [[Politics of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] to install millions of surveillance cameras throughout [[People's Republic of China|China]], along with advanced [[video analytics]] and facial recognition software, which will identify and track individuals everywhere they go.

===Social network analysis===
[[File:Kencf0618FacebookNetwork.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the relationships between users on the [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]]. [[Social network analysis]] enables governments to gather detailed information about peoples' friends, family, and other contacts. Since much of this information is voluntarily made public by the users themselves, it is often consider to be a form of [[open-source intelligence]]]]
One common form of surveillance is to create maps of [[Social network analysis|social networks]] based on data from [[social networking sites]] such as [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Twitter]] as well as from [[traffic analysis]] information from phone call records such as those in the [[NSA call database]],&lt;ref name="keefe"&gt;{{cite news|title= Can Network Theory Thwart Terrorists?|last=Keefe|first=Patrick |date=March 12, 2006|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

Jason Ethier of Northeastern University, in his study of modern social network analysis, said the following of the Scalable Social Network Analysis Program developed by the [[Information Awareness Office]]:

{{quote|The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people....

AT&amp;T developed a programming language called "Hancock", which is able to sift through enormous databases of phone call and Internet traffic records, such as the [[NSA call database]], and extract "communities of interest"—groups of people who call each other regularly, or groups that regularly visit certain sites on the Internet.

Some people believe that the use of social networking sites is a form of "participatory surveillance", where users of these sites are essentially performing surveillance on themselves, putting detailed personal information on public websites where it can be viewed by corporations and governments.&lt;ref name="part-surv"/&gt; In 2008, about 20% of employers reported using social networking sites to collect personal data on prospective or current employees.&lt;ref name="havenstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9114560|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923065244/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9114560|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 23, 2008|title=One in five employers uses social networks in hiring process|last=Havenstein|first=Heather|date=September 12, 2008|work=Computer World|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biometric===
[[File:US-VISIT (CBP).jpg|thumb|right|Fingerprints being scanned as part of the [[US-VISIT]] program]]
{{Main|Biometrics}}

Biometric surveillance is a technology that measures and analyzes human physical and/or behavioral characteristics for authentication, identification, or screening purposes.&lt;ref name="rand-facial"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=John|author2=Christopher Horn |author3=Julius Gatune |author4=Aryn Thomas |title=Biometrics: A Look at Facial Recognition |publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2003|isbn=0-8330-3302-6|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA414520 |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of physical characteristics include fingerprints, DNA, and facial patterns. Examples of mostly behavioral characteristics include gait (a person's manner of walking) or voice.

[[Facial recognition system|Facial recognition]] is the use of the unique configuration of a person's facial features to accurately identify them, usually from surveillance video. Both the Department of Homeland Security and [[DARPA]] are heavily funding research into facial recognition systems.&lt;ref name="usatoday-facial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-05-10-facial-recognition-terrorism_N.htm|title=Face recognition next in terror fight|last=Frank|first=Thomas|date=May 10, 2007|work=USA Today|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Information Processing Technology Office]] ran a program known as [[Human Identification at a Distance]] which developed technologies that are capable of identifying a person at up to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} by their facial features.

Another form of behavioral biometrics, based on [[affective computing]], involves computers recognizing a person's emotional state based on an analysis of their facial expressions, how fast they are talking, the tone and pitch of their voice, their posture, and other behavioral traits. This might be used for instance to see if a person's behavior is suspect (looking around furtively, "tense" or "angry" facial expressions, waving arms, etc.).&lt;ref name="pop-mech-cameras"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4236865.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219164859/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4236865.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-12-19|title=Surveillance Society: New High-Tech Cameras Are Watching You|last=Vlahos|first=James|date=January 2008|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent development is [[DNA profiling]], which looks at some of the major markers in the body's DNA to produce a match.

{{Further|Surveillance aircraft}}
[[File:MicroAirVehicle.jpg|thumb|right|Micro Air Vehicle with attached surveillance camera]]

Aerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance, usually visual imagery or video, from an airborne vehicle—such as an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], [[helicopter]], or [[surveillance aircraft|spy plane]]. Military [[surveillance aircraft]] use a range of sensors (e.g. radar) to monitor the battlefield.

Digital imaging technology, miniaturized computers, and numerous other technological advances over the past decade have contributed to rapid advances in aerial surveillance hardware such as [[micro-aerial vehicles]], [[forward-looking infrared]], and high-resolution imagery capable of identifying objects at extremely long distances. For instance, the [[MQ-9 Reaper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.military.com/equipment/mq-9-reaper|title=MQ-9 Reaper|last=Boyd|first=Ryan|language=en|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a U.S. drone plane used for domestic operations by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], carries cameras that are capable of identifying an object the size of a milk carton from altitudes of 60,000 feet, and has [[forward-looking infrared]] devices that can detect the heat from a human body at distances of up to 60 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-rapid-rise-of-federal-surveillance-drones-over-america/473136/|title=The Rapid Rise of Federal Surveillance Drones Over America|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier instance of commercial aerial surveillance, the [[Killington Mountain]] ski resort hired 'eye in the sky' aerial photography of its competitors' parking lots to judge the success of its marketing initiatives as it developed starting in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Bruce, [http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/RH/20121109/BUSINESS03/711099916 "Killington co-founder Sargent dead at 83"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904091030/http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2FRH%2F20121109%2FBUSINESS03%2F711099916 |date=September 4, 2015 }}, Rutland ''Herald'', November 9, 2012.

Programs such as the [[Heterogeneous Aerial Reconnaissance Team]] program developed by [[DARPA]] have automated much of the aerial surveillance process. They have developed systems consisting of large teams drone planes that pilot themselves, automatically decide who is "suspicious" and how to go about monitoring them, coordinate their activities with other drones nearby, and notify human operators if something suspicious is occurring. This greatly increases the amount of area that can be continuously monitored, while reducing the number of human operators required. Thus a swarm of automated, self-directing drones can automatically patrol a city and track suspicious individuals, reporting their activities back to a centralized monitoring station.&lt;ref name="hart-overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|title=HART Overview|date=August 2008|work=IPTO (DARPA) – Official website|accessdate=March 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205233843/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hart-proposal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |title=BAA 04-05-PIP: Heterogeneous Airborne Reconnaissance Team (HART) |date=December 5, 2003 |work=Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA) – Official Website |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127074930/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defense-daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227 |title=DARPA, Northrop Grumman Move Into Next Phase of UAV Control Architecture |last=Sirak |first=Michael |date=Nov 29, 2007 |work=Defense Daily |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309060941/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227/ |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data mining and profiling===
[[Data mining]] is the application of statistical techniques and programmatic algorithms to discover previously unnoticed relationships within the data. [[Data profiling]] in this context is the process of assembling information about a particular individual or group in order to generate a profile&amp;nbsp;— that is, a picture of their patterns and behavior. Data profiling can be an extremely powerful tool for psychological and [[social network analysis]]. A skilled analyst can discover facts about a person that they might not even be consciously aware of themselves.&lt;ref name="profiling-euro"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Mireille Hildebrandt|last=Hildebrandt|first=Mireille|author2=Serge Gutwirth |title=Profiling the European Citizen: Cross Disciplinary Perspectives|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4020-6913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic (such as credit card purchases) and social (such as telephone calls and emails) transactions in modern society create large amounts of stored [[data]] and records. In the past, this data was documented in paper records, leaving a "[[paper trail]]", or was simply not documented at all. Correlation of paper-based records was a laborious process—it required human intelligence operators to manually dig through documents, which was time-consuming and incomplete, at best.

But today many of these records are electronic, resulting in an "[[Digital footprint|electronic trail]]". Every use of a bank machine, payment by credit card, use of a phone card, call from home, checked out library book, rented video, or otherwise complete recorded transaction generates an electronic record. Public records—such as birth, court, tax and other records—are increasily being digitized and made available online. In addition, due to laws like [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]], web traffic and online purchases are also available for profiling. Electronic record-keeping makes data easily collectable, storable, and accessible—so that high-volume, efficient aggregation and analysis is possible at significantly lower costs.

Information relating to many of these individual transactions is often easily available because it is generally not guarded in isolation, since the information, such as the title of a movie a person has rented, might not seem sensitive. However, when many such transactions are [[government databases|aggregated]] they can be used to assemble a detailed profile revealing the actions, habits, beliefs, locations frequented, [[social network analysis|social connections]], and preferences of the individual. This profile is then used, by programs such as [[ADVISE]]&lt;ref name="data-sweep"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0209/p01s02-uspo.html|title=US Plans Massive Data Sweep|last=Clayton|first=Mark|date=February 9, 2006|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TALON (database)|TALON]], to determine whether the person is a military, criminal, or political threat.

In addition to its own aggregation and profiling tools, the government is able to access information from third parties&amp;nbsp;— for example, banks, credit companies or employers, etc.&amp;nbsp;— by requesting access informally, by compelling access through the use of subpoenas or other procedures,&lt;ref name="cdt-fbi-subpoenas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |title=Administrative Subpoenas for the FBI: A Grab for Unchecked Executive Power |last=Flint |first=Lara |date=September 24, 2003 |work=The Center For Democracy &amp; Technology (official site) |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308183232/http://cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers. The United States has spent $370 million on its 43 planned [[fusion centers]], which are national network of surveillance centers that are located in over 30 states. The centers will collect and analyze vast amounts of data on U.S. citizens. It will get this data by consolidating personal information from sources such as state driver's licensing agencies, hospital records, criminal records, school records, credit bureaus, banks, etc. – and placing this information in a centralized database that can be accessed from all of the centers, as well as other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="epic-fusion-centers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/surveillance/spotlight/0607/default.html|title="National Network" of Fusion Centers Raises Specter of COINTELPRO|date=June 2007|work= EPIC Spotlight on Surveillance|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=425&amp;invol=435 United States v. Miller]'' (1976), data held by third parties is generally not subject to [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] warrant requirements.

===Corporate===
Corporate surveillance is the monitoring of a person or group's behavior by a corporation. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Although there is a common belief that monitoring can increase productivity, it can also create consequences such as increasing chances of deviant behavior and creating punishments that are not equitable to their actions. Additionally, monitoring can cause resistance and backlash because it insinuates an employer’s suspicion and lack of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Denise|date=2017|title="Toward a Sociology of Privacy"|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43(1)|pages=249-269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Business Intelligence====
Data collected on individuals and groups can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. It can be used for [[direct marketing]] purposes, such as targeted advertisements on Google and Yahoo. These ads are tailored to the individual user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails&lt;ref name="nytimes-onlineads"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (if they use free webmail services), which is kept in a database.&lt;ref name="surv-in-society"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/Technology/Surveillance+society/1322333/story.html|title=Surveillance in society|last=Butler|first=Don|date=February 24, 2009|work=The Star Phoenix|publisher=CanWest|accessdate=March 17, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[Google]], the world's most popular search engine, stores identifying information for each web search. An [[IP address]] and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.&lt;ref name="cnet-googlelogs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10038963-46.html|title=Debunking Google's log anonymization propaganda|last=Soghoian|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service, in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.&lt;ref name="joshi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/every-move-you-make-google-will-be-watching-you/57071/on|title= Every move you make, Google will be watching you|last=Joshi|first=Priyanki|date=March 21, 2009|work=Business Standard|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google is, by far, the largest Internet advertising agency. Their revenue model is based on receiving payments from advertisers for each page-visit resulting from a visitor clicking on a Google [[AdWords]] ad, hosted either on a Google service or a third-party website. Millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites, in order to share this profit from visitors who click on the ads. Each page containing Google advertisements adds, reads, and modifies [[HTTP cookie|"cookies"]] on each visitor's computer.&lt;ref name="google-adprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html|title=Advertising and Privacy|year=2009|work=Google (company page)|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cookies track the user across all of these sites, and gather information about their web surfing habits, keeping track of which sites they visit, and what they do when they are on these sites. This information, along with the information from their email accounts, and search engine histories, is stored by Google to use for building a profile of the user to deliver better-targeted advertising.&lt;ref name="joshi"/&gt;

====Intra-Corporate Surveillance====
According to the [[American Management Association]] and the ePolicy Institute that undertake an annual quantitative survey about electronic monitoring and surveillance with approximately 300 U.S. companies, "more than one fourth of employers have fired workers for misusing e-mail and nearly one third have fired employees for misusing the Internet".&lt;ref name="stacy"&gt;American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute (2008). [http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance 2007 Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801095437/http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey/ |date=August 1, 2012 }}. Retrieved July 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40% of the companies monitor e-mail traffic of their workers, and 66% of corporations monitor Internet connections. In addition, most companies use software to block non-work related websites such as sexual or pornographic sites, game sites, social networking sites, entertainment sites, shopping sites, and sport sites. The American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute also stress that companies "tracking content, keystrokes, and time spent at the keyboard ... store and review computer files ... monitor the blogosphere to see what is being written about the company, and ... monitor social networking sites".&lt;ref name="stacy"/&gt; Furthermore, about 30% of the companies had also fired employees for non-work related email and Internet usage such as "inappropriate or offensive language" and "viewing, downloading, or uploading inappropriate/offensive content".&lt;ref name="stacy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allmer, Thomas (2012). Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government Use of Corporate Surveillance Data====
The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies—such as Google—for augmenting the profiles of individuals whom it is monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/08/01/the-surveillance-society/|title=The Surveillance Society|last=Drehle|first=David Von|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and other intelligence agencies have formed an "information-sharing" partnership with over 34,000 corporations as part of their [[Infragard]] program.

The U.S. Federal government has gathered information from grocery store "discount card" programs, which track customers' shopping patterns and store them in databases, in order to look for "terrorists" by analyzing shoppers' buying patterns.&lt;ref name="fox-store-cards"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,59262,00.html|title=Store Customer Cards a Source for FBI?|last=Vlahos|first=Kelley|date=August 1, 2002|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human operatives===
Organizations that have enemies who wish to gather information about the groups' members or activities face the issue of infiltration.&lt;ref name="fbi-anna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2006/01/332735.shtml|title=Information on the Confidential Source in the Auburn Arrests|last=anonymous|date=Jan 26, 2006|work=Portland Indymedia|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pentagon-infiltration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10454316|title=Is the Pentagon spying on Americans?|last=Myers|first=Lisa|date=December 14, 2005|work=NBC Nightly News|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to operatives' infiltrating an organization, the surveilling party may exert pressure on certain members of the target organization to act as [[informants]] (i.e., to disclose the information they hold on the organization and its members).&lt;ref name="senate-hearing-informants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIId.htm|title=The Use of Informants in FBI Domestic Intelligence Investigations |work=Final Report: Book III, Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans |pages=225–270 |date=April 23, 1976 |publisher=U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2010/jun/15/secret-justice-criminal-informants-and-americas-underground-legal-system/ |title= Secret Justice: Criminal Informants and America's Underground Legal System {{!}} Prison Legal News |website= www.prisonlegalnews.org |access-date= 2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding operatives is very expensive, and for governments with wide-reaching electronic surveillance tools at their disposal the information recovered from operatives can often be obtained from less problematic forms of surveillance such as those mentioned above. Nevertheless, human infiltrators are still common today. For instance, in 2007 documents surfaced showing that the [[FBI]] was planning to field a total of 15,000 undercover agents and informants in response to an anti-terrorism directive sent out by George W. Bush in 2004 that ordered intelligence and law enforcement agencies to increase their [[HUMINT]] capabilities.&lt;ref name="fbi-informant-network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/07/fbi-proposes-bu.html|title=FBI Proposes Building Network of U.S. Informants|last=Ross|first=Brian|date=July 25, 2007|work=Blotter|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite imagery===
{{Main|Reconnaissance satellite}}
On May 25, 2007 the U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Michael McConnell|Michael McConnell]] authorized the [[National Applications Office|National Applications Office (NAO)]] of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] to allow local, state, and domestic Federal agencies to access imagery from [[military intelligence]] [[Reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[Reconnaissance aircraft]] sensors which can now be used to observe the activities of U.S. citizens. The satellites and aircraft sensors will be able to penetrate cloud cover, detect chemical traces, and identify objects in buildings and "underground bunkers", and will provide real-time video at much higher resolutions than the still-images produced by programs such as [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref name="ns-archive-domestic-sat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB229/index.htm|title=U.S. Reconnaissance Satellites: Domestic Targets|work=National Security Archive|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-domestic-sat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118714764716998275 |title=U.S. to Expand Domestic Use Of Spy Satellites|last=Block|first=Robert|date=August 15, 2007|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-sat-program-approved"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122282336428992785?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Satellite-Surveillance Program to Begin Despite Privacy Concerns |last=Gorman|first=Siobhan|date=October 1, 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dhs-nao-factsheet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |title=Fact Sheet: National Applications Office |date=August 15, 2007 |work=Department of Homeland Security (official website) |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311151910/http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |archivedate=March 11, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpost-sat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081502430_pf.html|title=Domestic Use of Spy Satellites To Widen|last=Warrick|first=Joby|date=August 16, 2007|work=Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-spysat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-09-26-civilian-spying_x.htm|title=Spy imagery agency watching inside U.S.|last=Shrader|first=Katherine|date=September 26, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification and credentials===
[[File:Social Security card.jpg|thumb|right|A card containing an identification number]]

One of the simplest forms of identification is the carrying of credentials. Some nations have an [[Identity document|identity card]] system to aid identification, whilst others are considering it but face public opposition. Other documents, such as [[passport]]s, driver's licenses, library cards, banking or credit cards are also used to verify identity.

If the form of the identity card is "machine-readable", usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number (such as a [[Social Security number]]), it corroborates the subject's identifying data. In this case it may create an electronic trail when it is checked and scanned, which can be used in profiling, as mentioned above.

===RFID and geolocation devices===
[[File:RFID hand 1.jpg|thumb|right|Hand with planned insertion point for Verichip device]]

====RFID tagging====
[[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) tagging is the use of very small electronic devices (called "RFID tags") which are applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. The tags can be read from several meters away. They are extremely inexpensive, costing a few cents per piece, so they can be inserted into many types of everyday products without significantly increasing the price, and can be used to track and identify these objects for a variety of purposes.

Some companies appear to be "tagging" their workers by incorporating RFID tags in employee ID badges. Workers in U.K. considered [[strike action]] in protest of having themselves tagged; they felt that it was [[dehumanisation|dehumanizing]] to have all of their movements tracked with RFID chips.&lt;ref name="rfid-strike-uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/print/6294|title=Two Stories Highlight the RFID Debate|date=July 19, 2005|work=RFID Journal|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=March 2012}} Some critics have expressed fears that people will soon be tracked and scanned everywhere they go.&lt;ref name="usatoday-verichip"/&gt;  On the other hand, RFID tags in newborn baby ID bracelets put on by hospitals have foiled kidnappings.&lt;ref name="rfid-strike-uk" /&gt;

[[File:Paypass chip front.png|thumb|upright|left|RFID chip pulled from new credit card]]
[[Verichip]] is an RFID device produced by a company called Applied Digital Solutions (ADS). Verichip is slightly larger than a grain of rice, and is injected under the skin. The injection reportedly feels similar to receiving a [[Injection (medicine)|shot]]. The chip is encased in glass, and stores a "VeriChip Subscriber Number" which the scanner uses to access their personal information, via the Internet, from Verichip Inc.'s database, the "Global VeriChip Subscriber Registry". Thousands of people have already had them inserted.&lt;ref name="usatoday-verichip"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2007-07-21-chips_N.htm|title=Microchips in humans spark privacy debate|last=Lewan|first=Todd|date=July 21, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, for example, 160 workers at the Attorney General's office were required to have the chip injected for identity verification and [[access control]] purposes.&lt;ref name="mex-pig-verichip"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=23901004|title= RFID Chips Implanted In Mexican Law-Enforcement Workers|last=Gardener|first=W.

In a 2003 editorial, CNET News.com's chief political correspondent, Declan McCullagh, speculated that, soon, every object that is purchased, and perhaps ID cards, will have RFID devices in them, which would respond with information about people as they walk past scanners (what type of phone they have, what type of shoes they have on, which books they are carrying, what credit cards or membership cards they have, etc.). This information could be used for identification, tracking, or [[targeted marketing]]. {{as of|2012}}, this has largely not come to pass.&lt;ref name="mccullagh-rfid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2010-1069-980325.html|title=RFID Tags: Big Brother in small packages|last=McCullagh |first=Declan|date=January 13, 2003|work=CNET News|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Positioning System====
[[File:ConstellationGPS.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of GPS satellites orbiting Earth]]

{{see also|GPS tracking}}

In the U.S., police have planted hidden [[Global positioning system|GPS]] tracking devices in people's vehicles to monitor their movements,&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, D., Micheal.

''Ethical Justice: Applied Issues for Criminal Justice Students and Professionals''. 1st ed.  Academic Press, 2013. p150.

Several cities are running pilot projects to require parolees to wear GPS devices to track their movements when they get out of prison.&lt;ref name="verichip-legal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/05/columns/fl.hilden.chip/index.html|title=What legal questions are the new chip implants for humans likely to raise?| last=Hilden| first=Julie| work=CNN.com (FindLaw)| accessdate=March 17, 2009| date=April 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mobile phones====
Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect geolocation data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"/&gt; Dr. Victor Kappeler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Forget the NSA: Police May be a Greater Threat to Privacy|url=http://www.plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/forget-nsa-police-may-be-greater-threat-privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of Eastern Kentucky University indicates that police surveillance is a strong concern, stating the following statistics from 2013:
{{quote|Of the 321,545 law enforcement requests made to Verizon, 54,200 of these requests were for "content" or "location" information—not just cell phone numbers or IP addresses. Content information included the actual text of messages, emails and the wiretapping of voice or messaging content in real-time.}}
A comparatively new off-the-shelf surveillance device is an [[IMSI-catcher]], a [[Telephone tapping|telephone eavesdropping]] device used to intercept mobile phone traffic and track the movement of mobile phone users. Essentially a "fake" [[cell site|mobile tower]] acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a [[man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] (MITM) attack. IMSI-catchers are used in some countries by [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | chapter=Section 100i – IMS I-Catcher | title=The German Code Of Criminal Procedure | url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | pages=43–44 | year=2014 | access-date=November 27, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925164238/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | archive-date=September 25, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human microchips===
{{Main|Microchip implant (human)}}

A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or [[RFID]] transponder encased in [[silicate glass]] and implanted in the body of a human being.  A [[subdermal implant]] typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information.

Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies,{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} a "killer" tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009.

===Devices===
{{See also|United States v. Spy Factory, Inc.}}
[[Covert listening device]]s and video devices, or "bugs", are hidden electronic devices which are used to capture, record, and/or transmit data to a receiving party such as a law enforcement agency.

The U.S. has run numerous domestic intelligence operations, such as [[COINTELPRO]], which have bugged the homes, offices, and vehicles of thousands of U.S. citizens, usually [[political activists]], [[subversives]], and [[criminals]].&lt;ref name="wolf-cointelpro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm|title=COINTELPRO|last=Wolf|first=Paul|work=(online collection of historical documents)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement and intelligence services in the U.K. and the United States possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones, by accessing the phone's diagnostic/maintenance features, in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone.&lt;ref name="roving-bugs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uk-mobile-bug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa-phone"/&gt;

===Postal services===
As more people use faxes and e-mail the significance of surveilling the postal system is decreasing, in favor of Internet and telephone surveillance.

===Stakeout===
{{Redirect|Stakeout}}
A '''stakeout''' is the coordinated surveillance of a location or person. Stakeouts are generally performed [[covert]]ly and for the purpose of gathering [[evidence]] related to [[criminal activity]]. The term derives from the practice by [[land surveyor]]s of using [[survey stakes]] to measure out an area before the main building project is commenced.

=== Wildlife ===
The management of wildlife populations often requires surveillance. This includes, for example surveillance of (1) [[Invasive species]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauser|first=Cindy E.|last2=McCarthy|first2=Michael A.|date=2009-07-01|title=Streamlining 'search and destroy': cost-effective surveillance for invasive species management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01323.x/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=7|pages=683–692|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01323.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; location and abundance for more effective management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Nyrop|first2=Jan P.|last3=Ellner|first3=Stephen P.|date=2016-06-01|title=The economic benefit of time-varying surveillance effort for invasive species management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12617/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=712–721|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12617|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) illegal fishers and poachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fSl9o9lFvoEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=+surveillance+fisheries&amp;ots=iSl00OnmlW&amp;sig=vQgrephh5FBz97zuzVbuME6wQys&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=surveillance%20fisheries&amp;f=false|title=Recent Trends in Monitoring Control and Surveillance Systems for Capture Fisheries|last=Flewwelling|first=Peter|last2=Nations|first2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=9789251048764|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Rong|last2=Ford|first2=Benjamin|last3=Tambe|first3=Milind|last4=Lemieux|first4=Andrew|date=2014-01-01|title=Adaptive Resource Allocation for Wildlife Protection Against Illegal Poachers|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2615731.2615805|journal=Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems|series=AAMAS '14|location=Richland, SC|publisher=International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems|pages=453–460|isbn=9781450327381}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce harvest and [[overexploitation]] of natural resources, (3) the population abundances of endangered species to decrease the risk of extinction, and (4) wildlife diseases that can damange crops, agriculture and natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mörner|first=T.|last2=Obendorf|first2=D.

==Controversy==
[[File:Bansky one nation under cctv.jpg|thumb|right|Graffiti expressing concern about proliferation of video surveillance]]

===Support===

Supporters of surveillance systems believe that these tools can help protect society from [[terrorists]] and [[criminals]]. They argue that surveillance can reduce crime by three means: by deterrence, by observation, and by reconstruction. Surveillance can deter by increasing the chance of being caught, and by revealing the [[modus operandi]]. This requires a minimal level of [[invasive observation|invasiveness]].&lt;ref name ="Deviant Behaviour - Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security"&gt;[http://www.fp7-tactics.eu/files/documents/Deviant%20Behaviour-Socially%20accepted%20observation%20of%20behaviour%20for%20security.pdf Deviant Behaviour – Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security], Jeroen van Rest&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method on how surveillance can be used to fight criminal activity is by linking the information stream obtained from them to a recognition system (for instance, a camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system). This can for instance auto-recognize fugitives and direct police to their location.

A distinction here has to be made however on the type of surveillance employed. Some people that say support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate telephone taps and vice versa. Besides the types, the way in how this surveillance is done also matters a lot; i.e. indiscriminate telephone taps are supported by much fewer people than say telephone taps only done to people suspected of engaging in illegal activities.

Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. [[video analytics]]. Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts. Surveillance can also influence subjective security if surveillance resources are visible or if the consequences of surveillance can be felt.

Some of the surveillance systems (such as the camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system mentioned above) can also have other uses besides countering criminal activity. For instance, it can help on retrieving runaway children, abducted or missing adults and mentally disabled people. 
Other supporters simply believe that there is nothing that can be done about the loss of privacy, and that people must become accustomed to having no privacy. As [[Sun Microsystems]] CEO [[Scott McNealy]] said: "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it."&lt;ref name="sun-getoverit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538|title=Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It'|last=Sprenger|first=Polly|date=January 26, 1999|work=Wired Magazine|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw-getoverit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |title=Privacy |last=Baig |first=Edward |author2=Marcia Stepanek |author3=Neil Gross |date=April 5, 1999 |work=Business Week |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017102602/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common argument is: "[[nothing to hide argument|If you aren't doing something wrong then you don't have anything to fear]]." Which follows that if one is engaging in unlawful activities, in which case they do not have a legitimate justification for their privacy. However, if they are following the law the surveillance would not affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove, Daniel]]|title='I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy|journal=San Diego Law Review|year=2007|volume=44|page=745|ssrn=998565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
[[File:UncleSamListensIn.jpg|thumb|upright|An elaborate [[Sgraffito|graffito]] in Columbus, Ohio, depicting state surveillance of [[telecommunications]] ]]

With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program and [[ADVISE]], technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/index.html|title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society?|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and [[American Civil Liberties Union]], have expressed concern that by allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens we will end up in a [[mass surveillance]] society, with extremely limited, or non-existent political and/or personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as ''[[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]]''.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigger-monster"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/aclu_report_bigger_monster_weaker_chains.pdf|title=Bigger Monster, Weaker Chains: The Growth of an American Surveillance Society|date=January 15, 2003|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics state that the claim made by supporters should be modified to read: "As long as we do what we're told, we have nothing to fear.".&lt;!-- [103] --&gt; For instance, a person who is part of a political group which opposes the policies of the national government, might not want the government to know their names and what they have been reading, so that the government cannot easily subvert their organization, arrest, or kill them.&lt;!-- [104] --&gt; Other critics state that while a person might not have anything to hide right now, the government might later implement policies that they do wish to oppose, and that opposition might then be impossible due to mass surveillance enabling the government to identify and remove political threats.&lt;!-- [103] --&gt;&lt;!-- [105] --&gt; Further, other critics point to the fact that most people ''do'' have things to hide.&lt;!-- [102] --&gt;&lt;!-- [104] --&gt; For example, if a person is looking for a new job, they might not want their current employer to know this.&lt;!-- [106] --&gt; Also if an employer wishes total privacy to watch over their own employee and secure their financial information it may become impossible, and they may not wish to hire those under surveillance. The most concern of detriment is securing the lives of those who live under total surveillance willingly, educating the public to those under peaceful watch while identifying terrorist and those who use the same surveillance systems and mechanisms in opposition to peace, against civilians, and to disclose lives removed from the laws of the land.

In addition, a significant risk of private data collection stems from the fact that this risk is too much unknown to be readily assessed today. Storage is cheap enough to have data stored forever, and the models using which it will be analyzed in a decade from now cannot reasonably be foreseen.&lt;ref name="privacy-hbarel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hbarel.com/index.php/against-the-collection-of-private|title=Against the collection of private data: The unknown risk factor|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the Government of China took steps to oppose widespread surveillance by security-company cameras, webcams, and [[IP Camera]]s after tens-of-thousands were made accessible for internet viewing by IT company [[Qihoo]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2124158/chinese-tech-firm-told-stop-watching-us-after-footage-security&lt;/ref&gt;

====Totalitarianism====
[[File:Sur-veillance-trafficcam-glog.jpg|thumb|upright|A traffic camera atop a high pole oversees a road in the Canadian city of Toronto]]

Programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] have led many groups to fear that society is moving towards a state of [[mass surveillance]] with severely limited personal, social, political freedoms, where dissenting individuals or groups will be strategically removed in [[COINTELPRO]]-like purges.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigger-monster"/&gt;

Kate Martin, of the Center For National Security Studies said of the use of military spy satellites being used to monitor the activities of U.S. citizens: "They are laying the bricks one at a time for a police state."&lt;ref name="washpost-sat"/&gt;

Some point to the blurring of lines between public and private places, and the privatization of places traditionally seen as public (such as shopping malls and industrial parks) as illustrating the increasing legality of collecting personal information.&lt;ref name="Marx et al, 2007"&gt;Marx, G. T., &amp; Muschert, G. W. (2007). [http://www.users.miamioh.edu/muschegw/Personal%20Info%20Borders%20Surveillance%20Marx%20Muschert.pdf Personal information, borders, and the new surveillance studies]. Annual Review of Law and Social Science, 3, 375–395.&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling through many public places such as government offices is hardly optional for most people, yet consumers have little choice but to submit to companies' surveillance practices.&lt;ref name="Agre, 2003"&gt;Agre, Philip E. (2003), [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/bar-code.html "Your Face is not a bar code: arguments against automatic face recognition in public places"]. Retrieved November 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance techniques are not created equal; among the many [[biometric]] identification technologies, for instance, [[face recognition]] requires the least cooperation. Unlike automatic fingerprint reading, which requires an individual to press a finger against a machine, this technique is subtle and requires little to no consent.&lt;ref name="Agre, 2003" /&gt;

====Psychological/social effects====
{{See also|Hawthorne effect}}
Some critics, such as [[Michel Foucault]], believe that in addition to its obvious function of identifying and capturing individuals who are committing undesirable acts, surveillance also functions to create in everyone a feeling of always being watched, so that they become self-policing. This allows the State to control the populace without having to resort to physical force, which is expensive and otherwise problematic.&lt;ref name="foucault-discipline"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=1979|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of panopticism is a means of indirect control over a large populace through the uncertainty of surveillance. Michel Foucault analyzed the architecture of the prison panopticon, and realized that its success was not just in its ability to monitor but also its ability to not monitor without anyone knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Critics such as Derrick Jensen and George Draffan, argue that panopticism in the United States began in World War I when the issuing of passports became important for the tracking of citizens and possibly enemies of the state. Such surveillance continues today through government agencies in the form of tracking internet usage and library usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|title= Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance and the Culture of Control|date=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=Vermont|pages=112–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of digital technology, individuals have become increasingly perceptible to one another, as surveillance becomes virtual. Online surveillance is the utilization of the internet to observe one's activity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Superconnected: the internet, digital media, and techno-social life|last=Chayko|first=Mary|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations, citizens, and governments participate in tracking others' behaviours for motivations that arise out of business relations, to curiosity, to legality. In her book ''Superconnected'', Chayko differentiates between two types of surveillance: vertical and horizontal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vertical surveillance occurs when there is a dominant force, such as the government that is attempting to control or regulate the actions of a given society. Such powerful authorities often justify their incursions as a means to protect society from threats of violence or terrorism. Some individuals question when this becomes an infringement on civil rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Horizontal diverges from vertical surveillance as the tracking shifts from an authoritative source to an everyday figure, such as a friend, coworker, or stranger that is interested in one's mundane activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individuals leave traces of information when they are online that reveal their interests and desires of which others observe. While this can allow people to become interconnected and develop social connections online, it can also increase potential risk to harm, such as [[cyberbullying]] or censoring/stalking by strangers, reducing privacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Michel Foucault has expanded literature on discipline and power structures within society, specifically by developing Jeremy Bentham's notion of the [[panopticon]]. This metaphor has been used to illustrate the influence of surveillance on the individual, in addition to society as a collective. The panopticon is a circular prison design in which prison guards are located within the center of the facility, monitoring the prisoners who are invisible to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison|last=Foucault|first=Michel|publisher=Vintage|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the inmates are not consistently observed, they are nevertheless obliged to abide by the rules due to the perception that they are under surveillance. This is similar to the contemporary prevalence of undercover police and highway trackers. An example of video surveillance is called closed-circuit television ([[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]), which are used to reduce crime and increase public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=Barrie|date=October 2011|title=Camera surveillance within the UK: Enhancing public safety or a social threat?|url=|journal=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology|volume=25|pages=193–203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation is maintained both through vertical and self-surveillance.

====Privacy====
Numerous [[civil rights]] groups and [[privacy]] groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy. Such groups include: [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]]

There have been several lawsuits such as [[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]] and [[EPIC v. Department of Justice]] by groups or individuals, opposing certain surveillance activities.

Legislative proceedings such as those that took place during the [[Church Committee]], which investigated domestic intelligence programs such as [[COINTELPRO]], have also weighed the pros and cons of surveillance.

;Court Cases

[[People v. Diaz|People vs. Diaz (2011)]] was a court case in the realm of cell phone privacy, even though the decision was later overturned. In this case, Gregory Diaz was arrested during a sting operation for attempting to sell ecstasy.  During his arrest, police searched Diaz's phone and found more incriminating evidence including SMS text messages and photographs depicting illicit activities.  During his trial, Diaz attempted to have the information from his cell phone removed from evidence, but the courts deemed it as lawful and Diaz's appeal was denied on the California State Court level and, later, the Supreme Court level.  Just three short years after, this decision was overturned in the case Riley vs. California (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1033744.html|title=People vs. Diaz|last=Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 6, California.|first=|date=July 30, 2008|website=FindLaw|access-date=Feb 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riley v. California|Riley vs. California (2014)]] was an extremely vital [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] case in which a man was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting.  A few days after the shooting the police made an arrest of the suspect (Riley), and, during the arrest, the police searched him.  However, this search was not only of Riley's person, but also the police opened and searched his cell phone, finding pictures of other weapons, drugs, and of Riley showing gang signs.  In court, the question arose whether searching the phone was lawful or if the search was protected by the 4th amendment of the constitution.  The decision held that the search of Riley's cell phone during the arrest was illegal, and that it was protected by the 4th Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-132|title=Riley v.

==Countersurveillance, inverse surveillance, sousveillance==
[[Countersurveillance]] is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difficult. Developments in the late twentieth century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity, such as the Internet, increasing prevalence of electronic [[security systems]], high-altitude (and possibly armed) [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]], and large corporate and government computer databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/secrets_countersurveillance|title=The Secrets of Countersurveillance|publisher=Security Weekly|date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inverse surveillance]] is the practice of the reversal of surveillance on other individuals or groups (e.g., citizens photographing police). Well-known examples are [[Rodney King|George Holliday]]'s recording of the [[Rodney King]] beating and the organization [[Copwatch]], which attempts to monitor police officers to prevent [[police brutality]].  Counter-surveillance can be also used in applications to prevent corporate spying, or to track other criminals by certain criminal entities. It can also be used to deter stalking methods used by various entities and organizations.

''[[Sousveillance]]'' is inverse surveillance, involving the recording by private individuals, rather than government or corporate entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Popular culture==
===In literature===
* [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' portrays a fictional [[totalitarian]] surveillance society with a very simple (by today's standards) [[mass surveillance]] system consisting of human operatives, informants, and two-way "telescreens" in people's homes. Because of the impact of this book, mass-surveillance technologies are commonly called "Orwellian" when they are considered problematic.
* The novel ''[[mistrust]]'' highlights the negative effects from the overuse of surveillance at Reflection House. The central character Kerryn installs secret cameras to monitor her housemates – see also [[Paranoia]].
* The book ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', as well as a film based on it, portray a totalitarian [[Christian]] [[theocracy]] where all citizens are kept under constant surveillance.
* In the book ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', [[Lisbeth Salander]] uses computers to get information on people, as well as other common surveillance methods, as a freelancer.
* [[Dave Eggers|David Egger's]] novel ''[[The Circle (Eggers novel)|The Circle]]'' exhibits a world where a single company called "The Circle" produces all of the latest and highest quality technologies from computers and smartphones, to surveillance cameras known as "See-Change cameras". This company becomes associated with politics when starting a movement where politicians go "transparent" by wearing See-Change cameras on their body to prevent keeping secrets from the public about their daily work activity. In this society, it becomes mandatory to share personal information and experiences because it is The Circle's belief that everyone should have access to all information freely. However, as Eggers illustrates, this takes a toll on the individuals and creates a disruption of power between the governments and the private company. The Circle presents extreme ideologies surrounding mandatory surveillance. Eamon Bailey, one of the Wise Men, or founders of The Circle, believes that possessing the tools to access information about anything or anyone, should be a human right given to all of the world's citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Circle|last=Eggers|first=David|publisher=Alfred A.

Negative actions will eventually be eradicated from society altogether, through the fear of being exposed to other citizens&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would be achieved in part by everyone going transparent, something that Bailey highly supports, although it's notable that none of the Wise Men ever became transparent themselves. One major goal of The Circle is to have all of the world's information filtered through The Circle, a process they call "Completion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A single, private company would then have full access and control over all information and privacy of individuals and governments. Ty Gospodinov, the first founder of The Circle, has major concerns about the completion of the circle. He warns that this step would give The Circle too much power and control, and would quickly lead to [[totalitarianism]].

===In music===
* The [[Dead Kennedys]]' song "I Am The Owl" is about government surveillance and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] of political groups.
* The [[Vienna Teng]] song "Hymn of Acxiom" is about corporate data collection and surveillance.

{{Main|List of films featuring surveillance}}

* The film ''[[Gattaca]]'' portrays a society that uses [[biometric]] surveillance to distinguish between people who are genetically engineered "superior" humans and genetically natural "inferior" humans.
* In the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', the police and government intelligence agencies use [[micro aerial vehicles]] in [[SWAT]] operations and for surveillance purposes.
* [[HBO]]'s crime-drama series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' regularly portrays the FBI's surveillance of the [[DiMeo Crime Family]]. Audio devices they use include "[[Covert listening device|bugs]]" placed in strategic locations (e.g., in "[[I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano]]" and "[[Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood]]") and hidden microphones worn by operatives (e.g., in "[[Rat Pack (The Sopranos)|Rat Pack]]") and informants (e.g., in "[[Funhouse (The Sopranos)|Funhouse]]", "[[Proshai, Livushka]]" and "[[Members Only (The Sopranos)|Members Only]]"). Visual devices include [[hidden cameras|hidden still cameras]] (e.g., in "[[Pax Soprana]]") and video cameras (e.g., in "[[Long Term Parking]]").
* The movie ''[[THX-1138]]'' portrays a society wherein people are drugged with sedatives and antidepressants, and have surveillance cameras watching them everywhere they go.
* The movie ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' portrays the monitoring of [[East Berlin]] by agents of the [[Stasi]], the [[East Germany|GDR]]'s secret police.
* The movie ''[[The Conversation]]'' portrays many methods of [[Eavesdropping|audio surveillance]].

'''''The Camp of the Saints''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Camp des Saints}}) is a 1973 French novel by author and explorer [[Jean Raspail]]. The novel depicts the destruction of [[Western civilization]] through [[Third World]] mass immigration to [[France]] and the [[Western world|West]]. Almost forty years after its initial publication, the novel returned to the bestseller list in 2011.&lt;ref name="L'Express"&gt;''[[L'Express]]'': [http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/le-camp-des-saints-de-jean-raspail-un-succes-de-librairie-raciste_980039.html "Le camp des Saints, de Jean Raspail, un succès de librairie raciste?"], 6 April 2011, retrieved 30 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On its publication, the book received praise from some French literary figures&lt;ref&gt;"''Le camp des saints'' finit par obtenir une critique imposante, non pas tant par le volume (demeuré incomparable à celui que provoque le moindre texte d'une vedette de variétés) que par la qualité de ses laudateurs.

In the U.S., it was praised by William F. Buckley and [[Max_Lerner|Max Lerner]], and criticized by [[Linda_Chavez|Linda Chavez]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].

== Inspiration ==
Raspail has said his inspiration came while at the French Riviera in 1971, as he was looking out at the Mediterranean.

{{Quote|What if ''they'' were to come? I did not know who "they" were, but it seemed inevitable to me that the numberless disinherited people of the South would, like a tidal wave, set sail one day for this opulent shore, our fortunate country’s wide-gaping frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Camp des Saints (Édition 2011)|last=Raspail|first=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1881780076|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name of the book comes from a passage in the [[Book of Revelation]] (Revelation 20:7–9) depicting the [[apocalypse]]. Satan influences most of the nations of the Earth to gather for one final battle against "the camp of the saints," before being defeated for eternity:

{{Quote|And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.20.esv|title=Revelation 20, English Standard Version (ESV) {{!}} Chapter 20 {{!}} The Bible App {{!}} Bible.com|website=www.bible.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Plot ==
{{Long plot|section|date=February 2018}}

In [[Kolkata|Calcutta, India]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests promote the adoption of Indian children by those back in [[Belgium]] as a form of charity. When the Belgian government realizes that the number of Indian children raised in Belgium has reached 40,000 in just five years, an emergency policy attempts to halt the migration. Desperate for the chance to send their children to what they call a "land of plenty", a mob of desperate Indians swarms the [[consulate]]. As a Belgian aid worker works through the crowd, an Indian [[gong farmer]] begs him to take them back to Europe, to which the worker agrees.

The worker and farmer bring the crowd to the docks, where there are hundreds of ships once owned by European powers, now suited only for river traffic. Nevertheless, the crowd boards, and a hundred ships soon leave for Europe; conditions on board are cramped, unsanitary and miserable, with some passengers publicly fornicating. As the ships pass "the straits of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]", helicopters swarm overhead, capturing images of the refugees on board to be published in Europe. Meanwhile, on the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] Far East, the Soviet troops see masses of Chinese ready to enter [[Siberia]] but are reluctant to fight them.

As the fleet crosses the Indian Ocean, the political situation in France becomes more charged. At a press conference about the crisis, a French official who offers a speech in praise of the refugees is confronted by a journalist who claims he is merely trying to "feed the invaders" and demands to know if France will "have the courage to stand up to" the migrants when they reach France. The official decries this question as morally offensive and threatens to throw the journalist out when he continues to yell. Other journalists seek to inflame tensions between the French and Africans and Arabs already living in the country. Over time, these journalists begin to write that the migrant fleet is on a mission to "enrich, cleanse and redeem the Capitalist West". At the same time as the fleet is praised by those in Paris, the people of [[Southern France]], terrified of the migrants' arrival, flee to the north.

As the fleet approaches the [[Suez Canal]], [[Egypt|Egyptian]] forces fire a warning shot, causing the fleet to steer south, around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. To the surprise of observers, the [[apartheid]] regime of [[South Africa]] floats out barges of food and supplies, which the migrants throw overboard. The international press is thrilled, believing the rejection of these supplies to be a political statement against the apartheid South African regime. Western leaders, confident the refugees will accept supplies from their "more virtuous" nations, organize a supply mission, funded by governments, charities, rock stars and major churches, to meet the refugees off [[São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé]]. However, the fleet does not stop for these barges either, and when a worker from the [[Pope|Papal]] barge attempts to board one of the ships, he is strangled and thrown overboard. The press attempts to contain coverage of the disaster.

When the migrants pass through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[President of France|French president]] orders troops to the south and addresses the nation of his plan to repel the migrants. However, in the middle of the address, he breaks down, demands the troops simply follow their consciences instead. Most of the troops immediately desert their posts and join the civilians as they flee north, and the south is quickly overrun by the migrants. Some of the last troops to stand their ground take refuge in a small village, along with Calguès, an old man who has chosen to remain at his home, and Hamadura, a [[Westernization|Westernized]] Indian who is terrified of his "filthy, brutish" countrymen and prides himself on having more in common with whites than Indians. The troops in this village, total of nineteen Frenchmen and one Indian, surrounded by what they deem "occupied territory", remains the last defense of Western values and "Free France" against the immigrants.

The migrants make their way north, having no desire to assimilate to French culture, but continuing to demand a First World standard of living, even as they flout laws, do not produce, and murder French citizens, such as factory bosses and shopkeepers, as well as the ordinary people who do not welcome them. They are also joined by the immigrants who already reside in Europe, as well as various left-wing and anarchist groups. Across the West, more and more migrants arrive and have children, rapidly growing to outnumber whites. In a matter of months, the white West has been overrun and the pro-immigrant governments are established, while the white people are ordered to share their houses and flats with the immigrants. The village containing the troops is bombed flat by airplanes of the new French government, referred to only as the "Paris Multiracial Commune". Within a few years, most Western governments have surrendered. The mayor of [[New York City]] is made to share [[Gracie Mansion]] with three [[African-American]] families from [[Harlem]], migrants gather at coastal ports in West Africa and South Asia and swarm into [[Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], London is taken over by an organization of non-white residents known as the "Non-European Commonwealth Committee" which force the [[Elizabeth II|British queen]] to have her son marry a [[Pakistan]]i woman, millions of [[black Africans]] from around the continent gather at the [[Limpopo River]] and invade [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], and only one drunken [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldier stands in the way of hundreds of thousands of Chinese peasants as they overrun Siberia.

The epilogue reveals that the story was written in the last holdout of the Western world, [[Switzerland]], but international pressure from the new governments, isolating it as a [[rogue state]] for not opening its borders, and the internal pro-migrant elements, force it to capitulate as well. Mere hours from the border opening, the author dedicates the book to his grandchildren, in the hopes they will grow up in a world where they will not be ashamed of him for writing such a book.

According to [[Matthew Connelly]] and [[Paul Kennedy]], "[s]ixties radicalism still prevailed in Paris... [and] French intellectuals and bureaucrats swiftly dismissed [the book] as a racist tract".&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; It was praised by [[Bernard Pivot]] and conservative intellectuals such as [[Michel Déon]], [[Jean Cau (writer)|Jean Cau]] and [[Louis Pauwels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Le Point|date=1987|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3YY7AQAAIAAJ|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dupuis|first1=Jerome|title=Le camp des Saints, de Jean Raspail, un succès de librairie raciste?|publisher=L'Express|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/le-camp-des-saints-de-jean-raspail-un-succes-de-librairie-raciste_980039.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was translated to English, [[Max Lerner]] said that it had "irresistible pace of skill and narrative", while [[Sidney Hook]] said that it would "succeed in shocking and challenging the complacent contemporary mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Publishers Weekly|publisher=R. R.

In 2002, [[Lionel Shriver]] described the novel as "both prescient and appalling," certainly "racist" but "written with tremendous verbal energy and passion."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12715">In [[mathematics]], a '''vector-valued differential form''' on a [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[differential form]] on ''M'' with values in a [[vector space]] ''V''. More generally, it is a differential form with values in some [[vector bundle]] ''E'' over ''M''. Ordinary differential forms can be viewed as '''R'''-valued differential forms.

An important case of vector-valued differential forms are [[Lie algebra-valued forms]]. (A [[connection form]] is an example of such a form.)

==Formal definition==

Let ''M'' be a [[smooth manifold]] and ''E'' → ''M'' be a smooth [[vector bundle]] over ''M''. We denote the space of [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth section]]s of a bundle ''E'' by Γ(''E''). An '''''E''-valued differential form''' of degree ''p'' is a smooth section of the [[tensor product bundle]] of ''E'' with Λ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sup&gt; ∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M''), the ''p''-th [[exterior power]] of the [[cotangent bundle]] of ''M''. The space of such forms is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^p(M,E) = \Gamma(E\otimes\Lambda^pT^*M).&lt;/math&gt;
Because Γ is a [[strong monoidal functor]],&lt;ref name=gamma_monoidal&gt;{{cite web|title=Global sections of a tensor product of vector bundles on a smooth manifold|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/492166/global-sections-of-a-tensor-product-of-vector-bundles-on-a-smooth-manifold|website=math.stackexchange.com|accessdate=27 October 2014|ref=monoidal}}&lt;/ref&gt; this can also be interpreted as
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(E\otimes\Lambda^pT^*M) = \Gamma(E) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Gamma(\Lambda^pT^*M) = \Gamma(E) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M),&lt;/math&gt;
where the latter two tensor products are the [[tensor product of modules]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') of smooth '''R'''-valued functions on ''M'' (see the seventh example [[module (mathematics)#Examples|here]]).  By convention, an ''E''-valued 0-form is just a section of the bundle ''E''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^0(M,E) = \Gamma(E).\,&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, an ''E''-valued differential form can be defined as a [[vector bundle morphism|bundle morphism]]
:&lt;math&gt;TM\otimes\cdots\otimes TM \to E&lt;/math&gt;
which is totally [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]].

Let ''V'' be a fixed [[vector space]]. A '''''V''-valued differential form''' of degree ''p'' is a differential form of degree ''p'' with values in the [[trivial bundle]] ''M'' &amp;times; ''V''. The space of such forms is denoted Ω&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', ''V''). When ''V'' = '''R''' one recovers the definition of an ordinary differential form.  If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then one can show that the natural homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^p(M) \otimes_\mathbb{R} V \to \Omega^p(M,V),&lt;/math&gt;
where the first tensor product is of vector spaces over '''R''', is an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Proof: One can verify this for ''p''=0 by turning a basis for ''V'' into a set of constant functions to ''V'', which allows the construction of an inverse to the above homomorphism.  The general case can be proved by noting that
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^p(M, V) = \Omega^0(M, V) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M),&lt;/math&gt;
and that because &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a sub-ring of Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') via the constant functions,
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^0(M, V) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M) = (V \otimes_\mathbb{R} \Omega^0(M)) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M) = V \otimes_\mathbb{R} (\Omega^0(M) \otimes_{\Omega^0(M)} \Omega^p(M)) = V \otimes_\mathbb{R} \Omega^p(M).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations on vector-valued forms==

===Pullback===

One can define the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of vector-valued forms by [[smooth map]]s just as for ordinary forms. The pullback of an ''E''-valued form on ''N'' by a smooth map φ : ''M'' → ''N'' is an (φ*''E'')-valued form on ''M'', where φ*''E'' is the [[pullback bundle]] of ''E'' by φ.

The formula is given just as in the ordinary case. For any ''E''-valued ''p''-form ω on ''N'' the pullback φ*ω is given by
:&lt;math&gt; (\varphi^*\omega)_x(v_1,\cdots, v_p) = \omega_{\varphi(x)}(\mathrm d\varphi_x(v_1),\cdots,\mathrm d\varphi_x(v_p)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Wedge product===

Just as for ordinary differential forms, one can define a [[wedge product]] of vector-valued forms. The wedge product of an ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-valued ''p''-form with an ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-valued ''q''-form is naturally an (''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;otimes;''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-valued (''p''+''q'')-form:
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge : \Omega^p(M,E_1) \times \Omega^q(M,E_2) \to \Omega^{p+q}(M,E_1\otimes E_2).&lt;/math&gt;
The definition is just as for ordinary forms with the exception that real multiplication is replaced with the [[tensor product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(\omega\wedge\eta)(v_1,\cdots,v_{p+q}) = \frac{1}{(p + q)!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_{p+q}}\sgn(\sigma)\omega(v_{\sigma(1)},\cdots,v_{\sigma(p)})\otimes \eta(v_{\sigma(p+1)},\cdots,v_{\sigma(p+q)}).&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, the wedge product of an ordinary ('''R'''-valued) ''p''-form with an ''E''-valued ''q''-form is naturally an ''E''-valued (''p''+''q'')-form (since the tensor product of ''E'' with the trivial bundle ''M'' &amp;times; '''R''' is [[naturally isomorphic]] to ''E''). For ω ∈ Ω&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') and η ∈ Ω&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', ''E'') one has the usual commutativity relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta = (-1)^{pq}\eta\wedge\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the wedge product of two ''E''-valued forms is ''not'' another ''E''-valued form, but rather an (''E''&amp;otimes;''E'')-valued form. However, if ''E'' is an [[algebra bundle]] (i.e. a bundle of [[algebra over a field|algebra]]s rather than just vector spaces) one can compose with multiplication in ''E'' to obtain an ''E''-valued form. If ''E'' is a bundle of [[commutative algebra|commutative]], [[associative algebra]]s then, with this modified wedge product, the set of all ''E''-valued differential forms
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega(M,E) = \bigoplus_{p=0}^{\dim M}\Omega^p(M,E)&lt;/math&gt;
becomes a [[graded-commutative]] associative algebra. If the fibers of ''E'' are not commutative then Ω(''M'',''E'') will not be graded-commutative.

===Exterior derivative===

For any vector space ''V'' there is a natural [[exterior derivative]] on the space of ''V''-valued forms. This is just the ordinary exterior derivative acting component-wise relative to any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of ''V''. Explicitly, if {''e''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;} is a basis for ''V'' then the differential of a ''V''-valued ''p''-form ω = ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = (d\omega^\alpha)e_\alpha.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The exterior derivative on ''V''-valued forms is completely characterized by the usual relations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;d(\omega+\eta) = d\omega + d\eta\\
&amp;d(\omega\wedge\eta) = d\omega\wedge\eta + (-1)^p\,\omega\wedge d\eta\qquad(p=\deg\omega)\\
&amp;d(d\omega) = 0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, the above remarks apply to ''E''-valued forms where ''E'' is any [[flat vector bundle]] over ''M'' (i.e. a vector bundle whose transition functions are constant). The exterior derivative is defined as above on any [[local trivialization]] of ''E''.

If ''E'' is not flat then there is no natural notion of an exterior derivative acting on ''E''-valued forms. What is needed is a choice of [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] on ''E''. A connection on ''E'' is a linear [[differential operator]] taking sections of ''E'' to ''E''-valued one forms:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla : \Omega^0(M,E) \to \Omega^1(M,E).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''E'' is equipped with a connection ∇ then there is a unique [[covariant exterior derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;d_\nabla: \Omega^p(M,E) \to \Omega^{p+1}(M,E)&lt;/math&gt;
extending ∇. The covariant exterior derivative is characterized by [[linearity]] and the equation
:&lt;math&gt;d_\nabla(\omega\wedge\eta) = d_\nabla\omega\wedge\eta + (-1)^p\,\omega\wedge d\eta&lt;/math&gt;
where ω is a ''E''-valued ''p''-form and η is an ordinary ''q''-form. In general, one need not have ''d''&lt;sub&gt;∇&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. In fact, this happens if and only if the connection ∇ is flat (i.e. has vanishing [[curvature form|curvature]]).

==Basic or tensorial forms on principal bundles==

Let ''E'' → ''M'' be a smooth vector bundle of rank ''k'' over ''M'' and let ''π'' : F(''E'') → ''M'' be the ([[associated bundle|associated]]) [[frame bundle]] of ''E'', which is a [[principal bundle|principal]] GL&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') bundle over ''M''. The [[pullback bundle|pullback]] of ''E'' by ''π'' is canonically isomorphic to F(''E'') &amp;times;&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; via the inverse of [''u'', ''v''] →''u''(''v''), where ρ is the standard representation. Therefore, the pullback by ''π'' of an ''E''-valued form on ''M'' determines an '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-valued form on F(''E''). It is not hard to check that this pulled back form is [[equivariant|right-equivariant]] with respect to the natural [[group action|action]] of GL&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') on F(''E'') &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and vanishes on [[vertical bundle|vertical vectors]] (tangent vectors to F(''E'') which lie in the kernel of d''π''). Such vector-valued forms on F(''E'') are important enough to warrant special terminology: they are called ''basic'' or ''tensorial forms'' on F(''E'').

Let ''π'' : ''P'' → ''M'' be a (smooth) [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] and let ''V'' be a fixed vector space together with a [[group representation|representation]] ''ρ'' : ''G'' → GL(''V''). A '''basic''' or '''tensorial form''' on ''P'' of type ρ is a ''V''-valued form ω on ''P'' which is '''equivariant''' and '''horizontal''' in the sense that
#&lt;math&gt;(R_g)^*\omega = \rho(g^{-1})\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; for all ''g'' ∈ ''G'', and
#&lt;math&gt;\omega(v_1, \ldots, v_p) = 0&lt;/math&gt; whenever at least one of the ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are vertical (i.e., d''π''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0).
Here ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the right action of ''G'' on ''P'' for some ''g'' ∈ ''G''. Note that for 0-forms the second condition is [[vacuously true]].

*Example: If ρ is the [[adjoint representation]] of ''G'' on the Lie algebra, then the connection form ω satisfies the first condition (but not the second). The associated [[curvature form]] Ω satisfies both; hence Ω is a tensorial form of adjoint type. The "difference" of two connection forms is a tensorial form.

Given ''P'' and ''ρ'' as above one can construct the [[associated vector bundle]] ''E'' = ''P'' &amp;times;&lt;sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''V''. Tensorial ''q''-forms on ''P'' are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with ''E''-valued ''q''-forms on ''M''. As in the case of the principal bundle F(''E'') above, given a ''q''-form &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; on ''M'' with values in ''E'', define φ on ''P'' fiberwise by, say at ''u'',
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = u^{-1}\pi^*\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' is viewed as a linear isomorphism &lt;math&gt;V \overset{\simeq}\to E_{\pi(u)} = (\pi^*E)_u, v \mapsto [u, v]&lt;/math&gt;. φ is then a tensorial form of type ρ. Conversely, given a tensorial form φ of type ρ, the same formula defines an ''E''-valued form &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; on ''M'' (cf. the [[Chern–Weil homomorphism]].) In particular, there is a natural isomorphism of vector spaces
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(M, E) \simeq \{ f: P \to V | f(ug) = \rho(g)^{-1}f(u) \}, \, \overline{f} \leftrightarrow f&lt;/math&gt;.

*Example: Let ''E'' be the tangent bundle of ''M''. Then identity bundle map id&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''E'' →''E'' is an ''E''-valued one form on ''M''. The [[tautological one-form]] is a unique one-form on the frame bundle of ''E'' that corresponds to id&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;. Denoted by θ, it is a tensorial form of standard type.&lt;!--Mention this somewhere else: The [[exterior covariant derivative]] of θ, Θ = ''D''θ is called a [[torsion form]].--&gt;

Now, suppose there is a connection on ''P'' so that there is an [[exterior covariant differentiation]] ''D'' on (various) vector-valued forms on ''P''. Through the above correspondence, ''D'' also acts on ''E''-valued forms: define ∇ by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \overline{\phi} = \overline{D \phi}.&lt;/math&gt;
In particular for zero-forms,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla: \Gamma(M, E) \to \Gamma(M, T^*M \otimes E)&lt;/math&gt;.
This is exactly the [[covariant derivative]] for the [[connection (vector bundle)|connection on the vector bundle ''E'']].&lt;ref&gt;Proof: &lt;math&gt;D (f\phi) = Df \otimes \phi + f D\phi&lt;/math&gt; for any scalar-valued tensorial zero-form ''f'' and any tensorial zero-form φ of type ρ, and ''Df'' = ''df'' since ''f'' descends to a function on ''M''; cf. this [[Chern–Weil homomorphism#Definition of the homomorphism|Lemma 2]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Golden hour graph.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Critical windows in emergency medicine]]

A '''window of opportunity''' (also called a '''margin of opportunity''' or '''critical window''') is a period of time during which some action can be taken that will achieve a desired outcome. Once this period is over, or the "window has closed", the specified outcome is no longer possible.&lt;ref name="Sull"/&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of windows of opportunity include:
*The '''[[critical period]]''' in the development of an organism, during which [[neuroplasticity]] is greatest and key neurological functions, such as [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] and [[language]], are acquired which may be impossible to acquire at a later stage&lt;ref name="Robson"/&gt;
*The '''[[golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]]''' or '''golden time''', used in [[emergency medicine]] to describe the period following traumatic injury in which life-saving treatment is likely to be successful&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;

==Variations==
===Timing===
The length of a critical window may be well known (as in the case of launch windows) or poorly known (in the case of medical emergencies or climate change). In some cases, there may be multiple windows during which a goal can be achieved.

===Automation===
In situations with very brief or unpredictable windows of opportunity, [[automation]] may be employed to take advantage of these windows, as in [[algorithmic trading]].&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; [[Real-time computing]] systems can guarantee responses on the order of milliseconds or less.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ari-pg164"/&gt;

===Costs===
In some time-critical situations, failure to act may entail a continuously increasing cost over time, or a continuously decreasing probability over time of achieving the desired outcome. This may be represented in real-time computing systems by [[time-utility function]]s.

===Use as a marketing tactic===
In some cases, critical windows may be artificially imposed (or even falsely implied) as a [[marketing]] tactic to encourage action, in what is known as a "limited time offer".&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt;
