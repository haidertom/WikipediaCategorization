'''CINEMA 21''' is the largest movie theater chain in Indonesia. It serves 30 cities in Indonesia.

Along with the demands of the times, CINEMA 21 has conducted a number of improvements and innovations, among which are to form a network movie theater into 3 separate brands, namely Cinema 21, Cinema XXI and The Premiere to target different markets. This movie network spread across several major cities throughout the archipelago and most of them located in shopping centers with Hollywood and Indonesian movies as the main menu, equipped with Dolby Digital and THX sound system.

== CINEMA 21 ==
CINEMA 21 was the largest cinema network in Indonesia, which has spread across the archipelago. Before Cinema XXI's establishment, Cinema 21 controlled the overall market share of Indonesian moviegoers with varying ticket prices applied and the types of films shown, in accordance with the location and the intended target. 

After Cinema XXI was established, slowly Cinema 21 turned into second-class cinema network, with most of the films are local movies and foreign films that are not playing at the Cinema XXI anymore. However, this condition does not apply in smaller cities outside Jakarta which don't have any Cinema XXI theaters and where there are not many Cinema 21 theaters available. 

In general, most of CINEMA 21 studios are equipped with Dolby Digital sound systems, and even some of those are ''THX'' certified such as Hollywood KC (now Hollywood XXI), Karawaci and Mega (now Pluit Village XXI) in Jakarta. Not only that, some Cinema 21 even adapted the atmosphere and comfort equivalent to Cinema XXI. But again, it is based on the targeted market share and the agreement with the shopping centers management.

== Cinema XXI ==
Cinema AKU was first established in 2004 in the Plaza Indonesia Entertainment OFF
 (closed on 30 June 2014), with 4 regular theaters and 2 Premiere theaters. This Cinema XXI (named Studio XXI) is the only Cinema XXI that uses exclusive sofas in all of their theaters, and has a THX certificate in all of their theaters. Its closure was widely reported by news outlets in Indonesia and rumors say that the sofas used in that cinema are still kept.

The majority of films that played at Cinema XXI studios are Hollywood movies, both the latest, and past movies that haven't got the chance to be screened before. Some Cinema XXI studios also show Indonesian movies, based on the location and the targeted market share of the shopping centers the cinema is located in. 

Some Cinema 21 studios are also renovated and turned into Cinema XXI, with the addition of carpet, design changes, and replacement of the studio chairs. Some of them are, Anggrek XXI, BSM XXI, Plaza Senayan XXI (formerly Senayan 21), Puri XXI, Djakarta XXI and Metropole XXI (formerly Megaria 21). Especially for Plaza Senayan XXI, renovations undertaken a total overhaul, including movie theaters and the addition of several studios became 8 regular theaters and 2 Premiere theaters. The total renovation time took almost 7 months. 

To reach the entire audience, some shopping centers have more than one movie theaters in it, like Mal Kelapa Gading with Gading 21 and Gading XXI; Pondok Indah Mall which has Pondok Indah 1 XXI and Pondok Indah 2 XXI; Supermall Karawaci with Karawaci 21 and Karawaci XXI; Manado Town Square with Mantos 1 XXI and Mantos 3 XXI; Panakkukang Mall with Panakkukang 21 and Panakkukang XXI; Tunjungan Plaza with Tunjungan XXI, Tunjungan 3 XXI and Tunjungan 5 XXI; and Supermal Pakuwon Indah with Supermal XXI and Pakuwon Mall XXI. Synergies between 21 and XXI in it was maintained either by rotation of the film which was shown along with hours of play. 

Each year, the emergence of Cinema XXI in major cities continue to increase, replacing the appearance of Cinema 21. Not only that, some existing Cinema 21 and Cinema XXI studios are still doing renovations to better themselves. 

At the end of 2008, along with the development of 3D technology and the increasingly rampant films based on that format, Cinema XXI helped to apply the technology ''Dolby 3D Digital Cinema'' in several XXI, like Plaza Senayan XXI, Studio XXI, Pondok Indah XXI, Gading XXI and Puri XXI in Jakarta, as well as several other major cities such as Serpong XXI Tangerang, CiWalk XXI Bandung Sutos XXI Surabaya and CSB XXI Cirebon with a special ticket price.

'''Affective labor''' is [[Labour (economics)|work]] carried out that is intended to produce or modify emotional experiences in people. Coming out of [[Autonomist]] [[Feminist economics|feminist]] critiques of marginalized and so-called "invisible" labor, it has been the focus of critical discussions by, e.g., [[Antonio Negri]], [[Michael Hardt]], Juan Martin Prada, and [[Michael Betancourt]].

Although its history is as old as that of [[Labour (economics)|labor]] itself, affective labor has been of increasing importance to modern [[economies]] since the emergence of [[mass culture]] in the nineteenth century.  The most visible institutionalized form of affective labor is perhaps [[advertising]], which typically attempts to make audiences relate to products through particular effects.  Yet there are many other areas in which affective labor figures prominently, including [[service industry|service and care industries]] whose purpose is to make people feel in particular ways. [[Domestic worker|Domestic work]], frequently ignored by other analysts of labor, has also been a critical focus of theories of affective labor.&lt;ref&gt;Federici, Silvia (2004) Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body, and Primitive Accumulation. Brooklyn, NY: Autonomedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The phrase affective labor, seen broadly, has its roots in the [[Autonomist]] critiques of the 1970s, in particular those that theorize a dynamic form of capitalism that is able to move away from purely industrial labor. In particular, the "Fragment on Machines," from Marx's ''[[Grundrisse]]'', and conceptions of [[immaterial labor]] decentered the focus of labor theory and sparked debate over what constituted real labor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No longer does the worker insert a modified natural thing (Naturgegenstand) as middle link between the object (Objekt) and himself; rather, he inserts the process of nature, transformed into an industrial process, as a means between himself and inorganic nature, mastering it. He steps to the side of the production process instead of being its chief actor. In this transformation, it is neither the direct human labour he himself performs, nor the time during which he works, but rather the appropriation of his own general productive power, his understanding of nature and his mastery over it by virtue of his presence as a social body – it is, in a word, the development of the social individual which appears as the great foundation-stone of production and of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. ''The Grundrisse.'' Accessed Online at: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meanwhile, movements such as [[Selma James]] and Marirosa Dalla Costa's [[Wages for housework]] campaign attempted to activate the most exploited and invisible sectors of the economy and challenge the typical, male and industrial focus of labor studies.

==Hardt and Negri==

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] have begun to develop this concept in their books [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']]&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, M. and Negri, A. (2000) ''Empire''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire]]''.&lt;ref name=Multitude&gt;Hardt, M. and Negri, A. (2004) ''Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire''. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their recent work, Hardt and Negri focus on the role affective labor plays in the current mode of production (which can be referred to as "imperial", "late capitalist", or "postmodern").  In this passage from ''Multitude'' they briefly define their key terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unlike emotions, which are mental phenomena, affects refer equally to body and mind.  In fact, affects, such as joy and sadness, reveal the present state of life in the entire organism, expressing a certain state of the body along with a certain mode of thinking.  Affective labor, then, is labor that produces or manipulates affects.... One can recognize affective labor, for example, in the work of legal assistants, flight attendants, and fast food workers (service with a smile). One indication of the rising importance of affective labor, at least in the dominant countries, is the tendency for employers to highlight education, attitude, character, and "prosocial" behavior as the primary skills employees need.  A worker with a good attitude and social skills is another way of saying a worker is adept at affective labor."&lt;ref name=Multitude/&gt;{{rp|108}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most important point in their scholarship with respect to this issue is that immaterial labor, of which affective labor is a specific form, has achieved dominance in the current mode of production. This does not mean that there are more immaterial laborers than material laborers, or that immaterial labor produces more capital than material labor.  Instead, this dominance is signaled by the fact that, in developed countries, labor is more often figured as immaterial than material.  To illustrate the significance of this claim, they draw a comparison between the early twenty-first century and that of the mid-nineteenth century, famously engaged by [[Karl Marx]], in which factory labor was dominant even if it was not the form of labor practiced by the most people.  One popular, albeit slightly less than perfect example, of this might be that, whereas [[Fred Flintstone]], as an average American, drove a crane in a quarry, [[Homer Simpson]] sits at a desk and provides safety.

==Role in the political economy==

[[Michael Betancourt]] has suggested that affective labor may have a role in the development and maintenance of what he has termed "[[agnotology|agnotologic capitalism]]". His point is that affective labor is a symptom of the disassociation between the reality of capitalist economy and the alienation it produces:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The affective labor created to address this alienation is part of the mechanisms where the agnotological order maintains its grip on the social: managing the emotional states of the consumers, who also serve as the labor reserve, is a necessary precondition for the effective management of the quality and range of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652 |title=Michael Betancourt, "Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism", CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc002, Date Published: 6/10/2010, Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His construction of affective labor is concerned with its role as an enabler for a larger capitalist superstructure, where the reduction of alienation is a precondition for the elimination of dissent. Affective labor is part of a larger activity where the population is distracted by affective pursuits and fantasies of economic advancement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1643">'''Association of Telehealth Service Providers''' (ATSP) is an international membership-based [[trade]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to improving health care through growth of the [[telehealth]] industry and promoting the use of [[telecommunications]] in healthcare. Its main activities are advocacy, education awareness programs, and business support services. It is a business-oriented group which focuses on providing members with information and tools to facilitate the success of their telehealth activities.

ATSP believes that [[telemedicine]] is a practical tool that can improve the distribution of healthcare services to the benefit of both patients and providers.

It was founded in 1996 by [[Douglas Perednia]], MD and is located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  Its executive director is [[Will Engle]].

==Telemedicine Information Exchange ==

In June 2006, the ATSP announced that it was taking over the hosting and updating responsibilities for the [[Telemedicine Information Exchange]] (TIE). The TIE's mission is to provide an online, unbiased, all-inclusive platform for information on telemedicine and telehealth. As of April 2012, this site seems to be down.

A '''business suite''' is a set of business software functions enabling the core business and business support processes inside and beyond the boundaries of an organization.

== Overview ==
The key characteristic of a business suite is the delivery of end-to-end [[business processes]] which span organizational boundaries such as business departments and locations. In the last years the focus of the business processes supported by business suites has expanded to integrate business partners such as customers, suppliers and service providers .

Business Suites are generally rooted in the traditional [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems that are based on a common [[data model]] used to storing the data to be shared between departments and their [[business processes]]. Most corporate ERP systems have been enhanced and complemented by additional applications over the years. As a result, the total cost of ownership ([[Total cost of ownership|TCO]]) grows, process integrity across applications is at stake, and the flexibility to consistently change and optimize business processes suffers. The vendors of business suites claim to address these issues.

== Topics ==
The issues with business process visibility, flexibility, efficiency, and integrity in heterogeneous business application environments have recently created 2 basic types of business suites:

* The "cumulative" business suite consists of a set of previously separate applications that are connected at the [[middleware]] or [[database]] level. The absence of a unified data and process model complicates the implementation of end-to-end processes with ensured process integrity for customers. System integrators are addressing this issue at the expense of a business suite owner.
* The "organic" business suite delivers end-to-end business processes designed to run in one offering. Modern organic business suites provide additional openness to integrate with other applications or extend processes to business partners through [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] technologies.

== Business Process Scope ==
A business suite usually encompasses all core business and business support processes of an organization, unlike business applications such as [[treasury management]] or [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]  that have been designed to serve a single [[line of business]].

Since no vendor today offers applications covering all business process requirements of larger organizations, vendors complement their application portfolio through acquisitions or through cooperation with specialized partners.

===Two strategies===
A "coverage through acquisition" strategy is confined to the processes that are entirely under the control of a single organization, while the "coverage through cooperation" approach can also enable and support processes that span the boundaries of multiple organizations like suppliers, customers, banks.

===Foundational processes===
The foundational set of [[business process]]es supported by a business suite includes business support processes to manage financials, build, develop and administer the workforce, run facilities, support the procurement of generic goods and services. Those foundational processes are required to sustain a functional enterprise that complies with all regulatory requirements.

===Value drivers===
The next layer of business processes is sometimes grouped by the main value drivers or differentiators of a company:
* Development, production, sales, and distribution of [[Product (business)|products]]
* Acquisition, operations, and compliance of production [[assets]]
* Management of the production, logistics, and distribution network
* Marketing, sales, production, and service for [[customer]]s
* Cost/performance optimized procurement, production, and operations

===Processes in support of value drivers===
Key processes supporting those value drivers invariably span organizational boundaries and are relevant for multiple [[Line of business|lines of business]]. A typical [[business process]] that connects organizational entities is "order to cash" which can span sales, production, finance, logistics, billing and dispute management and influences important key performance indicators of the involved areas like "[[Free cash flow|free cash-flow]]", "[[customer satisfaction]]", "[[customer profitability]]", "fulfillment cost".

Some business suites offer a layer of deep industry processes - either through industry extensions of the core business suite or through a network of frequently certified 3rd party software providers which adopt compatible or identical process and data models.

===Current status===
Today, no commercial business suite can cover all business process requirements of a large organization. Modern business suites offer an environment in which an organization can develop or modify business processes reusing the supplied standard processes. Some advanced business suites allow the fast composition of new business processes from process fragments or process steps.

{{Accounting}}
'''Capital expenditure''' or '''capital expense''' ('''capex''' or '''CAPEX''') is the money a company spends to buy, maintain, or improve its fixed assets, such as buildings, vehicles, equipment, or land.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=capital expenditure (capex)|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/capital-expenditure-CAPEX.html|website=BusinessDictionary|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)?|url=http://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/capital-expenditure|website=My Accounting Course|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a capital expenditure when the asset is newly purchased or when money is used towards extending the useful life of an existing asset, such as repairing the roof.&lt;ref name=investopedia/&gt;

Capital expenditures contrast with [[operating expense]]s ('''opex'''), which are ongoing expenses that are inherent to the operation of the asset. Opex includes items like [[electricity]] or cleaning. The difference between opex and capex may not be immediately obvious for some expenses; for instance, repaving the parking lot may be thought of inherent to the operation of a [[shopping mall]]. The dividing line for items like these is that the expense is considered capex if the financial benefit of the expenditure extends beyond the current [[fiscal year]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.comindware.com/blog-what-is-capex-and-opex/ |title=What is CapEx and OpEx?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Capital expenditures are the funds used to acquire or upgrade a company's [[fixed asset]]s, such as expenditures towards property, plant, or equipment (PP&amp;E).&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Adam|title=Capital Expenditure (capex)|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=11 July 2017|date=18 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case when a capital expenditure constitutes a major financial decision for a company, the expenditure must be formalized at an annual shareholders meeting or a special meeting of the Board of Directors.  In [[accounting]], a capital expenditure is added to an asset account, thus increasing the asset's basis (the cost or value of an asset  adjusted for tax purposes). capex is commonly found on the [[cash flow statement]] under "Investment in Plant, Property, and Equipment" or something similar in the Investing subsection. An agile capital expenditure approval process and transparent operation expenditure management are keys to cost containment and optimization.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Accounting rules==
For tax purposes, capex is a cost that cannot be deducted in the year in which it is paid or incurred and must be capitalized. The general rule is that if the acquired property's useful life is longer than the taxable year, then the cost must be capitalized. The capital expenditure costs are then [[amortization (business)#Accounting|amortized]] or [[depreciation|depreciated]] over the life of the asset in question. Further to the above, capex creates or adds basis to the asset or property, which once adjusted, will determine tax liability in the event of sale or transfer. In the US, Internal Revenue Code §§263 and 263A deal extensively with capitalization requirements and exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Samuel A. Federal Income Taxation Of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials (2nd ed.). St. Paul: Thomson West, 2007. pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in capital expenditures are amounts spent on:
# acquiring fixed, and in some cases, intangible assets
# repairing an existing asset so as to improve its useful life
# upgrading an existing asset if it results in a superior fixture
# preparing an asset to be used in business
# restoring property or adapting it to a new or different use
# starting or acquiring a new business

An ongoing question for the accounting of any company is whether certain costs incurred should be ''capitalized'' or ''expensed''. Costs which are expensed in a particular month simply appear on the [[financial statement]] as a cost incurred that month. Costs that are capitalized, however, are amortized or depreciated over multiple years. Capitalized expenditures show up on the balance sheet. Most ordinary business costs are either expensable or capitalizable, but some costs could be treated either way, according to the preference of the company. [[Capitalized interest]] if applicable is also spread out over the life of the asset.

The counterpart of capital expenditure is [[operating expense]] or [[operational costs|operational cost]] (opex).

The '''Charles Egan Gallery''' opened at 63 East 57th Street ([[Manhattan]]) in about 1945, when Charles Egan was in his mid-30s. Egan's artists helped him fix up the gallery: "[[Isamu Noguchi]] did the lighting... [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]] painted the walls."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Stevens, Annalyn Swan, [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54817142 "De Kooning : an American master,"] (New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; 

A group show the next year included works by [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]], [[Joseph Stella]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[Georges Braque]]. 

== Timeline ==
In 1948, Charles Egan Gallery held a solo exhibition of de Kooning's black and white paintings. [[Irving Sandler]] wrote that because of this exhibition, "de Kooning was established as a major [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] ... soon to be the most influential artist of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1949 [[Joseph Cornell]] had his first show at the Charles Egan Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159592539{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]] had his first show at the Egan Gallery, where he continued to show until 1955.

In 1952 [[George McNeil (artist)|George McNeil]] had his first show at the Egan Gallery, and subsequent solo shows in 1953 and 1954, and where he continued to show until the mid-1950s. 

In 1954 [[Knox Martin]] had his first one-man show at the Charles Egan Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/09/16/archives/about-art-and-artists-knox-martin-impresses-in-first-oneman-show.html | work=The New York Times | title=About Art and Artists; Knox Martin Impresses in First One-Man Show  | date=September 16, 1954 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4169">[[Nitrogen]], as an element of great technical importance, can be produced in a '''cryogenic nitrogen plant''' with a purity of more than 99.9999%.
Air inside a distillation column is separated at cryogenic temperatures (about 100K/-173°C) to produce high purity nitrogen with 1ppm of impurities.
The process is based on the [[air separation]], which was invented by [[Carl von Linde|Dr. Carl von Linde]] in 1895.

==Purpose==
[[File:GAN1800.jpg|thumb|250px|Gaseous Nitrogen (GAN) plant with production rate of 800 Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hour]]
The main purpose of a cryogenic nitrogen plant is to provide a customer with high purity gaseous nitrogen (GAN). In addition [[liquid nitrogen]] (LIN) is produced simultaneously and is typically 10% of the gas production. High purity liquid nitrogen produced by cryogenic plants is stored in a local tank and used as a strategic reserve. This liquid can be vaporised to cover peaks in demand or for use when the nitrogen plant is offline.
Typical cryogenic nitrogen plants range from 250 Nm³/hour to very large range plants with a daily capacity of 63.000 tonnes of nitrogen a day (as the [[Cantarell Field]] plant in Mexico).

==Plant Modules==
A cryogenic nitrogen plant comprises:

===Warm End (W/E) Container===
*[[gas compressor|Compressor]]
*[[Air receiver]]
*Chiller ([[Heat exchanger]])
*Pre-filter
*[[Air purification unit]] (APU)

===Coldbox===
*Main heat exchanger
*[[Fractionating column|Distillation Column]]
*[[Condenser (heat transfer)|Condenser]]
*Expansion brake turbine

===Storage and Backup System===
*Liquid nitrogen tank
*Vapouriser

==How the plant works==
[[File:schemeGAN.jpg|thumb|650px| [[Process flow diagram|Flowsheet]] GAN Plant Linde Cryoplants Ltd.]]

===Warm end process===
[[Earth's atmosphere|Atmospheric air]] is roughly filtered and pressurised by a [[gas compressor|compressor]], which provides the product pressure to deliver to the customer. The amount of air sucked in depends on the customer’s nitrogen demand.

The Air Receiver collects condensate and minimises pressure drop. The dry and compressed air leaves the air to refrigerant [[heat exchanger]] at about 10°C.

To clean the process air further, there are different stages of [[filtration]]. First of all, more condensate is removed, this removes some [[hydrocarbon]]s.

The last [[unit process]] in the warm end container is the [[thermal swing adsorber]] (TSA). The Air purification unit cleans the compressed process air by removing any residual water vapour, [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrocarbons]]. It comprises two vessels, valves and exhaust to allow the changeover of vessels. While one of the TSA beds is on stream the second one is regenerated by the oxygen rich waste flow, which is vented through a silencer into the ambient environment.

===Coldbox process===
After leaving the air purification unit, the process air enters the main heat exchanger, where it is rapidly cooled down to -165°C. All residual [[impurities]] (e.g. [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) freeze out, and the process air enters at the bottom of the [[Fractionating column|distillation column]] partially liquefied.

===Back up process===
[[Liquid Nitrogen]] produced from the cold box transfers into the liquid [[storage tank]].  An ambient air vaporiser is used to vaporise stored liquid during peak demand. A pressure control panel senses the demand for gaseous nitrogen and regulates the gas flow into the end-users pipeline to maintain line pressure.

==Applications for high purity nitrogen production==
*[[Ammonia]] production for the [[fertilizer]] industry
*[[Float glass]] manufacture
*[[Petrochemical]]
**Purge gas
**Blanketing/Inerting gas for tanks and reactor vessels
**[[Amine]] gas treatment
**[[Bearing (mechanical)|Bearing]] seal gas
*[[Polyester]] manufacture
*[[Semiconductor]] manufacture
*[[Photovoltaic]] manufacture

==History==

DHA Suffa University was granted charter by the [[Government of Sindh]] in 2002. The university derives its name "Suffa" from the rectangular platform called [[Suffah]] in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]], where companions of [[Muhammad]] used to gather to seek knowledge. The construction of the present campus on 5 acres of land in DHA Phase VII (Ext) was started in 2004 and completed in 2007. The capacity of the campus is 2000 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsu.edu.pk/index.php/en/about-dha-suffa/about-dsu Official Website-DHA Suffa University]. Retrieved 4 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

DSU was recognized as a private sector degree awarding institution by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (HEC) in the year 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Pages/Sindh/DHA-Suffa-University.aspx|title=Universities|website=hec.gov.pk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In its very first participation in the annual ranking process of HEC for the year 2014, DSU achieved the impressive ranking of 31 out of 169 public and private sector universities of Pakistan.

The [[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]] (Mechanical) and [[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]] (Electrical) programs of DSU are accredited by the [[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pec.org.pk/schedule_first.aspx|title=Accredited Engg. Programmes in Pakistan(First Schedule)|website=www.pec.org.pk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] (Computer Science) program conforms to the standards of [[National Computing Education Accreditation Council]] (NCEAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nceac.org/UniversityInformation/UniversityRating|title=Accredited HEIs {{!}} NCEAC|website=www.nceac.org|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBA]] and [[MBA]] programs conform to the standards of [[National Business Education Accreditation Council]] (NBEAC).

The university has been inspected and evaluated by the Government of Sindh’s Charter Inspection and Evaluation Committee (CIEC) three tims in the last six years. On all occasions, the CIEC was pleased to see the rapid growth of the university and the high standards of education being maintained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5755">'''David Abraham Blech''' (born November 25, 1955) is an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]], [[investor]], and [[venture capitalist]]. He is one of the financial pioneers of the [[biotech]] industry and was once known as the "King of Biotech".

==Early life and education==
Blech graduated from [[Baruch College]] and earned a Master's in Music Education at the Teacher's College of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/06/19/72129/ | work=CNN | first=Gene | last=Bylinsky | title=WHAT A WAY TO START A COMPANY! A pharmaceuticals giant has put more than $70 million into Nova, a fledgling outfit that didn't even have a lab before it went public -- and still hasn't marketed a product | date=19 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Since 1980 Mr. Blech has been a founder of companies and venture capital investor in the biotechnology sector. His initial venture investment, Genetic Systems Corporation, which he helped found with his father and his brother Isaac Blech, was built around promising scientists, including the high profile microbiologist Robert Nowinski. It developed the first inexpensive and accurate test to diagnosis sexually-transmitted diseases using [[monoclonal antibodies]], allowing tens of thousands of babies to be born to women who otherwise would have become sterile from [[pelvic inflammatory disease]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifesciencesfoundation.org/events-Genetic_Systems_Inc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The company was sold to [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol Myers]] in 1986 for $294 million (3%) of Bristol Myers stock.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walters|first=Donna|title=Bristol-Myers Agrees to Buy Genetic Systems : Syntex Bought Out of Deal With Biotech Firm|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-04/business/fi-4255_1_genetic-systems|work=Bristol-Myers Agrees to Buy Genetic Systems : Syntex Bought Out of Deal With Biotech Firm|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 February 2012|date=4 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Blech co-founded [[Icos Corporation]] with Nowinski and George B. Rathmann, receiving the largest start up financing in biotech history at $33 million. Icos discovered the drug Cialis, which was acquired by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in 2003 for over $2.6 billion. The Blechs also co-founded [[Celgene]] Corporation in 1986, which was a unit of the [[Celanese Corporation]], and was spun off as an independent company following the merger of [[Celanese Corporation]] with American Hoechst Corporation. Celgene introduced two major cancer drugs, and has a current value of over $35 billion, making it the 5th largest biotech company in the world.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duff Wilson |author2=David Heath |title=He helped create the biotech boom and when it went bust so did he|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/uninformed_consent/financier/story1.html|work=Uninformed Consent|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies he helped found include [[DNA Plant Technology]], Neurogen Corporation, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, [[Alexion Pharmaceuticals]], [[ARIAD Pharmaceuticals|Ariad Pharmaceuticals]], [[Neurocrine Biosciences]], [[Cytosorbents]] Inc, and Intellect Neurosciences. He was also instrumental in the turnaround of Liposome Technology Inc. and Biotech General Corporation. In 1990 Mr. Blech founded D. Blech &amp; Company, which, until it ceased doing business in September 1994, was a registered broker-dealer involved in underwriting biotechnology issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=190504021&amp;targetid=profile&lt;/ref&gt;
At his peak in 1992, Blech's wealth was estimated at almost $300 million, briefly making him a member of the [[Forbes 400]].&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|author1=William P. Barrett |author2=Janet Novack |author3=Daniel Fisher |author4=Matthew Rand |title=And Starting to Bark|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0604/042.html|work=And Starting to Bark|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falling deep into debt, D. Blech &amp; Co was in violation of [[net capital rule]]s and ceased operations on September 22, 1994, a day that came to be known as "Blech Thursday" in the biotech industry.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times" /&gt;

Blech came under investigation by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] for [[securities fraud]]. During the investigation Lloyd Schwed, a Florida-based attorney representing a group of former brokers, attempted to blackmail Blech by promising to withhold tapes subpoenaed during the investigation. Blech became an informant in exchange for leniency. He pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal fraud and was sentenced to a five-year term of probation.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times" /&gt;

==Personal==
Blech says he is [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]], has a [[Behavioral addiction|gambling addiction]] and is a member of [[Gamblers Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/business/david-blech-a-biotech-king-dethroned.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Andrew | last=Pollack | title=A Biotech King, Dethroned | date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-02/david-blech-gets-four-years-for-manipulating-stock-prices.html | work=Bloomberg | title=David Blech Gets Four Years for Manipulating Stock Prices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1908 Trophy-winning performance ==

On Saturday, 29 February 1908, three [[Cadillac Model K|Model K]]s from the 1907 Cadillac production were released from the stock of the Anglo-American Motor-car Company, the UK agent for Cadillac automobiles,{{Sfn|Holland|1908b|p=7}} at the Heddon Street showroom in London (these were engines Nos. 23391, 24111 and 24118). The three cars, all registered in London under the numbers A2EO, A3EO and A4EO, were driven 25 miles to the [[Brooklands]] race track at Weybridge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, the cars completed ten laps of the track, or approximately 30&amp;nbsp;miles,{{Sfn|Holland|1908b|p=7}} before being locked away until Monday, 2 March 1908,{{Sfn|Holland|1908a|p=2}} when they were released and disassembled completely,{{Sfn|Holland|1908b|p=7}} using only wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, and pliers.{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} Each car was reduced to a pile of 721 component parts, which were then scrambled into one heap by the RAC.{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} Eighty-nine parts{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} requiring extreme accuracy were withdrawn from the heap, locked away at the Brooklands club house{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and replaced with new parts from Anglo-American's showroom stock. The parts were then sorted into three piles, each with all the parts needed to assemble a car.{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} A mechanic - Mr. E. O. Young - reassembled the cars with the help of his assistant - Mr. M. M. Gardner. Sometimes they had to work ankle-deep in water, using only wrenches and screwdrivers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The third car was re-assembled by Thursday morning, 12 March.{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}} With the painted parts on the original cars not being identical in color or style, the reassembled cars were mismatched in appearance, gaining the nickname "[[harlequin]] cars".{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}} By 2 p.m. on Friday 13 March{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} the three cars had completed the mandatory 500-mile run with singular regularity.{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}} Only one point was lost owing to a broken cotter pin in the ignition lever (promptly replaced from stock). During the event, it was reported that one of the sheds where the parts were stored became partly flooded during a heavy storm and some parts became rusted. Only oily rags could be used to remove all traces of the immersion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} On completion of the test, one of the cars was locked away until the start of the 2000-miles [[reliability trial]]s in June 1908.{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}}{{Sfn|Holland|1908d|p=9}} It came out the winner of the R.A.C.

== 1909 Trophy-winning performance ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=structure and citations|date=December 2017}}

&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daimler 1896 to 1946: 50 Years of the Daimler Company |author= St. John C. Nixon|year= 1946|publisher=G.T. Foulis &amp; Co.|pages=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the introduction of the sleeve-valve principle into the Daimler engine, the Daimler Company in 1909 asked the Royal Automobile Club to frame conditions of a test that should be of unprecedented severity and would demonstrate in the most public manner possible that the new Daimler engine was in every way reliable.

The two engines selected for this test were a 38 and a 22-h.p., having a bore and stroke, respectively, of 124 by 130&amp;nbsp;mm. and 96 by 130&amp;nbsp;mm. They were bolted down to the test bench close together in one of the large engine testing shops at the Daimler Works. The section of the shop in which they were placed was railed off and under the sole charge and observation of the R.A.C. officials from the start of the test to the finish. The observers kept watch day and night just as on board a ship, and periodically tested the revolution counters and spring balances to ensure that the engines were always running under full load. Every possible precaution was taken to keep constant and close observation upon the test, and there were never less than two observers on duty.

Both engines were started up at 6 a.m. on Monday, March 22, 1909, and each completed the 132 hours' bench test on the following Saturday evening. To appreciate more clearly the severity of the test, if the larger engine had been driving a car during the whole time, with the standard Daimler gear ratios, a distance of no less than 8,252 miles (13280&amp;nbsp;km) would have been covered, at a mean speed of 43.45 m.p.h. (69.92&amp;nbsp;km/h) while the smaller engine would have covered, similarly, a distance of 8,830 miles (14210&amp;nbsp;km) at 48.4 m.p.h. (77.9&amp;nbsp;km/h). The disparity in speed and distance between these results is, of course, attributable to the higher rate of revolutions of the smaller engine.

'''-- Details of the 38-H.P. Engine Test --'''

First Bench Test-

The speed of the engine was 1200 r.p.m. giving a limit of 50.0 h.p. below which the h.p. was at no time to fall.

The duration of the test was 5 days 14 hours 15 minutes or 134.25 hours.

There were no stops incurring any penalties.

There were five stops totalling 1 hour and 56 minutes which did not incur any penalty under Rule 6 (2)

The load was eased for a total of 19 minutes for brake adjustments, but the engine was not stopped.
Average horse-power recorded, 54.3.

Petrol consumed, 614 gallons equal to .679 pints per horse-power hour.

Running Test

On completion of the first test, the engine was removed from the bench and fitted under observation to the chassis without any vital parts being disturbed. A standard type four-seater body was fitted and the car proceeded from Coventry to Weybridge - 112 miles (180.2&amp;nbsp;km). The average weight of the car and passengers on the road was 4,085&amp;nbsp;lbs = 1 ton 16 cwt 1 qr 25&amp;nbsp;lbs (1852.9&amp;nbsp;kg).

The runs on Brooklands track amounted to 1,930.5 miles (3106.8&amp;nbsp;km)at an average speed of 42.4&amp;nbsp;mph (68.2&amp;nbsp;km/h) with an average weight of car and passengers of 3,805&amp;nbsp;lb (1726&amp;nbsp;kg). A distance of 5 miles was traversed in running to and from the car-headquarters and the track, and this with the return journey to Coventry made a total mileage of 2,159.5 (3474.5&amp;nbsp;km).

The petrol consumption on the track was equal to 20.57 m.p.g. and on the road 19.48 m.p.g.
The ton-miles per gallon of fuel were 34.94 on the track and 35.97 on the road.

Final Bench Test

On arrival in Coventry, the engine was replaced on the test bench and run for 5 hours 15 minutes during which there were no stoppages of any description; the load was eased for 15 minutes for brake adjustments.

Average horse-power recorded, 57.25.

Petrol consumed, 22.5 gallons = .599 pints per horse-power hour.

The judges append the following remarks to their certificate:
"The engine was completely dismantled, and no perceptible wear was noticeable on any of the fitted surfaces.
The cylinders and pistons were found to be notably clean.
The only perceptible wear in any part was caused by two joint pins rubbing against adjacent parts.
The ports of the valves showed no burning or wear."

'''Di Blasi Industriale''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] manufacturer of [[folding bicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s, and [[moped]]s, based in [[Francofonte]], [[Sicily]]. The company's products are suitable for being transported by car, boat, or airplane, and are designed and manufactured entirely in-house.

== History ==
[[Image:DIBLA7 Salone Automobile Torino 1968.jpg|thumb|240px|DIBLA7 at the 1968 Turin Auto Show]]

The founder of the company, Rosario Di Blasi, began development of a folding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] in 1952, which by 1968 had evolved into a Zanetti-powered folding tricycle called the DIBLA 7 that was shown at the [[Turin Auto Show]] as a prototype. Finally in 1974 Di Blasi began production of a folding moped with a Franco Morini motor and single-speed transmission called the R2 (also known as the "Paperino"). In 1979 the model R7 replaced the R2 and featured an engine of Di Blasi's own design as well as a multi-speed transmission. This moped has been continuously improved and is still in production as the R7E. It has been used by the [[Polizia Stradale]], the Traffic Police division of the [[Polizia di Stato|Italian National Police]], aboard their helicopters.&lt;ref name="diblasi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diblasi.it/Storia.asp?Lng=en |title=The story of our company |publisher=Diblasi.it |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diblasi.it/Img/?Files=R7_Pol |title=Ciclomotori pieghevoli, Tricicli pieghevoli e Biciclette pieghevoli Di Blasi: Foto |publisher=Diblasi.it |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R7 is sold by Di Blasi of America as the "Express."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diblasi.com/home.htm |title=Di Blasi Of America - Folding Motorcycle Motor Bike Minibike Motorbike Moped Collapsible Motorscooter Portable Scooter Mini-Bikes Mini Bike Private Pilots Boats Sailing Recreation Tourists Accessories Travel Airplanes Alternate Transportation Vehicle Planes Airplanes Rv Recreational Vehicle |publisher=Diblasi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used worldwide by a number of different "chauffeur" companies, who will drive it to meet the customer, fold it up and put it in the trunk of their car, and drive the customer wherever they need to go, such as home from a bar or party. One such company, Superbob, serves part of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superbob.nl/?show=home&amp;lan=en |title=Superbob Chauffeursdiensten |publisher=Superbob.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern US, [[Zingo Transportation]] provides this service. In Australia the Di Blasi R7 has been imported, sold and run as part of their designated chauffeur service by [http://www.scoot2you.com/franchise.htm Scoot2you Personal Chauffeurs] originally on the Gold Coast and then in Brisbane and Melbourne and shortly in Sydney as part of their growing Franchise.

Also in 1974, the company introduced a folding bicycle called the Avia. The model Avia is notable for having featured the first folding pedals ever developed.&lt;ref name="diblasi1"/&gt; The Avia evolved into the model R20 (1980), R50 (1984), R6 (1991), R4 (1995), R5, R21 (20-inch wheels), R24, and the R22. This bicycle series has characteristically been one of the most compact and easily  folding bicycles on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/03/di_blasi_r24_fo.php |title=Di Blasi R24 Folding Bike |publisher=TreeHugger |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atob.org.uk/Buyers'_Guide.html#DiBlasi |title=Folding Bike Buyer’s Guide UK |publisher=Atob.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also produced folding pedal tricycles since 2000: the R31, R32, and R34.

'''Egyptian National Railways''' ('''ENR'''; {{lang-ar|السكك الحديدية المصرية}} ''Al-Sikak al-Ḥadīdiyyah al-Miṣriyyah'') is the national [[railway]] of [[Egypt]] and managed by the [[parastatal]] '''Egyptian Railway Authority''' ('''ERA'''; {{lang-ar|الهيئة القومية لسكك حديد مصر}} ''Al-Haī'ah al-Qawmiyya li-Sikak Ḥadīd Miṣr'', literally, "National Agency for Egypt's Railways").

==History==
===1833–77===
[[Image:Robertstephenson.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Stephenson]] (1803–59) was the engineer of Egypt's first railway]]
In 1833, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] [[Pasha]] considered building a railway between [[Suez]] and [[Cairo]] to improve transit between Europe and India. Muhammad Ali had proceeded to buy the rail when the project was abandoned due to pressure by the French who had an interest in building a canal instead.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
[[File:Proposed railway from Cairo to the Sea of Suez by C.F. Cheffins, 1840s.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed railway from Cairo to the Sea of Suez by [[C.F. Cheffins]], 1840s]]
In 1848, Muhammad Ali died, and in 1851 his successor [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] contracted [[Robert Stephenson]] to build Egypt's first [[standard gauge]] railway. The first section, between [[Alexandria]] on the Mediterranean coast and [[Kafr el-Zayyat]] on the [[Nile Delta#Geography|Rosetta branch of the Nile]] was opened in 1854.&lt;ref name=Hughes12&gt;Hughes, 1981, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first railway in the [[Ottoman Empire]] as well as [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Egy_SecondRailway"&gt;{{cite news|last=Raafat |first=Jordan |publisher=Jordan Star |date=1998-03-05 |url=http://www.egy.com/community/98-03-05.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-18 |title=Desert Train Heralds Train Tourism In Egypt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207064829/http://www.egy.com/community/98-03-05.shtml |archivedate=December 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Abbas died and was succeeded by [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]], in whose reign the section between Kafr el-Zayyat and [[Cairo]] was completed in 1856 followed by an extension from Cairo to [[Suez]] in 1858.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; This completed the first modern transport link between the Mediterranean and the [[Indian Ocean]], as [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] did not complete the [[Suez Canal]] until 1869.

[[Image:ModernEgypt, Prince Ahmed Rifaat Pasha, PRS 2030 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ahmad Rifaat Pasha]] (1825–63) drowned when his train fell off a [[car float]] into the Nile]]
At Kafr el-Zayyat the line between Cairo and Alexandria originally crossed the Nile with an {{convert|80|ft|m}} [[car float]].&lt;ref name=Hughes17&gt;Hughes, 1981, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 May 1858 a special train conveying Sa'id's [[heir presumptive]] [[Ahmad Rifaat Pasha]] fell off the float into the river and the prince was drowned.&lt;ref name=Hughes17/&gt; Stephenson therefore replaced the car float with a [[swing bridge]] nearly {{convert|500|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name=Hughes17/&gt; By the end of Sa'id's reign branches had been completed from [[Banha]] to [[Zagazig]] on the [[Nile Delta#Geography|Damietta branch of the Nile]] in 1860, to [[Mit Bera]] in 1861 and from [[Tanta]] to [[Talkha]] further down the Damietta Nile in 1863.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt;

Sa'id's successor [[Isma'il Pasha]] strove to modernise Egypt and added momentum to railway development. In 1865 a new branch reached [[Desouk]] on the Rosetta Nile and a second route between Cairo and Talkha was opened, giving a more direct link between Cairo and Zagazig.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; The following year a branch southwards from Tanta reached [[Shibin El Kom]].&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; The network started to push southwards along the west side of the Nile with the opening of the line between [[Imbaba]] near Cairo and [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] in 1867.&lt;ref name=Hughes15&gt;Hughes, 1981, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; A short branch to [[Faiyum]] was added in 1868.&lt;ref name=Hughes15/&gt; A line between Zagazig and Suez via [[Nifisha]] was completed in the same year.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; The following year the line to Talkha was extended to Damietta on the Mediterranean coast and a branch opened to [[Salhiya]] and [[Sama'ana]].&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt;

Imbaba had no rail bridge across the Nile to Cairo until 1891.&lt;ref name=Hughes17/&gt; However, a long line between there and a junction west of Kafr el-Zayyat opened in 1872, linking Imbaba with the national network.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; From Minya the line southwards made slower progress, reaching [[Mallawi]] in 1870 and [[Assiut]] in 1874.&lt;ref name=Hughes15/&gt; On the west bank till Najee Hammady from which goes on east bank of the Nile till Aswan. A shorter line southwards linked Cairo with [[Tura, Egypt|Tura]] in 1872 and was extended to [[Helwan]] in 1875.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; In the Nile Delta the same year a short branch reached [[Kafr el-Sheikh]] and in 1876 a line along the Mediterranean coast linking the termini at Alexandra and Rosetta was completed.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt;

===1877–88===
By 1877, Egypt had a network of key main lines and the Nile Delta had quite a network, but with this and other development investments, Isma'il had gotten the country deeply into debt. For its first 25 years of operation Egypt's national railway had never even produced an annual report.&lt;ref name=Hughes13&gt;Hughes, 1981, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; A Council of Administration with Egyptian, British and French members was appointed in 1877 to put the railway's affairs in order. They published its first annual report in 1879,&lt;ref name=Hughes13/&gt; and in the same year, the British Government had Isma'il Pasha deposed, exiled and replaced with his son [[Tewfik Pasha]].  In 1882, the British essentially [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|invaded and occupied Egypt]].

With these developments, the Egyptian Railway Administration's rail network stagnated until 1888, but it also put its management in much better order.&lt;ref name=Hughes13/&gt; In 1883 the ERA appointed Frederick Harvey Trevithick, nephew of [[Francis Trevithick]], as Chief Mechanical Engineer.&lt;ref name=Hughes32&gt;Hughes, 1981, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; Trevithick found a heterogeneous fleet of up to 246 [[steam locomotive]]s of many different designs from very different builders in England, Scotland, France and the USA.&lt;ref name=Hughes32/&gt; This lack of standardisation of locomotives or components complicated both locomotive maintenance and general railway operation.&lt;ref name=Hughes32/&gt;

From 1877 to 1888, the ERA struggled to keep up with even basic maintenance&lt;ref name=Hughes13/&gt; but by 1887 Trevithick managed to start a programme to renew 85 of the very mixed fleet of locomotives with new boilers, cylinders and motion.&lt;ref name=Hughes32/&gt; The others he started to replace with four standard locomotive types introduced from 1889 onwards: one class of [[0-6-0]] for freight, one class of [[2-4-0]] for mixed traffic, one 0-6-0T [[tank locomotive]] for [[shunt (rail)|shunting]] and one class of only ten [[2-2-2]] locomotives for express passenger trains.&lt;ref name=Hughes32/&gt; Trevithick ensured that these four classes shared as many common components as possible, which simplified maintenance and reduced costs still further.&lt;ref name=Hughes32/&gt;

===1888–1914===

By 1888, the ERA was in better order and could resume expanding its network. In 1890 a second line between Cairo and Tura opened.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; On 15 May 1892 the [[Imbaba Bridge]] was built across the Nile, linking Cairo with the line south following the west bank of the river.&lt;ref name=Hughes17/&gt; The civil engineer for the bridge was [[Gustave Eiffel]]. (It was reformed and renewed in 1924 which is still the only railway bridge across the Nile in Cairo.){{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Cairo's main [[Ramses Station|Misr Station]] was rebuilt in 1892. The line south was extended further upriver from Assiut reaching [[Girga]] in 1892, [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1896, [[Qena]] in 1897 and [[Luxor]] and [[Aswan]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=Hughes15/&gt;  With the railroad's completion, construction began the same year on the [[Aswan Low Dam|first Aswan Dam]] and the [[Assiut Barrage]], main elements of a plan initiated in 1890 by the government&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Peel]], [http://www.electronicsudan.com/cgi-bin/sdb/2bb.cgi?seq=print&amp;board=200&amp;msg=1242047480&amp;rn=3 The Binding of the Nile and the New Soudan]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Oxford, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; to modernize and more fully develop Egypt's existing irrigated agriculture, export potential, and ability to repay debts to European creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald Bloche, [http://www.univie.ac.at/colonial-development/docs/Programme%20Workshop%20Developing%20Africa.pdf Constructing Modern Egypt:Modernization and Development Discourses in the Context of British and Egyptian Water Engineering], p.6-7 (Abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Railway System of Egypt.jpg|thumb|Map from "Egypt &amp; how to see it"]]

In the north in 1891, a link line was opened between Damanhur and Desouk.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; The line to Shibin El Kom was extended south to [[Minuf]] in the same year and reached [[Ashum]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; By then a line across the Nile Delta from a junction north of Talkha on the line to Damietta had reached [[Biyala]].&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; By 1898 this reached Kafr el-Sheikh, completing a more direct route between Damietta and Alexandria.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; An important extension along the west bank of the Suez Canal linking Nifisha with [[Ismaïlia]], [[Al Qantarah El Sharqiyya|Al Qantarah]] West and [[Port Said]] was completed in 1904.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt; Thereafter network expansion was slower but two short link lines north of Cairo were completed in 1911 followed by a link between Zagazig and Zifta in 1914.&lt;ref name=Hughes12/&gt;

===Sinai===
The first [[El Ferdan Railway Bridge]] over the [[Suez Canal]] was completed in April 1918 for the [[Palestine Railways#Palestine Military Railway|Palestine Military Railway]].&lt;ref name="Hughes17" /&gt; It was considered a hindrance to shipping so after the [[World War I|First World War]] it was removed.&lt;ref name=Hughes17/&gt; During the [[World War II|Second World War]] a steel swing bridge was built in 1942 but this was damaged by a steamship and removed in 1947.&lt;ref name=Hughes17/&gt; A double swing bridge was completed in 1954 but the [[Suez Crisis|1956 Israeli invasion of Sinai]] severed rail traffic across the canal for a third time.&lt;ref name=Hughes17/&gt; A replacement bridge was completed in 1963&lt;ref name=Structurae&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0002510 |title=El Ferdan Swing Bridge |author= |date=1998–2011 |work=Structurae |publisher=Nicolas Janberg Internet Content Services |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but destroyed in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. A new double swing bridge was completed in 2001 and is the largest swing bridge in the World.&lt;ref name=Structurae/&gt; However, the construction of the [[New Suez Canal]] has since disconnected the Sinai from the rest of Egypt’s rail network again. Instead of the bridge, two rail tunnels are planned under the canal, one near Ismailia and one in Port Said.

Historically, the [[Palestine Railways]] main line linked [[Al Qantarah El Sharqiyya|Al Qantarah]] East with [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Lebanon]]. It was built in three phases during the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] [[World War]]s. Commenced in 1916, it was extended to [[Rafah]] on the border with [[Palestine (region)#Ottoman rule (1841–1917)|Palestine]] as part of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]]'s [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The route was extended through to [[Haifa]] in [[Mandate Palestine]] after World War I, to [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] in 1942 and became a vital part of the wartime supply route for Egypt.

As a result of the 1946–48 [[Israel War of Independence|Israeli War of Independence]] and subsequent [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] the Palestine Railways main line was severed at the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice Line]]. The 1956 Israeli invasion severed Sinai's rail link with the rest of Egypt was reconnected its rail link with Israel. Israel captured a [[Egyptian Republic Railways 4211 class|4211 class]] 0-6-0 [[Switcher#Diesel|diesel shunting locomotive]] and five [[Egyptian State Railways 545 class|545 class]] [[2-6-0]] steam locomotives.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, 1984, page 137&lt;/ref&gt; Israel also captured rolling stock including a six-wheel coach dating from 1893 and a 30-ton [[steam crane]] built in 1950, both of which Israel Railways then appropriated into its breakdown fleet.&lt;ref name=gallery&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rail.co.il/EN/Fun/Museum/Pages/gallery.aspx |title=Gallery |author= |date= |work=Fun |publisher=Israel Railways |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619041704/http://rail.co.il/EN/Fun/Museum/Pages/gallery.aspx |archivedate=2012-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being forced to withdraw from Sinai in March 1957, Israel systematically destroyed infrastructure including the railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |authorlink=Noam Chomsky |title=The Fateful Triangle |location=New York |publisher=[[South End Press]] |year=1983 |isbn= 0-89608-187-7 |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963 the railway in Sinai was reconnected to the rest of Egypt but remained disconnected from Israel.

In the [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]], Israel captured more Egyptian railway equipment including one [[EMD G8]], four [[EMD G12]] and three [[EMD G16]] diesel locomotives&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, 1984, page 136&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were appropriated into Israel Railways stock. After 1967 Israel again destroyed the railway across occupied Sinai and this time used the materials in the construction of the [[Bar Lev Line]] of fortifications along the Suez Canal.

After numerous years' service on Israel Railways the 30-ton crane, 1893 Belgian 6-wheel coach and one of the EMD G16 diesels are all preserved in the [[Israel Railway Museum]] in Haifa.&lt;ref name=gallery/&gt;

===Museum===
Egypt's railway museum was built in 1932 next to Misr Station (now [[Ramses Station]]) in Cairo.&lt;ref name=Hughes15/&gt;&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egyptrail.gov.eg/docs/museum/museum.html |title=Welcome to the ENR Museum Page |year=2010 |work=Egyptian National Railways |publisher=Egyptian National Railways |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707210352/http://www.egyptrail.gov.eg/docs/museum/museum.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum opened in January 1933 to mark the city's hosting of the International Railway Congress.&lt;ref name=Hughes15/&gt;&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Its stock of over 700 items&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; includes models, historic drawings and photographs.&lt;ref name=Hughes15/&gt; Among its most prominent exhibits are three preserved steam locomotives:

*[[4-4-2 (locomotive)|4-4-2]] no. 194 (originally 678) built by the North British Locomotive Company in 1905&lt;ref name=Proud7/&gt;

==Operations==
In 2005 ENR operated {{convert|5063|km|mi}} of [[standard gauge]] {{RailGauge|1435mm}} track. Most of the rail system is focused on the Nile delta with lines essentially fanning out from Cairo. In addition, there is a line to the west along the coast that eventually could link to [[Libya]] as it did during [[World War II]]. From Cairo goes a major line south along the east bank of the Nile to [[Aswan]] ([[Sellel]]) in Upper Egypt. Neighboring [[Israel]] uses the same standard gauge but has been disconnected since 1948.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html#Trans |title=CIA World Factbook |accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the South the railway system of [[Sudan]] operates on a narrow gauge and is reached after using the ferry past the Aswan dam. Rail service is a critical part of the transportation infrastructure of Egypt but of limited service for transit. {{convert|63|km|mi}} of the network is electrified, namely commuter lines between Cairo-[[Helwan]] and Cairo-[[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]].&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;

ENR buys locomotives and rail abroad but passenger coaches are built and refurbished in Egypt by the ''Société Générale Egyptienne de Matériel de Chemins de Fer'' (SEMAF).&lt;ref name="strategy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr108360e.html |title=Strategies to improve safety |accessdate=2006-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910012219/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr108360e.html |archive-date=2006-09-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cargo volume transported by ENR is about 12 million tons{{which|date=May 2011}} annually.&lt;ref name="strategy"/&gt;

Services were severely disrupted during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|political protests]] in early 2011; operating hours of the [[Cairo Metro]] were shortened to comply with the [[curfew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2011/02/egypt%e2%80%99s-train-running-again/ |accessdate=2011-02-19 |title=Egypt's Train Running Again |publisher=Railways Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2015 Egyptian National Railways signed a €100&amp;nbsp;million contract with [[Alstom]] to supply signalling equipment for the 240&amp;nbsp;km Beni Suef-Asyut line and maintain services for five years. Also, Alstom will provide [[Interlocking|smartlock electronic interlocking system]] to replace the existing electromechanical system, which in turn will increase the number of trains that operate on the route by more than 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alstom wins €100m Egyptian signalling contract|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single-view/view/alstom-wins-EUR100m-egyptian-signalling-contract.html|website=Railway Gazette|accessdate=9 February 2015|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alstom to deliver signalling equipment for Egyptian Railway|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsalstom-to-deliver-signalling-equipment-for-egyptian-railway-4492543|website=railway-technology|publisher=Kable|accessdate=9 February 2015|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ER is the backbone of passenger transportation in Egypt with 800 million passenger miles annually.&lt;ref name="strategy"/&gt; Air-conditioned passenger trains usually have 1st and 2nd class service, while non-airconditioned trains have  2nd and 3rd class. Most of the network connects the densely populated area of the [[Nile delta]] with Cairo and Alexandria as hubs. Train fares in commuter trains and 3rd class passenger trains are kept low as a social service.

There are large volumes of tourist traffic during [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]; this causes problems due to a shortage of rolling stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/egypt%e2%80%99s-limit-for-eid-is-14-extra-trains/|accessdate=2010-11-14|title=EGYPT’S LIMIT FOR EID IS 14 EXTRA TRAINS | publisher= Railways Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleeper trains==
The Alexandria–Cairo–Luxor–Aswan route is served daily in both directions by air-conditioned sleeper trains of Abela Egypt.&lt;ref name="abela"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sleepingtrains.com/ |title=Abela sleeper trains |accessdate=2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service is especially attractive to [[tourist]]s who can spend the night on the train as it covers the stretch between Cairo and Luxor. A luxury express train also links Cairo with [[Marsa Matruh]] towards the Libyan border.

==Locomotives==
===Current===
The vast majority of ENR locomotives are [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]]. These include:

== Problems ==
The debacle of the [[2002 Al Ayyat railway accident]] showed significant deficiencies in the status and maintenance of the equipment. In the aftermath, the ERA initiated a program to update equipment and improve safety.&lt;ref name="strategy"/&gt; While some services have been privatized (i.e. food service, sleeper trains), ENR is considering further steps in privatization to increase efficiency and improve service. In addition, ENR has dormant real estate holding that it plans to utilize in a more profitable way.

The 2006 [[Qalyoub train collision]] led to further criticism of the management of the ENR raising issues of underfunding and corruption.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=105&amp;sid=887646| title=Egypt's Minister Admits Railway Problems| accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the ERA, Hanafy Abdel-Qawi, was dismissed one day after the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2718| title=National Rail Head fired over Train Tragedy| publisher=The Daily Star| location=Egypt| date=2006-08-23| accessdate=2006-08-30| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305035352/http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2718| archive-date=2008-03-05| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the accidents an investment programme was launched in 2007 with the aim of modernising the rail network and improving safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//egyptian-investment-will-raise-safety-standards.html| title=Egyptian investment will raise safety standards| publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]| date=August 2007| accessdate=2007-08-30| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201103648/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/egyptian-investment-will-raise-safety-standards.html| archive-date=2011-02-01| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrow Gauge ==
[[Image:Luxor west bank1.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Police post with public fountain and railway used for sugar cane.|Sugar cane railway by a police post.]]
There is a modest network of narrow gauge railways at [[Kurna]] (the west Nile bank opposite [[Luxor]]). This has a gauge of approximately {{RailGauge|2ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] and is used for transporting sugar cane. A smaller network of the same gauge and for the same purpose exists on the east bank, around the southern outskirts of Luxor.

Haulage is by diesel locomotive. Rolling stock includes rakes of bogie bolsters, typically seen loaded high up with sugar cane crop.

'''Electronic billing''' or '''electronic bill payment and presentment''', is when a [[seller]] such as company, organization, or group sends its bills or [[invoice]]s over the [[internet]], and customers [[electronic bill payment|pay the bills electronically]].&lt;ref name="What is Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/EBPP.html|title=What is EBPP (electronic bill presentment and payment)?|publisher=webopedia.com|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This replaces the traditional method where invoices were sent in paper form and payments were done by manual means such as sending [[cheques]].

There are a number of advantages to electronic billing that include the faster presentation of invoices and reductions in costs in handling paper document.  However to take full advantage of electronic billing both seller and buyer need to have in place computer systems able to handle electronic billing and have access to financial institutions that can do [[electronic payment]]s.

==History==
The development of electronic billing and payments started in late 20th century, and went hand in hand with development of [[internet banking]], introduction of [[accounting software]] and widespread use of the [[email]].

In the United States, the Council for Electronic Billing and Payment of the [[National Automated Clearing House Association]] (NACHA) is credited with broadly promoting and communicating various forms of electronic billing in the early 2000s. NACHA promoted activities and initiatives that facilitated the adoption of electronic payments in the areas of Internet commerce, electronic bill payment and presentment, financial [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), international payments, electronic checks, [[Electronic Benefit Transfer|electronic benefits transfer]] (EBT) and student lending. Certain electronic billing applications also provide the ability to electronically settle payment for goods or services.

==Different types==
* Biller-direct - This refers to an approach in which consumers make payments directly to one biller that issues bills that they receive at the website of the firm that issued the bill. An example would be of a [[public utility]] company offering this payment service to its consumers.  A market has emerged for outsourced billing providers who specialize in electronic billing processes and technology for companies that need to send bills directly to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aitegroup.com/report/biller-direct-and-walk-bill-pay-update Aite Group independent research firm report on biller-direct vendors by Gwenn Bezard. August 29, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Bank-aggregator - The approach under this model is to make payment at an aggregator or consolidator site, usually from a consumer's [[online banking|bank’s website]]. This model allows the consumer to make payments to multiple billers that are pre-registered to receive payments. An example in the UK is [[OneVu]] or [https://www.e-bill.ch/en/E-bill-Receive-check-and-pay-bills-in-your-e-banking-system-108.html%20eBills eBills] in Switzerland..

==Parties involved==
Billers, bankers, aggregators and consolidators can play various roles in the overall process. Once roles are defined, it is easier to identify which model is most appropriate for the client's strategy. Billers may also implement more than one model in order to best serve their clients. Because the industry is continuously changing and redefining, the options and opportunities will continue to expand.

*Biller payment provider (BPP) - An agent of the biller that accepts remittance information on behalf of the Biller. 
*Biller service provider (BSP) - An agent of the biller that provides the service for the Biller. 
*Consolidator - A biller service provider that consolidates bills from multiple Billers or other bill service providers (BSPs) and delivers them for presentment to the customer service provider (CSP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisolutionswiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Internet_Banking_Systems_Vendors#Bill_Payment_&amp;_Presentment_Vendors Information on several solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Customer service provider (CSP) – An agent of the customer that provides an interface directly to customers, businesses or others for bill presentment. CSP enrolls customers, enables presentment and provides customer care, among other functions.

== Slow development due to legacy systems ==
In developed countries existing legacy banking systems and rules has slowed down the development of electronic billing.  For example in the United States financial institutions typically formally prohibit the use of their consumer electronic bill payment systems for payments to certain agencies such as: collection agencies, or recipients of court-ordered payments like child support or alimony. Any organizations or individuals outside of the United States are also usually excluded. Payments to government agencies for utilities such as water are usually permitted.

Electronic bill pay systems fall into two categories, "pay-anyone" services and restricted biller list services.  In a pay-anyone service, the provider will facilitate a payment to the payee regardless of whether they have an electronic connection with that payee or not.  If they cannot deliver the payment to the payee electronically, they will print and mail a paper check on the payer's behalf.  The largest providers of electronic bill pay services can deliver about 80% of their payments electronically, so 20% of payments facilitated by the large pay-anyone services are still made by mailing a paper check to the biller.  This is the primary reason why some billers in a pay-anyone service require as much as a 5-day lead time for the payment to reach the payee.

Restricted biller list payment services allow you to pay any biller that is in the provider's network, and in these services where the provider has an electronic relationship with the biller, the payments will be delivered electronically.

Forte Oil also has a subsidiary, which specializes in the supply of Well Production [[Chemicals]] and Drilling/Completion Fluids to the Upstream Sector of the Oil and Gas Industry. It continues to pursue aggressive diversification into related high margin businesses, a strategy that has been buoyed by the recent acquisition of the 414 megawatts (MW) Geregu Power Generation Plant located in [[Kogi]] State of [[Nigeria]] in a government-led privatisation of power assets. However, A major overhaul of the plant commenced in 2015 and was completed in 2016, increasing the combined capacity to 435MW.

The Company has introduced a digital platform to enhance the customer's experience with the development of an e-commerce site (www.foquick.com), the implementation of a mobile application (FO App) and the modification of the FO advantage card under the customer loyalty and reward program. All aimed at ensuring prompt, reliable and convenient customer service experience. The Company also provides FO Gas (bulk &amp; retail) FO Gas cylinder and FO Solar home solutions.

==History==
Forte Oil PLC (formerly African Petroleum) was incorporated on December 11, 1964. After 14 years in operation, the company changed its status from a private limited liability company to a public liability company. In compliance with the provisions of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree of 1977, 40% of the company’s shares were sold to Nigerians and a year later, 60% was acquired by the Federal Government of Nigeria in favour of the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]] (NNPC) from [[British Petroleum]]. In November 1979 its name was changed to African Petroleum PLC. NNPC’s stake in AP was reduced by 20% in March 1989 after the Federal Government sold the above percentage to Nigerian Citizens, increasing their stake from 40% to 60%. In the year 2000, the Federal Government under its [[privatization]] programme divested its remaining 40% to core investors and interested Nigerians.

In May 2007, the shareholding structure took another dimension as Incorporated Trustees of NNPC’s [[Pension Fund]] divested its stake to Zenon Petroleum &amp; Gas Limited, owned by [[Femi Otedola]], making it the majority shareholder in the company. As a result, Mr. Otedola and his affiliated entities became the core investor in the company.

Under the new management, African Petroleum embarked on a rebranding and restructuring programme which led to a name change to Forte Oil PLC in December, 2010, and a rebranding of the retail outlets spread across the across the country.

In 2013 the company purchased a controlling stake in the 414 MW Geregu Power plant under a government-led privatisation programme in the power industry under the leadership of [[Goodluck Jonathan]]. Geregu Power Plant was commissioned in 2007 with three Siemens V94.2 open cycle gas turbine power generation units, namely GT11, GT12, and GT13, with an initial combined installed capacity of 414MW. A major overhaul of the plant commenced in 2015 and was completed in 2016, increasing the combined capacity to 435MW.

In 2015 they signed an $83 million contract with Siemens to upgrade the 414 MW plant, the work is due to be completed in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2015/06/30/nigerian-billionaire-femi-otedolas-forte-oil-signs-83-million-contract-with-siemens/|title=Nigerian Billionaire Femi Otedola's Forte Oil Signs $83 Million Contract With Siemens|last=Nsehe|first=Mfonobong|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung''''' ({{IPA-de|gəˈzɛlʃaft mɪt bəˈʃʁɛŋktɐ ˈhaftʊŋ|}}, abbreviated '''GmbH''' {{IPA-de|geː ʔɛm beː haː|}} and also '''GesmbH''' in Austria) is a type of [[Juristic person|legal entity]] very common in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] (where it is equivalent to a [[société à responsabilité limitée]]) and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is an entity broadly equivalent with the [[private limited company]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, and the [[limited liability company]] (LLC) in the United States. The name of the GmbH form emphasizes the fact that the owners (''Gesellschafter'', also known as members&lt;!-- Note: Gesellschafter should rather be translated as member (as used in LLC), since shareholder is reserved for stock corporation. --&gt;) of the entity are not personally liable or credible for the company's debts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/bundesrecht RIS - Bundesrecht konsolidiert - Suche]. Ris.bka.gv.at. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gmbhg GmbHG - nichtamtliches Inhaltsverzeichnis]. Bundesrecht.juris.de. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''GmbH''s are considered [[legal person]]s under German, Swiss and Austrian law. Other variations include '''mbH''' (used when the term ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' is part of the company name itself), and '''gGmbH''' (''gemeinnützige'' GmbH) for [[non-profit]] companies.

The GmbH has become the most common corporation form in Germany, since the AG (''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]''), the other major company form corresponding to a stock corporation, was much more complicated to form and operate until recently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ViuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=9041124446&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=kxV-Trn4B8jHsgag24UL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA Müller, Klaus J. ''The GmbH: a guide to the German limited liability company''] Beck, 2006 {{ISBN|978-90-411-2444-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr-lawfirm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Aufsaetze/Doin_Business_in_Germany.pdf Rutow, Lange ''Doing Business in Germany''] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The laws governing this type of legal entity were adopted in Germany in 1892, and in Austria in 1906. The concept of limited liability created by these laws inspired the legal establishment of the [[limited liability company]] form in other countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate = 2001-06-04
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the concept of a limited liability company already existed in the United Kingdom.

==Requirements of formation==

It is widely accepted that a GmbH is formed in three stages: the founding association, which is regarded as a private partnership with full liability of the founding partners/members; the founded company (often styled as "GmbH i.G.", with "i.G." standing for ''in Gründung'' – literally "in the founding stages", with the meaning of "registration pending"); and finally the fully registered GmbH. Only the registration of the company in the Commercial Register (''[[German Trade Register|Handelsregister]]'') provides the GmbH with its full legal status.

The founding act and the articles of association have to be [[Civil law notary|notarized]]. The GmbH law outlines the minimum content of the articles of association, but it is quite common to have a wide range of additional rules in the articles.

Under German law, the GmbH must have a minimum founding capital of €25,000 (§ 5 I GmbHG), from which €12,500 have to be raised before registering in the commercial register (§ 7 II GmbHG). A supervisory board (''Aufsichtsrat'') is required if the company has more than 500 employees, otherwise, the company is run only by the managing directors (''Geschäftsführer'') who have the unrestricted proxy for the company. The members acting collectively may restrict the powers of the managing directors by giving them binding orders. In most cases, the articles of the association list the business activities for which the directors must obtain prior consent from the members. Under German law, a violation of these duties by a managing director will not affect the validity of a contract with a third party, but the GmbH may hold the managing director in question liable for damages.

As of 2008, a derivate form called '''[[Entrepreneurial company (Germany)|Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)]]''' (English: "entrepreneurial company (limited liability)") or short  '''UG (haftungsbeschränkt)''' was introduced. It does not require a minimum founding capital and was introduced to assist company founders in setting up a new company. Also, the UG must every year enlarge its capital by at least 25% of its yearly net profit (with some adjustments), until the general minimum of €25,000 is reached (at which point the company may change its name for the more prestigious ''GmbH''). In this case, the word ''haftungsbeschränkt'' must not be abbreviated.

Because a legal entity with liability limited to the contributed capital was regarded in the 19th century as something dangerous, German law has many restrictions unknown to [[common law]] systems. A number of business transactions have to be [[Civil law notary|notarized]], such as transfer of shares, issuing of stock, and amendments to the articles of association. Many of those measures have to be filed with the company registry where they are checked by special judges or other judicial officers. This can be a tiresome and time-consuming process, as in most cases the desired measures are legally valid only when entered into the registry. The founding process is expensive. Normally the foundation of new GmbH cost about 1000€ - 3000€.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.juraforum.de/lexikon/gesellschaft-mit-beschraenkter-haftung |accessdate= 2018-09-29 |location=Hannover |title=GmbH gründen - alles zur Haftung, Geschäftsführer und Auflösung }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there is no central company registry in Germany but rather several hundred connected to regional courts, the administration of the law can be rather different between [[States of Germany|German states]]. Since 2007 there has been an internet-based central company register for the whole of Germany, called ''Unternehmensregister''.

The '''Government Finance Officers Association of Texas''' (or GFOAT) is a [[professional association]] of state, [[County (United States)|county]], and [[local government]] finance officers in [[Texas]].  The Government Finance Officers Association of Texas is the statewide organization serving all Texas municipal finance professionals, an affiliate of the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).  Membership is open to anyone in the State of Texas actively engaged in government finance in any [[city]], county, or [[Special-purpose district|special district]].  Its stated mission is to enhance the quality of local government finance, to assist and support local government finance professionals in Texas, and to promote the public service profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfoat.org/missionstatement_web.asp GFOAT Website, Mission Statement] Retrieved 2009-06-04&lt;/ref&gt;  GFOAT members are actively involved in the key issues facing cities, counties, and special districts in the State of Texas.

The [[Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990]](CFO Act) was signed into law by President [[George H.W. Bush]]. For each of 23 federal agencies, the position of chief financial officer was created. Since that time, federal efforts have been intended to improve the government's financial management and develop standards of financial performance and disclosure. Similar financial expectations exist at State and Local government levels.

The [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) of a public agency is the corporate officer primarily responsible for managing the financial risks of the business or agency. This officer is also responsible for budgeting, financial planning, record-keeping, cash flow management, higher management. communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community. The title may vary, such as finance director or treasurer, from agency to agency. The CFO typically reports to the city manager or other chief executive officer.

Financial reporting has multiple audiences, with a responsibility to citizens, taxpayers and voters to provide transparent accountability for use of public funds (taxes).  Additionally, financial reporting must provide internal guidance to program managers to maintain budgetary control and to governing city councils and boards of directors to provide adequate financial policy guidelines.

The United States government in general has sought to improve the quality of financial reporting.  The Government Accounting Standards Board ([[Governmental Accounting Standards Board|GASB]]) has a stated mission to "establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting that will result in useful information for users of financial reports and guide and educate the public, including issuers, auditors, and users of those financial reports." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasb.org/ Government Accounting Standards Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Pronouncements in particular have trended to incorporate more comparable elements of business-sector.

The need for and value of financial managers has increased. Over the past decades, a number of factors have created a rapidly changing environment for today's government financial managers.  Beginning with the [[New York City]] financial crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, state and local governments began overhauling their financial management systems. In 1990, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) act called for reforms that brought the goal of accountability to the forefront.  The 1994 Bankruptcy of [[Orange County, California]] further underscored the need for ongoing excellence and expertise in the field of municipal finance.

==Role of GFOAT Membership==
Members are finance directors and treasurers of municipalities and other local government agencies, whether elected or appointed, having responsibility for collection, receipt, reporting, custody, investment or disbursement of municipal funds.  Municipal funding sources are commonly [[property tax]], [[sales tax]], [[income tax]], utility users tax (UUT), transient occupancy tax (hotel occupancy), and user fees such as licensing and permit fees.

[[Glenn Hegar]] is the [[Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts]] of the [[State of Texas]].  The office of '''Texas State Treasurer''' was established in the Constitution of 1876.  It superseded a similar office in the Republic of Texas. The treasurer was elected to serve for four years as head of the State Treasury Department.  The office was abolished by Texas voters in 1995 and was formally closed in 1996, with duties taken over by the [[Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts]].

Texas has 254 counties, by far the most counties of any state.  As of 2000, six Texas cities had populations greater than 500,000. The two largest are Dallas and Houston. Texas has the most cities with populations exceeding 1,000,000 of any state: Dallas, Houston, San&amp;nbsp;Antonio.&lt;ref name=PopEstBigCities&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2006–01.csv |title=Table 1: Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places Over 100,000, Ranked by July 1, 2006 Population: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 |format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]] |work=2005 Population Estimates |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2008-06-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three rank among the 10 most populous cities of the United States.

Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager.  Finance Directors typically are appointed by the City Manager.

In addition to cities and counties, Texas has numerous special districts. The most common is the independent [[school district]], which (with one exception) has a board of trustees that is independent of any other governing authority. Other special districts include Groundwater Conservation Districts (regulatory agencies), river authorities, water supply districts (for irrigation or municipal supply), public hospitals, road districts and community colleges.

==Professional Standards Setting==
Certification is a guide for municipal finance directors and treasurers to become valued administrators in local government.  GFOAT encourages [[professional certification]] for public finance directors and treasurers who meet standards of education, experience and commitment to a [[code of ethics]].  GFOAT offers its own [[post-nominal]] professional certificate, the Certified Government Finance Officer (CGFO) similar to the GFOA-administered the Certified Professional Finance Officer (CPFO), and [[Certified Government Financial Manager]] (CGFM) certification in Federal, State and Local Government Financial excellence from the Association of Government Accountants (AGA).  
{{see also|List of post-nominal letters}}

'''Groupe DSO''' was a collection of small business units that operated from 1967 to 1997 in the Asia-Pacific region. The core focus of these business units was logistic integration and consultancy.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:hoboct.jpg|thumb|right|R. Milhous Hoboct]] --&gt;

The company was founded in 1967 by R. Milhous Hoboct, a Czech-English engineer and entrepreneur. It found some significant successes in its BSDN and Checkpoint logistics systems; however due to a number of regulatory obstacles and failed business endeavours, a decision was made to dissolve the company in November 1997.

===Business Alliances===
Groupe DSO was a member of the FALO alliance, a close-knit set of companies providing reciprocal services. The FALO alliance comprised:
* '''Groupe DSO:''' logistics and engineering integration
* '''BSDN''' (a spin-off of the DSO BSDN business unit)
* '''Pacific-East:''' legal services
* '''SBU:''' financial services

==Business Units==
The organisational structure of Groupe DSO was of a number of small business units, each with a clearly defined purpose and goal. Central financial and administrative management was controlled by a holding company named '''DSO Centraal'''.

===DSO BSDN===
The ''Bow-Scott Distribution Network'', named after its creators, Ashleigh Bow and Dr. Shalain Scott, provided an integrated 'end-to-end' solution to the distribution of large volumes of data by traditional courier means.

The BSDN business unit was an [[Business incubator|incubator]] initiative whose aim was to provide start-up capital for DSO's core businesses: logistic and engineering consultancy. After wild success and rapid expansion, it was later spun off as a separate entity in 1979. The now-independent BSDN faced trouble in the 1990s, when company-wide computer networks and the [[Internet]] rendered its business model obsolete.

===DSO Checkpoint ''('Checkpoint Charlie')''===
After the spinoff of the BSDN business unit, Groupe DSO sought to apply its logistic expertise to niche markets. It found most success in academia, where the DSO Checkpoint system was used by many libraries for transporting books and other media between branches. Workers often referred to the system as ''Checkpoint Charlie'' due to the strict, well-documented procedures that ensured its efficiency and reliability.

===DSO CBS===
The DSO CBS (Consultancy and Business Support) division provided business consultancy on leveraging technology to improve workplace logistics and operations. A large number of Indonesian clients allowed for a local subsidiary to be established, ''P.T. DSO Logisti''.

===DSO EPI===
The DSO EPI (Electro-Pyro Initiative) was a small, relatively short-lived business unit that was created in response to a government tender for safe physics teaching aids. (Himself an engineer, R. M. Hoboct was passionate about science education through practical and applied learning.)

Although the tender was not successful, this unit enjoyed moderate success with its ''240'' series of electricity teaching appartus; and ''Big Joe'', a safety chamber that allowed otherwise dangerous laboratory experiments to be conducted at greatly reduced risk.

One commercial spinoff of the "Big Joe" project was the development of a highly puncture-proof design for food cans. In practice, however, these were little improvement over existing tin cans.

===DSO Trabaction===
DSO Trabaction was a division proposed and set up by Derek Helmutiffe; a DSO employee living in Germany, and keen [[Trabant]] enthusiast. This division helped facilitate and organise the supply of Trabant parts to enthusiasts across Western Germany, after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and [[German Reunification]]. After Helmutiffe's migration to Australia in 1995, the division closed.

==Trivia==
Groupe DSO was a minor sponsor of [[Ukyo Katayama]]'s [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] [[Formula One]] car in {{f1|1994}}.

'''Haim Michael Revivo''' ({{lang-he-n|חיים מיכאל רביבו}}; born 22 February 1972) is a retired Israeli [[Association football|football]] player who played as a [[midfielder]], and a businessman.

==Sports career==
Revivo is [[Jews|Jewish]] and was born to a traditional [[Mizrahi]] Jewish family in [[Ashdod]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dAq4TGQsWwwC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=Haim+Revivo+jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji9KnJkPTbAhWCA4gKHSAzBgQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Haim%20Revivo%20jewish&amp;f=false ''Day by Day in Jewish Sports History'' - Bob Wechsler&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kippur&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |script-title=he:ספורט ביום כיפור? היה דבר כזה |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3606681,00.html |agency = |work= |publisher=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |language=Hebrew |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yw-DAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Haim+Revivo+jewish&amp;dq=Haim+Revivo+jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA8Lb24PTbAhWG7mEKHQ-iAjgQ6AEIOjAD ''Great Jews in Sports'' - Robert Slater&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his grandmothers is from Morocco.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cgsXDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=%22Haim+Revivo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG36bQ4fTbAhUhsFQKHdKLA3kQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Haim%20Revivo%22&amp;f=false ''Languages of Modern Jewish Cultures: Comparative Perspectives''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He played football at [[F.C. Ashdod|Hapoel Ashdod]] until the age of 16 when he transferred to the youth club of [[Gadna Tel Aviv Yehuda F.C.|Gadna Tel Aviv Yehuda]]. Revivo liked that the club had no senior team and he would be a free agent once he reached 18. When he turned 19, [[Giora Spiegel]] brought him to [[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda]] after both [[Hapoel Kfar Saba F.C.|Hapoel Kfar Saba]] and [[Maccabi Petah Tikva F.C.|Maccabi Petah Tikva]] turned him down. Revivo spent three seasons at Bnei Yehuda before transferring to city rivals, [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel]].

When [[Reuven Atar]] requested to leave [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] for [[Hapoel Haifa F.C.|Hapoel Haifa]], [[Ya'akov Shahar]] was quick to sign a replacement. He brought in Revivo, who was happy to join Haifa since he believed that from there he could get to a European club. In his first season with Haifa, Revivo led the league (along with [[Amir Turgeman]]) with 17 goals. In his second season, he wanted to move from the left side of the midfield to the center of the pitch. Then club manager, Giora Spiegel, was reluctant but in order to avoid a fight with his star, he released [[Alon Mizrahi]]. Revivo paid off dividends and was once again the league leading goal scorer. Haifa was quick to sell their star to Spanish club, [[Celta de Vigo]].

Revivo became a starter at Celta Vigo. In October 1996, shortly after Revivo joined the club, he made headlines because of the club's league clash on [[Yom Kippur]]. Revivo desperately wanted to avoid the match that fell on the Jewish holiday. The club was able to move the match fixture ahead by a couple of hours and Revivo played for as long he could before being brought off in the second half to hurry home for the holiday.&lt;ref name=Kippur/&gt; He played in Spain a few successful years, and was very popular in Spain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He was named co-winner of the 1998 Israel Sports Figure of the Year Award.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

His first two years with [[Fenerbahçe]] were a success, and he led the team to the 2001 Turkish championship, but then he lost the attention of the club's management after other famous foreign players were brought in. He decided to leave, and caused much controversy with his move to [[Istanbul]] rivals [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]]. His spell at Galatasaray only lasted a year before he left Turkey.

After his return to Israel, he signed for Israel's [[F.C. Ashdod]], but after 12 games he retired from football. He is now a successful businessman and one of the former owners of F.C. Ashdod.

===Israeli national team ===
Revivo made his first appearance for a national side on December 18, 1990, playing with the [[Israel national under-18 football team]] against their [[Portugal national under-18 football team|Portuguese]] counterparts at the [[Estádio da Luz (1954)|Estádio da Luz]] in [[Lisbon]]. Revivo played in the midfield along with [[Avi Nimni]] and [[Eyal Berkovic]] who he would end up playing with most of his national team career.

A year and a half later, Revivo debuted with the [[Israel national under-21 football team]] on May 13, 1992 in a friendly against their [[Turkey national under-21 football team|Turkish]] counterparts at [[Herzliya Municipal Stadium]] in Israel. He scored on his debut and added another four goals in nine appearances, including a brace in a [[1994 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1994 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifier]] against [[Austria national under-21 football team|Austria]].

Six months after making his under-21 debut, he represented the [[Israel national football team|full side]] in a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] at [[Ramat Gan Stadium]] against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Revivo became a fixture in the national team lineup under [[Shlomo Scharf]] and competed for Israel in three FIFA World Cup qualifying campaigns and UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaigns in addition to 26 friendly matches.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Integrated Business Planning is a planning process that integrates across two or more functions in a business or government entity referred to as an enterprise to maximize
financial value.

The specific functional areas in a company as well as the industry domain associated with the company defines the specific type of IBP process. 
Examples of  IBP processes are:

* [[Sales and Operations Planning]]
* Healthcare Analytics
* Strategic Corporate Performance Management
* Planning and scheduling across multiple plants in a factory

The key requirement for IBP is that two or more functional process areas must be involved and maximizing (optimizing) of financial value should be done.

Corporate executives, business unit heads and planning managers use IBP to evaluate plans and activities based on the economic impact of each consideration.

'''Bridging Corporate Performance Management and S&amp;OP
There has been a lot of focus on Integrated Business Planning in the context of Sales and Operations Planning. Gartner ([http://www.gartner.com www.gartner.com]) refers to a 5-stage
S&amp;OP Maturity model wherein IBP is referred to as the Phased 4 &amp; 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2587021/introducing-fivestage-sales-operations-planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Integrated Business Planning however is more broader than S&amp;OP. It is an approach that combines Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) and sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP) to provide incremental capabilities that neither provides individually. In so doing, IBP platforms address long-standing challenges that financial and operational professionals have struggled to overcome. The result: opportunities for step change improvements to how manufacturers plan, manage and govern their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBP Industry Week cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/software-systems/integrated-business-planning-not-just-marketing-hoax}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the focus is on strengthening the financial integration and reconciliation of plans, as well as increasing the responsiveness of the supply chain using ad-hoc reports and what-if scenario analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.camelot-mc.com/en/integrated-business-planning-ibp/|title=Integrated Business Planning (IBP) - Camelot - Management Consultants|website=www.camelot-mc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Integrated Business Planning requires the following capabilities to be enabled:

a) Enterprise Model
* Ability to create a demand chain model
* Ability to create a supply chain model
* Ability to create a finance chain model
b) Integrated Planning
* Ability to create a plan across multiple functions
* Ability to create predictive and collaborative plans

c) Enterprise Optimization
* Ability to create optimized plans across multiple constraints
* Ability to create financial integration across optimization

== Applications ==
IBP has been used to model and integrate the planning efforts in a number of applications, including:
* Product profitability
* [[Customer profitability]]
* [[Capital expenditures]]
* Manufacturing operations
* [[Supply chain]]
* Business processes (human and information-based)
* Business policy
* Market demand curves
* Competitive strategy
All of the above can be summarized as Enterprise Optimization use cases.

== Criticism ==
Some argue that IBP is not any different from S&amp;OP.  See article by Patrick Bower [http://www.jaguar-aps.com/pdf/IBP%20is%20a%20Hoax.pdf where he calls IBP a marketing hoax], a name developed to create confusion and sell consulting and system services.  The main proponents of IBP are in fact consulting companies.    In return to this criticism,
it has been pointed out that [http://www.industryweek.com/software-systems/integrated-business-planning-not-just-marketing-hoax IBP is not a marketing hoax], but an important
part of Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) system.

Another criticism is that [http://supplychaintrend.com/2015/02/28/the-rise-and-fall-of-sop/ IBP is not academically defined] and is supply chain biased in its definition. The lack of academic standard leaves room for interpretation to what IBP is, which is confusing practitioners. In a [https://supplychaintrends.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/supply-chain-trend-sop-pulse-check-2015.pdf 2015 S&amp;OP survey], 32% of participants answered that there is no difference between S&amp;OP and IBP, 20% "did not know", and 71% of participants answered that there is a need for more industry standards around S&amp;OP.

It has been called out that IBP has a lack of governance and in need of an industry group to create a unified definition. Due this lack of academic and industry standards, there has been an attempt to create an [http://supplychaintrend.com/2015/11/25/a-new-definition-for-integrated-business-planning/ open source definition for IBP]. This definition is as follows:

Integrated Business Planning (IBP): A holistic planning philosophy, where all organizational functions participate in providing executives periodically with valid, reliable information, in order to
decide how to align the enterprise around executing the plans to achieve budget, strategic intent and the envisioned future.

By 2015, Isabel dos Santos owned a share of satellite-TV operator ZAP, that had in December 2013 acquired the rights to distribute ''Forbes'' in a number of Portuguese speaking countries, namely Portugal, Angola and Mozambique. It had been announced that most of the content would be produced by a local team, complemented by content for the North American edition, therefore potentially allowing influence on ''Forbes'' content. It was initially planned that the first edition of the Portuguese language ''Forbes'' would be published during the second quarter of 2014.

'''Jean Van Milders''' (13 November 1924 – 20 June 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humo.be/humo-dossiers/32102/jean-van-milders-overleden. Artikel over zijn overlijden in [[Humo]]], 20 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Belgian businessman and the president of soccer team [[AA Gent]] for ten years.

==Business career==
Born in [[Geel]], Van Milders was a talented entrepreneur. He managed to develop the Brewery Van Milders situated in Geel, which he had inherited together with his brothers from his parents, to a sound company and he introduced the abbey beer Tongerlo. 1970, The brothers sold their brewery and started bottling [[Coca-Cola]]. As from 1976, they were catering Carestel-road restaurants.

Van Milders sometimes proclaimed very strange expressions about his entrepreneurial management. A good one-liner of his was: "As a child, what did we know about money? Nothing at all! And now, I've got grandchildren playing with their money on the stock markets."

==President of AA Gent==
As from July 1988 to 1998, Van Milders was he president of [[AA Gent]]. This soccer team was just degraded out of [[ Belgian First Division]] and the team had a heavy burden. Van Milders used his rich bank account to help the team financially.

In soccer, this meant a large difference at AA Gent. He transferred some well-known players to the team, making the way of playing more attractive. After a number of years, the team played European games again. In 1992, AA Gent reached the quarter finals of the [[UEFA Cup]]. This was the best European result under his guidance. In the Belgian competition, it did not work out so well the next years, but the foundations of the successes were laid. Those were achieved under his successor [[Ivan De Witte]].

Van Milders died in [[Knokke-Heist]].

== Background ==
Paid maternity leave is important for women to take time away from work to bond with a child without financial pressures. Of the 193 [[United Nations]] countries, only a handful do not have a paid-parental-leave policy: [[New Guinea]], [[Suriname]], the [[United States]] and a few South [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[Island country|island nation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/495839588/countries-around-the-world-beat-the-u-s-on-paid-parental-leave|title=Countries Around The World Beat The U.S. On Paid Parental Leave|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international history dates back to the 1970s, with countries such as Iraq granting full pay for women. By the 1980s, [[Great Britain]] was at the point of giving women benefits but did not specify a pay rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-timeline-maternity-leave-2113236.html|title=The Timeline: Maternity leave|date=2010-10-22|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of pay rates is limited and not well-recorded, except by the OECD.

== {{anchor|Different Kinds of Leave}}Types of leave ==
Maternity leave varies by country, with most developed countries having at least one set type of maternity leave. Most maternity leaves include a length of time to take off, with some form of pay. The following countries grouped by pay rate.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]] maternity-leave pay is known as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), which can cover up to 39 weeks of maternity leave. A woman can expect to earn 90 percent of her weekly earnings for the first six weeks of maternity leave; after that, the rate decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/pay|title=Maternity pay and leave - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia, Canada, and New Zealand ===
In Australia, women can receive up to 18 weeks minimum-wage from the government; if an employer offers paid leave, a mother can receive that as well. In Canada, a woman can receive 17 weeks of maternity leave: two weeks before giving birth and 15 weeks afterwards. The two weeks before birth are unpaid.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/family/PF2_5_Trends_in_leave_entitlements_around_childbirth_Annex.pdf|title=Annex: Detail of Change in Parental by Country|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, primary leave is 18 weeks of paid leave; special leave covers 10 days (spread out) for appointments or unpaid illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/types-of-parental-leave/|title=Types of parental leave » Employment|website=www.employment.govt.nz|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark, Greece, and Switzerland ===
In Denmark, a woman can receive 35 or 46 weeks of paid leave; the 35-week pay leave may be spread over 46 weeks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women in Greece must be insured to receive maternity benefits, which include 56 days before giving birth and 63 days afterwards. To receive the benefits a woman must stop working for 56 days. If she does not take 56 days off, the woman must add the days after giving birth to be paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/greece/healthcare/pregnancy-birth/benefits|title=Maternity and Birth Benefits - Greece - Angloinfo|newspaper=Angloinfo|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, a woman is guaranteed up to 14 weeks (a minimum of 8 weeks) of paid leave after giving birth. She is paid 80 percent of her previous wage, with a daily maximum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Iceland, Japan, Turkey, and Slovak Republic}}Iceland, Japan, Turkey and Slovakia ===
Icelandic women receive 13 weeks of paid maternity leave (with an additional shared 13 weeks), with a ceiling of [[Icelandic króna|ISK]]370,000 per month. Japan allows 14 weeks if the woman is enrolled in the Employees' Health Insurance system. The leave can be taken by both parents in one absence period. There is a minimum payment of [[Japanese yen|¥]]46,230 per month and a maximum monthly payment of ¥285,420. Sixteen weeks of maternity leave  are on the condition that the employee was employed for 236 weeks by the 15th week before the first week of leave. There is no ceiling on payments for the first six weeks. [[Slovakia]] grants leave until the child's third birthday as a family entitlement, with a monthly benefit of €203.2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, and Sweden ===
Women in [[Cyprus]], including women who are adopting, receive 16 weeks of maternity leave. Nine weeks are mandatory, with the first two beginning two weeks before the expected due date. During this time, women receive a grant which serves as maternity pay. After maternity leave, women can apply to leave work an hour each day with pay for six months to help care for their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlsi.gov.cy/mlsi/dl/dl.nsf/dmlposting_en/dmlposting_en?OpenDocument|title=Department of Labour - Employment Policy|website=www.mlsi.gov.cy|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Czech Republic]], women receive 28 weeks of paid maternity leave; the minimum leave is 14 weeks. Families can receive financial support for child care. Women in [[Hungary]] have the options of up to 24 weeks of maternity leave at 70-percent pay or financial support and job insurance to raise the child, with part-time work promoted. In [[Korea]], a woman receives 44 days of maternity leave before the birth and 90 days afterwards. During the first 60 days of the 90-day period, they receive full salary; during the last 30 days, they can receive up to [[South Korean won|₩]]1,350,000. [[Sweden|Swedish]] parents receive 480 days of maternity leave, with 90 days reserved for the father. The first 300 days are at 80-percent of pay, and the remainder is paid at a flat rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Italy, Latvia, Malta, and Romania ===
In [[Italy]], women receive 80 percent of their normal earnings for six months.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Latvia]]n women are granted 114 days of paid leave, which may be extended based on health complications, the birth of more than one child or if there is more than one child under age two. When they return to work, mothers are allowed time to check on their child (or children).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilo.org/ifpdial/information-resources/national-labour-law-profiles/WCMS_158912/lang--en/index.htm|title=National Labour Law Profile: Latvia|date=2015-09-01|language=en|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malta|Maltese]] women receive 18 weeks of uninterrupted maternity leave. The first 14 weeks are full salary and benefits, and the last four weeks can be covered by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dier.gov.mt/en/Employment-Conditions/Leave/Pages/Maternity-Leave.aspx|title=Maternity Leave|website=dier.gov.mt|language=en|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Romania]], women have two options: a one-year leave at 75-percent salary, with a bonus when they return to work, or two years at 75 percent without the return bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lpg-roumanie.ro/en/publications/social/maternity-paternity-leave-in-romania|title=Maternity/Paternity leave in Romania|date=2014-12-19|newspaper=LPG Romania|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria, France, and Norway ===
In [[Bulgaria]] women receive 410 days of maternity leave at 90-percent salary, with 45 days granted before giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/bulgaria/healthcare/pregnancy-birth/maternity-leave|title=Maternity Leave, Allowance and Benefits - Bulgaria - Angloinfo|newspaper=Angloinfo|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France|French]] women are given 16 weeks of paid maternity leave for their first child, and time off increases with subsequent children. The amount paid is based on household income and how many children are already in the family. In [[Norway]], women can choose 49 weeks at 100 percent of salary or 59 weeks at 80 percent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to OECD research, 60 percent of countries offering maternity leave do not provide full pay.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The table lists countries offering less than full salary, from lowest to highest.

These pay rates are the average of the paid leave for an individual earning 100 percent of the 2014 national average. In most countries, leave payments are calculated on gross earnings; however, in some—e.g., [[Austria]], [[Chile]], [[France]] and [[Germany]]—payments are based on net earnings (after income-tax and social-security payments). Pay rates in these countries reflect the proportion of net earnings replaced by the relevant payments, and should not be compared directly with pay rates based on gross earnings. Many countries have a variable rate; for example, [[Belgium]] gives women 82% of their salary for the first month. For the remaining three or four months (depending on the number of births) they receive 75 percent, with a cap of €133 per day.

Most OECD countries provide payments replacing over 50 percent of previous earnings, with twelve countries offering average-wage mothers full compensation for the leave. Pay rates are lowest in [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where only about one-third of gross average earnings are replaced by maternity benefits. Despite lengthy paid-leave entitlements, full-rate maternity leave in these countries is only nine weeks in Ireland and twelve in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf|title=Key Characteristic of Parental Leave Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Haugesund]].

Eriksen, who belonged to [[Rogaland]], was never elected directly to the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] but served as a deputy representative in the periods 1969&amp;ndash;1973 and 1973&amp;ndash;1977. During the first term he was brought in as a replacement representative for [[Egil Endresen]], who became appointed to the Cabinet in 1970. Eriksen sat as a regular representative until March 1971, when the cabinet of which Endresen was a part was dissolved, allowing him to return to his seat in Parliament.

On the local level Eriksen held various positions in [[Haugesund]] [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] between 1963 and 1987, as well as being a deputy member from 1991 to his death in 1999. He served as deputy mayor in 1966&amp;ndash;1967 and 1975&amp;ndash;1977, and mayor in 1970&amp;ndash;1971, 1974&amp;ndash;1975, 1978&amp;ndash;1979 and 1979&amp;ndash;1983.

{{Contract law}}
An '''output contract''' is an [[contract|agreement]] in which a producer agrees to sell his or her entire production to the buyer, who in turn agrees to purchase the entire output. Example: an almond grower enters into an ''output contract'' with an almond packer: thus the producer has a "home" for output of nuts, and the packer of nuts is happy to try the particular product. The converse of this situation is a [[requirements contract]], under which a seller agrees to supply the buyer with as much of a good or service as the buyer wants, in exchange for the buyer's agreement not to buy that good or service elsewhere.

[[Uniform Commercial Code]] comment section 2-306: A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer, means such actual output or requirements that may occur in good faith. [[Good faith]] cessation of production terminates any further obligations thereunder and excuses further performance by the party discontinuing production. However, the cessation of production must be in light of [[bankruptcy]] or other similar situations. The yield of less profit from a sale than expected does not excuse further performance of an output contract. See Feld vs. Henry S. Levy &amp; Sons, Inc. (New York, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/commercial-law/commercial-law-keyed-to-lopucki/performance/feld-v-henry-s-levy-sons-inc/ Brief at CaseBriefs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/197476545AD2d720_2489/FELD%20v.%20HENRY%20S.%20LEVY%20&amp;%20SONS,%20INC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">In [[economics]], '''rationalization''' is an attempt to change a pre-existing [[ad hoc]] [[workflow]] into one that is based on a set of published rules. There is a tendency in modern times to quantify experience, [[knowledge economy|knowledge]], and [[Labour (economics)|work]]. Means–end (goal-oriented) rationality is used to precisely calculate that which is necessary to attain a goal. Its effectiveness varies with the enthusiasm of the workers for the changes being made, the skill with which management applies the rules, and the degree to which the rules fit the job.

Rationalization aims at an efficiency increase by better use of existing possibilities: A same effect can with fewer means, or with same means to be obtained. In the industry thereby frequently the replacement of manpower is designated by machines (rationalization investment). It is the reasonable, appropriate organization of operational conditions under changing conditions to increase with the goal, productivity and economy.

Julien Freund defines rationalization as "the organization of life through a division and coordination of activities on the basis of exact study of men's relations with each other, with their tools and their environment, for the purpose of achieving greater efficiency and productivity".&lt;ref name="Freund"&gt;Freund, Julien, 1968. ''The Sociology of Max Weber''.  New York: Vintage Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalization process is the practical application of knowledge to achieve a desired end. Its purpose is to bring about [[economic efficiency|efficiency]], coordination, and control of the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[social environment]]. It is a product of "scientific specialization and technical differentiation" that seems to be a characteristic of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Freund"/&gt; Rationalization is the guiding principle behind [[bureaucracy]] and the increasing [[division of labour|division of labor]], and has led to an increase in both the production and distribution of [[goods and services]]. It is also associated with [[secularization]] without its more positive component of [[humanism]], with depersonalization and with oppressive routine.

Increasingly, human behavior is to be guided by observation, experiment, and reason (''[[Instrumental action|zweckrational]]'').&lt;ref name="Elwell"&gt;Elwell, Frank W., 1999. ''Industrializing America: Understanding Contemporary Society through Classical Sociological Analysis''. West Port, Connecticut: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; Change in human character is expected to be part of the process; rationalization and bureaucratization promote efficiency, and [[economic materialism|materialism]], both of which are subsumed under [[Max Weber|Weber]]'s concept of ''zweckrational''.

A '''seasonal industry''' is activity within an economic [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] in which the majority of operations take place during only part of the year, usually within a period of half a year or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Assembly Bills, Original and Amended|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDhRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA50-IA67|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, as with [[agriculture]], this limitation may relate to [[climate]] or other forces of nature. In others, the seasonality may relate to annual variations in human activity (for example, [[tourism]], [[restaurant]]s, some forms of [[manufacturing]]).

Seasonal industries often feature large swings in labor force size, and in many cases, precipitate mass [[Migrant worker|migrations of workers]]. 

In those countries that provide them, [[unemployment benefit]]s may be affected by a worker's seasonal status. That is, in certain cases, a seasonal worker may not be considered "[[unemployed]]" during the off-season for the sake of benefits or aggregated statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coworkforce.com/uib/regulation/default.asp?section=seasonal|title=Colorado Workforce Regulations (example)|accessdate=2006-08-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060515190615/http://www.coworkforce.com/uib/regulation/default.asp?section=seasonal &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite being functionally inactive.

'''Socialist Workers' Sport International''' ({{lang-de|Sozialistische Arbeitersport Internationale}}, SASI) was an international [[socialist]] sporting organisation, based in [[Lucerne]]. It was founded in 1920, and consisted of six national federations (with a combined membership of about one million) at the time of its foundation. Initially it was known as '''International Association for Sports and Physical Culture'''. Informally it was known as the '''Lucerne Sport International'''. It adopted the name SASI in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Bruce. The Struggle for Canadian Sport. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1996. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austro-Marxism|Austro-Marxist]] [[Julius Deutsch]] was the president of SASI.&lt;ref name="wheel"/&gt;

[[International Labour Sports Federation]] (CSIT) was established in 1946 as the successor of SASI.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] &amp; [[James Riordan]] (eds.) (1996). ''The Story of Worker Sport.'' Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics. {{ISBN|978-0873228749}}; Halevi Olin (ed.) (2013). ''Sport, Peace and Development. International Worker Sport. 1913 - 2013.'' Wien: CSIT {{ISBN|978-3-9503593-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

An international meeting of workers sports associations had been held in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], in 1913. However, the [[First World War]] put the build-up of an international workers' sport organisation on hold. After the war two Belgians, Gaston Bridoux and Jules Devlieger, took initiative to revive the cooperation. Preparatory meetings were held in [[Seraing]], [[Belgium]] in 1919 and in [[Paris]], [[France]], during Easter 1920. The founding congress of the international took place in Lucerne September 13-September 14, 1920. During the foundation, the French and Belgian delegations urged that the word 'Socialist' be omitted from the name of the organisation, in order to attract a broader following.&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;Steinberg, David A.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/260115 The Workers' Sport Internationals 1920&amp;ndash;28]'', in ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 13, No. 2, Special Issue: Workers' Culture (Apr., 1978), pp. 233&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

The organisation upheld a policy of neutrality towards party organisations, a policy inherited from the German workers' sports movement (which tried to steer away from the fractional conflicts between the German socialists). This policy was however challenged by the communists, which claimed that the workers' sport movement could not abstain from taking part in revolutionary struggle. In 1921, the third congress of the [[Communist International]] decided to form a parallel sport international. In August 1921, the [[Sportintern]] was founded. [[Sportintern]] launched fierce political attacks against the Lucerne international. Its Czechoslovak section had suffered a split in July 1921, as the communists deserted it.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

At the second congress of the Lucerne International, held in Leipzig 1922, the French delegation argued in favour of unification between the two Internationals. This policy was not supported by the congress. The following year, the French affiliate FST decided to shift its membership to [[Sportintern]].&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

Ahead of the 1925 Workers Olympiad, the [[Sportintern]] appealed to the Lucerne International that four [[Sportintern]] delegations (France, Soviet Union, Norway, Czechoslovakia) should be allowed to participate. Discussions lingered on within the Lucerne International, but after communist sportsmen had made a public protest at a German Workers Sports Festival in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] in 1924, it was decided that the [[Sportintern]] would be barred from the Workers Olympiad. Likewise SASI barred its affiliates for participating in the 1928 [[Spartakiad]] organised by [[Sportintern]].&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

Politically, SASI was supported by the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] and the [[Labour and Socialist International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110001136801/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers' Olympiads==
The main activity of SASI was the organizing of the [[International Workers' Olympiads]], portrayed as a socialist alternative to the '[[bourgeois]]' [[Olympics]]. At the Workers Olympiads only the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, rather than national flags.
*The [[1925 Workers' Summer Olympiad|first Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], in 1925. There were around 150,000 spectators. A world record was broken in the 100 meter women's relay race. The summer Workers Olympiad had been preceded by [[1925 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter games]] the same year, in [[Schreiberhau]], in which twelve national delegations had participated.
*The [[1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad|second Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in 1931. 80,000 athletes took part in the games, which had around 250,000 spectators. The games were larger than the [[1932 Los Angeles Olympics]], both in number of participants and spectators.&lt;ref name="vcn"&gt;http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[1931 Workers' Winter Olympiad|winter Workers' Olympiad]] was held in [[Mürzzuschlag]], [[Austria]], in 1931. Like the summer event, the winter Workers Olympiad was larger (in number of participants and spectators) than the [[1932 Lake Placid Olympics]].

'''The British-Swiss Chamber of Commerce (BSCC)''' was founded in 1920 and is an independent [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit organisation]] with more than 500 Members. It promotes [[business relations]] between [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The Chamber provides a network and platform for business people to facilitate dialogue and change. The BSCC offers an open forum for debate, networking and access to key decision makers and influencers from all sectors and nationalities. 

The BSCC is composed of Corporate, SME and Individual Members that are a part of 4 Membership Categories: Network, Promote, Lead and Influence. BSCC Members represent the majority of business sectors, including Commodities &amp; Energy, Consumer goods &amp; Retail, Financials, Human Capital, Industrial &amp; Manufacturing, Insurance, Life Sciences &amp; Pharma, Luxury, Professional Services, Real Estate, Technology and Travel &amp; Culture. 

Represented by Geographically defined Chapters, the BSCC is active in [[Basel]], [[Berne]], [[Central Switzerland]], [[Geneva]], Liechtenstein, [[Ticino]], UK and [[Zurich]]. The BSCC has Special Interest Groups covering Public Affairs and Legal and Tax. Across all Chapters the BSCC organizes around 100 events each year featuring C-suite speakers and offering trainings, workshops, panel discussions, business breakfasts and lunches, after work and gala events for members and non-members. 

== Organisation ==
An elected President and a Secretary General head up the organisation. Both the Swiss Ambassador in [[London]] and the British Ambassador in Bern are Honorary Presidents.

The BSCC Team is made up of more than 100 Individuals in Switzerland and the UK, of whom the majority support the BSCC on a voluntarily basis. Most of their volunteers are representatives of member companies and are active in the Council, Executive Board, Chapter Committees, Public Affairs Commission (PAC) and Task Force Europe. 

• Councillors review the executive operations and constitute the governing body of the BSCC
• The Executive Board oversees operational matters and drives BSCC strategy
• Chapter Committee Members are the BSCC's local brand ambassadors and provide ideas for chapter event programmes
• The Public Affairs Commission identifies political and economic issues of bilateral interest
• Task Force Europe provides insight on relevant European trends and developments

In 2016 Anne-Marie de Weck, took over the Presidency of the BSCC. James Woodeson joined the BSCC as Secretary General in 2017.  

== Special Interest Groups ==

The Public Affairs Commission (PAC) serves as a business platform for furthering the understanding of political and economic issues of common interest to the British and Swiss business communities. On an annual basis, PAC organises Public Affairs Dinners in Berne and Westminster to encourage dialogue between members, parliamentarians and the broader business world.

The remit of the Task Force Europe is to examine the similarities and differences in the way Switzerland and the UK approach European issues. The Task Force operates as an independent think tank that provides BSCC members with an analytical perspective on topical themes and political developments. 

== COBCOE ==
The BSCC is a member of [[COBCOE]], (Council of British Chambers of Commerce in Europe). Founded in 1973, COBCOE is an independent non-profit organisation representing 40 British [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]] in 37 countries across [[Europe]]. Acting as an [[umbrella organisation]], they work with their member chambers to advance international trade and business with the United Kingdom.

The '''workweek''' and '''weekend''' are the complementary parts of the [[week]] devoted to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and [[Leisure|rest]], respectively.  The legal '''working week''' ([[British English]]), or workweek ([[American English]]), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labor.  In most of the world, the workweek is from [[Monday]] to [[Friday]] and the weekend is [[Saturday]] and [[Sunday]], but other divisions exist: for example, many countries observing a Sunday to Thursday working week.  A '''weekday''' or '''workday''' is any day of the working week.  Other institutions often follow this pattern, such as places of [[education]]. Sometimes the term “weekend” is expanded to include the time after work hours on the last workday of the week; e.g. Friday evening is often referred to as the start of the weekend. Technically the weekend starts after 5pm on Friday evening until Sunday 12pm.{{According to whom|date=November 2018}}

In some Christian traditions, [[Sunday]] is the "[[Lord's Day|day of rest and worship]]". The [[Judaism|Jewish]] ''[[Shabbat]]'' or [[Biblical Sabbath (Hebrew)|Biblical Sabbath]] lasts from sunset on [[Friday]] to the fall of full darkness on [[Saturday]]; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday–Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries have historically instituted a Thursday–Friday weekend. Today, many of these countries have shifted from Thursday–Friday to Friday–Saturday, or to Saturday–Sunday.

Historically, the [[Christian Sabbath]] was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century.  This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. The present-day concept of the "weekend" first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=weekend|title=weekend - Origin and meaning of weekend by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.

Some countries have adopted a one-day weekend, i.e. either Sunday only (in seven countries), Friday only (in [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Somalia]]), or Saturday only (in [[Nepal]]). However, most countries have adopted a two-day weekend, whose days differ according to religious tradition, i.e. either Friday and Saturday, or Saturday and Sunday, or Friday and Sunday (in [[Brunei]] Darussalam), with the previous evening post-work often considered part of the weekend. Proposals continue to be put forward to reduce the number of days or hours worked per week, on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits.

== History ==
{{Labour|expanded=rights|sp=uk}}
{{expand section|date=September 2013}}
A continuous seven-day cycle that runs throughout history, paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon and having a fixed day of rest, was most likely first practiced in [[Judaism]], dated to the 6th century BC at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd5ZjRsNj4sC&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week |last=[[Eviatar Zerubavel]] |first= |date=1989-03-15 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year= |isbn=978-0-226-98165-9 |location= |pages= |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5c7C2rQzU0C&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical |last=Senn |first=Frank C. |date=1997 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=978-0-8006-2726-3 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Rome]], every eight days there was a [[nundinae]]. It was a market day, during which children were exempted from school&lt;ref&gt;The Teacher in Ancient Rome: The Magister and His World, Lisa Maurice, Lexington Books, 2013, pp. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and [[plebs]] ceased from work in the field and came to the city to sell the produce of their labor&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome in So Many Words, Christopher Francese, Hippocrene Books, 2007, pp. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Nundinae.html |title=LacusCurtius • Roman Calendar — Nundinae (Smith's Dictionary, 1875) |website=penelope.uchicago.edu |language=en |access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to practice religious rites.{{Citation needed|reason=nundunae page says it's doubtful that this day had religious characteristics. || date=June 2017}}

The [[French Revolutionary Calendar]] had ten-day weeks (called ''décades'') and allowed ''décadi'', one out of the ten days, as a leisure day.

In cultures with a [[four-day week]], the three [[Sabbath]]s derive from the culture's main religious tradition: Friday ([[Muslim Sabbath|Muslim]]), Saturday ([[Jewish Sabbath|Jewish]]), and Sunday ([[Christian Sabbath|Christian]]).

The present-day concept of the relatively longer 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early part of the nineteenth century&lt;ref name="etymonline.com" /&gt; and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2pm in agreement that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Waiting for the Weekend, Witold Rybzinski, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary traces the first use of the term ''weekend'' to the British magazine ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stanton |first1=Kate |title=The origin of the weekend |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-origin-of-the-weekend-20150807-giu3ay.html |accessdate=10 June 2017 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the first five-day workweek in [[United States|the United States]] was instituted by a [[New England]] [[cotton mill]] so that [[Jewish]] workers would not have to work on the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Witold Rybczynski |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/91aug/rybczynski-p2.htm |title=Waiting for the Weekend |pages=35–52 |date=August 1991 |work=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Henry Ford]] began shutting down his [[car factory|automotive factories]] for all of Saturday and Sunday. In 1929, the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] Union was the first union to demand and receive a five-day workweek. The rest of the [[United States]] slowly followed, but it was not until 1940, when a provision of the 1938 [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|Fair Labor Standards Act]] mandating a maximum 40-hour workweek went into effect, that the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com" /&gt;

Over the succeeding decades, particularly in the 1940s-1960s, an increasing number of countries adopted either a Friday–Saturday or Saturday–Sunday weekend to harmonize with international markets. A series of workweek reforms in the mid-to-late 2000s and early 2010s brought much of the [[Arab World]] in synchronization with the majority of countries around the world, in terms of working hours, the length of the workweek, and the days of the weekend. The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) currently defines a workweek exceeding 48 hours as excessive. A 2007 study by the ILO found that at least 614.2 million people around the world were working excessive hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sahadi |first=Jeanne |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/07/news/ilo_study/ |title=22% of workers work more than 48 hours a week, study finds – Jun. 7, 2007 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid reduction took place from 1900 to 1920, especially between 1913 and 1919, when weekly hours fell by about eight percent.&lt;ref name=hunnicutt&gt;Hunnicutt, B.K.

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]] the working week begins on Monday and terminates on Friday. An eight-hour working day is the norm. Working three weekdays a fortnight, for example, would therefore be approximately twenty-four hours (including or excluding traditional breaks tallying up to two hours). Some people work overtime with extra pay on offer for those that do, especially for weekend work. Shops open seven days a week in most states with opening hours from 9am to 5.30pm on weekdays, with some states having two "late night trading" nights on Thursday and Friday, when trading ceases at 9pm. Many supermarkets and low end department stores remain open until midnight and some trade 24/7. Restaurants and cinemas can open at all hours, save for some public holidays. Bars generally trade seven days a week but there are local municipal restrictions concerning trading hours. Banks trade on Monday to Friday, with some branches opening on Saturdays (and in some cases Sundays) in high demand areas. The Post Office (Australia Post) trades Monday to Friday as per retail shops but some retail post offices may trade on Saturdays and Sundays in some shopping centres. A notable exception to the above is South Australia whereby retail establishments are restricted to trading between the hours of 11am-5pm on Sundays.

=== Brazil ===
As a general rule, [[Brazil]] adopts a 44-hour working week, which typically begins on Monday and ends on Friday, with a Saturday-Sunday weekend. [[Brazilian Law]],&lt;ref&gt;Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho: http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del5452.htm&lt;/ref&gt; however, also allows for shorter Monday-to-Friday working hours so employees can work on Saturdays or Sundays, as long as the weekly 44-hour limit is respected and the employee gets at least one weekend day. This is usually the case for malls, supermarkets and shops. The law also grants [[labor unions]] the right to negotiate different work weeks, within certain limits, which then become binding for that union's labor category. Overtime is allowed, limited to two extra hours a day, with an increase in pay.

=== Chile ===
The working week in [[Chile]] averages 45 hours, most often worked on a Monday-Friday schedule, but is not uncommon to work on Saturdays. Retail businesses mostly operate Monday through Saturday, with larger establishments being open seven days a week.

=== China (People's Republic) ===
In [[China]], there is a five-day Monday-Friday working week, prior to which work on Saturday was standard. China began the two-day Saturday–Sunday weekend on May 1, 1995. Most government employees work 5 days a week (including officials and industrial management). Most manufacturing facilities operate on Saturdays as well. However, most shops, museums, cinemas and commercial establishments open on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Banks are also open throughout the weekend and on most public holidays.

During the period of [[Public holidays in China|public holidays]], swapped holidays are common between the actual holiday and weekend, so a three-day or seven-day holiday periods are created. The nearby Saturday or Sunday may be changed to a normal working day. For example, on a three-day holiday period, if the actual holiday falls on a Tuesday, Monday will be swapped as a holiday, and citizens are required to work on the previous Saturday.

A number of provinces and municipalities across China, including Hebei, Jiangxi and Chongqing, have issued new policies, calling on companies to create 2.5-day weekends. Under the plan, government institutions, state-owned companies, joint-ventures and privately held companies are to be given incentives to allow their workers to take off at noon on Friday before coming back to the office on Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China to implement 2.5-day weekend this summer |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-02/03/content_23369098.htm |website=www.chinadaily.com.cn |access-date=2016-02-03 |last=江巍}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hong Kong SAR ====
In [[Hong Kong]], a typical working week for local enterprises begins on Monday and ends at 1pm on Saturday, although most employees have alternate Saturdays off. After the introduction of the five-day working week for the majority of government departments in 2006, most multinational enterprises and large local companies followed suit, extended the working day from 9am to 6pm so as to adopt a five-day work week. Despite the aforementioned official hours, many employees work overtime, and in the case of the financial industry in particular, working 12-hour days on a chronic basis is not uncommon.

Most commercial establishments in the retail sector such as restaurants, shops and cinemas, as well as public venues such as museums and libraries are open on Saturdays, Sundays and most public holidays. For schools, lessons are not normally held on Saturdays, but students may be required to go school on Saturdays for extra-curricular activities or make-up classes.

=== Colombia ===
In general, [[Colombia]] has a 48-hour working week. Depending on the business, people work five days for [https://web.archive.org/web/20151203220944/http://www.mintrabajo.gov.co/preguntas-frecuentes/jornada-de-trabajo.html max 8 hours per day], typically Monday to Friday, or six days for eight hours a day, Monday to Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Colombia/Colombia-Guide/Jobs/Legal-regulations-in-the-Colombian-job-market |title=Legal regulations in the Colombian job market |work=Just Landed |access-date=2017-06-19 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
The standard working week is Monday to Friday. Shops are also open on Saturday. Small shops may close on a weekday (generally Monday) to compensate workers for having worked on Saturday. By law, préfets may authorise a small number of specific shops to open on Sunday such as bars, cafés, restaurants, and bakeries, which are traditionally open every day but only during the morning on Sunday. Workers are not obliged to work on Sunday. School children have traditionally taken Wednesday off, or had only a half day, making up the time either with longer days for the rest of the week or sometimes a half day on Saturday. This practice was made much less common under new legislation rolled out over 2013–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=France: Weird about Wednesday |url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21586572-state-primary-schools-are-abandoning-their-four-day-week-weird-about-wednesday |work=[[The Economist]] |date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Netherlands ====
In the Netherlands, the standard working week is Monday to Friday (40 hours).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More two-income couples with one full-time job and one large part-time job |url=https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2015/05/more-two-income-couples-with-one-full-time-job-and-one-large-part-time-job |website=CBS – Statistics Netherlands |publisher=CBS – Statistics Netherlands |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shops are almost always open on Saturdays and often on Sundays.

==== Poland ====
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Large malls are open on Saturdays and Sundays; many small shops are closed on Sundays. Since 11 March 2018 all malls and shops are close on Sundays with banned trading.

Under the new rules, trading will be only allowed on the first and last Sunday of the month. The ban will be stepped up to all Sundays except the last each month in 2019, while in 2020 trading will be prohibited on all Sundays except seven, including those in the run-up to Christmas and Easter. 11 March 2018 will be the first Sunday on which trading is banned.

Bakeries, confectioners, petrol stations, florists, post offices, train stations and airports will be exempt from the ban. Owners will be able to open their shops as long as they serve customers themselves.

Anyone infringing the new rules faces a fine of up to PLN 100,000 (EUR 23,900; USD 29,250). Repeat offenders may face a prison sentence

==== Romania ====
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Shops are open on Saturday and Sunday. The weekend begins on Friday, and ends on Monday.

==== Serbia ====
In [[Serbia]], the working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day (with 30 minutes break included), 40 hours in total per week. Shops are open on Saturday and Sunday, usually with shorter working hours.

Most shops are open on Saturday mornings and many of the larger shopping malls are open all day Saturday and in some cities like Madrid, they are open most Sundays. Some restaurants, bars, and shops are closed Mondays, as Mondays are commonly a slow business day.&lt;ref&gt;Weekend spanish traditions – ''[http://escapadasdefindesemana.net/ escapadas de fin de semana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020816/http://escapadasdefindesemana.net/ |date=March 5, 2016 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sweden ====
In [[Sweden]], the standard working week is Monday to Friday, both for offices and industry workers. The standard workday is eight hours, although it may vary greatly between different fields and businesses. Most office workers have flexible working hours and can largely decide themselves on how to divide these over the week. The working week is regulated by ''Arbetstidslagen'' (''Work time law'') to a maximum of 40 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arbetstidslagen |url=http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/kapitel02.aspx |publisher=Arbetsmiljöverket |accessdate=August 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318050210/http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/kapitel02.aspx |archivedate=March 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 40-hour-week is however easily bypassed by overtime. The law allows a maximum of 200 hours overtime per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arbetstidslagen – Övertid |url=http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/Kapitel03.aspx |publisher=Arbetsmiljöverket |accessdate=August 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814060859/http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/kapitel03.aspx |archive-date=August 14, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is however no overseeing government agency; the law is often cited as toothless.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Shops are almost always open on Saturdays and often on Sundays, supermarkets and shopping centres, so that employees there have to work. Traditionally, restaurants were closed on Mondays if they were opened during the weekend, but this has in recent years largely fallen out of practice. Many museums do however still remain closed on Mondays.

==== United Kingdom ====
The traditional business working week is from Monday to Friday (35 to 40 hours depending on contract). In retail, and other fields such as healthcare, days off might be taken on any day of the week. Employers can make their employees work every day of a week, although the employer is required to allow each employee breaks of either a continuous period of 24 hours every week or a continuous period of 48 hours every two weeks.

Laws for shop opening hours differ between Scotland and the rest of the UK. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, many shops and services are open on Saturdays and increasingly so on Sundays as well. In England and Wales, stores' maximum Sunday opening hours vary according to the total floor space of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizhelp24.com/law/business-trading-hours-law.html |title=Working Hours – Business Trading Hours |publisher= |access-date=March 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314095843/http://www.bizhelp24.com/law/business-trading-hours-law.html |archive-date=March 14, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, however, there is no restriction in law on shop opening hours on a Sunday.

Under the EU [[Working Time Directive]], workers cannot be forced to work for more than 48 hours per week on average. However, the UK allows individuals to opt out if they so choose. Individuals can choose to opt in again after opting out, even if opting out was part of their employment contract. It is illegal to dismiss them or treat them unfairly for so doing – but they may be required to give up to 3 months notice to give the employer time to prepare, depending on what their employment contract says.&lt;ref name="govuk-workingtime"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours/weekly-maximum-working-hours-and-opting-out |title=Maximum weekly working hours |publisher=HMG |accessdate=October 25, 2014 |date=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum holiday entitlement is now 28 days per year, but that can include public holidays, depending on the employee's contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/Timeoffandholidays/DG_10029788 |title=Holiday entitlement |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; England &amp; Wales have eight, Scotland has nine, and Northern Ireland has ten permanent public holidays each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741 |title=UK bank holidays |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/WorkingHoursAndTimeOff/DG_10029426 Directgov: Working time limits (the 48-hour week)], business trading hours law.&lt;/ref&gt; The 28 days holiday entitlement means that if the government creates a one-off public holiday in a given year, it is not necessarily a day off and it does not add 1 day to employees' holiday entitlement – unless the employer says otherwise, which some do.

Working time must not exceed 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week (on average, annualised).

=== India ===
The standard working week in [[India]] for most office jobs begins on Monday and ends on Saturday. The work schedule is 60 hours per week, Sunday being a rest day. However, most government offices and the software industry follow a five-day workweek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWcTBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT38&amp;ots=IT3sxY-MiS&amp;dq=india%20%22work%20week%22%20(friday%20OR%20saturday)&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PT38#v=onepage&amp;q=india%20%22work%20week%22%20(friday%20OR%20saturday)&amp;f=false |title=bWise: Doing Business in India |last=Dunung |first=Sanjyot P. |date=2015-01-15 |publisher=Atma Global |isbn=978-0-9905459-2-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; All major industries along with services like transport, hospitality, healthcare etc. work in shifts.

Central government offices follow a five-day week. State governments follow half-day working on the first, third, and fifth Saturdays of each month and rest on the second and fourth Saturdays, except West Bengal's government which follows a Monday–Friday workweek. There is usually no half working day in the private sector and people work in two or three shifts of 8hours each.

Generally establishments other than those having pure desk jobs are open until late evening in most cities, offering more flexibility of time to visitors. Most stores are open for six or seven days a week. Retail shops in malls are open on all days. Doctors are mostly available in morning and evening in their clinics and at hospitals during the day. Doctors usually work twelve hour days, six-days a week. Senior doctors and surgeons work more. Most visiting doctors attached to hospitals visit on all days.

Many services are open till 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm or 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm. Most restaurants are open on all days. Small eateries open early and bigger ones open around 11:00&amp;nbsp;am. Most eateries close between 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm. Many highway restaurants called ''[[dhaba]]s'' are open for 24 hours a day. Dhabas are available in large numbers on all major state and national highways; outside city or village limits. Some highway fuel stations are open for 24 hours. Overall India works longer hours in most areas than most of the world and offers more flexibility of time for visitors.

=== Muslim countries ===

==== Thursday–Friday weekend ====
Friday is the Muslim holiday when [[Jumu'ah]] prayers take place. Most of the Middle Eastern countries and some other predominantly Muslim countries used to consider Thursday and Friday as their weekend. However, this weekend arrangement is no longer observed by a significant number of Muslim countries ([[Workweek and weekend#Friday–Saturday weekend|
see below]]).

==== Friday weekend (One day weekend) ====
Three countries in the Muslim world have Friday as the only weekend day and have a six-day working week.
* In [[Iran]], Thursday is half a day of work for most public offices and all schools are closed, but for most jobs, Thursday is a working day. Foreign companies normally have Friday and Saturday as their weekend.
* In [[Djibouti]], many offices also tend to open early – around 7:00 or 8:00, then closing at 13:00 or 14:00, especially during the summer due to the afternoon heat.

==== Friday–Saturday weekend ====
[[Jordan]] was the first Arab country to shift to Friday-Saturday weekend arrangement back in January,2000. Other Arab states followed in the upcoming years. Following reforms in a number of [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Arab states in the Persian Gulf]] in the 2000s and 2010s, the Thursday–Friday weekend was replaced by the Friday–Saturday weekend. This change provided for the Muslim offering of Friday prayers and afforded more work days to coincide with the working calendars of international financial markets.

==== Saturday–Sunday weekend ====
Other countries with Muslim-majority populations or significant Muslim populations follow the Saturday–Sunday weekend, such as [[Indonesia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]]. While Friday is a working day, a long midday break is given to allow time for worship.
* [[Indonesia]] On Friday, due to prayer time for Muslims, the lunch break is extended up to 2 hours or more. Shopping malls are always open and very crowded on Saturday and Sunday. Thus, some banks offer weekend banking services, especially for branches located in or near shopping malls.
* [[Malaysia]] (Federal Territories of [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Labuan]] and [[Putrajaya]], [[Selangor]], [[Perak]], [[Penang]], [[Perlis]], [[Sarawak]], [[Sabah]], [[Pahang]], [[Malacca]], [[Negeri Sembilan]] except the states of [[Johor]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Kedah]], which have a Friday–Saturday weekend)

* [[Morocco]] The working week is Monday to Friday, 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week.
* [[Pakistan]] follows the standard international 40-hour working week, from Monday to Friday, with Saturday and Sunday being the weekend.&lt;ref name="Pakistan weekend"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pakistani Weekend Public Holidays Update |url=http://www.qppstudio.net/public-holidays-news/2010/pakistan_004010.htm |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=December 14, 2011 |date=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many schools and enterprises, Friday is usually considered a half-day.
* [[Senegal]] The working week is Monday to Friday, with a large break on Friday afternoon.
* [[Tunisia]] The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week.
* [[Turkey]] Working above 45 hours is considered overtime, and the employer is required to pay 1.5x the hourly wage per hour.

==== Non-contiguous working week ====
[[Brunei Darussalam]] has a non-contiguous working week, consisting of Monday to Thursday plus Saturday. The days of rest are Friday (for [[Jumu'ah]] prayers) and Sunday.

Some non-government companies in Brunei adopted the working week of Monday to Friday, while the weekend starts on Saturday until Sunday. Depending on the company rules, employees may be required to work half-day on Saturday.

=== Israel ===
In [[Israel]], the standard workweek is 42 hours as prescribed by law. The typical workweek is five days, Sunday to Thursday, with 8.4 hours a day as the standard, with anything beyond that considered overtime. A minority of jobs operate on a partial six-day Sunday-Friday workweek.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davar1.co.il/118603|title=כל מה שצריך לדעת על קיצור שבוע העבודה שנכנס היום (א') לתוקף|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Israelis work overtime hours, with a maximum of 12 overtime hours a week permitted by law. Most offices and businesses run on a five-day week, though many stores, post offices, banks, and schools are open and public transportation runs six days a week. Almost all businesses are closed during Saturday, and most public services except for emergency services, including almost all public transport, are unavailable on Saturdays. However, some shops, restaurants, cafes, places of entertainment, and factories are open on Saturdays, and a few bus and [[share taxi]] lines are active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/open-on-shabbat-israels-fray-of-rest/|title=Open on Shabbat: Israel’s fray of rest|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-sabbath-bus-service-in-israel-detours-around-religious-status-quo-1.5398012|title=Sabbath Bus Service in Israel Finds a Detour Around Religious Status Quo|first1=Lee|last1=Yaron|first2=Almog Ben|last2=Zikri|date=June 20, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transport-in-israel.wikidot.com/shabbat-and-holidays|title=Public transport on Shabbat and holidays - ISRAEL-TRANSPORT.COM|website=transport-in-israel.wikidot.com|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees who work Saturdays, particularly service industry workers, public sector workers, and pilots, are compensated with alternative days off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Israel/Israel-Guide/Jobs/Working-Conditions|title=Working Conditions|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the average workweek was 45.8 hours for men and 37.1 hours for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=By Lee Yaron |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.624900 |title=Israeli Workers’ Average Salary Rose 1.4% in 2013 to $2,376 – Business |publisher=Haaretz |date=2014-11-06 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
The standard business office working week in [[Japan]] begins on Monday and ends on Friday, 40 hours per week. This system became common between 1980 and 2000. Before then, most workers in Japan worked full-time from Monday to Friday and a half day on Saturday, 45–48 hours per week. Public schools and facilities (excluding city offices) are generally open on Saturdays for half a day.&lt;ref name="Jappleng University"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jappleng University (Days of the Week) |url=http://www.jappleng.com/education/jplearn/japanese_lessons/398/days-of-the-week-japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lebanon === 
The working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Some institutions, however, also work 4 hours on Saturdays . Large malls are open on Saturday and Sunday; many small shops close on Sunday.

=== Mexico ===
[[Mexico]] has a 48-hour work week (8 hours × 6 days),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ley federal del trabajo. |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/125.pdf |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604154515/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/125.pdf |archivedate=June 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a custom in most industries and trades to work half day on Saturday. Most public employees work Monday to Friday as well in some office companies. Shops and retailers open on Saturday and Sunday in most large cities.

=== Mongolia ===
[[Mongolia]] has a Monday to Friday working week, with a normal maximum time of 40 hours. Most shops are also open on weekends, many large retail chains having full opening hours even on Sunday. Private enterprises conduct business from 9:00 to 18:00, and government institutions may have full working hours.

=== Nepal ===
Nepal follows the ancient [[Hindu calendar|Vedic calendar]], which has the resting day on Saturday and the first day of the working week on Sunday.&lt;ref name="Vedic Books"&gt;[http://vedicbooks.net/blog/?p=34 Vedic Books], The Vedic Week.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in Nepal are off on Saturdays, so it is common for pupils to go to school from Sunday to Friday.

In November 2012, the home ministry proposed a two-day holiday per week plan for all government offices except at those providing essential services like electricity, water, and telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=44273 |title=MYREPUBLICA.com – News in English from Nepal: Fast, Full &amp; Factual News |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal followed a previous proposal by the Nepali government, i.e. ''Load-shedding Reduction Work Plan 2069 BS'', for a five working day plan for government offices as part of efforts to address the problem of [[load shedding|load-shedding]]. The proposal has been discussed in the Administration Committee; it is not yet clear whether the plan includes private offices and educational institutions.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]] the working week is typically Monday to Friday 8:30 to 17:00, but it is not uncommon for many industries (especially construction) to work a half day on Saturday, normally from 8:00 or 9:00 to about 13:00. Supermarkets, malls, independent retailers, and increasingly, banks, remain open seven days a week.

=== The Philippines ===
In [[the Philippines]], Article 91 of the [[Labor Code of the Philippines|Labor Code]] requires one rest day for workers in a week; the choice of selecting the rest day is left to the employer, subject to [[collective bargaining]]. Most workers avail of Sunday as their mandated rest day. However, government offices, banks, and many non-service industry establishments maintain a five-day (Monday to Friday) work week.

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]] the common working week begins on Monday and ends on Friday with 8 hours per day.

Federal law defines a working week duration of 5 or 6 days with no more than 40 hours worked. In all cases Sunday is a holiday. With a 5-day working week the employer chooses which day of the week will be the second day off. Usually this is a Saturday, but in some organizations (mostly government), it is Monday. Government offices can thereby offer Saturday service to people with a normal working schedule.

There are non-working public holidays in Russia; all of them fall on a fixed date. By law, if such a holiday coincides with an ordinary day off, the next work day becomes a day off. An official public holiday cannot replace a regular day off. Each year the government can modify working weeks near public holidays in order to optimize the labor schedule. For example, if a five-day week has a public holiday on Tuesday or Thursday, the calendar is rearranged to provide a reasonable working week.

Exceptions include occupations such as transit workers, shop assistants, and security guards. In many cases independent schemes are used. For example, the service industry often uses the X-through-Y scheme (Russian: ''X через Y'') when every worker uses X days for work and the next Y days for rest.

==== Soviet Union ====
In the [[Soviet Union]] the standard working week was 41 hours: 8 hours, 12 min. Monday to Friday. Before the mid-1960s there was a 42-hour 6-day standard working week: 7 hours Monday to Friday and 6 hours on Saturday.

=== Singapore ===
In [[Singapore]] the common working week is 5-day work week, which runs from Monday to Friday beginning 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and end at 5 p.m. – 6 p.m. Some companies work a half day on Saturdays. Shops, supermarkets and shopping centres are open seven days a week and on most public holidays. 'Foreign workers', for example domestic helpers and construction workers (typically from the Philippines and India, respectively), usually work 6 days per week, having Sunday as their only day off.

=== South Africa ===
In [[South Africa]] the working week traditionally was Monday to Friday with a half-day on Saturday and Sunday a public holiday. However, since 2013 there have been changes to the working week concept based on more than one variation. The week can be 5 days of work, or more. The maximum number of hours someone can work in a week remains 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/legislation/acts/basic-guides/basic-guide-to-working-hours |title=Basic Guide to Working Hours — Department of Labour |publisher=Labour.gov.za |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]] the working week is Monday to Saturday for a maximum of 44 to 48 hours per week (Saturday can be a half or full day).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

However, government offices and some private companies have modernised through enacting the American and European standard of working Monday through Friday.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Currently, 50% of the luxury beach resorts in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] have a five-day working week. Of the remaining 50%, 23% have taken steps to reform their 6-day workweek through such measures as reducing the working week from 6 days to 5.5 days.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== United States ===
The standard working week in the [[United States]] begins on Monday and ends on Friday, 40 hours per week, with Saturday and Sunday being weekend days. However, in practice, only 42% of employees work 40-hour weeks. The average workweek for full-time employees is 47 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-average-workweek-gallup-labor-day-20140829-story.html |title=Average full-time workweek is 47 hours, Gallup says |publisher=LA Times |date=2014-08-29 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most stores are open for business on Saturday and often on Sunday as well, except in a few places where prohibited by law (see [[Blue law]]). Increasingly, employers are offering compressed work schedules to employees. Some government and corporate employees now work a 9/80 work schedule (80 hours over 9 days during a two-week period)—commonly 9 hour days Monday to Thursday, 8 hours on one Friday, and off the following Friday. There are also some government or corporate employees that work a 10/40 schedule–40 hours per week over 4 days, usually with Fridays off. Jobs in healthcare, law enforcement, transportation, retail, and other service positions commonly require employees to work on the weekend or to do shift work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tnsemployeeinsights.com/non-traditional-work-hours-and-retention/ |title=Non-Traditional Work Hours and Retention |publisher=tnsemployeeinsights.com|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
[[Vietnam]] has a standard 48-hour six-day workweek. Monday to Friday are full workdays and Saturday is a partial day. Work typically begins at 8:00 AM and lasts until 5:00 PM from Monday to Friday and until 12:00 PM on Saturdays. This includes a one-hour lunch break. Government offices and banks follow a five-day workweek from Monday to Friday..&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam Labor Laws and Regulations Handbook: Strategic Information and Basic Laws''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vietnamcheaptours.com/Tourist-Information/Time-and-working-hours/Time-and-working-hours.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503173942/http://www.vietnamcheaptours.com/Tourist-Information/Time-and-working-hours/Time-and-working-hours.html |archive-date=May 3, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Álvaro de Oliveira Madaleno Sobrinho''' (born 1962) is an Angolan [[philanthropist]], [[banker]] and [[business]]man.

== Career ==

===Banco Espírito Santo===
Following ten years with Grupo Banco Espírito Santo, Sobrinho became one of the youngest ever directors of [[Banco Espírito Santo]] (BES) in [[Lisbon]] (aged 38) and was subsequently tasked with founding the subsidiary company in Angola, [[Banco Espírito Santo Angola]] (BESA). Throughout his time at BESA, the bank received multiple awards, including the World Finance award as the Best Bank in Angola in 2009, and Global Finance Magazine's award as the Best Bank in Angola in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfolio.co.uk/region/africa/angola/alvaro-sobrinho-besa |title=Angola - Alvaro Sobrinho, Chairman of BESA - Worldfolio - AFA PRESS |publisher=Worldfolio |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102124546/www.worldfolio.co.uk/region/africa/angola/alvaro-sobrinho-besa |archive-date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Portuguese weekly newspaper ''[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]]'' reported that BESA did not know to whom it had extended loans worth US$5.7 billion - around 80 percent of its debt portfolio - during the mandate of previous chief executive Álvaro Sobrinho, who left the post in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2018/03/03/sociedade/noticia/alvaro-sobrinho-suspeito-de-desviar-centenas-de-milhoes-de-euros-do-besa-1805255|title=Grupo Espírito Santo.

'''Đorđe Vajfert''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Ђорђе Вајферт}}, {{lang-de|Georg Weifert}}; 15 June 1850{{spaced ndash}}12 January 1937) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] industrialist of [[Germans|German]] descent, [[List of governors of national banks of Serbia and Yugoslavia|Governor]] of the [[National Bank of Serbia]] and later [[National Bank of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="NBS"&gt;[https://www.nbs.rs/internet/english/10/10_8/10_8_2.html Governors of the National Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is considered the founder of the modern mining sector in Serbia and a great benefactor.

==Biography==
Georg Weifert was born in [[Pančevo]], [[Germany|German]] [[Banat]] to a [[Danube Swabian]] family. From an early age Đorđe Vajfert worked with his father, Ignatz Weifert in [[Belgrade]], in brewing. Theirs was the first brewery in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. He graduated from the ''Braumeisterschule'' in [[Weihenstephan]], near [[Munich]]. Then he returned to Serbia and took over the brewery of his father, which he expanded. With the profits he bought a coal mine in [[Kostolac]], then a copper mine in [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]], a Steinberg works at [[Zaječar]] and finally a gold mine. With the proceeds from the mines, he was the richest man in Serbia and was considered the greatest industrialist of the future [[Yugoslavia]].

In 1890 Vajfert was appointed Governor of the [[National Bank of Serbia]]. He served in this capacity from 1890 to 1902, and again from 1912 to 1914/1918.&lt;ref name="NBS"/&gt; During this period he acquired a good reputation maintaining the value of the [[Serbian dinar]] and in credit. After 1918, because of his good offices, Vajfert was appointed Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="NBS"/&gt; His best-known arrangement as Governor was the conversion of the [[Austro-Hungarian krone]] into the new [[Yugoslav dinar]]. This also led to great criticism, as the former Serbian dinar was exchanged 1:1 in the new dinar, the Austrian money into a 4:1 ratio - this led to substantial losses of property of those Yugoslavs who formerly lived in [[Austria-Hungary]]. 
[[File:1000RSD front.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Weifert on the 1000 [[Serbian dinar]] bill.]]

Đorđe Vajfert was an important patron and supporter of humanitarian and cultural institutions. He donated his prized collection of ancient coins and his private library to the [[University of Belgrade]]. In [[Pančevo]], from where his parents Ignatz and Anna originated, he left the [[Roman Catholic]] Church a small chapel known as ''Anina crkva'' (the Church of Anna), in memory of his mother.

As a major benefactor, opened a large Catholic cemetery Pancevo, where they are still the remains of family members Vajfert. They also built a fund from your Pancevo St. Anne Catholic Church and many other public and charitable institutions.

He died on 12 January 1937, at 17:20 pm at his villa in Belgrade. The funeral service was held in the Catholic Church of St. Anne Pancevo 14 January, and the 15th was buried in the Catholic cemetery Pančevo. The heir to his business empire was his nephew Ferdinand Gramberg. Since 2001, his portrait is depicted on the 1000 Serbian dinar note.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbs.rs/export/internet/english/75/75_4/index.html Banknotes Withdrown from circulation]&lt;/ref&gt;
