{{French art history}}

'''17th-century French art''' is generally referred to as [[Baroque]], but from the mid to late 17th century, the style of French art shows a [[classicism|classical]] adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque as it was practiced in most of the rest of Europe during the same period.

== Louis XIII style ==
{{main|Louis XIII style}}
In the early part of the 17th century, late [[Mannerism|mannerist]] and early [[Baroque]] tendencies continued to flourish in the court of [[Marie de' Medici]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].  Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe (Dutch and Flemish schools) and from Roman painters of the [[Counter-Reformation]].  Artists in France frequently debated the merits between [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors) and [[Nicolas Poussin]] (rational control, proportion, Roman classicism).

There was also a strong [[Caravaggio]] school represented in the period by the candle-lit paintings of [[Georges de La Tour]].  The wretched and the poor were featured in an almost Dutch manner in the paintings by the three [[Le Nain]] brothers.  In the paintings of [[Philippe de Champaigne]] there are both propagandistic portraits of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]' s minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and other more contemplative portraits of people in the [[Jansenist]] sect.

== Residential architecture ==
{{Main|French baroque architecture}}

However, under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy was not in French taste ([[Bernini]]'s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.)  Through [[propaganda]], wars and great architectural works, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name.  The [[Palace of Versailles]], initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties.  Architect [[Louis Le Vau]], painter and designer [[Charles Le Brun]] and the landscape architect [[André Le Nôtre]] created marvels : fountains danced; wandering revelers discovered hidden grottos in the gardens.

The initial impetus for this transformation of Versailles is generally linked to the private château [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] built for Louis XIV's minister of Finance [[Nicolas Fouquet]].  Having offered a lavish festival for the king in the newly finished residence in 1661 (Le Brun, Le Vau, Le Nôtre, the poet [[La Fontaine]], the playwright [[Molière]] were all under Fouquet's patronage), the minister was accused of misappropriation of funds and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  The architects and artists under his patronage were all put to work on Versailles.

==The court of Louis XIV==
{{main|Style Louis XIV}}
In this period, Louis' minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] established royal control over [[artisan]]al production in France; henceforth France would no longer purchase luxury goods from abroad, but would, herself, set the standard for quality. This control was also seen in the creation of an academy of painting and sculpture, which maintained a [[hierarchy of genres]] in painting (the "noblest," according to [[André Félibien]] in 1667, being [[history painting]]), a strong use of pictorial [[rhetoric]], and a strict sense of decorum in subject matter.{{Citation needed|reason=May 30, 2008|date=May 2008}}

Furnishings and [[interior design]]s from this period are referred to as ''Louis XIV-style''; the style is characterized by weighty [[brocade]]s of red and gold, thickly [[gilding|gilded]] [[plaster]] [[molding (decorative)|molding]], large sculpted [[sideboard]]s, and heavy [[marble|marbling]].{{Citation needed|reason=May 30, 2008|date=May 2008}}

In 1682 Versailles was transformed into the official residence of the king; eventually the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] was built; other smaller ''[[château]]x'', like the [[Grand Trianon]], were built on the grounds, and a huge [[canal]] featuring [[gondola]]s and gondoliers from [[Venice]] was created.

Through his wars and the glory of Versailles, Louis became, to a certain degree, the arbiter of taste and power in Europe and both his ''château'' and the etiquette in Versailles were copied by the other European courts.  Yet the difficult wars at the end of his long reign and the religious problems created by the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] made his last years dark ones.{{Citation needed|reason=May 30, 2008|date=May 2008}}

'''Applied folklore''' is the branch of [[folkloristics]] concerned with the study and use of [[folklore]] and [[traditional]] [[culture|cultural]] materials to address or solve real social problems.  The term was coined in 1939 in a talk by [[folklorist]] [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] who, along with [[Alan Lomax]], became the foremost proponent of this approach over the next thirty years.  Applied folklore is similar in its rationale and approach to [[applied anthropology]] and other [[applied social science]]s, and like these other applied approaches often distinguishes itself from "pure" research, that which has no explicit problem-solving aims.

Botkin's development of the approach emerged from his work on the collecting by the [[Federal Writers' Project]] of [[oral history|oral narratives]] of former [[slaves]], when he worked for the [[Library of Congress]].  He saw the dissemination of these materials as having the potential to improve [[race relations]] in the [[United States]] and to combat prejudice.  The [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition movement]] had similarly used the oral narratives of escaped slaves, such as those collected by [[William Still]] in his ''[[Underground Railroad]] Records'', to draw support for their cause.  Botkin's landmark work, ''[[Lay My Burden Down (book)|Lay My Burden Down]]'' (1945) was the first American book to treat oral [[testimony|testimonies]] as [[historiography|historical]] [[evidence]], and it was another thirty years before this became accepted practice.  Botkin also worked with [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] activist [[Rachel Davis DuBois]] to develop public programs to improve race and [[ethnic]] relations by incorporating cultural practices and materials into neighborhood events, such as [[festivals]] and block parties.  Independent of this, [[Myles Horton]], [[Zilphia Horton]], [[Guy Carawan]], [[Candie Carawan]], and others at the [[Highlander Folk School]] in [[Tennessee]] incorporated [[folk song]] and [[folk dance]] into the training of [[civil rights]] activists, such as [[Rosa Parks]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]].

In the 1960s, other American folklorists began to apply knowledge gained from folkloric sources to address social issues, most notably drawing on [[folk medicine]] in the teaching and practice of [[holistic health|holistic]] and [[cross-cultural]] approaches to [[medicine]] and [[public health]].  Folklorists also began to work as consultants in [[city planning]], [[gerontology]], [[economic development]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] [[education]], [[conservation biology|conservation]], and other fields.

Painted in the early 12th century, it was in the church of [[Sant Climent de Taüll]] at the [[Vall de Boí]], [[Alta Ribagorça]] in the Catalan [[Pyrenees]] until removed in 1919-1923, along with other parts of the fresco decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/apse-sant-climent-de-taull/mestre-de-taull/015966-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apse has been replaced in the church by a replica, and some original decoration remains there. MNAC Barcelona also has the paintings from the triumphal arches, a side apse, the consecration inscription and an earlier window.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/apse-sant-climent-de-taull/mestre-de-taull/015966-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Its genius lies in the way it combines elements from different Biblical visions (''[[Revelation]]'', ''[[Isaiah and Ezekiel]]'') to present the ''[[Christ of the Day of Judgement]]''. Christ appears from the background causing a movement outwards from the centre of the composition, which is presided by the ornamental sense of the outlines and the skilful use of colour to create volume. The exceptional nature of this work and its pictorial strength have reached out to modernity and fascinated twentieth-century avant-garde artists like [[Picasso]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/apse-sant-climent-de-taull/mestre-de-taull/015966-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The round surface beneath Christ’s feet represents the earth and the halo on his head represents divinity. Christ’s right hand symbolizes blessing, and in his left hand he holds a book with the words EGO SUM LUX MUNDI, which translates in English to “I am the light of the world”. The symbols of Alpha and Omega hanging like lamps on either side of Christ, symbolize the beginning and end. The fourfold images represent four evangelists. To the right, an angel is seen beside the lion holding one of its hind legs, which is a symbol of St. Mark. To the left, an angel holding the tail of the bull is a symbol of St. Luke. The other two evangelists fit into the triangular space on either side of the mandorla. An angel holding the Gospel Book represents St. Matthew, and the other angel is St. John holding an eagle in his arms. Below the mural painting of Christ in the mandorla is St Thomas, St Bartholomew, Mother of God, St. John the Evangelist, St. James and San Felipe. The Mother of God holds a bowl where red rays emerge from it, which symbolize the blood of Christ.

== History ==
The paintings in the central apse of Sant Climent in Taüll are the most emblematic in the Museum’s collection of Romanesque art and make up one of the most representative and one of the finest works of Romanesque art.

The central theme of the apse is a Theophany, or vision of God, at the end of time, based mainly on the text of Revelation. In the middle, Christ in Majesty inscribed in a mandorla, seated on the arc of Heaven and with the Earth at his feet, blesses
with his right hand, while his left holds a book with the inscription EGO SUM LUX MUNDI (‘I am the light of the world’). On either side are the Alpha and the Omega, symbols that God is the beginning and the end of all things. He is surrounded by
the four Evangelists. Saints, apostles and the Virgin Mary occupy the semi-cylinder and several scenes from the Old and New Testaments are depicted on the arches over the entrance to the apse. One scene that stands out is of Lazarus the beggar at
the door of the rich man Epulon’s house, on the intrados of the arch, and at the top, the hand of God and the Agnus Dei (the Lamb of God), symbolising the death and resurrection of Christ (Rev 5, 6-14).

The style combines the geometricisation of forms and the general symmetry of the composition with the decorativism in the details and ornamental elements.

The volume of the pronounced drapery is geometrical, emphasised by coloured lines and glazing, contrasting with the flat tones of the background. In addition, the symmetry, frontality, hieratic nature and the very representation of God could
derive from Byzantine art, possibly via Italy. The bands of colour in the backgrounds, present in many Catalan Romanesque paintings, could remind us of what is known as Mozarabic illumination in tenth-century Hispanic manuscripts.

The exceptional artistic nature and the high quality of these paintings have been corroborated by the study of the pigments, which are of better quality and preparation than in other Catalan churches. Some imported pigments have even been found.
Through the use of superimposed layers, the painter obtains more intense chromatic effects. Thus blue, obtained from aerinite, is applied over a layer of black, and cinnabar is applied over haematite to get red.

Painted on one of the columns of the nave is the church’s inscription of consecration by bishop Ramon de Roda from Ribagorza on 10 December 1123. This reference is fundamental for dating the paintings, of which there are still remains in situ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4080">The '''Australian Music Foundation''' [AMF] is a charitable foundation, first established in the United Kingdom, with the chief purpose of providing financial support to outstanding young Australian musicians who wish to pursue post-graduate music courses in leading music education institutions around the globe. It also offers performance opportunities in Australia and abroad, advice and mentoring to awardees.

At inception, the AMF’s activities were centred on the UK, reflecting a historical tradition of strong institutional links between Australian music academies and British institutions such as the [[Royal College of Music]], [[Royal Academy of Music]], the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]. In recent years the AMF has more actively expanded its field of activity to include North America, Europe, and South East Asia.

==History==

{{Use Irish English|date=June 2018}}
{{Use DMY dates|date=June 2018}}
The '''Coggalbeg hoard''' is an [[Early Bronze Age]] [[hoard]] of goldwork jewellery dating to 4300–4000 [[Before Present|BP]]. It was found in a [[bog]] at Coggalbeg, [[County Roscommon]], Ireland in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;[[Fintan O'Toole|O'Toole, Fintan]]. "[https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/a-history-of-ireland-in-100-objects-1.562035 A history of Ireland in 100 objects]". ''[[Irish Times]]'', April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of a [[gold lunula]] (a crescent shaped "little moon") and two small gold discs, of a type known from other examples, decorated with a cross motif within two circles. The pieces are flat and thin, and collectively weigh under {{Convert|78|g|}}, indicating that they were probably intended as part of a necklace.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/02/stolen-treasure-the-coggalbeg-hoard/ Stolen treasure: The Coggalbeg Hoard]". Irish Archaeology (with image)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The hoard was discovered in 1945 by Hubert Lannon while cutting [[turf]] on his bog in Roscommon. From 1947, it was kept in a safe at Sheehan's Chemists in [[Strokestown]], during which time it was only seen by members of the Sheehan family.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.museum.ie/Corporate-Media/Media-Information/Media-Releases-Archives/Media-Releases-2011/November-2011/Safe-Secrets-The-Story-of-the-Coggalbeg-Hoard Safe Secrets The Story of the Coggalbeg Hoard]". [[National Museum of Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following a break-in at the pharmacy, in which the safe was stolen, the objects were found by the [[Garda Síochána]] (Irish police) wrapped in paper in a rubbish skip in April 2009. Due to its lightness in weight, police believe that the thieves were primarily interested in cash and were not aware of the objects' presence in the discarded loot.&lt;ref name="p8toole" /&gt;

Today it is held by the [[National Museum of Ireland]], where it is on permanent display. According to Mary Cahill of the museum, the objects are significant as the only extant "association between the discs and the lunula, because the discs would be considered among the earliest gold ornaments and the lunula as coming a little bit later".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://100objects.ie/coggalbeggold-hoard/ Coggalbeg Gold Hoard, 2300-2000BC]".

'''Contemporary art in Egypt''' is a term used to [[visual art]] including installations, [[Film|videos]], [[paintings]], [[sculptures]] developed in the [[Egypt]]ian art scene. While the Contemporary Art scene is mainly concentrated in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]], it is developing fast with the emergence of spaces for artists, and support from the public and from abroad. Many Egyptian artists use the Egyptian contemporary art scene as a ramp toward the international.

== History ==
While Egyptian [[contemporary art]] has always centered around national political and social aspects, there has clearly been some phases that accentuated other aspects present in Egyptian artists' work.

=== Pioneer generation and modern art: 1920–1956 ===
This era was the establishing stage of the [[contemporary art]] in [[Egypt]]. Most of the intellectual in the first part of the 20th century were going to foreign school, whether located in [[Egypt]] or abroad (mostly [[Europe]]), and pioneers were routed in a European tradition. While it emerged late, mainly because of the Islamic ban on pictorial art, Egyptian contemporary art strongly focused on the national aspect. Through history, traditions and national culture, contemporary artists were emerging mainly in [[Cairo]] and in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Engelstad|first=Svein|title=Historical Themes in Modern Egyptian Art|url=http://folk.uio.no/sveinen/egypt/egypt-art-lund01.pdf|publisher=Oslo University|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is during those decades that Egyptian modern art, institutionalized by the creation of the Prince Youssef Kamel Art School&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121119034419/http://www.helwan.edu.eg/fineartsen/fenongamela.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1908, began to shift toward a more contemporary composant, giving birth to Egyptian contemporary art.

''Main artists'' : 
* Mohamed Nagi&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101113170700/http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Story.aspx?sid=1319]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]] (1891–1934)
* Ramy Asaad
* Ragheb Ayad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almasargallery.com/ragheb-ayad-biography |title=Contemporary Art |publisher=Al Masar Gallery |date=2016-12-05 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1892–1982)

=== Nasserism and Egyptian art ===
This period is characterized by several events. First, the creation of [[Israel]] [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|in 1948]], followed by the war, has marked the spirits of Egyptians artists. [[Nasser]]'s accession to the presidency also played a role in the transformation of the contemporary art scene in Egypt.

The first consequence is the dissociation from [[Western civilization|the West]] for many Egyptian artists. This is caused by the support from the West during the creation of the state of [[Israel]]. The contemporary art hence took its influence from the rising [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] cause.

The presidency of [[Nasser]] also had a strong impact. In addition to more and more engaged art, contemporary artists started to express through their work the [[panarabism]] [[Nasser]] was trying to implement.  The main theme of this era was the Arab unity, not only after the [[Palestinian cause]], but also by the expansion of contemporary art through the Arab world. The aspects of [[contemporary art]] at this period have shifted from Western influence to common Arab culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

''Main artists :''
* [[Abdel Hadi Al Gazzar]] (1925–1966)
* [[Inji Efflatoun]] (1924–1989)
* [[Kamal Amin]] (1923–1979)

=== 1970–2000 : reemergence of Islamic aspects ===
[[Anwar Sadat]] accessed the presidency in 1970, and in order to counteract the nasserists left wing,  allowed the coming back of [[Islamism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=en arabe Anwar al-Sādāt |url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Sadate/141978 |title=Encyclopédie Larousse en ligne - Anouar el- Sadate en arabe Anwar al-Sādāt |website=Larousse.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same period, [[contemporary art]] has seen the emergence of Islamic aspects in the works, sometimes even stronger than social and political aspects,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; through the introduction of [[calligraphy]], or through works depicting Islamic historic events.

The regional aspect was also stronger, where regional Arab culture was a source of inspiration for artists.  The emergence of Islamic aspects also played a role in reinforcing the pan-arabism feeling.

* Atteya Mostafa

===The 2000–2011 era===

In 1998, the [[Townhouse Gallery]] was launched. This marks the beginning of a new era in Egyptian contemporary Art toward the will to democratize the art to any audience. New mediums of art emerging, such as video or installations, and the number of open and free art spaces is rising mainly in Cairo and Alexandria.

However, this development of the Egyptian contemporary art is still facing censorship from the government, the lack of funding from official sources, and the influence of foreign curators on the work exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Rocha|first=Sean|title=Vision of Cairo|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/visions-of-cairo/1|publisher=Travel and Leisure|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Egyptian arts post-2011 revolution ==
The [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] and the fall of former Egyptian President, [[Hosni Mubarak]], ushered a new era of arts that reflects new social and political environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Amelia|title=Revolution Graffiti: Street Art of the new Egypt|url=http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/media-review/book-review/5599-revolution-graffiti-street-art-of-the-new-egypt|publisher=Middle East Monitor|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The revolution triggered a new public culture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abaza|first=Mona|title=Walls, Segregating Downtown Cairo and the Mohammed Mahmud Street Graffiti|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society |date=9 October 2012|volume=30|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the revolution, artists played a significant role in the protests. Likewise, many genres of arts emerged such as [[street art]], music and what so called 'electro sha'bi' or 'Techno sha'bi'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Parshley|first=Lois|title=For Egypt's Graffiti Artists Revolution Brings Inspiration and Uncertainty|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/10/for-egypts-graffiti-artists-revolution-brings-inspiration-and-uncertainty/245941/|magazine=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists used arts to document and capture the essence of the revolution. They also  distribute their arts through on- line and social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kholeif|first=Omar|title=The Social Impulse: Politics, Meida and Art After the Arab Uprisings|url=http://www.artandeducation.net/paper/the-social-impulse-politics-media-and-art-after-the-arab-uprisings/|publisher=Art &amp; education|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti and political song are among the most powerful tools in the new public culture.

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] comes from the Greek word "Graphien", which means "to write". Graffiti today has been defined as "the act of inscribing or drawing on walls for the purpose of communicating a message to the general public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Werwath|first=Timothy|title=The Culture and Politics of Graffiti Art|url=http://www.graffiti.org/faq/werwath/werwath.html|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, graffiti is dating back to the Pharonic period when the Egyptians used to document their daily life on the temple walls.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heider|first=Abeer|title=Graffiti in Post Revolutionary Egypt Using Graffiti as a Language Source in the AFL Classroom|date=29 March 2012|url=http://eurocallsigsbologna.weebly.com/uploads/8/7/4/5/8745414/heider_bologna_2012_eurocall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern-day Egypt, and during Mubarak era, graffiti was illegal and classified as a "misdemeanor."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Before 2011 revolution, graffiti served as a channel to promote the reclamation of public space, via positive cultural and social exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irving Jensen|first=Michael|title=Streets of Cairo - Art in Public Space|url=http://dedi.org.eg/wp-content/uploads/flippage/book.html#p=4|publisher=The Danish Egyptian Dialogue Institute|accessdate=16 April 2013|author2=Gry Krogager Lund}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graffiti were mostly featuring religious, advertisements or romantic declarations, even though a couple of urban artists were already active.&lt;ref name="Schielke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schielke|first=Samuli|title=The Writing on Walls of Egypt|url=http://www.merip.org/mer/mer265/writing-walls-egypt|publisher=Middle East Research and Information Project|accessdate=16 April 2013|author2=Jessica Winegar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of "revolutionary graffiti" in Egypt took place during the first days of the revolution when Egyptians protesters convey uncensored political messages against Mubarak's regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morayef|first=Soraya|title=Street Art and The City|url=http://www.thearabreview.org/cairo-street-art-revolution/|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the toppling of Mubarak, graffiti has become an alternative media channel, documenting different political events that taking place in the country and paying homage to activists who died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zayan|first=Jailan|title=Street art: Gutsy graffiti captures evolution of Egypt uprising|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=56607|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some streets inside and outside [[Cairo]] turned into graffiti hubs such as [[Mohamed Mahmoud Graffiti|Mohamed Mahmoud Street]] in Cairo and Al Gomhuria in [[Assiut]].

Meanwhile, graffiti reflects the controversial political debate in Egypt post revolution and during [[Muslim Brotherhood]] ruling era. On one hand, the streets around [[Tahrir square]] have become a graffiti gallery of opposing the current regime of [[Mohamed Morsi]] who is accused of failing to reform post-revolution Egypt while consolidating power in the hands of his Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=AFP|title=Gutsy graffiti recounts two years of Egypt revolt|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2013/01/23/262007.html|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=Al Arabiyia News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in some districts inside Cairo and Assiut, only pro- Morsi graffiti exist in streets' walls.&lt;ref name="Schielke"/&gt;

Egyptian graffiti artists are also raising awareness on socio-political subjects as diverse as corruption, poverty, media brainwashing or sexual harassment. Moreover, they use graffiti as a tool to beautify slum areas in Cairo, restoring a sense of ownership, pride and hope to its residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suze in the city |title=Graffiti for a social cause: Zeft, Nazeer Nemo and Mona Lisa Brigade|url=http://suzeeinthecity.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/graffiti-for-a-social-cause-zeft-nazeer-nemo-and-mona-lisa-brigades/ |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Egyptian graffiti are complex cultural products of an urban self-aware society that finds itself at a crossroad. The revolution, as Ursula Lindsey points out "has accelerated the valorization of Egypt's burgeoning youth culture and its "underground" and "independent" artists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindsey|first=Ursula|title=Art in Egypt's Revolutionary Square|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/interventions/art-egypts-revolutionary-square|publisher=MERIP |date=|accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These artists are committed to freely expressing themselves, engaging in a civic dialog with the society, re-appropriating in this way a public space from which the previous authoritarian regime deprived the Egyptians. The large corpus of graffiti available shows a high incidence of national and gender related imagery highlighting the political and social themes that engage different sides of the Egyptian society. Through graffiti and its  predominant imagery we can catch a glimpse of how the Egyptians reconstruct national symbols and how events of the revolution are memorialized not only preventing them from oblivion but transforming them into symbols of national identity. As Susan Philips indicates "if graffiti is a window into a culture (...) then it is the same window that people use to look in on themselves as they actively construct the guidelines and concerns of their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Susan|title=Wallbangin' graffiti and gangs in L.A.|publisher= University of Chicago Press|date= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Cairene graffiti show us is that the Egyptian (post-) revolutionary society valorizes its recent and remote past and cultural heritage to which its identity is tributary.  Nonetheless, as witnesses of important social and political change, the walls of Cairo contribute to transforming the actors of the revolution into symbols of cohesion and mobilization while keeping their memory alive and promoting the social and political causes they stand for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nicoarea|first=Georgiana|url=https://www.academia.edu/6464638/Cairos_New_Colors_Rethinking_Identity_in_the_Graffiti_of_the_Egyptian_Revolution |title=Cairo's New Colors: Rethinking Identity in the Graffiti of the Egyptian Revolution |journal=Romano-Arabica Journal |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political song and music===
The purpose of political songs is to move and unify the crowds in a state that '[[Durkheim]] has called "[[collective effervescence]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swedenburg|first=Ted|title=Egypt's Music of Protest From Sayyid Darwish to DJ Haha|url=http://www.merip.org/mer/mer265/egypts-music-protest|publisher=MER265|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian political song is always playing a crucial role at provoking the public to be politically active. Take the song "patriotic Port Said"  by El Tanbura The song refers to the [[Suez war|1956 Suez war]], when [[Israel]], [[France]] and [[Great Britain]] attacked [[Egypt]] after President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalized the [[Suez Canal]]. El Tanbura is a collective of musicians from the city of Port Said on the Suez Canal, formed by Zakariyya Ahmad in 1978. They also performed other nationalist songs in various political and time phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=El Mastaba Centre for Egyptian Folk Music |url=http://eltanbura.org/ |title=El Tanbura &amp;#124; News &amp; Tour Dates |website=Eltanbura.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to discuss Egyptian political songs after the 25th of January Revolution without recalling the role played by pioneer musician [[Sheikh Imam]] in politics in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaatari|first=Ahmad|title=Tahrir Square Music: Sounds of Rebels|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/3675|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=alakhbar English|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sheikh Imam is a major pillar of the Arabic political song which motivated thousands of workers and intellectuals rebellious against decadent times and ambitious for better tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Staff Writers"&gt;{{cite web|author=Al Jadid Staff Writers |title=The Legacy of the Late Sheikh Imam, Creator Of Modern Arabic Political Song|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/egypt/700/780/sheikh-imam/aljadid-sheikh.html|publisher=Al Jadid|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sheikh Imam met the poet [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]] in 1962, the two formed an influential duo and developed the popular political song. The 1967 War brought the duo to reflect the impact of f Arab defeat in their revolutionary songs ''Misr Ya Bahia'' [Pretty Egypt], ''Shayid Kussurak'' [Build Your Palaces], ''Ghifara'' [Che Ghivara], El Fallahin [the Peasants] and ''Mur El Kalam'' [Bitter Talk] "The music of Sheikh Imam was marked by a form of totality that made his political song travel beyond the geographical location of its origin."&lt;ref name="Staff Writers"/&gt; Many other popular Egyptian singers contribute in political song such as [[Um Kalthoum]], [[Abdel Halim Hafez]], and [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab|Abdel Wahab]] who composed "[[Al Watan Al Akbar|''Al watan Al Akbar'']]" The Greatest Homeland in 1960 and it was produced to celebrate the union of Egypt &amp; Syria into the [[United Arab Republic]].

In 2011, Egypt witnesses a new and distinguished wave of political songs, in which unknown young singers and [[underground bands]] played a significant role to keep the protesters' spirit high during 18 days revolution. Singers such as Ramy Esam, Amir Eid and Hani Adel, Rami Donjewan and other bands like Eskenderella used to rock Tahrir square with their political lyrics and influential music. These singers continue to tackle Egyptian social and political issues in their songs.

Another important and emergent genre of contemporary Egyptian music is ''Mahragan'' (مهرجان) ("festival") or ''Mahraganat'' (مهرجانات) (pl. "festivals"), which originated in working-class neighborhoods and in particular from the ''{{'}}ashwa'iyyat'' (shanty towns) on the peripheries of Cairo and Alexandria. This genre, which started to appear on YouTube in 2007, has gained immense popularity among the youngest generations of Egyptians. Additionally, in the last several years the genre has gained international traction through numerous international tours and various collaborations with European Electronic artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mixtape art by: Mumdance &amp; Ross J. Platt |url=http://www.dummymag.com/mixes/dummy-mix-205-mumdance-mahraganat-mixtape |title=Dummy Mix 205 // Mumdance |publisher=Dummy Mag |date=2014-04-17 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music has also been called techno-sha'bi or electro-sha'bi, which refers to the older genre of sha'bi (شعبي) ("folk") music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mer/mer265/egypts-music-protest|title=Egypt"s Music of Protest by Ted Swedenberg|last=Swedenburg|first=Ted|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many ''Mahragan'' artists have resisted this designation, as they see their music as something completely new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mosa’ab Elshamy |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/egypt-new-music-mahraganat-sadat-electro-shaabi.html |title='Mahraganat': New Hybrid Music Wave Sweeps Egypt |website=Al-monitor.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists, such as Okka and Ortega, have argued that ''Mahragan'' is more closely aligned with American Rap/Hip-Hop than with other Egyptian musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzlicKV0gq4 |title=أوكا وأورتيجا وشعبان عبد الرحيم في أجرأ الكلام |language=ar |trans-title=Oka and Ortega and Shaaban Abdel-Rahim in the boldest speech |publisher=YouTube |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mahragan'', usually recorded in make-shift home studios and traded via YouTube and USB sticks, is a mix of either sung (often with auto-tune) or rapped vocals over sampled beats that provide a heavy, energetic, and fast-paced musical soundtrack. Some of the most popular ''mahragan'' performers are Figo, Sadat, Alaa' Fifty Cent, DJ Amr Haha (often stylized as 7a7a), Islam Fanta, Weza, Okka and Ortega.

==Themes==
===Ancient history===
Artists took their inspiration in Egyptian [[Pharaonic Egypt|pharaonic]] heritage, which is omnipresent in [[Egypt]], through paintings, architecture or sculptures. The main occurring symbol is the [[pyramid]], repeatedly used by artists, as a way of expressing the Egyptian national identity.

Mostafa Abdel Moity's work, the Pyramid motif is strongly present in most of his sculptures. He often represents the three Great Pyramids of [[Pyramids of Giza|Gizeh]]. This is a way a reaffirming the strong influence of Egyptian ancient history.

[[The Nile]] is also a very recurring aspect of Egyptian culture and beliefs, a sign of fertility, but also in Egyptian contemporary art. Mythological stories from Ancient Egypt often use the Nile as the center of the story, and so do Egyptian contemporary artists.

===Religion===
The religious aspect is also repeatedly used in Egyptian contemporary Art either through the form of calligraphy or the description of Islamic events .
Classical calligraphy is a source of inspiration for a lot of artworks, and its evolution through the centuries has made it a rich theme in Egyptian contemporary art. In works by Taha Hussein, the aesthetic aspect of the calligraphy is studied by the artist, mostly superposition of letters written in unreadable calligraphy.

===Women===
[[Women]] are also a frequent theme in Egyptian contemporary art. [[Inji Efflatoun]], in her paintings often depicts women in different positions. This represent the burden Egyptian women are carrying since their birth because of their gender. Injy Efflatoun was well known to be a feminist, fighting for women rights through her work.

'''''Deep Throat''''' is a 1972 American [[pornographic film]] that was at the forefront of the [[Golden Age of Porn]] (1969–1984). The film was written and directed by [[Gerard Damiano]], who was listed in the credits as "Jerry Gerard"; produced by Louis Peraino, credited as "Lou Perry"; and starring [[Linda Lovelace]], the pseudonym given to Linda Susan Boreman.

One of the first pornographic films to feature a plot, character development, and relatively high production values, ''Deep Throat'' earned mainstream attention and launched the "[[Golden Age of Porn|porno chic]]" trend, even though the film was banned in some jurisdictions and was the subject of obscenity trials.

==Plot==
A sexually frustrated woman, [[Linda Lovelace]] (Linda Boreman), asks her friend Helen (Dolly Sharp) for advice on how to achieve an [[orgasm]]. After a [[Sex party (group sex)|sex party]] provides no help, Helen recommends that Linda visit a psychiatrist, Dr. Young ([[Harry Reems]]). The doctor discovers that Linda's [[clitoris]] is located in her throat, and after he helps her to develop her [[oral sex]] skills, the infatuated Linda asks him to marry her. He informs her that she can settle for a job as his therapist, performing her particular oral technique—thereafter known as "[[Deep-throating|deep throat]]"—on various men, until she finds the one to marry. Meanwhile, the doctor documents her exploits while repeatedly having sex with his nurse ([[Carol Connors (actress)|Carol Connors]]). Linda finally meets a man who can make her happy, agreeing to marry him. The movie ends with the line "The End. And Deep Throat to you all."

In a March 1973 column, critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a rare "no star" rating and wrote: "It is all very well and good for Linda Lovelace, the star of the movie, to advocate sexual freedom; but the energy she brings to her role is less awesome than discouraging. If you have to work this hard at sexual freedom, maybe it isn't worth the effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-throat-1973 |title=Deep Throat |publisher=Rogerebert.com |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=March 6, 1973 |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Goldstein]] wrote a rave review in his ''[[SCREW (magazine)|SCREW]]'' magazine, saying "I was never so moved by any theatrical performance since stuttering through my own bar mitzvah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Will Sloan |date=December 20, 2013 |title=Al Goldstein: The Anti-Hef |url=http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/hazlitt/longreads/al-goldstein-anti-hef |publisher=Penguin Random House Canada |accessdate=November 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030211908/http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/hazlitt/longreads/al-goldstein-anti-hef |archive-date=October 30, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="observer.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lili Anolik |title=Al Goldstein: The Pornographer in Winter |work=New York Observer |date=February 23, 2011 |url=http://observer.com/2011/02/al-goldstein-the-pornographer-in-winter/ |accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porno chic and pop culture influence==
''Deep Throat'' officially premiered at the World Theater in New York on June 12, 1972, and was advertised in ''[[The New York Times]]'' under the [[bowdlerized]] title ''Throat''.

The film's popularity helped launch a brief period of upper-middle class interest in explicit pornography referred to by Ralph Blumenthal of ''The New York Times'' as "[[Golden Age of Porn|porno chic]]". Several mainstream celebrities admitted to having seen ''Deep Throat'', including [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Brian De Palma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiJ5wYCqt5I&amp;feature=related |title=Scorsese on Scorsese Part 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=July 25, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Truman Capote]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Johnny Carson]],&lt;ref name=pornochic&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |date=January 21, 1973 |title=Porno chic; 'Hard-core' grows fashionable-and very profitable |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=28 |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spiro Agnew]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref name="observer.com"/&gt; [[Barbara Walters]] mentions having seen the film in her autobiography, ''[[Audition: A Memoir]]''.&lt;ref name=Audition&gt;{{cite book |title=Audition: A Memoir |last=Walters |first=Barbara |authorlink=Barbara Walters |year=2008 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

The film's title soon became a pop culture reference, most notably when [[Howard Simons]], the then-managing editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', chose "[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]" as the code name for a well guarded secret  [[Watergate]] inside informant about the 1972-1974 political scandals that plagued the administration of President [[Richard M. Nixon]], many years later revealed to be assistant [[FBI]] director [[W. Mark Felt]].

==Production and revenue==
The scenes involving Linda Lovelace were shot in [[North Miami, Florida]], over six days in January 1972. The interior scenes were shot at a hotel between 123rd and 124th Streets on Biscayne Boulevard, then known as the Voyager Inn. The building was subsequently converted to a dormitory for [[Johnson &amp; Wales University]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The scenes involving Carol Connors were shot in [[New York City]].

The movie was produced by Louis "Butchie" Peraino, who was listed in the credits as "Lou Perry". Peraino was the owner of Plymouth Distributing, which he later renamed Arrow Film and Video. The entire production cost of $22,500, and an additional $25,000 for music, was provided by Peraino's father, [[Anthony Peraino]], a member of the [[Colombo crime family]]. Gerard Damiano, who had rights to one-third of the profits, was reportedly paid a lump sum of $25,000 once the film became popular and was forced out of the partnership.&lt;ref name=pornochic/&gt; The film was then distributed by a network of [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]-connected associates of the Peraino family.
''Deep Throat'' grossed $1 million in its first seven weeks of release in 1972, including a then-porn film single-screen record of $30,033 in its opening week at New York City's New World Theatre. The film made a then-record $3 million in its first six months of release and was still ranked among the top 10 highest-grossing films, as ranked by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 48 weeks after its release.&lt;ref name="Hollywood v. Hard Core"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Jon|title=Hollywood v. Hard Core: How the Struggle Over Censorship Created the Modern Film Industry|year=2000|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York |isbn=978-0814751428|pages=260–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the film's total revenues have varied widely: numbers as high as $600 million have been cited, which would make ''Deep Throat'' one of the highest-grossing films of all time. With an average ticket price of $5, box-office takings of $600 million would imply 120 million admissions, an unrealistic figure.&lt;ref name=pornochic/&gt; Although subsequent sales of the film on home video certainly brought additional revenue, the FBI's estimate that the film produced an income of approximately $100 million may be closer to the truth. Michael Hiltzik of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' also argues for a lower figure in a February 2005 article, pointing out that ''Deep Throat'' was banned outright in large parts of the US (as well as many other countries), and only tended to find screenings in a small network of adult theaters in larger urban centers.&lt;ref name=hiltzik/&gt; The directors of ''[[Inside Deep Throat]]'' responded to the article, suggesting that actual revenues from the film were possibly even higher than the $600 million figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/insidedeepthroat/archives/2005/Mar/05/cut.wow|title='Throat' Gets Cut, Directors Perform Surgery|accessdate=February 18, 2009|author=Fenton Bailey |author2=Randy Barbato|date=March 5, 2005|work=World of Wonder|publisher=World of Wonder Productions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312044826/http://worldofwonder.net/insidedeepthroat/archives/2005/Mar/05/cut.wow|archivedate=March 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiltzik was unsatisfied with the directors' response, writing that their method was to "construct a seemingly solid box office figure out of layers and layers of speculation piled upon a foundation of sand".&lt;ref name="hiltzik-multiplying"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Hiltzik|title=Bad 'Deep Throat' Revenue Numbers Are Multiplying|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/10/business/fi-golden10|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=C-1 |date=March 10, 2005|accessdate=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] noted as well in his review of ''Inside Deep Throat'', a 2005 [[documentary film|documentary]] about the film's cultural legacy, that many theaters that screened the film were mob-connected enterprises, which probably also "inflated box office receipts as a way of [[money laundering|laundering]] income from drugs and prostitution" and other illegal activities.&lt;ref name=ebert&gt;{{cite news |author=Roger Ebert |date=February 11, 2005 |title=Inside Deep Throat |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a censored edition of the film was released on DVD for fans of pop culture and those wishing to own a non-[[X-rated]] copy of the infamous movie. ''Deep Throat'' was the first film to be inducted into the [[XRCO Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dirtybob.com/xrco/hall.htm |title=HALL OF FAME |publisher=Dirty Bob/X-Rated Critics Organization |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Linda Boreman's allegations===
{{Main|Linda Lovelace}}

In her first two biographies, Linda Boreman characterized having made the film as a liberating experience; in her third and fourth biographies, both of which were written after she had come out with her stories of [[sexual abuse]], [[rape]], and forced prostitution in the porn business, she charged that she had not consented to many of the depicted sexual acts and that she had been coerced to perform by her [[domestic violence|abusive]] then-husband [[Chuck Traynor]], who received $1,250 for her acting. She also claimed that Traynor threatened to kill her, brandishing handguns and rifles to control her.

In 1986, she testified before the [[Meese Commission]], "Virtually every time someone watches that movie, they're watching me being raped." In the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' on March 20, 1981 she said, "It is a crime that movie is still showing; there was a gun to my head the entire time." While the other people present on the set did not support the gun charge, both Traynor and Damiano confirmed in interviews that Traynor was extremely controlling towards Boreman and also hit her on occasion. In the documentary ''Inside Deep Throat'', it is claimed that bruises are visible on Boreman's body in the movie.

These allegations were cited in the UK Government's Rapid Evidence Assessment on "The evidence of harm to adults relating to exposure to extreme pornographic material"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/research280907.htm [ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Evidence of harm to adults relating to exposure to extreme pornographic material – Ministry of Justice]. Justice.gov.uk. Retrieved December 22, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516075647/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/research280907.htm |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its plans to criminalize possession of what it termed "[[extreme pornography]]".

===Obscenity litigation===
In various United States communities, the movie was shown to juries to determine whether it was [[obscene]]; the outcomes varied widely and the movie was banned in numerous locations.

In August 1972, after a jury in New York had found the movie not to be obscene, prosecutors decided to charge Mature Enterprises, the company that owned the World Theater, for promotion of obscene material, taking them to trial in December.&lt;ref name=pornochic/&gt;&lt;ref name=joeljtylerobit&gt;{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Bruce |date=January 14, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/nyregion/joel-j-tyler-judge-who-ruled-deep-throat-obscene-dies-at-90.html?hpw |title=Joel J. Tyler, Judge Who Pronounced 'Deep Throat' Obscene, Dies at 90 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, a psychiatrist testified that the film portrayed acts that were "well within the bounds of normal behavior".&lt;ref name=joeljtylerobit/&gt; A film critic testified the movie had social value because it showed sympathy for female desires, because the script contained humor and because it was filmed "with clarity and lack of grain".&lt;ref name=joeljtylerobit/&gt; Conversely, in response to a claim the film was a spoof of sexual behavior, a [[New York University]] professor said, "I do not see how you can spoof fellatio by showing continuous performance of fellatio."&lt;ref name=joeljtylerobit/&gt; On March 1, 1973, Judge Joel J. Tyler ruled ''Deep Throat'' to be obscene, issuing his opinion on the film as "this feast of carrion and squalor", "a nadir of decadence" and "a Sodom and Gomorrah gone wild before the fire".&lt;ref name=joeljtylerobit/&gt; Judge Tyler fined Mature Enterprises $100,000, which was later reduced on appeal.&lt;ref name=joeljtylerobit/&gt; The ruling would inadvertently contribute to the film becoming perhaps the most popular X rated movie of all time.&lt;ref name=joeljtylerobit/&gt;

In 1976, there was a series of federal cases in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where over 60 individuals and companies, including the Perainos and actor Harry Reems, were indicted for [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to distribute obscenity across state lines. Damiano and Lovelace were granted immunity in exchange for testimony. The Hon. [[Harry W. Wellford]] was the Federal District Court judge who heard the case. The trials ended in convictions. This was the first time that an actor had been prosecuted by the federal government on obscenity charges ([[Lenny Bruce]] had been prosecuted in the 1960s by local authorities.) Reems became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' and received considerable support from Hollywood circles. On appeal, he was represented by [[Alan Dershowitz]], and his conviction was overturned: the [[Miller test]] had been applied in his case. The Perainos and some other major players connected to organized crime received short prison sentences.

In 1995, while in Las Vegas for an obscenity trial, Louis Peraino met and befriended Raymond and Treasure Pistol, local adult club owners, and sold the Pistols the rights to his entire library, including ''Deep Throat''.

In the UK, the movie was banned upon release, and the ban was upheld by the courts 10 years later. The uncut DVD of the movie was finally given an [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18]] rating in 2000, which allowed it to be sold in licensed [[sex shop]]s in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,369949,00.html |title=Deep Throat passed uncut 28 years on |work=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |date=September 18, 2000 |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright===
''Deep Throat'' was released without a [[copyright]] notice. Because Peraino had used [[four wall distribution]] for all of ''Deep Throat's'' releases, that left the potential for the film to be classified as an unpublished work, preventing it from falling into the [[public domain]]. Peraino sold the rights to the film to Arrow Productions for home video release (including a copyright notice) at some point prior to 2009. Despite Arrow holding the rights, rival pornography distributor VCX began distributing ''Deep Throat'' as retaliation for Arrow's distribution of ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'', two films VCX asserted were under their copyright. (In the former case, ''Debbie Does Dallas'' was determined to be public domain in a 1987 court ruling.) In order to prevent VCX from challenging the copyright on ''Deep Throat'', Arrow Productions agreed in 2011 to voluntarily stop distributing ''Debbie Does Dallas'' and ''The Devil in Miss Jones'', thus leaving their copyright statuses unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eriq |last=Gardner |title=How a Nasty Legal Fight Over 'Deep Throat,' 'Debbie Does Dallas' Was Settled |date=October 26, 2011 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/how-a-nasty-legal-fight-252525 |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch television===
On February 23, 2008, the [[Dutch public broadcasting system|Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] corporations [[VPRO]] and [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] screened ''Deep Throat'' on national television as part of a themed night on the history of pornographic films, and the influence of pornography in youth culture in the [[Netherlands]]. Although the film aired after 10 p.m., following a guideline for adult television, and was embedded in a discussion program, several political parties (especially Dutch cabinet member party [[ChristianUnion]]) were clamoring for steps to be taken to prevent airing. The Minister of Education and Media, [[Ronald Plasterk]], declared that he could not and did not want to forbid the airing of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kievit |first=Rob |title=Porn movie on Dutch public TV causes row |work=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]: English |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |date=January 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826152754/http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/080129-deep-throat-redirected|archivedate=August 26, 2009 |url=http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/080129-deep-throat-redirected}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was seen by 907,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pornofilm trekt ruim 900.000 kijkers |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |publisher=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau]] |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |date=February 24, 2008 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/multimedia/article507124.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410164508/http://www.volkskrant.nl/multimedia/article507124.ece|archivedate=April 10, 2010 |language=dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity of "Dolly Sharp"===
In December 2014, ''[[The Rialto Report]]'', a web site devoted to the history of the so-called [[Golden Age of Porn]], made the surprise announcement that the supporting actress billed as Dolly Sharp, who had vanished into obscurity shortly after the release of ''Deep Throat'', was in fact Helen Wood (1935–1998), a former Broadway performer who, as a teenager, had a major role in the 1953 Hollywood musical ''[[Give a Girl a Break]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whatever Happened to Deep Throat's Dolly Sharp?|url=http://www.therialtoreport.com/2014/12/07/whatever-happened-to-deep-throats-dolly-sharp/|website=The Rialto Report|date=7 December 2014|accessdate = 4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An original soundtrack album for the film was released in 1972. Few copies exist today and when on the market, they have sold for as much as [[US$]]300. The album contains both instrumental and vocals tracks as well as short snippets of dialog from the film (indicated with quotations in the list below). All artists are unknown. A remixed and remastered CD and LP version is available from [[Light in the Attic Records]] (see links). Director [[Gerard Damiano]] reportedly cut the sex scenes to conform to different musical cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_22/Deep_Throat.aspx |title=Archive – ''Deep Throat'' |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |publisher=[[Fused Magazine]] |quote=Gerard Damiano edited the film to its music, so the actions would match and the beat would match ... like up and down strokes on the old shaft ... it was pretty clever. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203054434/http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_22/Deep_Throat.aspx |archivedate=December 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opens with an instrumental track that echoes the hook of the 1968 easy listening hit, "[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]".

==Sequels and remakes==
The original [[sequel]] to ''Deep Throat'' – ''Deep Throat Part II'' – was written and directed by [[Joseph W. Sarno]] and featured the original stars [[Linda Lovelace]] and [[Harry Reems]]. Shot in New York City in early 1973, it was released in New York in February 1974 with an [[MPAA]] "R" rating. Although attributed to Damiano Films, ''Deep Throat'' director [[Gerard Damiano]] was not involved with its production. The film was produced, however, by ''Deep Throat'' producer [[Louis Peraino]], who had in the meantime founded the mainstream distribution company [[Bryanston Films]]. The version of ''Deep Throat Part II'' currently available on DVD is [[bowdlerized]] to the point where the film contains virtually no sexual content of any sort, probably a byproduct of its efforts to receive an MPAA R rating at the time of its release. An [[Italy|Italian]] DVD release of the film, however, contains its original [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] sex scenes. It has long been claimed that ''Deep Throat Part II'' was originally shot with the intention of releasing it as a [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] feature and that hardcore sequences shot for the film were stolen while the film was in post-production. Director Joe Sarno, however, has insisted in interviews that this is not the case.

[[Vivid Entertainment]] owner [[Steven Hirsch]] told XFANZ reporters at the [[FAME Awards]] in June 2008 that the company is producing a remake of ''Deep Throat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andrew |first=Steven |date=June 9, 2008 |title=F.A.M.E. Awards Winners |url=http://xfanz.com/news/94984 |publisher=XFANZ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220014755/http://xfanz.com/news/94984 |archivedate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The making of this film was the subject of the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] original series ''[[Deeper Throat]]''.

Vivid had planned to release its remake but Arrow Productions, the copyright owner did not like the deviation from the original storyline or the manner in which the film was directed and cast. They then withdrew permission to make the remake to ''Deep Throat'', and forced Steve Hirsch to remarket and edit his movie for [[copyright]] purposes.

Hirsch changed the name of the title to ''[[Throat: A Cautionary Tale]]'', and it was released in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avn.com/movies/78920.html |title=Throat: A Cautionary Tale |publisher=AVN |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distributed Proofreaders Canada''' (DP Canada) is a volunteer organization that converts books into digital format and releases them as [[public domain]] books in formats readable by electronic devices. It was launched in December 2007 and {{as of|2018|lc=yes}} has published about 4,200 books. Books that are released are stored on a book archive called ''Faded Page''. While its focus is on Canadian publications and preserving [[Canadiana]], it also includes books from other countries as well. It is modelled after [[Distributed Proofreaders]], and performs the same function as similar projects in other parts of the world such as [[Project Gutenberg]] in the United States and [[Project Gutenberg Australia]].

== History ==
Distributed Proofreaders Canada was launched in December 2007 by David Jones and Michael Shepard. Although it was established by members of the original Distributed Proofreaders site, it is a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Distributed Proofreaders just celebrated its 10th anniversary |first=Marie |last=Lebert |url=http://teleread.com/distributed-proofreaders-just-celebrated-its-10th-anniversary-by-marie-lebert/ |publisher=Teleread |date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a volunteer based non-profit organization. All the administrative and management costs are borne by its members. The software used by DP Canada was originally downloaded from [[SourceForge]] but has been substantially modified since then.

In addition to preserving Canadiana, DP Canada is notable because it is one of the first major efforts to take advantage of Canada's copyright laws which allows more works to be preserved. Unlike copyright law in other countries, Canada has a "life plus 50" copyright term. Works by authors who died more than fifty years ago may be made publicly available in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How long does copyright last? |first=Donald |last=Taylor |url=http://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/academic-integrity/copyright/length |publisher=Simon Fraser University |date=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have differing copyright laws. Although files available through DP Canada are publicly available in other countries, the onus is on the reader to ensure that they only download material that is not in copyright in their country of residence.

Notable Canadian authors whose books have been published include [[Stephen Leacock]], [[Lucy Maud Montgomery|L. M. Montgomery]], [[Ernest Thompson Seton|E. T. Seton]] and [[Mazo de la Roche]]. Authors whose works have been released in Canada but not other parts of the world include [[A. A. Milne]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[E. E. Smith]] and [[Amy Carmichael]].

==Proofreading==
[[File:DPC Proofreading Screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Proofreading software showing original text on left and edited text on the right.]]
Eligible books are chosen by members for publication based on personal interest and access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Books mean the world to volunteers |last=Knox |first=Jack |newspaper=Times - Colonist |location=Victoria, B.C |date=April 28, 2016 |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books are scanned electronically and each page is uploaded to the proofreading website. A project is created for the book and is made available to the proofreading members. Each book is proofread in three stages called 'P1', 'P2' and 'P3'. During the first stage, errors in scanning and other minor errors are corrected. Once all pages in the book have been edited the book pages are promoted to the next stage, P2. The proofreading is repeated and again in stage P3 to ensure no errors make it to the final publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proofreading Guidelines |url=http://www.pgdpcanada.net/guidelines/proofguide.html |publisher=Distributed Proofreaders Canada |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once stage P3 is finished the book moves to a set of two formatting stages called 'F1', and 'F2'. In these stages the book text is changed into a format that allows it to be presented to the reader in a style that resembles the original book as closely as possible. For example, text originally appearing in [[Italic type]] is placed within formatting tags &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;this text is in italics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. When formatted the text appears correctly as ''this text is in italics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Formatting Guidelines |url=http://www.pgdpcanada.net/guidelines/formatguide.html |publisher=Distributed Proofreaders Canada |date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the formatting stages are complete, a post-processing stage brings all the files together to publish the books in five electronic formats. These include [[ePub]], [[Mobipocket|mobi]], [[HTML]], [[PDF]] and [[UTF-8|plain text]]. The HTML version is also made available as a [[Zip (file format)|Zip]] file. 

Before the books are added to the Faded Page book archive, the books are placed in a final round called 'Smooth Reading'. While in this phase, members of DP Canada are encouraged to download the books and read them. While the books are in this phase, comments about the book for possible improvements can be sent to the post processor. Once past the Smooth Reading process, the publication is posted on Faded Page.

==Publication==
The books that are published by DP Canada in the [[public domain]] are made available through the Faded Page book archive. Some of the publications released are also posted to the [[Project Gutenberg Canada]] (PG Canada) website. PG Canada is a book archive that does not perform proofreading tasks.

'''Don Leicht''' (born 1946) is a visual artist who has worked as a [[Painting|painter]] and [[sculptor]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]] for over forty years. Leicht has had one person exhibitions in New York, [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]] and is an early figure in the New York City downtown scene in the 1970s, and in the subsequent [[Street Art]] and [[Graffiti]] movements.

In 1983, art writer [[Glenn O'Brien]] in a review in ''[[Artforum]]'' magazine states, "Leicht’s piece consists of a sequence of creatures that exist only on a video screen- Pac Man, Donkey Kong, and other Atari-type stable mates. Leicht has cut the forms of these leisure demons from heavy aluminum plate and enameled them with their normal, unnatural colors. But each creature has also been abraded, scratches in the enamel showing the metal underneath. One geometric thing – an abstracted dog? an "Imperial Walker"? – has been  scratched with a message like a toilet-stall graffito or the "Pray" scratched on the metal of New York City phone booths.&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, Glenn, ''[[Artforum]]'' magazine, 1983

[[File:Fashionmoda1981.jpg|thumb|right|Fashion Moda, South Bronx, NY, photo by John Fekner, 1981]]
[[Fashion Moda]] is most often associated with graffiti art and its acceptance into the art world through such figures as Fekner, [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Jenny Holzer]], and [[Keith Haring]].&lt;ref&gt;Fashion Moda: A Bronx Experience, by Professor Sally Webster, 1996, http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/gallery/talkback/fmwebster.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Leicht participated in Fashion Moda's annual ''South Bronx'' exhibition, and the following year in ''From The Monkey To The Monitor'' an installation by Fekner, Leicht and Fred Baca which included a live performance by [[Phoebe Legere]].

==Charlotte Street==

In August 1980, John Fekner and Don Leicht worked together on an outdoor project located at the site of the People’s Convention held at Charlotte Street in the [[South Bronx]]. Held on August 8–10, the People's Convention was an alternative and direct response to the National Convention of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] being held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Fekner’s stenciled messages included ''Decay, Broken Promises, Falsas Promesas, Last Hope, Broken Treaties'' and ''Save Our School'' were succinct and dramatic in size; Leicht’s ''Birdfeeders'' were small-scaled and intimate painted sculptures for the children of the neighborhood. Their work transversely complemented each other with two different and distinct approaches that identified and drew attention to the existing conditions of the immediate Black and Latino communities, as well the concerns of Native American Indians. Presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] stood amidst the abandoned buildings on August 5, 1980 promising to rebuild the area, as did his predecessor President [[Jimmy Carter]] in October 1977. The area has seen improvements through the rebuilding initiatives of Mayor [[Ed Koch]], Ed Logue’s SBDO Charlotte Street Gardens, and the ongoing efforts of MBD Community Housing Corporation, SoBro and other newer partnerships and financial institutions.

==Collaborations==

Leicht began collaborating with Queens artist John Fekner at P.S. 1 where they shared a studio in 1976. In 1982, they began a series of work and installations using steel, cut metal, aluminum and automotive paints based on Nishikado's [[Space Invaders]] arcade game with the statement: ''Your Space Has Been Invaded-Our Children are Fighting a Terrible War. Whole families are being sent to Battlescreen.'' Their ''Beauty's Only Street Deep'' was installed at the [[Wooster Collective]]'s ''11 Spring Street'' [[street art]] 2006 exhibition in NYC. In 1978, Leicht painted outdoors in Fekner's ''Detective Show'' in Gorman Park in Queens which included the words ''street museum'' on the invitational card.&lt;ref&gt;Lewisohn Cedar, ''Street Art: The Graffiti Revolution'', Tate Museum, London, England 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-85437-767-8}}  pgs.23, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
O’Brien, Glenn, ''Artforum'' magazine, 1983

Review of From the Monkey to the Monitor, Fashion Moda, South, Bronx

The Wooster Collective said, "For us, John Fekner's pioneering stencil work is as important to the history of the urban art movement as the work of artists like Haring, Basquiat. It was artists like Fekner, Leicht, Hambleton and others who truly held down the scene back in the early 80's."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woostercollective.com/2007/01/catching_up_with_john_fekner_and_don_lei.html "Catching Up With John Fekner and Don Leicht"], woostercollective.com, 22 January 2007.

'''''Déficit''''' is a 2007 [[Mexico|Mexican]] feature film, the debut of [[Gael García Bernal]] as a [[film director|director]]. It was written by Kyzza Terrazas and debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on May 21, 2007.

In the film the lives of the rich Cristobal and his sister are contrasted with those of the servants on the estate. However, the riches are from illegal sources it would seem, and his father is on the run in Europe. In particular it is made clear that his childhood friend Adan, is now firmly kept in his place as the family gardener, and is no longer treated as a friend.

==Plot==
It tells the story of a rich young man, Cristobal, and his friends throwing a [[house party]] over the course of a weekend at his parents' home in [[Tepoztlán]]. It is implied through murmurings that his father is in [[Europe]] trying to settle finances and avoid corruption charges. At the beginning of the film, he is driven to the house by one of his [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|Indian]] servants. They drive through a group of protesters without ever really wondering what they are protesting about. His hippie sister, Elisa, has already invaded the place with her drug-addled friends hailing from places such as [[Brazil]] and [[Japan]]. The two groups seem disparate but it's nothing that can't be resolved through sharing alcohol and [[marijuana]]. Already at the house is a family who work as the groundskeepers and Adan, also a twenty-something who has grown up with them but works for them, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere as Cristobal barks out orders.

Cristobal and Adan vie for the attention of Dolores, an [[Argentina|Argentine]] girl at the party whose family has also escaped Argentina due to financial problems. Cris also struggles with his girlfriend, Mafer, constantly phoning him and finding out that he didn't get into [[Harvard University]], where his father wanted him to go. When he finds out that Adan did get into a university in the [[United States]], their rivalry grows even greater. During a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match in the garden, Cris purposely fouls Adan, showing his bitterness.

Cris and Dolores grow close and begin kissing, only to be interrupted by one of Mafer's phone calls. That night, a [[rave]] is held. Elisa, on an [[MDMA|ecstasy]] trip, wanders into the garden and finds Adan sitting in a tree on the perimeter, as he had returned to observe their antics after he had already left. She kisses him, but then begins to [[Drug overdose|overdose]]. She calls for Cristobal and he takes her into the house and blames Adan for what has happened. Cristobel starts a fight with Adan but is overpowered, and in frustration calls Adan an Indio, as a derogatory, deeply hurting Adan and reinforcing their differences. Elisa insists that he should not take her to a hospital. He finds she has been given three pills by one of the boys and the guests are asked to leave. Mafer then turns up, furious that he has been flirting with other women while she was trying to get to the party (Cris having ignored her phone call asking to come and pick her up). Cris receives a mobile phone call, which he can see is from his father, but he doesn't answer it and bursts into tears. The day saw him rejected from Harvard, lose his girlfriend (and Dolores) and his sister overdose on ecstasy, with the rift from his parents firmly entrenched and the differences between Adan perceived

{{about|theatre electricians|construction electricians|electrician}}
In [[theatre]], an  '''electrician''' is a person who works with the various aspects of lighting. Some of the positions among electricians include the lighting supervisor, master electrician, deck electrician, light board operator, moving light programmer, [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|followspot]] operator, as well as simply electricians. This group is generally known as the "Electrics" Department or LX Department.  

These people are responsible for receiving the [[light plot]] from the [[lighting designer]] and translating the design as it is on paper to the lighting that is seen by the audience in the final [[theatrical|production]]. In small theatres, many of these roles may be filled by a single person, while in a large production such as those on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or a large tour, there may be several people filling some of the roles.

== Duties  ==
[[Image:Focusing stage lights.jpg|thumb|right|An electrician focuses a light]]
Theatre electricians are responsible for all non-design aspects of the lighting in a theatrical production. They may also be responsible for special effects (such as fog) and powering other electrical items (such as motors) used in the production.

Electricians install (hang), point and shape the beam (focus), and connect to power (circuit) [[lighting instrument]]s. Additionally they may add gel to color the light, patterns (or gobos) to create texture or shape a light into pictures, and accessories that give the designer the ability to change some aspect of the light, such as scrollers (color changers) or pattern effects (gobo rotators).

In the past (and even in some theatres today) the electrics department was in charge of all water and water effects used on or offstage (i.e. rain, waterfalls, pools, etc.).

==  Positions ==
=== Lighting supervisor ===
The '''lighting supervisor''' is responsible for acting as the go-between for the designers, and the theatre's electrics staff. In the cases of shows done in repertory, they may have to adapt the designs of several designers to work together given the limits of the [[Theatre|venue]] and the equipment, budget, and time available. In the case of a re-mount, they may adapt a design to newer equipment or a different venue than the design was originally created for. While Broadway and high end Off-Broadway productions have this position, the Master Electrician is often responsible for these duties in smaller productions.

=== Deck electrician ===
The '''deck electrician''', '''"stage electrician"''', '''"floor electrician"''', '''"floor LX"''', '''"deck elec"'''or just "'''stage LX'''"  is a member of the [[running crew]] for a production and is responsible for all aspects of running the lighting for the show that happen on or backstage. This can include such things as changing color, focusing and readjusting lights that were moved, connecting and disconnecting [[Stage lighting instrument|practical units]] or set pieces which are electrified, and in some venues, assisting with motor control or effects.  On touring or musical productions this individual is also referred to as the '''Dimmer Technician''', as their responsibilities include supervising and maintaining portable dimmer racks.

=== Load in electrician ===
The '''Load in electrician''' or "'''production electrician'''" in the UK, often referred to simply as an electrician, is a person usually hired on a per day or per project basis (freelance) to hang, circuit and focus the lights. Once the show goes into tech, the Load in Electrician will usually leave, although they may stay around to do "notes" with the lighting designer which may include adding or taking away lights, refocusing, or re-gelling lights. Even small productions usually have at least one or two Load in Electricians who are supervised by the Master Electrician.

=== Light board operator ===
{{main|Light board operator}}
The '''light board operator''', '''lighting operator''', '''noard op''' or just '''LX op''' is the person who executes [[cue (theatrical)|cues]] for a production. This can range from adjusting light levels of individual dimmers, such as on a two scene preset board, to simply pressing a "Go" button on a computer controlled console. They may need to be able to write cues for their lighting board, and to make adjustments quickly to account for equipment failure, or people being in the wrong location. For some live events, such as concerts, this person may also be creating cues and looks on the fly, and functioning both as an operator and a designer simultaneously.

=== Master electrician ===
{{main|Master electrician}}
The '''master electrician''', '''M.E.''' or '''"chief electrician"''' in the UK, supervises all other Electricians working on a production or show.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last = Parker | first = W.

Their other duties include:

*Planning and implementing of the cabling (circuiting) of lights and electric power distribution for any given show or production. 
*Inventory and repair and maintenance of all stage lighting fixtures, cables, effects, power distribution, dimmers, networking and lighting control consoles. 
*Organization and purchasing of all consumables including [[Color_gel|gels]], [[Gobo_(lighting)|gobos]], and [[gaffer tape|gaff tape]]. 
*Documenting and tracking of all scenery, circuiting, addressing, and system configuration in cooperation with the Lighting Designer. 
*If there are no light board ops, the Master Electrician may need to patch the board according to the L.D.'s designs.
*Solving any problems or issues with the electrical equipment that the Deck Electricians cannot resolve by themselves.
*Occupational safety and health of workers and operational decisions as the Head of the Electrics department.

=== Lighting programmer ===
The '''lighting programmer''', is a person familiar with the lighting board being used who sits next to or in communication with the lighting designer during "tech". He or she is responsible for programming in the lighting cues as dictated to him or her by the lighting designer. This saves the designer the time and attention of using the light board and allows him or her to concentrate on building the cues. Often, especially in smaller theatres, this person is the Light Board Operator for the show's run.

=== Moving light programmer ===
The '''moving light programmer''' is a person who specializes in the sometimes complex creation of cues for [[Intelligent lighting|moving lights]]. For large productions with several moving lights, there may even be a separate control system for the moving lights from that of the "conventional" lighting. Some of these lights, in addition to being able to change focus from one location to another, can include many other features such as color and patterns. The coordinating of these fixtures can be complex enough to require a dedicated person to program.

=== Followspot operator ===
{{main|Spotlight operator}}
The ''' followspot operator''' is the person who operates the [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|followspot]], or spotlight on a production. This is a light which is physically moved by the operator during the production to follow a performer's movement around the stage. A follow spot may also have mechanisms to change color, as well as an iris to change the diameter of the projected circle of light. The followspot operator may have to change several aspects of the beam from their unit simultaneously. This position is more common in [[musical theatre]] and concerts than for drama.

The '''National Emblem of the [[Togo|Togolese Republic]]''' was adopted on 14 March 1962.

In the device, there are two red [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] to be seen, which symbolize the bravery of the people.  The bow and arrow call for all citizens to be active in the [[Civil defense|defense]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] of the country.  Between the lions is a golden shield with the letters '''RT''' (République Togolaise) to be seen.  Above the [[flag of Togo]] is displayed twice.  On the ribbon stands "Travail, Liberté, Patrie" (Work, Liberty, Homeland).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,TGO,456d621e2,48ef43c72,0.html Togolese constitution (1992) at UNHCR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanlegislaturesproject.org/content/constitution-togo Togolese constitution (2002) at African Legislatures Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214090412/http://www.africanlegislaturesproject.org/content/constitution-togo |date=2012-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Togo's 1991 National Conference, multiple versions of this emblem proliferated, even within the Togolese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes-les-rubriques/Politique/Armoiries-voici-le-bon-modele |title=Armoiries: voici le bon modèle! |date=27 June 2008 |publisher=République Togolaise |accessdate=12 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, however, a Constitutional Court decision clarified which version was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes-les-rubriques/Medias/A-quelles-armoiries-se-vouer |title=A quelles armoiries se vouer?|language=French|date=9 January 2009 |publisher=République Togolaise |accessdate=12 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed arms 1914===
[[File:Proposed Coat of Arms Togo 1914.png|thumb|right|120px|Proposed German arms 1914]]

In 1914, the German government decided to assign coats of arms to its overseas colonies, including Togoland.  Arms were designed, but [[World War I]] broke out before the project was  finalised, and the arms were never actually taken into use. Giving the colonies their own insignia in time of war could let them have a symbol to rally around in case of rebellion. The arms proposed for [[Togoland|the Protectorate of Togoland]] depicted a tree supported by two cobra snakes and the German imperial eagle on a chief. The eagle and the imperial crown on the shield was the same for all the proposed colonial arms.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Schurdel, H.D. . Battenberg (1995).

'''Europeana 1914–1918''' is a major project to digitise and publish primary and secondary historical sources on the [[World War I|First World War]]. It is coordinated by [[Europeana]], as part of a broader program to digitise European cultural heritage.

The collection is composed of three major elements. The first, also titled '''Europeana 1914–1918''', gathers digitised memorabilia and personal stories from individuals, including a series of public workshops where material can be scanned or photographed. The second, '''Europeana Collections 1914–1918''', is a coordinated digitisation program by ten major libraries across eight European countries. The third element, '''EFG1914''', is a project to digitise a substantial number of wartime silent films through the [[European Film Gateway]].

==Background==

The Europeana 1914–1918 project was publicly announced in 2011, as "Europeana Collections 1914–1918: Remembering the First World War", with the goal of digitising over 400,000 source items from thirteen institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/13/first-world-war-british-library|title=Europe's archived trove of rare Great War documents goes online|date=13 November 2011|work=Observer|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan called for around 425,000 digitised items from the partner institutions. This would sit alongside 27,000 items (mostly photographs from the UK and France) already in Europeana, and include around 75,000 items already digitised but not yet added to Europeana. The focus was to be on "special collections" – manuscripts, artwork, rare books, maps, music, etc. – with the goal that most material provided would be rare or unique. Material would be hosted by the institutions but accessible through an aggregated service, and where possible copyright issues would be resolved to ensure maximal reusability of material.&lt;ref name="dow-12"&gt;{{citation|title=Description of Work: Europeana Collections 1914–1918 (version 1.2)|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-collections-1914-1918/outcomes/-/document_library_display/fTO5/view/0/61602|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the project was anticipated to cost around 5.4 million euro, the bulk of which was due to 3.1 million euro in staffing costs at the partner institutions and 1 million in costs for sub-contracted digitisation. (The bulk of digitisation was carried out in-house.)

Material from "Collections" was released to the Europeana site as it was digitised and uploaded, with the first collections (newspapers from Austria and photographs/magazines from Italy) released in March 2012. The first public events to showcase these digitised collections began in 2013, continuing through release in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/events/|title=Europeana Collections 1914–1918: Events|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public "Europeana 1914–18" project opened for online submissions and began the first public roadshow events in March 2011. These events invited members of the public to bring physical artefacts or documents to be digitised, and to record information or stories connected to them. 51 sessions were run across Europe up to December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-1914-1918|title=Europeana 1914–1918: Background|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public initiative used the Community Collection Model founded by Stuart Lee and Kate Lindsay at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Stuart|last2=Lindsay|first2=Kate|title=If You Build It, They Will Scan: Oxford University’s Exploration of Community Collections|journal=Educause Quarterly|date=30 July 2009|volume=32|issue=2|url=http://er.educause.edu/en/Articles/2009/7/If-You-Build-It-They-Will-Scan-Oxford-Universitys-Exploration-of-Community-Collections|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used for [http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/ The Great War Archive]. The University of Oxford was a partner in Europeana 1914–1918, providing support in the development of the online platform and training to all institutions running roadshow events.

==Release and reception==

The main public-facing portal for the overall project (&lt;tt&gt;europeana1914-18.eu&lt;/tt&gt;) was launched at the [[Berlin State Library]] on 29 January 2014 by [[Monika Grütters]], the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media. At the time of launch, the site had around 400,000 digitised items from the partner institutions, alongside 90,000 "personal" items and 660 hours of film.&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Phil|url=http://www.infotoday.eu/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Europeana-1914-1918-the-untold-stories-and-offical-histories-94710.aspx |title=Europeana 1914–1918: the untold stories and official histories|work=Information Today|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public reaction to the collections has often highlighted individual items or small collections. For example, digitised correspondence from the British Library's [[India Office]] collections has been used to highlight the involvement of Indian soldiers, particularly on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/21/found-translation-indias-first-world-war|title=The last post: letters home to India during the first world war|first=Daljit|last=Nagra|date=21 February 2014|work=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/india/the-forgotten-indian-soldiers-of-wwis-european-battlefields|date=9 March 2014|title=The forgotten Indian soldiers of WWI's European battlefields|first=Samanth|last=Subramanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early find during the public digitisation project was a postcard (''right'') sent by [[Adolf Hitler]] to a fellow soldier while recuperating in hospital, which attracted a great deal of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News Online|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17908150|title=Hitler postcard found in World War I project|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Famine-33''''' ({{lang-ua|Голод-33}}, ''Holod-33'') is a 1991 [[drama film]] by Oles Yanchuk about the [[Holodomor]] famine in [[Ukraine]], and based on the novel ''The Yellow Prince'' by [[Vasyl Barka]]. The film is told through the lives of the Katrannyk family of six.

==Synopsis==
"In an early scene, the members of an impoverished farming family solemnly take turns dipping their ladles into the single bowl of watery soup that is their only meal of the day. Later in the film, scores of villagers numb with despair and hunger huddle silently in the pouring rain outside a Government office until a truckload of armed soldiers arrives to disperse them. In the most poignant scene, a little boy who has lost his parents calls for his mother as he wanders, panic-stricken, through a snowy woodland where the trees are outnumbered by crosses marking the dead."&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen. "A Family's Struggle In Stalin's Man-Made Famine: Famine-33 Film Review." ''The New York Times.'' 15 December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Get Your War On''''' is a series of satirical [[comic strip]]s by [[David Rees (cartoonist)|David Rees]] about political topics. Initially, the comic concerned the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York City, but it quickly switched its focus to more recent topics, in particular the [[War on Terror]]. The series achieved a [[cult following]] on the Internet through [[Internet forum|discussion forums]] and [[blogs]], very soon after debuting on October 9, 2001.

From a technical standpoint the strips are considered very crude, being assembled from about a dozen simple [[clip art]] pictures of office workers (with a few exceptions, most notably super robot [[Voltron]]) that are repeated, often in the same strip. Almost all are in red on a white background. There is an emphasis on dialogue, with little action. Highly disillusioned and cynical, it is heavily laden with [[Expletive attributive|expletives]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Development and publishing==

The majority of the clip art used in ''Get Your War On'' is taken from ''Office and Business Illustrations'', designed by Tom Tierney and first published by [[Dover Publications]] in 1988.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Dover's web page about the book is [http://store.doverpublications.com/0486257622.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, American restaurant chain [[Jamba Juice]] was criticized for running an ad campaign which looked similar to the ''Get Your War On'' series as it used the same clip art.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130115201252/https://andyontheroad.wordpress.com/2009/07/18/jamba/ Jamba Juice’s new advertising technique is despicable]", Andy on the Road, July 18, 2009. (Archive, retrieved July 14, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JambaJuiceControversy"&gt;Xeni Jardin, "[http://boingboing.net/2009/07/27/jamba-juice-accused.html Jamba Juice accused of stealing ''Get Your War On'' artist's work: Update: Jamba responds, GYWO calls for boycott]", boingboing.net, July 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Get Your War On'' has been published in book form, with the author's [[royalties]] (as well as part of the publisher's income for the first book and ''Get Your War on II'') being donated to the charity [[Adopt-A-Minefield]] for removal of landmines in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://contemporarylit.about.com/cs/authorinterviews/a/davidRees.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnftiu.cc/mdc-team-5/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807075617/http://www.mnftiu.cc/mdc-team-5/ |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also published regularly in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;ref name="USA today"&gt;Balog, Kathy, et al. (September 9, 2004). "Our critics' top picks". ''[[USA Today]]'', Pg. 6D&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Alternative weekly|alternative newspapers]]. In 2004, Rees was interviewed in the book ''[[Attitude: The New Subversive Cartoonists|Attitude 2: The New Subversive Alternative Cartoonists]],'' edited by syndicated editorial cartoonist [[Ted Rall]].

In 2007, ''Get Your War On'' comics were included with the works of [[Jenny Holzer]] and [[Goya]] in the ''Dissent!'' exhibition of protest art at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Fogg Art Museum]].&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"&gt;Editorial board (February 10, 2007).

As the author had promised, the strip ended the day that [[George W. Bush]] left office, January 20, 2009. Rees continues to maintain a blog, which covers topical political issues.

==Critical reaction==
Tom Carson has called ''Get Your War On'' a "glorious excoriation of our post-9/11 loony bin",&lt;ref name="NYT2004"&gt;Carson, Tom (October 3, 2004). "Last Comic Standing". ''[[The New York Times]]'', Pg. 20G&lt;/ref&gt; while Connie Ogle, in her review of the second ''Get Your War On'' book, called it "Profane, decidedly anti-war and screamingly funny ... guaranteed to make you laugh yourself sick."&lt;ref name="The Miami Herald"&gt;Ogle, Connie (November 24, 2004). "Go Ahead, Make Your Buddy's Belly Ache From Laughing". ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', Pg. 22E&lt;/ref&gt; James Poniewozik has compared ''Get Your War On'' to ''[[Doonesbury]]'' and ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'', calling it "a fresher (and more R-rated) critique" of the Bush administration.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Poniewozik, James (July 12, 2002). "The Cultural Campaign". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Horton and the Kwuggerbug and More Lost Stories''''' is an anthology of children's stories written and illustrated by [[Dr. Seuss]], published posthumously by [[Random House]] in 2014.

==Background==
The four stories in this book were originally published as installments of a monthly column that Dr. Seuss wrote for ''[[Redbook]]'' during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migaki|first1=Lauren|title=Horton Meets A... Who?|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/09/08/345880696/horton-meets-a-who-introducing-the-kwuggerbug-from-seuss-lost-stories|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Seuss died in 1991, but the stories were later rediscovered by Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen.&lt;ref name=WT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taube|first1=Michael|title=BOOK REVIEW: ‘Horton and the Kwuggerbug and More Lost Stories’|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/6/book-review-the-lost-and-found-dr-seuss/?page=all|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plots==
The four stories included in the book are as follows:
*"Horton and the Kwuggerbug": A Kwuggerbug lands on [[Horton the Elephant]]'s trunk and asks him to take him to his beezlenut tree, which Horton agrees to since when they get there the bug promises Horton will get half the nuts. The journey to the beezlenut tree is quite hazardous, and Horton goes through all the hardships including swimming across a large crocodile infested river and climbing a large and rocky mountain, with the Kwuggerbug taking advantage of Horton's good nature. In the end, the Kwuggerbug tries to double-cross Horton, but a well-timed sneeze makes things more even.
*"Marco Comes Late": Marco from ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]'' explains to his teacher why he was late for school. His explanation involves a bird who landed on his books and laid an egg there, and various animals who argue over whether he should protect the egg or get to school on time. In the end, the teacher sees through the tall tale for the morsel of truth.
*"How Officer Pat Saved the Whole Town": Officer Pat sees a gnat about to disturb a cat and realizes this could be the start of a string of disasters that could obliterate the town. He intervenes and the town is saved.
*"The Hoobub and the Grinch": A very short story in which a [[Grinch]] convinces a Hoobub that a piece of green string is better than the sun.

==Reception==
Michael Taube of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' was enthusiastic about the book, writing, "If you loved Dr. Seuss as a child (and as an adult), these little-known stories will bring back many fond memories."&lt;ref name=WT/&gt; The reviewer for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' was more critical, stating, "By no means gems, these archives suggest how Geisel tinkered with characters, developed his signature [[tetrameter]], and commented on ethical issues, circa 1950."&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite news|title=Horton and the Kwuggerbug: And More Lost Stories|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-38298-4|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ilit Azoulay''' (born 1972) is an Israeli artist. She is best known for panoramic [[Photomontage|photo montages]], depicting arrangements of different objects and materials she has collected from demolished buildings around the southern districts of [[Tel Aviv]]. She visited the buildings before demolition, exploring their rooms and examining their walls. After the demolition, Azoulay returned, searching through the remains and gathering pieces of them. In the studio, she sorted and cataloged the findings. Then photographs are made separately and used for collage preparation.

== Biography ==
Azoulay was born in the [[Jaffa]] district of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. She received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] from the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 1998 and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] of [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Tel Aviv in 2010. She lives and works in Tel Aviv.

She had solo exhibitions in [[Andrea Meislin Gallery]] in New York and [[Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art]] as well as [[Braverman Gallery]], Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/culture/why-the-curator-came-down-to-earth-1.467015|title=Why the Curator Came Down to Earth|date=27 September 2012|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in numerous group exhibitions around the world. She is currently a resident at the [[Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/news-in-brief/news-in-brief-1.483990|title=News in Brief|date=11 December 2012|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has works in permanent collections of museums as well as in private collections in Israel and abroad.

The '''Instant Pot''' is a brand of [[kitchen appliance]]s. The brand's original and primary products are electronically controlled, combined [[pressure cooker]]s and [[slow cooker]]s. The original cookers are marketed as 7-in-1 appliances designed to consolidate the cooking and preparing of food to one device ([[multicooker]]). The brand has since expanded to include non-pressure slow cookers, [[sous-vide]] immersion circulators, and blenders.

==History==
The concept of a multi-purpose cooker has been around since 2006 with the patent from the [[Midea Group]], which would go on to manufacture the Instant Pot,&lt;ref name="cagc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2015/54204r-eng.php|title=Double Insight Inc. recalls Instant Pot Smart Pressure Cooker|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the function and simple structure of what would become the Instant Pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Electric pressure cooker patent|date=2007-06-30|url=http://www.google.com/patents/CN2904886Y|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and one other friend, all former employees of [[Nortel]] in Ottawa, Canada, started working on designs for the Instant Pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/ottawa-entrepreneurs-instant-pot-has-attracted-a-devoted-following-of-home-cooks/article33804422/|title=Ottawa entrepreneur’s Instant Pot has attracted a devoted following of home cooks|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang is credited as the inventor of the Instant Pot. This beginning model operated as a [[pressure cooker]], [[slow cooker]], rice / [[porridge]] cooker, yogurt maker, [[sauté]] / [[searing]] pan, [[food steamer|steamer]], and food warmer.&lt;ref name="margaretinc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201706/margaret-rhodes/double-insight-instant-cooking-pot-design-awards-2017.html|title=Fired From His Own Startup, This Founder Invented Amazon's Hit Product of 2016|date=2017-05-15|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was under development for 18 months.

==Double Insight==
Double Insight Inc was founded by Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and three other partners in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39058736|title=How a cooker developed a cult following|last=Murphy|first=Jessica|date=2017-03-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the distributor and designers of the Instant Pot. &lt;ref name="cagc"/&gt; Wang has a PhD in [[computer science]] with a specialty in [[artificial intelligence]].

The company became profitable in 2012, with the Instant Pot as their main product. In 2016, Double Insight sold more than 215,000 Instant Pots on Amazon's [[Prime Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2185161|title=Amazon&amp;nbsp;— Press Room&amp;nbsp;— Press Release|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/instant-pot-electric-pressure-cooker-recipes.html|title=Why Do Cooks Love the Instant Pot?

===Recalls===
In July 2015 the Instant Pot Smart-60 cooker was recalled, affecting about 1140 units in the United States and Canada. The defect caused electric current to leak, which could potentially shock the product's user. There were four reported instances of this shock before it was recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2015/instant-pot-pressure-cookers-recalled-by-double-insight|title=Instant Pot Pressure Cookers Recalled by Double Insight {{!}} CPSC.gov|website=www.cpsc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, five production runs of Instant Pot Gem 65 8-in-1 Multicookers were recalled because they were overheating and subsequently melting due to a manufacturing issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/an-instant-pot-multicooker-is-melting-but-not-the-one-you-think/#ftag=CAD590a51e|title=An Instant Pot multicooker is melting -- but not the one you think|last=Bennett|first=Brian|date=2018-02-23|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=2018-02-23|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Manufacturing==
Instant Pots are manufactured by the Midea Group in GuangDong, China. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2015/54204r-eng.php|title=Double Insight Inc. recalls Instant Pot Smart Pressure Cooker|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Forest: [http://educationaltechnology.net/instructional-design/ Instructional Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091647/http://educationaltechnology.net/instructional-design/ |date=2016-12-20 }}, Educational Technology&lt;/ref&gt; There are many instructional design models but many are based on the [[ADDIE model]] with the five phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. 

==History==

===Origins ===
As a field, instructional design is historically and traditionally rooted in [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral psychology]], though recently [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] has influenced thinking in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=Richard E|year=1992|title=Cognition and instruction: Their historic meeting within educational psychology|url=|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=84|issue=4|pages=405–412|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, T. M., &amp; Cunningham, D. J. (1996). Constructivism: Implications for the design and delivery of instruction. In D. Jonassen (Ed.), Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology (pp. 170-198). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, T. M., &amp; Jonassen, D. H. (1992). Constructivism: New implications for instructional technology. In T. Duffy &amp; D. Jonassen (Eds.), Constructivism and the technology of instruction (pp. 1-16). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to the way it emerged during a period when the behaviorist paradigm was dominating American psychology. There are also those who cite that, aside from behaviorist psychology, the origin of the concept could be traced back to [[systems engineering]]. The impact of each of these fields is difficult to quantify, however, it is argued that the language and the "look and feel" of the early forms of instructional design and their progeny were derived from this engineering discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Instructional Design: International Perspectives. Theory, research, and models. Vol. 1|last=Tennyson|first=Robert|last2=Dijkstra|first2=S.|last3=Schott|first3=Frank|last4=Seel|first4=Norbert|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|year=1997|isbn=0805814000|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they were linked to the training development model used by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]], which were based on systems approach and was explained as "the idea of viewing a problem or situation in its entirety with all its ramifications, with all its interior interactions, with all its exterior connections and with full cognizance of its place in its context."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Improving Performance in the Workplace, Instructional Design and Training Delivery|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|last2=Foshay|first2=Wellesley|publisher=Pfeiffer|year=2010|isbn=9780470190685|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

The role of systems engineering in the early development of instructional design was demonstrated during [[World War II]] when a considerable amount of training materials for the military were developed based on the principles of instruction, learning, and human behavior. Tests for assessing a learner’s abilities were used to screen candidates for the training programs. After the success of military training, psychologists began to view training as a system and developed various analysis, design, and evaluation procedures.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; In 1946, [[Edgar Dale]] outlined a hierarchy of instructional methods, organized intuitively by their concreteness.&lt;ref name="slides"&gt;Clark, B. (2009).

===1950s===
B. F. Skinner's 1954 article “''The Science of Learning and the Art of Teaching''” suggested that effective instructional materials, called programmed instructional materials, should include small steps, frequent questions, and immediate feedback; and should allow self-pacing.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;
[[Robert F. Mager]] popularized the use of learning objectives with his 1962 article “''Preparing Objectives for Programmed Instruction”''. The article describes how to write objectives including desired behavior, learning condition, and assessment.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;
In 1956, a committee led by [[Benjamin Bloom]] published an influential [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives|taxonomy]] with three domains of learning: cognitive (what one knows or thinks), psychomotor (what one does, physically) and [[affective]] (what one feels, or what [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] one has). These taxonomies still influence the design of instruction.&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom's Taxonomy. Retrieved from Wikipedia on April 18, 2012 at [[Bloom's Taxonomy]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bloom_taxonomy.jpg|thumb|right|Bloom's Taxonomy]]

===1960s===
[[Robert Glaser]] introduced “criterion-referenced measures” in 1962. In contrast to norm-referenced tests in which an individual's performance is compared to group performance, a criterion-referenced test is designed to test an individual's behavior in relation to an objective standard. It can be used to assess the learners’ entry level behavior, and to what extent learners have developed mastery through an instructional program.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

In 1965, Robert Gagne (see below for more information) described three domains of learning outcomes (cognitive, affective, psychomotor), five learning outcomes (Verbal Information, Intellectual Skills, Cognitive Strategy, Attitude, Motor Skills), and nine events of instruction in “''The Conditions of Learning''”, which remain foundations of instructional design practices.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; Gagne’s work in learning hierarchies and hierarchical analysis led to an important notion in instruction – to ensure that learners acquire prerequisite skills before attempting superordinate ones.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

In 1967, after analyzing the failure of training material, Michael Scriven suggested the need for formative assessment – e.g., to try out instructional materials with learners (and revise accordingly) before declaring them finalized.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

===1970s===
During the 1970s, the number of instructional design models greatly increased and prospered in different sectors in military, academia, and industry.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; Many instructional design theorists began to adopt an information-processing-based approach to the design of instruction. David Merrill for instance developed Component Display Theory (CDT), which concentrates on the means of presenting instructional materials (presentation techniques).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/component-display.html Instructional Design Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194825/http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/component-display.html |date=2011-10-04 }}. Instructionaldesign.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Although interest in instructional design continued to be strong in business and the military, there was little evolution of ID in schools or higher education.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReiserPDF"&gt;Reiser, R. A. (2001).

ETR&amp;D, Vol. 49, No. 2, 2001, pp. 57–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, educators and researchers began to consider how the personal computer could be used in a [[learning environment]] or a [[learning space]].&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;History of instructional media.

Retrieved on April 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; There was a growing interest in how cognitive psychology could be applied to instructional design.&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt;

===1990s===
The influence of [[constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist theory]] on instructional design became more prominent in the 1990s as a counterpoint to the more traditional cognitive learning theory.&lt;ref name="ReiserPDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.instructionaldesigncentral.com/htm/IDC_instructionaltechnologytimeline.htm History and timeline of instructional design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425142515/http://www.instructionaldesigncentral.com/htm/IDC_instructionaltechnologytimeline.htm |date=2012-04-25 }}. Retrieved April 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivists believe that learning experiences should be "authentic" and produce real-world learning environments that allow learners to construct their own knowledge.&lt;ref name="ReiserPDF" /&gt; This emphasis on the learner was a significant departure from traditional forms of instructional design.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

[[Performance improvement]] was also seen as an important outcome of learning that needed to be considered during the design process.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube" /&gt; The World Wide Web emerged as an online learning tool with [[hypertext]] and hypermedia being recognized as good tools for learning.&lt;ref name="HyperHist" /&gt; As technology advanced and constructivist theory gained popularity, technology’s use in the classroom began to evolve from mostly drill and skill exercises to more interactive activities that required more complex thinking on the part of the learner.&lt;ref name="Markham" /&gt; Rapid prototyping was first seen during the 1990s. In this process, an instructional design project is prototyped quickly and then vetted through a series of try and revise cycles. This is a big departure from traditional methods of instructional design that took far longer to complete.&lt;ref name="ReiserPDF" /&gt;

==Robert Gagné==
Robert Gagné's work is widely used and cited in the design of instruction, as exemplified by more than 130 citations in prominent journals in the field during the period from 1985 through 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Anglin, G. J., &amp; Towers, R. L. (1992). Reference citations in selected instructional design and technology journals, 1985-1990. Educational Technology Research and Development, 40, 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesizing ideas from behaviorism and cognitivism, he provided a clear template, which is easy to follow for designing instructional events. Instructional designers who follow Gagné's theory will likely have tightly focused, efficient instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, J. D. (2001). Learning and cognition. [On-Line].

According to Gagné, learning occurs in a series of nine learning events, each of which is a condition for learning which must be accomplished before moving to the next in order. Similarly, instructional events should mirror the learning events:

# Gaining attention: To ensure reception of coming instruction, the teacher gives the learners a stimulus. Before the learners can start to process any new information, the instructor must gain the attention of the learners. This might entail using abrupt changes in the instruction.
# Informing learners of objectives: The teacher tells the learner what they will be able to do because of the instruction. The teacher communicates the desired outcome to the group.
# Stimulating recall of prior learning: The teacher asks for recall of existing relevant knowledge.
# Presenting the stimulus: The teacher gives emphasis to distinctive features.
# Providing learning guidance: The teacher helps the students in understanding (semantic encoding) by providing organization and relevance.
# Eliciting performance: The teacher asks the learners to respond, demonstrating learning.
# Providing feedback: The teacher gives informative feedback on the learners' performance.
# Assessing performance: The teacher requires more learner performance, and gives feedback, to reinforce learning.
# Enhancing retention and transfer: The teacher provides varied practice to generalize the capability.

Some educators believe that Gagné's taxonomy of learning outcomes and events of instruction oversimplify the learning process by over-prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, D. (1996). Gagné. [On-Line].

====Influence ====
Robert Gagné’s work has been the foundation of instructional design since the beginning of the 1960s when he conducted research and developed training materials for the military.   Among the first to coin the term “instructional design”, Gagné developed some of the earliest instructional design models and ideas.  These models have laid the groundwork for more present-day instructional design models from theorists like Dick, Carey, and Carey (The Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model),&lt;ref&gt;Dick, W., &amp; Carey, L. (1996). The systematic design of instruction. 4th ed.

The figure below illustrates these five ideas.&lt;ref name="instructional.com"/&gt;

Gagné's main focus for instructional design was how instruction and learning could be systematically connected to the design of instruction.  He emphasized the design principles and procedures that need to take place for effective teaching and learning.  His initial ideas, along with the ideas of other early instructional designers were outlined in ''Psychological Principles in Systematic Development'', written by Roberts B. Miller and edited by Gagné.&lt;ref&gt;Psychological Principles in System Development-1962.

Prior to Robert Gagné, learning was often thought of as a single, uniform process.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"&gt;Wiburg, K. M. (2003). [Web log message]. Retrieved from http://www.internettime.com/itimegroup/Is it Time to Exchange Skinner's Teaching Machine for Dewey's.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  There was little or no distinction made between “learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem”.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;   Gagné  offered an alternative view which developed the idea that different learners required different learning strategies.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;  Understanding and designing instruction based on a learning style defined by the individual brought about new theories and approaches to teaching.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;
Gagné 's understanding and theories of human learning added significantly to understanding the stages in cognitive processing and instructions.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;  For example, Gagné  argued that instructional designers must understand the characteristics and functions of short-term and long-term memory to facilitate meaningful learning.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt; This idea encouraged instructional designers to include cognitive needs as a top-down instructional approach.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;

Gagné (1966) defines curriculum as a sequence of content units arranged in such a way that the learning of each unit may be accomplished as a single act, provided the capabilities described by specified prior units (in the sequence) have already been mastered by the learner.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"&gt;Richey, R. C. (2000). The legacy of Robert M.Gagné . Syracuse, NY: ERIC Clearinghouse on Information &amp; Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

His definition of curriculum has been the basis of many important initiatives in schools and other educational environments.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gagné  had expressed and established an interest in applying theory to practice with particular interest in applications for teaching, training and learning.  Increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of practice was of particular concern.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;  His ongoing attention to practice while developing theory continues to influence education and training.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;

==Learning design==
The concept of learning design arrived in the literature of technology for education in the late 1990s and early 2000s&lt;ref&gt;Conole G., and Fill K., "A learning design toolkit to create pedagogically effective learning activities". Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 2005 (08).&lt;/ref&gt; with the idea that "designers and instructors need to choose for themselves the best mixture of behaviourist and constructivist learning experiences for their online courses".&lt;ref&gt;Carr-Chellman A. and Duchastel P., "The ideal online course," British Journal of Educational Technology, 31(3), 229–241, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the concept of learning design is probably as old as the concept of teaching. Learning design might be defined as "the description of the teaching-learning process that takes place in a unit of learning (e.g., a course, a lesson or any other designed learning event)".&lt;ref&gt;Koper R., "Current Research in Learning Design," Educational Technology &amp; Society, 9 (1), 13–22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

===ADDIE process===
Perhaps the most common model used for creating instructional materials is the [[ADDIE Model]]. This acronym stands for the 5 phases contained in the model (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate).

'''Brief History of ADDIE’s Development''' – The ADDIE model was initially developed by Florida State University to explain “the processes involved in the formulation of an instructional systems development (ISD) program for military interservice training that will adequately train individuals to do a particular job and which can also be applied to any interservice curriculum development activity.”&lt;ref name="ADDIE"&gt;Branson, R. K., Rayner, G. T., Cox, J. L., Furman, J. P., King, F. J., Hannum, W. H. (1975). Interservice procedures for instructional systems development. (5 vols.) (TRADOC Pam 350-30 NAVEDTRA 106A). Ft. Monroe, VA: U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, August 1975. (NTIS No. ADA 019 486 through ADA 019 490).&lt;/ref&gt;  The model originally contained several steps under its five original phases (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and [Evaluation and] Control),&lt;ref name="ADDIE" /&gt; whose completion was expected before movement to the next phase could occur.  Over the years, the steps were revised and eventually the model itself became more dynamic and interactive than its original hierarchical rendition, until its most popular version appeared in the mid-80s, as we understand it today.

The five phases are listed and explained below:&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues"&gt;Reiser, R. A., &amp; Dempsey, J. V. (2012). Trends and issues in instructional design and technology. Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]

'''Analyze''' – The first phase of content development is Analysis. Analysis refers to the gathering of information about one’s audience, the tasks to be completed, how the learners will view the content, and the project’s overall goals.  The instructional designer then classifies the information to make the content more applicable and successful.

'''Design''' – The second phase is the Design phase. In this phase, instructional designers begin to create their project. Information gathered from the analysis phase, in conjunction with the theories and models of instructional design, is meant to explain how the learning will be acquired. For example, the design phase begins with writing a learning objective. Tasks are then identified and broken down to be more manageable for the designer. The final step determines the kind of activities required for the audience in order to meet the goals identified in the Analyze phase.

'''Develop''' – The third phase, Development, involves the creation of the activities that will be implemented. It is in this stage that the blueprints of the design phase are assembled.

'''Implement''' – After the content is developed, it is then Implemented. This stage allows the instructional designer to test all materials to determine if they are functional and appropriate for the intended audience.

'''Evaluate''' – The final phase, Evaluate, ensures the materials achieved the desired goals. The evaluation phase consists of two parts: formative and summative assessment. The ADDIE model is an iterative process of instructional design, which means that at each stage the designer can assess the project's elements and revise them if necessary.  This process incorporates [[formative assessment]], while the [[summative assessment]]s contain tests or evaluations created for the content being implemented. This final phase is vital for the instructional design team because it provides data used to alter and enhance the design.

Connecting all phases of the model are external and reciprocal revision opportunities.  As in the internal Evaluation phase, revisions should and can be made throughout the entire process.

Most of the current instructional design models are variations of the ADDIE model.&lt;ref name="Piskurich, G.M. 2006"&gt;Piskurich, G.M. (2006). Rapid Instructional Design: Learning ID fast and right.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid prototyping===
An adaptation of the ADDIE model, which is used sometimes, is a practice known as [[rapid prototyping]].

Proponents suggest that through an iterative process the verification of the design documents saves time and money by catching problems while they are still easy to fix. This approach is not novel to the design of instruction, but appears in many design-related domains including software design, architecture, transportation planning, product development, message design, user experience design, etc.&lt;ref name="Piskurich, G.M. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saettler 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Saettler, P. |year=1990 |title=The evolution of American educational technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolovitch Keeps 1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stolovitch, H.D., &amp; Keeps, E. |title= Handbook of human performance technology |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some proponents of design prototyping assert that a sophisticated understanding of a problem is incomplete without creating and evaluating some type of prototype, regardless of the analysis rigor that may have been applied up front.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, T., &amp; Littman, J. (2005). The ten faces of innovation: IDEO's strategies for beating the devil's advocate &amp; driving creativity throughout your organization. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, up-front analysis is rarely sufficient to allow one to confidently select an instructional model. For this reason many traditional methods of instructional design are beginning to be seen as incomplete, naive, and even counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Hokanson, B., &amp; Miller, C. (2009). Role-based design: A contemporary framework for innovation and creativity in instructional design. Educational Technology, 49(2), 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some consider rapid prototyping to be a somewhat simplistic type of model. As this argument goes, at the heart of Instructional Design is the analysis phase. After you thoroughly conduct the analysis—you can then choose a model based on your findings. That is the area where most people get snagged—they simply do not do a thorough-enough analysis.

===Dick and Carey===
Another well-known instructional design model is the Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model.&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Dick, Walter, Lou Carey, and James O. Carey |year=2005 |title=The Systematic Design of Instruction |edition=6th |origyear=1978 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sYQCAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+systematic+design+of+instruction |pages=1–12 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |isbn=0-205-41274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was originally published in 1978 by Walter Dick and Lou Carey in their book entitled ''The Systematic Design of Instruction''.

[[File:Dick Carey.png|thumb|1000px|none|Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model]]

Dick and Carey made a significant contribution to the instructional design field by championing a systems view of instruction, in contrast to defining instruction as the sum of isolated parts. The model addresses instruction as an entire system, focusing on the interrelationship between context, content, learning and instruction.&lt;ref name="Forest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick and Carey Instructional Model|url=http://educationaltechnology.net/dick-and-carey-instructional-model/|author=Ed Forest|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124215130/http://educationaltechnology.net/dick-and-carey-instructional-model/|archivedate=2015-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dick and Carey, "Components such as the instructor, learners, materials, instructional activities, delivery system, and learning and performance environments interact with each other and work together to bring about the desired student learning outcomes".&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005/&gt; The components of the Systems Approach Model, also known as the Dick and Carey Model, are as follows:
* Identify Instructional Goal(s): A goal statement describes a skill, knowledge or attitude (SKA) that a learner will be expected to acquire
* Conduct Instructional Analysis: Identify what a learner must recall and identify what learner must be able to do to perform particular task
* Analyze Learners and Contexts: Identify general characteristics of the target audience, including prior skills, prior experience, and basic demographics; identify characteristics directly related to the skill to be taught; and perform analysis of the performance and learning settings.
* Write Performance Objectives: Objectives consists of a description of the behavior, the condition and criteria. The component of an objective that describes the criteria will be used to judge the learner's performance.
* Develop Assessment Instruments: Purpose of entry behavior testing, purpose of pretesting, purpose of post-testing, purpose of practive items/practive problems
* Develop Instructional Strategy: Pre-instructional activities, content presentation, Learner participation, assessment
* Develop and Select Instructional Materials
* Design and Conduct Formative Evaluation of Instruction: Designers try to identify areas of the instructional materials that need improvement.
* Revise Instruction: To identify poor test items and to identify poor instruction
* Design and Conduct Summative Evaluation

With this model, components are executed iteratively and in parallel, rather than linearly.&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005/&gt;

===Guaranteed Learning===
The instructional design model, Guaranteed Learning, was formerly known as the Instructional Development Learning System (IDLS).&lt;ref name="Esseff &amp; Esseff 1998"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Esseff, Peter J. |author2=Esseff, Mary Sullivan |year=1998 |title=Instructional Development Learning System (IDLS) |edition=8th |origyear=1970 |url=http://esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |pages=1–12 |publisher=ESF Press |isbn=1-58283-037-1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119152404/http://www.esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was originally published in 1970 by Peter J. Esseff, PhD and Mary Sullivan Esseff, PhD in their book entitled ''IDLS—Pro Trainer 1: How to Design, Develop, and Validate Instructional Materials''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html ESF, Inc. – Train-the-Trainer – ESF ProTrainer Materials – 813.814.1192] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119152404/http://www.esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |date=2008-11-19 }}. ESF-ProTrainer.com (2007-11-06). Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter (1968) &amp; Mary (1972) Esseff both received their doctorates in Educational Technology from the Catholic University of America under the mentorship of Dr. Gabriel Ofiesh, a founding father of the Military Model mentioned above. Esseff and Esseff synthesized existing theories to develop their approach to systematic design, "Guaranteed Learning" aka "Instructional Development Learning System" (IDLS). In 2015, Peter and Mary Esseff created an eLearning course to enable participants to take the GL course online under the direction of Dr. Esseff.

The components of the Guaranteed Learning Model are the following:
* Design a task analysis
* Develop criterion tests and performance measures
* Develop interactive instructional materials
* Validate the interactive instructional materials
* Create simulations or performance activities (Case Studies, Role Plays, and Demonstrations)

==Motivational design==
Motivation is defined as an internal drive that activates behavior and gives it direction.  The term motivation theory is concerned with the process that describe why and how human behavior is activated and directed.

===Motivation concepts===
''Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation''
* Instrinsic: defined as the doing of an activity for its inherent satisfactions rather than for some separable consequence.  When intrinsically motivated a person is moved to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather than because of external rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations|url=http://www.idealibrary.com|work=Contemporary Educational Psychology|accessdate=April 1, 2012|author=R.

If we are intrinsically motivated, we would not be worried about external rewards such as praise.
:''Examples:'' Writing short stories because you enjoy writing them, reading a book because you are curious about the topic, and playing chess because you enjoy effortful thinking
* Extrinsic: reflects the desire to do something because of external rewards such as awards, money and praise.  People who are extrinsically motivated may not enjoy certain activities.  They may only wish to engage in certain activities because they wish to receive some external reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrinsic Motivation and Extrinsic Motivation with Examples of Each Types of Motivation|url=http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/motivation.html|publisher=Blue Fox Communications|accessdate=April 1, 2012|author=Brad Bell|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414050628/http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/motivation.html|archivedate=April 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

has devoted his career to researching and understanding motivation in instructional systems.  These decades of work constitute a major contribution to the instructional design field. First, by applying motivation theories systematically to design theory.  Second, in developing a unique problem-solving process he calls the ARCS Motivation....

=== ARCS MODEL ===
The ARCS Model of Motivational Design was created by John Keller while he was researching ways to supplement the learning process with motivation.  The model is based on Tolman's and Lewin's expectancy-value theory, which presumes that people are motivated to learn if there is value in the knowledge presented (i.e. it fulfills personal needs) and if there is an optimistic expectation for success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ely|first=Donald|title=Development and Use of the ARCS Model of Motivational Design|year=1983|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model consists of four main areas: Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction.

Attention and relevance according to John Keller's ARCS motivational theory are essential to learning.  The first 2 of 4 key components for motivating learners, attention, and relevance can be considered the backbone of the ARCS theory, the latter components relying upon the former.

==== Components ====

=====Attention=====

The attention mentioned in this theory refers to the interest displayed by learners in taking in the concepts/ideas being taught.  This component is split into three categories: perceptual arousal, using surprise or uncertain situations; inquiry arousal, offering challenging questions and/or problems to answer/solve; and variability, using a variety of resources and methods of teaching.  Within each of these categories, John Keller has provided further sub-divisions of types of stimuli to grab attention. Grabbing attention is the most important part of the model because it initiates the motivation for the learners.  Once learners are interested in a topic, they are willing to invest their time, pay attention, and find out more.

=====Relevance=====

Relevance, according to Keller, must be established by using language and examples that the learners are familiar with.  The three major strategies Keller presents are goal-oriented, motive matching, and familiarity.  Like the Attention category, Keller divided the three major strategies into subcategories, which provide examples of how to make a lesson plan relevant to the learner. Learners will throw concepts to the wayside if their attention cannot be grabbed and sustained and if relevance is not conveyed.

=====Confidence=====

The confidence aspect of the ARCS model focuses on establishing positive expectations for achieving success among learners. The confidence level of learners is often correlated with motivation and the amount of effort put forth in reaching a performance objective. For this reason, it's important that learning design provides students with a method for estimating their probability of success. This can be achieved in the form of a syllabus and grading policy, rubrics, or a time estimate to complete tasks. Additionally, confidence is built when positive reinforcement for personal achievements is given through timely, relevant feedback.

=====Satisfaction=====

Finally, learners must obtain some type of satisfaction or reward from a learning experience. This satisfaction can be from a sense of achievement, praise from a higher-up, or mere entertainment. Feedback and reinforcement are important elements and when learners appreciate the results, they will be motivated to learn. Satisfaction is based upon motivation, which can be intrinsic or extrinsic. To keep learners satisfied, instruction should be designed to allow them to use their newly learned skills as soon as possible in as authentic a setting as possible.

==== Motivational Design Process ====
Along with the motivational components (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) the ARCS model provides a process that can address motivational problems. This process has 4 phases (Analysis, Design, Development, and Evaluation) with 10 steps within the phases:

'''Step 1: Obtain course information'''

Includes reviewing the description of the course, the instructor, and way of delivery the information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 2: Obtain audience information'''

Includes collecting the current skill level, attitudes towards the course, attitudes towards the teacher, attitudes towards the school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 3: Analyze audience'''

This should help identify the motivational problem that needs to be addressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 4: Analyze existing materials'''

Identifying positives of the current instructional material, as well as any problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 5:  List objectives and assessments'''

===Motivating opportunities===
Although Keller's ARCS model currently dominates instructional design with respect to learner motivation, in 2006 Hardré and Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardré|first=Patricia|author2=Miller, Raymond B.|title=Toward a current, comprehensive, integrative, and flexible model of motivation for instructional design|journal=Performance Improvement Quarterly|year=2006|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a need for a new design model that includes current research in human motivation, a comprehensive treatment of motivation, integrates various fields of psychology and provides designers the flexibility to be applied to a myriad of situations.

Hardré&lt;ref name="Hardré 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardré|first=Patricia|title=The motivating opportunities model for Performance SUCCESS: Design, Development, and Instructional Implications|journal=Performance Improvement Quarterly|year=2009|volume=22|issue=1|doi=10.1002/piq.20043}}&lt;/ref&gt;  proposes an alternate model for designers called the Motivating Opportunities Model or MOM. Hardré's model incorporates cognitive, needs, and affective theories as well as social elements of learning to address learner motivation. MOM has seven key components spelling the acronym 'SUCCESS' – Situational, Utilization, Competence, Content, Emotional, Social, and Systemic.&lt;ref name="Hardré 2009"/&gt;

The '''Joyce Theater''' (The Joyce") is a 472-seat [[dance]] performance venue located in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. The building opened in 1941 as the [[Elgin Theater]], a movie house, and was gut-renovated and reconfigured in 1981-82 to reopen as the Joyce Theater. The Joyce is a leading presenter of dance in New York City and nationally.

==Creation of The Joyce==
In 1977, the [[Eliot Feld | Eliot Feld Ballet]] had begun exploring more affordable approaches to presenting its annual season of performances in New York City. Rental costs and house sizes of the theaters available to the company made these seasons financially risky propositions. [[Eliot Feld]], the company’s founder and Artistic Director, and Cora Cahan, its Executive Director, envisioned creating a theater specifically for smaller dance organizations that their company could use, which would also be available to other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Leslie|last2=Morgan|first2=Roger|title=Space for Dance|date=1984|publisher=Publishing Center for Cultural Resources|location=Washington, D.C.|page=101|url=https://archive.org/details/spacefordancearc00arms|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first facility they looked at in late 1978 was the [[Elgin Theater]], a defunct movie theater in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood built in 1941. They quickly commenced negotiations to purchase it, ultimately arriving at a price of $225,000 and concluded the transaction in January, 1979. The philanthropist [[LuEsther Mertz]], co-founder of [[Publishers Clearing House]] and a benefactor of the company who had supported the renovation of the company’s studio, underwrote the full cost of the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Elgin Will Be Theater for Medium‐Sized Troupes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/29/archives/news-of-the-dance-elgin-will-be-theater-for-mediumsized-troupes-to.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=January 29, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing financial projections for the theater, Feld and Cahan anticipated an inclusive rental cost of around $12,000 per week. In a national survey they conducted, 73 dance organizations expressed interest in using the theater at the projected rental rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Plans to Convert Elgin To Dance Theater Falter|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/06/04/113944263.html?pageNumber=77|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 4, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings helped garner a wide range of financial support for developing the theater. The project secured a $400,000 Federal Urban Development Action Grant, which recognized its potential to provide employment and add to the vitality of its neighborhood. Other Federal Government support included a $450,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and a guarantee of a $600,000 bank loan. Private donors and foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation contributed the balance of the funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kisselgoff|first1=Anna|title=Creating a Theater Just for Dance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/arts/creating-a-theater-just-for-dance.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=July 26, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feld and Cahan engaged architect [[Hugh Hardy]] of the firm [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer]] to develop plans for a gut renovation of the facility. Major changes to the structure included the elimination of the original balcony configuration to create a steeply raked seating area on one level, new construction at the rear of the building to provide additional backstage space, and the installation of a 67 x 36 foot proscenium stage with a [[sprung floor]]. The completed theater had 472 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Leslie|last2=Morgan|first2=Roger|title=Space for Dance|date=1984|publisher=Publishing Center for Cultural Resources|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=101-102|url=https://archive.org/details/spacefordancearc00arms|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall cost of the project was $3.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance Theater Opening Delayed to April 12|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/20/arts/dance-theater-opening-delayed-to-april-12|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=December 20, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the June 25, 1981 groundbreaking, the building was renamed the Joyce Theater after the daughter of LuEsther Mertz in recognition of the elder Mertz’s leadership support of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facelift Begins at Renamed Elgin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/26/theater/facelift-begins-at-renamed-elgin.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 26, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater opened with a gala performance on June 2, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jennifer|first1=Dunning|title=Chelsea Program Opens Joyce Theater for Dance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/02/theater/chelsea-program-opens-joyce-theater-for-dance.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 2, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feld organization retained ownership of the building and created a separate non-profit organization to operate the theater under a 35-year lease at a nominal rent of $1 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kisselgoff|first1=Anna|title=Creating a Theater Just for Dance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/arts/creating-a-theater-just-for-dance.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=July 26, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 2016 conclusion of the lease term approached, the operating organization, the Joyce Theater Foundation, purchased the theater from the Feld organization for $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Joyce Theater to Buy Its Chelsea Home|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/joyce-theater-to-buy-its-chelsea-home/|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both the Feld organization and the Joyce Theater Foundation operated under successive legal names during the period recounted here. For the sake of clarity, these various names are elided in this section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and management==
The Joyce is a [[501(c)3 charitable organization]] whose mission is “To serve and support the art of dance and choreography, to promote the richness and variety of the art form in its fullest expression, and to advance the public interest in, and appreciation of, dance and the allied arts of music, design, and theater.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater: Mission and History|url=https://joyce.org/about/our-mission-and-history|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 27-member Board of Trustees oversees the organization. It operates on a budget of around $10 million annually that is supported by earned revenue, contributed income, government support and endowment income. Executive Director Linda Shelton oversees day-to-day activities of the Joyce, supported by a full-time staff of approximately 45 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater Foundation FY2015 IRS Form 990|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3038262|website=Guidestar|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining the Joyce in 1993, Shelton was General Manager of the [[Joffrey Ballet]], and had earlier held senior management roles at [[Twyla Tharp|Twyla Tharp Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Shelton Biography|url=https://www.danceusa.org/lindashelton|website=Dance/USA|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Mattocks is Director of Programming, with lead responsibility for developing each year’s presenting season.

==Main activities==
The Joyce presents an annual 40 to 45 week season on its stage, hosting an audience of approximately 150,000 people. In addition to this Chelsea season, the Joyce presents or co-presents at a small number of other venues, including the [[David H. Koch Theater]] at [[Lincoln Center]] and alternative spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater Foundation FY2015 IRS Form 990|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3038262|website=Guidestar|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through artistic residency and commissioning programs, the Joyce gives resources to established, early- and mid-career artists to advance their practice and develop new works for the Joyce stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater: Artist Residency|url=https://joyce.org/artist-residency|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New commissions are supported by the Stephen and Cathy Weinroth Fund for New Works, a $1 million endowment contributed by a Joyce board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Joyce Gets a $1 Million Fund to Foster New Dances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/01/arts/joyce-gets-a-1-million-fund-to-foster-new-dances.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=September 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also mounts a range of education, school and family programs that range from structured class visits to Joyce performances, to lessons at schools and community centers with Joyce-affiliated teaching artists, to family matinees with discount tickets for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater: School and Family Programs|url=https://joyce.org/school-family-programs|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Trade Center cultural center==
In 2004, The Joyce's proposal to operate a dance theater in the planned "arts hub" at the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]] was accepted by the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]]. The Joyce would have been one of several arts organizations at the facility, and proposed a 1,000-seat theater for major dance companies, with supporting programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Giving Dance a Better Presence Downtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/11/nyregion/giving-dance-a-better-presence-downtown.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing years, the vision for the cultural center has evolved through multiple iterations and tenant lists. It is currently planned as [[Performing Arts Center (Manhattan)|The Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center]], a multi-venue facility encompassing a range of performing and media arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Perlman Center: Artistic Vision|url=http://www.theperelman.org/artistic-vision/|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joyce's role in the current plan for the center has not been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Plans for Ground Zero Arts Hub Shift Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/arts/plans-for-ground-zero-arts-center-change-again.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joyce SoHo===
In 1996, The Joyce purchased a dance performance and rehearsal facility at 155 Mercer Street in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood that was owned and operated by the [[Dia Art Foundation]]. The building had been used for dance since 1985, and was sold because of financial difficulties at Dia. The Joyce obtained the building for $1.5 million with support from the [[LuEsther Mertz|LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust]], the charitable organization established by the organization's longstanding benefactor LuEsther T. Mertz upon her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Joyce Theater Buys Dia Dance Space in SoHo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/24/theater/joyce-theater-buys-dia-dance-space-in-soho.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=October 24, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joyce continued Dia's program of rehearsal space rental and performances in the 75-seat theater until 2012, when it accepted an unsolicited offer to sell the building for $27.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Joyce Theater to Buy Its Chelsea Home|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/joyce-theater-to-buy-its-chelsea-home/|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DANY Studios===
In December, 2009, the Joyce leased a rehearsal studio facility at 305 West 38th Street, in Manhattan's Garment District, that it operated under the name DANY [Dance Art New York] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Rocco|first1=Claudia|title=Joyce Theater Expands Its Studio Space|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/joyce-theater-expands-its-studio-space/|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility contained 11 studios. The Joyce did not renew when its lease ended in 2016 and closed DANY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DANY Studios in NYC Closing|url=http://www.danceinforma.us/articles/dany-studios-in-nyc-closing/|website=Dance Informa|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable '''[[book burning]]s''' have taken place throughout history.
&lt;!--keep this list in chronological order, please--&gt;

==Antiquity==
===Destruction of Ebla===

Destruction of [[Ebla]] 2240 BC, then in 1600 BC.

===Destruction of Mari===

Destruction of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in 1765 BC.

===Destruction of Alalakh===

Destruction of [[Alalakh]] circa 1200 BC.

===Destruction of Ugarit===

Destruction of [[Ugarit]] 1180 BC.

===Library of Ashurbanipal (by Babylonians, Scythians and Medes)===

In 612 BC the Assyrian capital [[Nineveh]] was destroyed by a coalition of [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Scythians]] and [[Medes]]. During the burning of the Royal Palace, a great fire ravaged the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] where the scholar King [[Ashurbanipal]] had amassed a great number of texts and tablets from various countries. Modern historians believe the library may have contained a considerable number of texts written on such mediums as leather scrolls, wax boards, and possibly [[papyrus|papyri]] – all of them vulnerable to fire. However, the considerable number of clay cuneiform tablets became partially baked.&lt;ref name="Polastron, Lucien X. 2007, page 3"&gt;Polastron, Lucien X.: "Books on Fire: The Tumultuous Story Of The World's Great Libraries" 2007, page 3, Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, London&lt;/ref&gt; This destructive event helped preserve the tablets, which lay in the earth and were eventually found by 19th century archaeologists.

===A scroll written by the Hebrew prophet Jeremiah (burnt by King Jehoiakim)===
About 600 BC, Jeremiah of Anathoth wrote that the King of Babylon would destroy the land of Judah. As recounted in Jeremiah 36, Jeremiah's scroll was read before Jehoiakim, King of Judah, in the presence of important officials; King Jehoiakim destroyed the scroll in a fire, and then sought to have Jeremiah arrested.

===Protagoras's "On the Gods" (by Athenian authorities)===
The Classical Greek philosopher [[Protagoras]] (c. 490 – c. 420 BC) was a proponent of agnosticism, writing in a now lost work entitled ''On the Gods'': ''"Concerning the gods, I have no means of knowing whether they exist or not or of what sort they may be, because of the obscurity of the subject, and the brevity of human life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/protagor.htm |title=Protagoras &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], the above outspoken Agnostic position taken by Protagoras aroused anger, causing the Athenians to expel him from their city, where the authorities ordered all copies of the book to be collected and burned in the marketplace. The same story is also mentioned by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, de Natura Deorum, 1.23.6&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Classicist [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] doubts this account, as both Diogenes Laertius and Cicero wrote hundreds of years later and no such persecution of Protagoras is mentioned by contemporaries who make extensive references to this philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;John Burnet, "Greek Philosophy: From Thales to Plato", 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Burnet notes that even if some copies of Protagoras' book were burned, enough of them survived to be known and discussed in the following century.

===Democritus' writings (by Plato)===

The philosopher [[Plato]] is said to have greatly disliked fellow-philosopher [[Democritus]] and wanted all of Democritus' books burned. [[Aristoxenus]] in his ''Historical Notes'' affirms that "Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he could collect"&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristoxenus]]' book is lost, but the Plato reference survives in a quote in  [[Diogenes Laërtius]]' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', ix. 40&lt;/ref&gt;. In his own lifetime, Plato was not in a position to destroy all copies of his rival's writings, but Plato's purpose was largely achieved through the choices made by scribes in later Classical times. Plato's own writings were frequently copied, and unlike nearly all of his [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophical contemporaries]], Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John M.; Hutchinson, D. S., eds. (1997): "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, none of Democritus' writings have survived, and only fragments are known from his vast body of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/ Democritus at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these fragments are enough to let many consider Democritus to be "The Father of Modern Science".&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Gossin, ''Encyclopedia of Literature and Science'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrian scriptures and Persian Royal Archives (by Alexander the Great)===
The burning of [[Persepolis]], the ceremonial capital of the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]], about 330 BC, was one of the stains on the record of
[[Alexander the Great]], contrasting with the efforts he otherwise made to act humanely towards the defeated Persians. Various accounts
attribute it to an accident, a drunken revelry by Alexander's soldiers, or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] by the Achaemenid army centuries before. There was evidently no deliberate targeting of books and written material, but – though not mentioned in Greek and Latin accounts – such destruction did result from the setting on fire of palaces made mostly of highly combustible [[cedar wood]]. The ''[[Book of Arda Wiraz]]'', a [[Zoroastrian]] work composed in the 3rd or 4th century CE, mentions the destruction of Royal Archives and of "all the [[Avesta]] (Zoroastrian scriptures) and [[Zend]] (commentraries)" which were "written with gold ink upon prepared cow-skins". The ''[[Bundahishn]]'' – an [[encyclopædia]]ic collection of [[Zoroastrian cosmogony]] and [[Zoroastrian cosmology|cosmology]] – also refers to "Aleskandar" (Alexander) having burned the Avesta following his defeat of "Dara" ([[Darius III]]). For this act of sacrilege, Alexander's name was regularly accompanied in [[Middle Persian]] Zoroastrian texts by the appelation ''Gujastak'' ("the Damned", or "the Evil"). As late as the 10th century CE, the native Iranian writer [[Biruni]], in his ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Nations]]'', mentioned regretfully the loss of historiographical sources due to that burning.

The fall of Persepolis paradoxically contributed to the preservation of the [[Persepolis Administrative Archives|Achaemenid administrative archives]] that might have been lost due to passage of time and natural and man-made causes.&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer 10-11"&gt;Wiesehöfer 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; According to archaeological evidence, the partial burning of Persepolis did not affect the Persepolis Fortification Archive tablets, but may have caused the eventual collapse of the upper part of the northern Fortification wall that preserved the tablets until their recovery by the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]]'s archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Henkelman 2008:Ch 2"&gt;Henkelman 2008:Ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese philosophy books (by Emperor Qin Shi Huang and anti-Qin rebels)===
{{Main|Burning of books and burying of scholars}}

During the [[Warring States Period]], China was divided into various states - each of which had its own historians, writing over centuries their version of the history of their state and its relations with neighbors and rivals. Following [[Qin (state)|Qin]]'s conquest of all the others, Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] - on the advice of his minister [[Li Si]]  - ordered the burning of all philosophy books and history books from states other than Qin  – beginning in 213 BC. This was followed by the live burial of a large number of intellectuals who did not comply with the state dogma.

Li Si is reported to have said: "I, your servant, propose that all historian's records other than those of [[Qin dynasty|Qin's]] be burned. With the exception of the academics whose duty includes possessing books, if anyone [[all under heaven|under heaven]] has copies of the [[Shi Jing]], the [[Classic of History]], or the writings of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought|hundred schools of philosophy]], they shall deliver them [the books] to the governor or the commandant for burning. Anyone who dares to discuss the Shi Jing or the Classic of History shall be publicly executed. Anyone who uses history to criticize the present shall have his family executed. Any official who sees the violations but fails to report them is equally guilty. Anyone who has failed to burn the books after thirty days of this announcement shall be subjected to tattooing and be sent to build the [[Great Wall]]. The books that have exemption are those on medicine, [[divination]], agriculture and [[forestry]]. Those who have interest in laws shall instead study from officials."&lt;ref&gt;In Chinese: "相李斯曰：「臣請史官非秦記皆燒之。非博士官所職，天下敢有D詩、書、百家語者，悉詣守、尉雜燒之。有敢偶語詩書者棄市。以古非今者族。吏見知不舉者與同罪。令下三十日不燒，黥為城旦。所不去者，醫藥卜筮種樹之書。若欲有学法令，以吏为师」", from [[Shiji]] Chapter 6. "The Basic Annals of the First Emperor of Qin," thirty-fourth year (213 BC).&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to Chinese culture was compounded during the revolts which ended the short rule of [[Qin Er Shi]], Qin Shi Huang's son. The imperial palace and state archives were burned, destroying many of the remaining written records that had been spared by the father.

Several other large book burnings also occurred in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;Jing Liao, [http://www.uri.edu/personal/yanma/597cl/userservicesjingliao.pdf A historical perspective : the root cause for the underdevelopment of user services in Chinese academic libraries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607050458/http://www.uri.edu/personal/yanma/597cl/userservicesjingliao.pdf |date=June 7, 2011 }}, [[The Journal of Academic Librarianship]], vol.30, num. 2, pages 109–115, march 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears they occurred in every dynasty following the Qin, but it is unknown how often.&lt;ref&gt;Chieh-Kang and Goodrich 1938, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books of Pretended Prophecies (by Roman authorities)===
In 186 BC, in an effort to suppress the [[Bacchanalia]] practices that had been led in part by [[Minius Cerrinius]], a Consul of Rome claimed that the fathers and grandfathers of the Romans had suppressed foreign rites and ceremonies, "seeking out and burning all books of pretended prophecies"&lt;ref&gt;Livy: History of Rome; 39.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish holy books (by the Seleucid monarch Antiochus IV)===
In 168 BC the [[Seleucid]] monarch [[Antiochus IV]] ordered Jewish 'Books of the Law' found in [[Jerusalem]] to be 'rent in pieces' and burned&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Maccabees]] 1:56&lt;/ref&gt; – part of the series of persecutions which precipitated the revolt of the [[Maccabees]].

===Aeneid (unsuccessfully ordered by Virgil)===
In 17 BC, [[Virgil]] died and in his will ordered that his masterpiece, the [[Aeneid]], be burned, as it was a draft and not a final version. However, his friends disobeyed him and released the epic poem after editing it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/suet-vergil.html |title=Suetonius: The Life of Vergil |website=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman history book (by the aediles)===
In 25 AD Senator [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus]] was forced to commit suicide and his ''History'' was burned by the [[aedile]]s, under the order of the [[Roman Senate|senate]]. The book's praise of [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], who had assassinated [[Julius Caesar]], was considered an offence under the ''[[law of majestas|lex majestatis]]''. A copy of the book was saved by Cordus' daughter Marcia, and it was published again under [[Caligula]]. However, only a few fragments survived to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Bellemore, Jane. "The Dating of Seneca's Ad Marciam De Consolatione". The Classical Quarterly 42, no.1 (1992): 219–234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Frederick H. "Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome". Journal of the History of Ideas 6, no.2 (April 1945): 157–196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]]. The Annals of Imperial Rome, translated by Michael Grant, p. 34. London: Harmondsworth, 1964; cited in Cramer, Frederick H. "Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome". Journal of the History of Ideas 6, no.2 (April 1945): 157–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek and Latin prophetic verse (by the Emperor Augustus)===
Suetonius tells us that, at the death of Marcus Lepidus (about 13 BC), Augustus assumed the office of Chief Priest, and burned over two thousand copies of Greek and Latin prophetic verse then current, the work of anonymous or unrespected authors (preserving the Sibylline Books).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius:Twelve Caesars; Augustus. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torah scroll (by Roman soldier)===
[[Flavius Josephus]]&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." xx. 5, § 4; "B. J." ii. 12, § 2.&lt;/ref&gt; relates that about the year 50 a Roman soldier seized a Torah scroll and, with abusive and mocking language, burned it in public. This incident almost brought on a general Jewish revolt against Roman rule, such as broke out two decades later. However, the Roman [[Procurator (Roman)|Procurator]] [[Cumanus]] appeased the Jewish populace by beheading the culprit.

===Sorcery scrolls (by early converts to Christianity at Ephesus)===
{{main|Book burning at Ephesus}}
About the year 55 according to the [[New Testament]] book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], early converts to Christianity in [[Ephesus]] who had previously practiced sorcery burned their scrolls: "A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand [[drachma]]s." (Acts 19:19, [[New International Version|NIV]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/curiousarts.html |title=Curious arts (WebBible Encyclopedia) – |publisher=Christiananswers.net |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion burned with a Torah scroll (under Hadrian)===
Under the Emperor [[Hadrian]], the teaching of the [[Jewish Scriptures]] was forbidden, as, in the wake of the [[Bar Kochva]] Rebellion, the Roman authorities regarded such teaching as seditious and tending towards revolt. [[Haninah ben Teradion]], one of the Jewish [[Ten Martyrs]] executed for having defied that ban, is reported to have been [[burned at the stake]] together with the forbidden [[Torah]] scroll which he had been teaching. According to Jewish tradition, when the flame started to burn himself and the scroll he still managed to say to his pupils: "I see the scrolls burning but the letters fly up in the air" – a saying considered to symbolize the superiority of ideas to brute force. While in the original applying to sacred writings only, 20th Century Israeli writers also quoted this saying in the context of secular ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avodah Zarah]] 17b et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=221&amp;letter=H&amp;search=Hanina%20ben%20Teradion |title=Hananiah (Ḥanina) B. Teradion |website=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burning of the Torah by Apostomus (precise time and circumstances debated)===
Among five catastrophes said to have overtaken the Jews on the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]], the ''[[Mishnah]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ta'anit]] iv. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; includes "the burning of the [[Torah]] by [[Apostomus]]". Since no further details are given and there are no other references to Apostomus in Jewish or non-Jewish sources, the exact time and circumstances of this traumatic event are debated, historians assigning to it different dates in Jewish history under Seleucid or Roman rule, and it might be identical with one of the events noted above (see [[Apostomus]] page).

===Epicurus's book (in Paphlagonia)===
The book ''Established beliefs'' of [[Epicurus]] was burned in a [[Paphlagonia]]n marketplace by order of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]], supposed prophet of [[Glycon]], the son of [[Asclepius]] ca 160&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm |title=Lucian of Samosata : Alexander the False Prophet |website=Tertullian.org |date=August 31, 2001 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manichaean and Christian scriptures (by Diocletian)===
The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] started on March 31, 302, with the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]], in a rescript from Alexandria, ordering that the leading [[Manichaean]]s be burnt alive along with their scriptures.&lt;ref name="GHH"&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 20; Clarke, 648, citing ''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 660 and ''Mosiacarum et Romanarum Legum Collatio'' 25.36–8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time a Roman Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature.&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Gwatkin, "Notes on Some Chronological Questions Connected with the Persecution of Diocletian," ''English Historical Review'' 13:51 (1898): 499.&lt;/ref&gt;
On the following year, on February 23, 303, Diocletian ordered that the newly built Christian church at [[Nicomedia]] be razed, its scriptures burned, and its treasures seized.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22; Clarke, 650; Odahl, 67–69; Potter, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Later persecutions included the burning of both the Christians themselves and of their books. As related in later Christian [[Hagiography]], at that time the governor of [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] offered the [[deacon]] who would become known as [[Saint Vincent of Saragossa]] to have his life spared in exchange for his consigning [[Scripture]] to the fire. Vincent refused and let himself be executed instead. In religious paintings he is often depicted holding the book whose preservation he preferred to his own life (see illustration in [[Saint Vincent of Saragossa]] page.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Prudentius]], ''Peristephanon'' ("Crowns of Martyrdom")&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, many other Christians, less courageous, did save their lives by giving away their Scriptures to be burned. These came to be known as [[Traditores]] (literally, "those who give away") from which the modern word "traitor" is derived.

===Books of Arianism (after Council of Nicaea)===
[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|Burning of Arian books at Nicaea (illustration from a compendium of canon law, ca. 825, MS. in the Capitular Library, Vercelli)]]

The books of [[Arianism|Arius]] and his followers, after the [[first Council of Nicaea]] (325 C.E.), were burned for [[heresy]] by the Roman emperors Constantine, Honorius, and [[Theodosius I]], who published a decree commanding that, "the doctrine of the Trinity should be embraced by those who would be called catholics; that all others should bear the infamous name of heretics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Priestley, Joseph|Joseph Priestley]].

===Library of Antioch (by Jovian)===
In 364, the Roman Catholic [[Jovian (Emperor)|Emperor Jovian]] ordered the entire [[Library of Antioch]] to be burnt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael von Albrecht]], and Gareth L. Schmeling, ''A history of Roman literature'' (1997), page 1744&lt;/ref&gt; It had been heavily stocked by the aid of his non-Christian predecessor, [[Flavius Claudius Julianus|Emperor Julian]].

==="Unacceptable writings" (by Athanasius)===
[[Elaine Pagels]] is the first to claim that in 367, [[Athanasius]] ordered monks in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in his role as bishop of [[Alexandria]] to destroy all "unacceptable writings" in [[Egypt]], the list of writings to be saved constituting the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Athanasius of Alexandria]]: Paschal letter (letter 39), 367 AD&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no evidence that Athanasius decreed all unacceptable writings to be burned, this unsubstantiated claim by Pagels is frequently cited as fact on the internet.

===The Sibylline books (various times)===
The [[Sibylline Books]] were a collection of oracular sayings. According to myth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]]: ''Institutiones divinae'' (I: 6) quoting a lost work by [[Varro]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cumae]]an [[sibyl]] offered [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] the books for a high price, and when he refused, burned three. When he refused to buy the remaining six at the same price, she again burned three, finally forcing him to buy the last three at the original price. The [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]] watched over the surviving books in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]], but could not prevent their being burned when the temple burned down in 83 BC. They were replaced by a similar collection of oracular sayings from around the Mediterranean in 76 BC, along with the sayings of the [[Tiburtine sibyl]], and then checked by priests for perceived accuracy as compared to the burned originals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annales'', VI, 12&lt;/ref&gt; These remained until for political reasons they were burned by Flavius [[Stilicho]] (died 408).&lt;ref&gt;[[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus]], ''De reditu suo''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings of Priscillian===
In 385, the theologian [[Priscillian]] of [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]] became the first Christian to be executed by fellow-Christians as a [[Heresy|heretic]]. Some (though not all) of his writings were condemned as heretical and burned. For many centuries they were considered irreversibly lost, but surviving copies were discovered in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Mckenna |url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan3.htm |title=The Library of Iberian Resources On-line: Paganism and Pagan Survivals in Spain up to the Fall of the Visigothic Kingdom by Stephen McKenna |publisher=Libro.uca.edu |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
===Patriarch Eutychius' book (by Emperor Tiberius II Constantine)===

[[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]] published a treatise, on the [[Resurrection of the dead|General Resurrection]], maintaining that the resurrected body "will be more subtle than air, and no longer palpable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines: Being a Continuation of 'The Dictionary of the Bible': VolumeII Eaba – Hermocrates|first=William|last=Smith|author2=Henry Wace|year=1880|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|page=415}} The dictionary account is apparently based on [[Bede]], Book II, Chapter 1, who used the expression "...impalpable, of finer texture than wind and air."&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Gregory the Great]] opposed the palpability of the risen Christ in {{bibleverse||Luke|24:39|KJV}}. As the dispute could not be settled, the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Tiberius II Constantine]], undertook to arbitrate. He decided in favor of palpability and ordered Eutychius' book to be burned. Eutychius died soon afterwards, on 5 April 582.

===Japanese books and manuscripts (during power struggle at the Imperial court)===

During the "[[Isshi Incident]]" of 645, a transformative event in early Japanese Imperial history, the influential [[Soga no Iruka]] was assassinated and enemies of the Soga Clan seized power. Shortly afterwards, Iruka's father [[Soga no Emishi]] killed himself by setting fire to his residence. The conflagration destroyed the manuscript copy of the ''[[Tennōki]]'', an important historical text which was forever lost, as well as many other Imperial treasures which had been taken for safe-keeping by the Soga,.&lt;ref name="pf50"&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fune no Fubitoesaka]] quickly grabbed out of the flames another unique historical text known as ''[[Kokki]]'' and is said to have afterwards presented it to [[Emperor Tenji]] – though it was at some later time lost in unknown circumstances, and no known extant copies of it remain.&lt;ref&gt;Sakamoto, Tarō ''et al.'' (1965). ''Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei: Nihon Shoki'' Vol. II, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeated destruction of Alexandria libraries===
{{Main|Library of Alexandria#Destruction of the Library}}
The library of the [[Serapeum]] in Alexandria was trashed, burned and looted, 392, at the decree of [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]], who was ordered so by [[Theodosius I]]. Around the same time, [[Hypatia]] was murdered. One of the largest destructions of books occurred at the [[Library of Alexandria]], traditionally held to be in 640; however, the precise years are unknown as are whether the fires were intentional or accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01303a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: The Alexandrian Library |website=Newadvent.org |date=March 1, 1907 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Venerable Bede |url=http://www.bede.org.uk/library.htm#omar |title=The Mysterious Fate of the Great Library of Alexandria |website=Bede.org.uk |date=May 28, 2013 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconoclast writings (by Byzantine authorities)===
Following the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]" in 843, when the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Byzantine Iconoclasts]] were decisively defeated and the worship of Icons formally restored, the Byzantine secular and religious authorities destroyed almost all Iconoclast writings – making it difficult for modern researchers to determine what exactly were the Iconoclasts' reasons to oppose the use of Icons in Christian worship.

===Qur'anic texts with varying wording (ordered by the 3rd Caliph, Uthman)===
{{Main|Origin and development of the Qur'an#First standardization of Qur'an}}
[[Uthman|Uthman ibn 'Affan]], the third [[Caliph]] of Islam after [[Muhammad]], who is credited with overseeing the collection of the verses of the [[Qur'an]], ordered the destruction of any other remaining text containing verses of the Quran after the Quran has been fully collected, circa 650. This was done to ensure that the collected and authenticated Quranic copy that Uthman collected became the primary source for others to follow, thereby ensuring that Uthman's version of the Quran remained authentic. Although the Qur'an had mainly been propagated through oral transmission, it also had already been recorded in at least three [[Codex|codices]], most importantly the codex of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud in [[Kufa]], and the codex of Ubayy ibn Ka'b in [[Syria]]. Sometime between 650 and 656, a committee appointed by Uthman is believed to have produced a singular version in seven copies, and Uthman is said to have "sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered any other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/061.sbt.html#006.061.510 |title=Volume 6, Book 61, Number 510 |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823104808/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/061.sbt.html#006.061.510 |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competing prayer books (at Toledo)===
After the conquest of [[Toledo, Spain]] (1085) by the king of Castile, whether [[History of Christianity in Spain|Iberian Christians]] should follow the foreign [[Roman rite]] or the traditional [[Mozarabic rite]] became a subject of dispute. After other [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]]s, the dispute was submitted to the [[trial by ordeal|trial by fire]]: One book for each rite was thrown into a fire. The Toledan book was little damaged after the Roman one was consumed. [[Henry Jenner]] comments in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]: "No one who has seen a [[Mozarabic manuscript]] with its extraordinarily solid [[vellum]], will adopt any hypothesis of Divine Interposition here."&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10611a.htm Mozarabic Rite], by [[Henry Jenner]] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abelard forced to burn his own book (at Soissons)===
The provincial [[synod]] held at [[Soissons]] (in France) in 1121 condemned the teachings of the famous theologian [[Peter Abelard]] as [[heresy]]; he was forced to burn his own book before being shut up inside the [[convent]] of St. Medard at Soissons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070814055518/http://robertfripp.ca/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ArticleDisplay&amp;ArticleID=483&amp;SectionID=152 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The writings of Arnold of Brescia (at France and Rome)===
The rebellious monk [[Arnold of Brescia]] – Abelard's pupil and colleague – refused to abjure his views after they were condemned at the [[Synod of Sens]] in 1141, and went on to lead the [[Commune of Rome]] in direct opposition to the Pope, until being executed in 1155.
The Church ordered the burning of all his writings, which was carried out so thoroughly than none of them survives and it is unknown even what they were – except for what can be inferred from polemics against him.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold's life depends for its sources on [[Otto of Freising]] and a chapter in [[John of Salisbury]]'s ''Historia Pontificalis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, though no written word of Arnold's has survived, his teachings on [[apostolic poverty]] continued potent after his death, among "Arnoldists" and more widely among [[Waldensians]] and the [[Spiritual Franciscans]].

===Nalanda University===
The library of [[Nalanda]], known as Dharma Gunj (Mountain of Truth) or Dharmagañja (Treasury of Truth), was the most renowned repository of Hindu and Buddhist knowledge in the world at the time. Its collection was said to comprise hundreds of thousands of volumes, so extensive that it burned for months when set aflame by [[Muslim invasions of India|Muslim invaders]] in 1193.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Early Indian Civilization'' by Gertrude Emerson Sen.

===Buddhist writings in the Maldives (by Royal dynasty converted to Islam)===
Following the conversion of the [[Maldives]] to Islam in 1153 (or by some accounts in 1193), the [[Buddhist]] religion – hitherto state religion for more than a thousand years – was suppressed. The copper-plate document known as Dhanbidhū [[Lōmāfānu]] gives information about events in the southern [[Haddhunmathi Atoll]], which had been a major center of Buddhism – where monks were beheaded, and statues of [[Vairocana]], the transcendent [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], were destroyed. At that time, also the wealth of Buddhist manuscripts written on [[screwpine]] leaves by Maldivian monks in their Buddhist monasteries was either burnt or otherwise so thoroughly eliminated that it has disappeared without leaving any trace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom.''

===Buddhist writings in the Gangetic plains region of India (by Turk-Mongol raiders)===

According to William Johnston, as part of the [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] there was a persecution of the Buddhist religion, considered idolaterous from the Muslim point of view. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Buddhist texts were burnt by the Muslim armies in the Gangetic plains region, which also destroyed hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and shrines and killed monks and nuns.&lt;ref name="Johnston2000p335"&gt;{{cite book|author=William M.

===Destruction of Cathar texts (Languedoc region of France)===
[[File:Santo Domingo y los albigenses-detalle.jpg|thumb|Detail of a [[Pedro Berruguete]] painting of a disputation between [[Saint Dominic]] of Guzman and the [[Albigensians]] ([[Catharism|Cathars]]) in which the books of both were thrown on a fire, with St. Dominic's books miraculously preserved from the flames. ''[[:Image:Talmudtrial.jpg|See the whole picture]]''.]]

During the 13th century, the Catholic Church waged a brutal campaign against the [[Cathar]]s of [[Languedoc]] (smaller numbers also lived elsewhere in Europe), culminating in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. Nearly every [[Catharism|Cathar]] text that could be found was destroyed, in an effort to completely extirpate their heretical beliefs; only a few are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sumption|first=Jonathan|title=The Albigensian Crusade|year=1978|publisher=Faber and Faber, Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-571-20002-8|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians researching the Cathar religious principles are forced to largely rely on information provided by the manifestly hostile writings of their sworn opponents.

===Maimonides' philosophy (at Montpellier)===
[[Maimonides]]' major philosophical and theological work, "[[Guide for the Perplexed]]", got highly mixed reactions from fellow-Jews of his and later times – some revering it and viewing it as a triumph, while others deemed many of its ideas [[heresy|heretical]], banning it and on some occasions burning copies of it.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry "Maimonidean Controversy, under Maimonides, in volume 11 of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', Keter Publishing, and ''Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought'' by Menachem Kellner.&lt;/ref&gt;
One such burning took place at [[Montpellier]], Southern France, in 1233.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Lister M. ''Icons of the Middle Ages : Rulers, Writers, Rebels, And Saints.'' p. 464: ABC-CLIO, 2012. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Talmud (at Paris), first of many such burnings over the next centuries===
In 1242, The French crown burned all [[Talmud]] copies in Paris, about 12,000, after the book was "charged" and "found guilty" in the [[Disputation of Paris]] sometimes called "the Paris debate" or the "Trial of the Talmud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossel|first=Seymour|title=Journey Through Jewish History (Book 2)|year=1983|publisher=Behrman House, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-87441-367-2|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These burnings of Jewish books were initiated by [[Pope Gregory IX]], who persuaded [[Louis IX of France|French King Louis IX]] to undertake it. This particular book burning was commemorated by the German Rabbi and poet [[Meir of Rothenburg]] in the [[Kinnot|elegy (kinna)]] called "Ask, O you who are burned in fire" (שאלי שרופה באש), which is recited to this day by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] on the fast of [[Tisha B'av]].

The Church's original stance alleged that the Talmud contained blasphemous writings towards Jesus Christ and his mother Mary, attacks against the Church and other offensive pronouncements against non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/burning-of-the-talmud Christian-Jewish Relations: Burning of the Talmud]&lt;/ref&gt; which lead subsequent popes to organize public burnings of Jewish books. The most well known of them were [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] (1243–1254), [[Pope Clement IV|Clement IV]] (1256–1268), [[Pope John XXII|John XXII]] (1316–1334), [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] (1555–1559), [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] (1566–1572) and [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1592–1605).

Once the printing press was invented, the Church found it impossible to destroy entire printed editions of the Talmud and other sacred books. [[Johann Gutenberg]], the German who invented the printing press around 1450, certainly helped stamp out the effectiveness of further book burnings. The tolerant (for its time) policies of Venice made it a center for the printing of Jewish books (as of books in general), yet the Talmud was publicly burned in 1553&lt;ref&gt;Stow, Kenneth R.

===Rabbi Nachmanides' account of the Disputation of Barcelona (by Dominicans)===
In 1263 the [[Disputation of Barcelona]] was held before King [[James I of Aragon]] between the [[monk]] [[Pablo Christiani]] (a convert from Judaism) and [[Rabbi]] [[Moses ben Nachman]] (also known as [[Nachmanides]]). At the end of disputation, king awarded Nachmanides a monetary prize and declared that never before had he heard "an unjust cause so nobly defended."&lt;ref&gt;
Slater, Elinor &amp; Robert (1999): ''Great Moments in Jewish History.'' Jonathan David Company, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8246-0408-3}}. p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Dominicans nevertheless claimed the victory, Nahmanides felt compelled to publish the controversy. The Dominicans asserted that this account was blasphemies against Christianity. Nahmanides admitted that he had stated many things against Christianity, but he had written nothing which he had not used in his disputation in the presence of the King, who had granted him freedom of speech. The justice of his defense was recognized by the King and the commission, but to satisfy the Dominicans Nahmanides was exiled and his pamphlet was condemned to be burned.

===Lollard books and writings (By English Law)===

The [[De heretico comburendo]] ("On the Burning of Heretics"), a law passed by the English Parliament under King [[Henry IV of England]] in 1401, was intended to stamp out "[[heresy]]" and in particular the [[Lollard]] movement, followers of [[John Wycliffe]]. The law stated that "...divers false and perverse people of a certain new sect ...make and write books, [and] do wickedly instruct and inform people". The law's purpose was to "utterly destroy" all "preachings, doctrines, and opinions of this wicked sect". Therefore, all persons in possession of "such books or writings of such wicked doctrine and opinions" were ordered to deliver all such books and writings to the diocesan authorities, within forty days of the law being enacted, so as to let them be burned and destroyed. Those failing to give up their heretical books would face the prospect of being arrested and having their bodies as well as their books burned.

===Wycliffe's books (at Prague)===
In 1410 [[John Wycliffe]]'s books were burnt by the illiterate [[Prague]] archbishop [[Zbyněk Zajíc|Zbyněk Zajíc z Házmburka]] in the court of his palace in [[Malá Strana|Lesser Town of Prague]] to hinder the spread of [[Jan Hus]]'s teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Huss|url=http://www.theopedia.com/John_Huss|publisher=Theopedia|accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry of Villena]], a scion of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]'s [[House of Barcelona|old dynasty]], was a scholar, surgeon, and translator who was persecuted by the kings of [[kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] as a [[witchcraft|sorcerer]] and [[necromancer]]. Upon his death in prison, {{nowrap|[[John II of Castile|John II]]}} of [[kingdom of Castile|Castile]] ordered his confessor [[Lope de Barrientos|Bishop Barrientos]] to burn Villena's library&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=García de Santamaría |first=Álvar |date=c. 1450 |title=Crónica de Juan II ''[''Chronicle of John II'']'' |location=Madrid |at=Ch. 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Juan de Mena]] skewered the bishop for this destruction in his ''Labyrinth of Fortune''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Spanish Arts |url=http://www.spanisharts.com |contribution=Medieval Spanish Poetry: Cancionero |contribution-url=http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_cancionero.htm |accessdate=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others accused him of plundering it for the purpose of later plagiarizing the works himself, but Barrientos portrayed himself as bound by his king's orders and as having done what he could to preserve the library's most important works:

{{quote|Your Majesty, after the death of [[Don Enrique de Villena]], as a Christian king, you sent me, your devoted follower, to burn his books, which I executed in the presence of your servants. These actions, and other ones, are a testament to your Majesty's devotion to Christianity. While this is praiseworthy, on the other hand, it is useful to entrust some books to reliable people who would use them solely with the goal of educating themselves to better defend the Christian religion and faith and to bedevil idolaters and practitioners of necromancy.&lt;ref name="divinança"&gt;{{citation |last=Barrientos |first=Lope de |authorlink=Lope de Barrientos |title=Tratado de la Divinanca ''[''Tract on Divinity'']'' |date=1994 |editor-last=Paloma |editor-first=Cuenca Muñoz |publisher=Council of Cuenca |location=[[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]] |isbn=84-86788-28-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Codices of the peoples conquered by the Aztecs (by Itzcoatl)===
According to the [[Florentine Codex|Madrid Codex]], the fourth [[tlatoani]] [[Itzcoatl]] (ruling from 1427 (or 1428) to 1440) ordered the burning of all historical [[codex|codices]] because it was "not wise that all the people should know the paintings".&lt;ref&gt;[[Florentine Codex|Madrid Codex]], VIII, 192v, as quoted in León-Portilla, p. 155.

===Gemistus Pletho's ''Nómoi'' (by Partiarch Gennadius II)===

After the death of the prominent late Byzantine scholar [[Gemistus Pletho]], there was discovered among his papers a major work called ''[[Gemistus Pletho#Nómoi|Nómon singrafí]]'' (Νόμων συγγραφή) or ''Nómoi'' (Νόμοι "Book of Laws"). He had been compiling it throughout most of his adult life, but never published it. It contained his most esoteric beliefs, including an objection to some of the basic tenets of Christianity and an explicit advocacy of a restoration (in modified form) of the worship of gods of the Classical [[Greek mythology]] – obviously [[heresy|heretical]] as the Orthodox Church understood the term. The manuscript came into the possession of Princess Theodora, wife of [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], [[despot of Morea]]. Theodora sent the manuscript to [[Gennadius II]], Patriarch of Constantinople, asking for his advice on what to do with it; he returned it, advising her to destroy it. Morea was under invasion from Sultan [[Mehmet II]], and Theodora escaped with Demetrios to Constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to Gennadius, reluctant to herself destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar's work. Gennadius finally burnt it in 1460. However, in a letter to the Exarch Joseph (which still survives) Gennadius details the book, providing chapter headings and brief summaries of the contents. Plethon's own summary of the ''Nómoi'', titled ''Summary of the Doctrines of Zoroaster and Plato'', also survived among manuscripts held by his former student Bessarion – though the full detailed text was lost with Gennadius' burning.

==Early Modern Period (from 1492 to 1650)==
===Library and archives of the Novgorod Republic (by Ivan III and Ivan IV)===

In the course of the [[Novgorod Republic]] being conquered and subjugated by the rising power of [[Muscovy]], the Republic's library and archives were destroyed, simultaneously with many of the republic's citizens being massacred and tortured and its wealth being looted. The library's destruction can be variously dated either to Novgorod's conquest by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] in 1478, or to the 1570 [[Massacre of Novgorod]] perpetrated by his grandson [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decameron, Ovid and other "lewd" books (by Savonarola)===
{{Main|Bonfire of the Vanities}}
In 1497, followers of the Italian priest [[Girolamo Savonarola]] collected and publicly burned books and objects which were deemed to be "immoral", some – but by no means all – of which might fit modern criteria of pornography or "lewd pictures", as well as pagan books, gaming tables, cosmetics, copies of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[Decameron]]'', and all the works of [[Ovid]] which could be found in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomtoread.ca/links-and-resources/bannings-and-burnings-in-history/#.WqYoxejwbIU Bannings and Burnings in History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic and Hebrew books (in Andalucía)===
In 1490 a number of Hebrew Bibles and other Jewish books were burned at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition. In 1499 or early 1500 about 5000 Arabic manuscripts, including a school library—all that could be found in the city—were consumed by flames in a public square in [[Granada, Spain]], on the orders of Cardenal [[Ximénez de Cisneros]], Archbishop of Toledo and head of the [[Spanish Inquisition]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Spanish Inquisition'', Henry Kelsea, London, White Lion, 1965, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern Wisdome and Learninge.

===Arabic books and archives in Oran (by Spanish conquerors)===
In 1509 Spanish forces commanded by Count [[Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto|Pedro Navarro]], on the orders of Cardinal [[Cardinal Cisneros|Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]], [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|conquered]] the city of [[Oran]] in North Africa. Thereupon, the occupying forces set fire to the books and archives of the town – a direct continuation of Cardenal Cisneros' book destruction in Granda, a few years before (see above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Urzainqui, Tomas |author2 = Esarte, Pello |author3 = García Manzanal, Alberto |author4 = Sagredo, Iñaki |author5 = Sagredo, Iñaki |author6 = Sagredo, Iñaki |author7 = Del Castillo, Eneko |author8 = Monjo, Emilio |author9 = Ruiz de Pablos, Francisco |author10 = Guerra Viscarret, Pello |author11 = Lartiga, Halip |author12 = Lavin, Josu |author13 = Ercilla, Manuel |year = 2013 |title = La Conquista de Navarra y la Reforma Europea |publisher = Pamiela |location=Pamplona-Iruña|isbn = 978-84-7681-803-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic theological works (by Martin Luther)===
At the instruction of Reformer [[Martin Luther]], a public burning of books was held in the public square outside [[Wittenberg]]'s Elster Gate on December 10, 1520. Together with the Papal Bull of Excommunication ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'', issued against Luther himself, were burned works which Luther considered as symbols of Catholic orthodoxy – including the ''Code of Canon Law'', the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and the ''[[Summa Angelica]]'', [[Blessed Angelo Carletti di Chivasso|Angelo Carletti]]'s work on [[Scotist]] theology.&lt;ref name=Bolognini&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://santiebeati.it/Detailed/90363.html&amp;langpair=it%7Cen&amp;hl=it&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;prev=%2Flanguage_tools Bolognini, Daniele.

===Lutheran and other Protestant writings (in the Habsburg Netherlands)===

On March 1521 Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] published in [[Flanders]] a ban prohibiting the "books, sermons and writings of the said [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and all his followers and adherents" and ordering all such materials to be burnt. This was followed by a stream of local bans throughout the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] and in neighboring states, particularly the ecclesiastical principalities of [[Liege]], [[Utrecht]], [[Cologne]] and [[Munster]]. Implementation was intensive in the southern part of the Habsburg Netherlands (present-day [[Belgium]]). At [[Leuven]] eighty copies of Luther's works were burned in October 1520 (even before publication of the official ban). At [[Antwerp]] no less than 400 Lutheran works – 300 of them confiscated from booksellers – were destroyed in the Emperor's presence in July 1521. In the same month 300 Lutheran works were destroyed at [[Ghent]]. More public book burnings followed in 1522, at [[Bruges]] and twice more at Antwerp. Implementation of the Emperor's ban was less swift in the northern part (present day [[Netherlands]]). In 1522 the authorities at [[Leiden]] ordered confiscation of all Lutheran works in the town, but apparently did not burn them. The first mass book burning in the North was in 1521 in the ecclesiastical territory of [[Utrecht]]. The first mass book burning in [[Amsterdam]] took place later, in 1526. Thereafter, public book burning remained part of life in the Habsburg Netherlands for much of the 16th Century, [[Anabaptist]] and [[Calvinist]] writings later joining the Lutheran ones in the flames. Yet despite this relentless campaign, Protestant writings continued to proliferate. As well as the books being burned, many of the printers and booksellers involved in disseminating them were themselves burned at the stake by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan I. Israel]], "The Dutch Republic", [[Clarendon Press]], Oxford, 1995, Ch. 5, "Early Dutch Reformation P.79-81, quoting Kronenberg, "Veboden boeken", p.31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyndale's New Testament (in England)===
In October 1526 [[William Tyndale]]'s English translation of the ''[[New Testament]]'' was burned in London by [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], Bishop of London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tudorsociety.com/william-tyndale/ William Tyndale]&lt;/ref&gt; Tunstall claimed that Tyndale's version was filled with lies and errors.

===The works of  Galen  and  Avicenna  (by  Paracelsus)===
In 1527, the innovative physician [[Paracelsus]] was licensed to practice in [[Basel]],  with the privilege of lecturing at the [[University of Basel]].  He published harsh criticism of the Basel physicians and apothecaries, creating political turmoil to the point of his life being threatened. He was prone to many outbursts of abusive language, abhorred untested theory, and ridiculed anybody who placed more importance on traditional medical texts than on practice ('The patients are your textbook, the sickbed is your study. If disease put us to the test, all our splendor, title, ring, and name will be as much help as a horse's tail')&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Edward, "The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus", published by James Elliott and Co., London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;. In a display of his contempt for conventional medicine, Paracelsus publicly burned editions of the works of [[Galen]] and [[Avicenna]] - two of the most highly respected traditional medical texts, which established physicians tended to trust without reservations, but which according to Paracelsus contained many serious medical errors.

===English Monastic Libraries (during the Dissolution of the Monasteries)===

During the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in England (1536–1541), many monastic libraries were destroyed. [[Worcester Abbey]] had 600 books at the time of the dissolution. Only six of them have survived intact to the present day. At the abbey of the Augustinian Friars at York, a library of 646 volumes was destroyed, leaving only three surviving books. Some books were destroyed for their precious bindings, others were sold off by the cartload, including irreplaceable early English works. It is believed that many of the earliest [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] manuscripts were lost at this time. The favorites of King [[Henry VIII]] and his minister [[Thomas Cromwell]], into whose hands the former Monasteries passed, had no interest in or appreciation of the value of the old manuscripts, treating them simply as raw material:
:: "A great nombre of them whych purchased those supertycyous mansyons, resrved of those lybrarye bokes, some to serve theyr jakes [i.e., as [[toilet paper]]], some to scoure candelstyckes, and some to rubbe their bootes. Some they solde to the grossers and soapsellers…" – [[John Bale]], 1549

===Servetus's writings (burned with their author at Geneva, and also burned at Vienne)===
In 1553, [[Servetus]] was burned as a heretic at the order of the city council of Geneva, dominated by [[John Calvin|Calvin]] – because a remark in his translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' was considered an intolerable heresy. As he was placed on the stake, "around [Servetus'] waist were tied a large bundle of manuscript and a thick [[octavo]] printed book", his ''[[Christianismi Restitutio]]''. In the same year the Catholic authorities at [[Vienne]] also burned Servetus in effigy together with whatever of his writings fell into their hands, in token of the fact that Catholics and Protestants – mutually hostile in this time – were united in regarding Servetus as a heretic and seeking to extirpate his works. At the time it was considered that they succeeded, but three copies were later found to have survived, from which all later editions were printed.&lt;ref&gt;Hillar, Marian. "Miguel Servet: Obras completas." ''Catholic Historical Review'' 93, no. 2 (April 2007): 401–403. ''Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost'' (accessed March 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Historie of Italie'' (In England)===
''The Historie of Italie'' (1549), a scholarly and in itself not particularly controversial book by [[William Thomas (scholar)|William Thomas]], was in 1554 "suppressed and publicly burnt" by order of Queen [[Mary I of England]] – after its author was executed on charges of treason. Enough copies survived for new editions to be published in 1561 and 1562, after [[Elizabeth I]] came to power.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati56stepuoft ''Dictionary of National Biography'', volume LVI] (1898), scanned volume from [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maya codices (by Spanish Bishop of Yucatan)===
July 12, 1562, Fray [[Diego de Landa]], acting [[Bishop of Yucatán]] – then recently conquered by the Spanish – threw into the fires the books of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Neil: ''Legends of the Plumed Serpent: Biography of a Mexican God'', HarperCollins Canada, 1998 {{ISBN|978-1-891620-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of destroyed books is greatly disputed. De Landa himself admitted to 27, other sources claim "99 times as many"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Translating Maya Hieroglyphs|last=Johnson|first=Scott A. J.|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2013|isbn=9780806143330|location=|pages= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road Encyclopedia|last=Su-Il|first=Jeong|publisher=Seoul Selection|year=2016|isbn=9781624120763|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the later being disputed as an exaggeration motivated by anti-Spanish feeling, the so-called [[Black Legend]]. Only three [[Maya codices]] and a fragment of a fourth survive. Approximately 5,000 Maya [[cult image]]s were also burned at the same time. The burning of books and images alike were part of de Landa's effort to eradicate the Maya "[[idolatry|idol worship]]", which he considered "diabolical". As narrated by de Landa himself, he had gained access to the sacred books, transcribed on deerskin, by previously gaining the natives' trust and showing a considerable interest in their culture and language:&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga. ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517–1570''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roys, Ralph L. Review of ''Landa's Relacion De Las Cosas De Yucatan: A Translation by Alfred M. Tozzer'', by Alred M. Tozzer. ''The American Historical Review'' (October 1943): 133.&lt;/ref&gt; "''We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they [the Maya] lamented to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.''"&lt;ref name="users.ipfw.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, 70&lt;/ref&gt; De Landa was later recalled to Spain and accused of having acted illegally in Yucatán, though eventually found not guilty of these charges. Present-day apologists for de Landa assert that, while he had destroyed the Maya books, his own ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' is a major source for the Mayan language and culture. Allen Wells calls his work an "ethnographic masterpiece",&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Allen. "Forgotten Chapters of Yucatán's Past: Nineteenth-Century Politics in Historiographical Perspective." ''Mexican Studies / Estudios Mexicanos'' (1996): 201.&lt;/ref&gt; while William J. Folan, Laraine A. Fletcher and Ellen R.

"Fruit, Fiber, Bark, and Resin: Social Organization of a Maya Urban Center." ''Science'' (1979): 697.&lt;/ref&gt;"

===Cluny Abbey's library (by Huguenots)===

During the [[French Wars of Religion]], in 1562 [[Huguenot]]s sacked the [[Abbey of Cluny]], destroying or dispersing many of the manuscripts in its library –  one of the richest and most important in France and Europe. The surviving part of the library would be targeted again during the [[French Revolution]].

===Monastic library in Utrecht (by militant Protestants)===

In the 1566 iconoclastic wave known as "[[Beeldenstorm]]" (or ''Bildersturm'' in German ("image/statue storm"), also the ''Great Iconoclasm'' or ''Iconoclastic Fury''), militant Protestants throughout the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]
attacked the Catholic Churches (at the time, the only Churches allowed), tore down and destroyed icons and holy pictures, visible symbols of Catholicism. Books were not particularly targeted, but in some cases they too were caught up in the wave of destruction. For example, in the outbreaks at [[Utrecht]], when great heaps of art treasures and vestments were piled in the streets and put to the torch, the entire library of the [[Friars Minor]] was destroyed as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan I. Israel]], ''The Dutch Republic'', [[Clarendon Press]], Oxford, 1995, Ch. 7, ''Breakdown of the Habsburg Regime'', P.149, quoting Freedberg, ''Art and Iconoclasm'', P.74, Duke, ''Reformation and Revolt'', P.132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic books in Spain (owners ordered to destroy their own books by King Philip II) ===

In 1567, [[Philip II of Spain]] issued a royal decree in Spain forbidding [[Moriscos]] (Muslims who had been converted to Christianity but remained living in distinct communities) from the [[Language death|use of Arabic on all occasions]], formal and informal, speaking and writing. Using Arabic in any sense of the word would be regarded as a crime. They were given three years to learn a "Christian" language, after which they would have to get rid of all Arabic written material. It is unknown how many of the Moriscos complied with the decree and destroyed their own Arabic books and how many kept them in defiance of the King's decree; the decree is known to have triggered one of the largest [[Morisco Revolt]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh]], et al.: ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics'', [[Brill Publishers]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Obscene" Maltese poetry (by the Inquisition)===
In 1584 Pasquale Vassallo, a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], wrote a collection of songs, of the kind known as "canczuni", in Italian and [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The poems fell into the hands of other Dominican friars who denounced him for writing "obscene literature". At the order of the [[Inquisition]] in 1585 the poems were burned for this allegedly 'obscene' content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 |title=Maltese Language Academy on landmarks in the language's development |publisher=Akkademjatalmalti.com |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923054701/http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arwi books (by Portuguese in India and Ceylon)===
With the 16th-century extension of the [[Portuguese Empire]] to India and Ceylon, the staunchly Catholic colonizers were hostile to [[Muslim]]s they found living there. An aspect of this was a Portuguese hostility to and destruction of writings in the [[Arwi]] language, a type of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] with many Arabic words, written in a variety of the Arabic script and used by local Muslims. Much of Arwi cultural heritage was thus destroyed, though the precise extent of the destruction might never be known.

===Bernardino de Sahagún's manuscripts on Aztec culture (by Spanish authorities)===
The 12-volume work known as the [[Florentine Codex]], result of a decades-long meticulous research conducted by the Fransciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] in Mexico, is among the most important sources on [[Aztec]] culture and society as they were before the Spanish conquest, and on the [[Nahuatl]] language. However, upon Sahagún's return to Europe in 1585, his original manuscripts – including the records of conversations and interviews with indigenous sources in [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], and [[Tenochtitlan]], and likely to have included much primary material which did not get into the final codex – were confiscated by the Spanish authorities, disappeared irrevocably, and are assumed to have been destroyed. The Florentine Codex itself was for centuries afterwards only known in heavily censored versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Censorship: A World Encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=Derek|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-57958-135-0|location=New York|pages= 1575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iberlibro.com/servlet/SearchResults?cm_sp=pan-_-srp-_-loc&amp;sortby=1&amp;an=bernardino+sahagun&amp;n=-1|title=Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain|last=Sahagún|first=Bernardino de|date=|website=iberlibro|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books from the Bibliotheca Palatina (by Catholic troops)===

In 1622, during the [[Thirty Years War]], [[Heidelberg]] was sacked by the troops of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] under general [[Count von Tilly|Von Tilly]]. The [[Bibliotheca Palatina]], most important library of the [[German Renaissance]], greatly suffered, many books being torn up by rampaging soldiers or "dispersed among private hands". Fortunately, Von Tilly and his employer, [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]], intervened to confiscate the remaining manuscripts and present them to Pope [[Gregory XV]] – their transfer from Protestant custody to a Catholic one saving them from destruction.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;The ''Classical Journal'' for March and June 1816, page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luther: Lectures on Romans'', ed. by Wilhelm Pauck.

The 1624 book ''An Examination of the Traditions of the Pharisees'', written by the dissident Jewish intellectual [[Uriel da Costa]], was burned in public by joint action of the Amsterdam Jewish Community and the city's Protestant-dominated City Council. The book, which questioned the fundamental idea of the [[immortality#Spiritual|immortality of the soul]], was considered [[heretical]] by the Jewish community, which excommunicated him, and was arrested by the Dutch authorities as a public enemy to religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/costa-uriel-da-1585-1640 Uriel da Costa]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socinian and Anti-Trinitarian books (by secular and church authorities in the Dutch Republic)===

As noted by [[Jonathan Israel]], the [[Dutch Republic]] was more tolerant than other 17th Century states, allowing a wide range of religious groups to practice more or less freely and openly disseminate their views. However, the dominant Calvinist Church drew the line at [[Socinian]] and [[Anti-Trinitarian]] doctrines which were deemed to "undermine the very foundations of Christianity". In the late 1640s and 1650s, Polish and German holders of such views arrived in the Netherlands as refugees from persecution in Poland and Brandenburg. Dutch authorities made an effort to stop them spreading their theological writings, by arrests and fines as well as book-burning. For example, in 1645, the burgomasters at [[Rotterdam]] discovered a stock of a 100 books by [[Cellius]] and destroyed them. In 1659 [[Lancelot van Brederode]] published anonymously 900 copies of a 563-page book assailing the dominant Calvinist Church and the doctrine of the Trinity. The writer's identity was discovered and he was arrested and heavily fined, and the authorities made an effort to hunt down and destroy all copies of the book – but since it had already been distributed, many of the copies survived. The book ''Bescherming der Waerheyt Godts'' by [[Foeke Floris]], a liberal [[Anabaptist]] preacher, was in 1687 banned by authorities in [[Friesland]] which deemed it to be Socinian, and all copies were ordered to be burned. In 1669 the Hof (high court) of Holland ordered the Amsterdam municipal authorities to raid booksellers in the city, seize and destroy Socinian books – especially the ''[[Biblioteca fratrum Polonorum]]'' ("Book of the [[Polish Brethren]]"), at the time known to be widely circulating in Amsterdam. The Amsterdam burgomasters felt obliged to go along with this, at least formally – but in fact some of them mitigated the practical effect by warning booksellers of impending raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan I.

===Earl of Worcester's library (by New Model Army)===
During the [[English Civil War]] in 1646, [[Thomas Fairfax]] ordered the [[New Model Army]] to burn the private library of the [[Earl of Worcester]] in [[Raglan Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textusreceptusbibles.com/Manuscript_Destruction|title=How Many Manuscripts Have Been Destroyed?|last=|first=|date=|website=Textus Receptus Bibles|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book criticising Puritanism (in Boston)===
The first book burning incident in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] occurred in Boston in 1651 when [[William Pynchon]], founder of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], published ''The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption'', which criticised the [[Puritan]]s, who were then in power in [[Massachusetts]]. The book became the first banned book in North America, and subsequently all known copies were publicly burned. Pynchon left for England prior to a scheduled appearance in court, and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, Mark. ''Censorship.'' p. 53: Greenwood Press, 2008. ''eBook Collection (EBSCOhost).'' Web.

===Manuscripts of John Amos Comenius (by anti-Swedish Polish partisans)===
During the [[Northern Wars]] in 1655, the well-known Bohemian Protestant theologian and educator [[John Amos Comenius]], then living in exile at the city of [[Leszno]] in Poland, declared his support for the Protestant Swedish side. In retaliation, Polish partisans burned his house, his manuscripts, and his school's printing press. Notably, the original manuscript of Comenius' ''Pansophiæ Prodromus'' was destroyed in the fire; fortunately, the text had already been printed and thus survived.

===Quaker books (in Boston)===
In 1656 the authorities at Boston imprisoned the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] women preachers [[Ann Austin]] and [[Mary Fisher (missionary)|Mary Fisher]], who had arrived on a ship from [[Barbados]]. Among other things they were charged with "bringing with them and spreading here sundry books, wherein are contained most corrupt, heretical, and blasphemous doctrines contrary to the truth of the [[gospel]] here professed amongst us" as the colonial gazette put it. The books in question, about a hundred, were publicly burned in Boston's Market Square.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/quakers-fight-religious-freedom-puritan-massachusetts-1656-1661 Quakers Fight Religious Freedom Puritan Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pascal's "Lettres provinciales" (by King Louis XIV)===

As part of his intensive campaign against the [[Jansenist]]s, King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1660 ordered the book "[[Lettres provinciales]]" by [[Blaise Pascal]] – which contained a fierce defense of the Jansenist doctrines – to be shredded and burnt. Despite Louis XIV absolute power in France, this decree proved ineffective. "Lettres provinciales" continued to be clandestinely printed and disseminated, eventually outliving the Jansenist controversy which gave it birth and becoming recognized as a masterpiece of French prose.

===Great Fire (London)===
In 1666, during the [[Great Fire of London]], many booksellers moved their books to the stone crypts of [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral]] to escape destruction of their books, but falling masonry broke through into the crypt and let the fire in and all the books were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://talkinghumanities.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2016/08/30/burning-books-the-great-fire-of-london/|title=Burning books: the Great Fire of London|last=Shaw|first=Dr. Matthew|date=30 August 2016|website=Talking Humanities|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim and Jewish books (during capture of Buda by Austrian troops)===

Following the 1686 [[Battle of Buda (1686)|capture]] of the Hungarian capital [[Buda]] by the Austrian-led [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]], the victorious troops rampaged in the city and carried out a large-scale massacre of the resident Muslim population – as well as of the Buda Jews, who were considered allies of the Ottomans. The mosques and [[minaret]]s of Buda were burned and destroyed, as were three synagogues. Numerous valuable books perished in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation, by Jonathan Rose, 2008, p.268-270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swedish National Archives===

===Mythical (and/or mystical) writings of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (by rabbis)===
During the 1720s rabbis in Italy and Germany ordered the burning of the [[kabbalist]] writings of the then young [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. The [[Messianic prophecies|Messianic]] messages which Luzzatto claimed to have gotten from a being called "The Maggid" were considered heretical and potentially highly disruptive of the Jewish communities' daily life, and Luzzatto was ordered to cease disseminating them. Though Luzzatto in later life got considerable renown among Jews and his later books were highly esteemed, most of the early writings were considered irrevocably lost until some of them turned up in 1958 in a manuscript preserved in the [[Bodleian Library|Library of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azamra.org/TempleSecrets/Ramchal.htm|title=Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|last=|first=|date=2007|website=Azamra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rabbiyaakovfeldman.aishdas.org/daattevunot/2015/11/15/daat-tevunot-the-life-of-rabbi-moshe-chaim-luzzatto/|title=Part One: Da’at Tevunot — The Life of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|last=Feldman|first=Rabbi Yaakov|date=15 November 2015|website=Yaakov Feldman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.jewishcurrents.org/tag/moshe-chaim-luzzatto/|title=THE MYSTICAL ETHICIST|last=Bush|first=Lawrence|date=15 May 2017|website=Jewish Currents|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant books and Bibles (by Archbishop of Salzburg)===
In 1731 Count Leopold Anton von Firmian – [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] as well as its temporal ruler – embarked on a savage persecution of the [[Lutheran]]s living in the rural regions of Salzburg. As well expelling tens of thousands of Protestant Salzburgers, the Archbishop ordered the wholesale seizure and burning of all Protestant books and Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=561 Catholics Cleanse Salzburg of Protestants]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays of the John Warburton collection===
[[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]] was an avid collector of old book and manuscripts, but often careless. At one occasion, he left a pile of drama manuscripts in the kitchen. When he came looking for them a year later, nearly all were gone. His cook, Betsy Baker, had used over fifty manuscripts as scrap paper while cooking—either for lighting fires or for lining the bottoms of pie pans while baking pies.&lt;ref name="dnb2"&gt;[[s:Warburton, John (DNB00)|"Warburton, John"]] entry in ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 59''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1733, Venetian playwright [[Carlo Goldoni]] burned his [[tragedy]] ''[[Amalasunta]]'' due to negative reception by his audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gambaccini|first1=Piero|title=Mountebanks and Medicasters: A History of Italian Charlatans from the Middle Ages to the Present|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=North Carolina|isbn=9780786416066|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The writings of Johann Christian Edelmann (by Imperial authorities in Frankfurt)===
In 1750, the Imperial Book Commission of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at [[Frankfurt/Main]] ordered the wholesale burning of the works of Johann Christian Edelmann, a radical disciple of [[Spinoza]] who had outraged the [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] clergies by his [[Deism]], his championing of [[sexual freedom]] and his asserting that Jesus had been a human being and not the Son of God. In addition, Edelmann was also an outspoken opponent of [[royal absolutism]]. With Frankfurt's entire magistracy and municipal government in attendance and seventy guards to hold back the crowds, nearly a thousand copies of Edelmann's writings were tossed on to a tower of flaming birch wood. Edelmann himself was granted refuge in Berlin by [[Friedrich the Great]], but on condition that he stop publishing his views.&lt;ref&gt;Christopehr Clark, ''The Iron Kingdom'' (London, 2006), pp. 254–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books that offended Qianlong Emperor===

China's [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1711–1799) embarked on an ambitious program – the [[Siku Quanshu]], largest compilation of books in [[Chinese history]] (possibly in human history in general). The enterprise included, however, also the systematic banning and burning of books considered "unfitting" to be included – especially those critical, even by subtle hints, of the ruling [[Qing Dynasty]]. During this Emperor's nearly sixty years on the throne, the destruction of about 3000 "evil" titles (books, poems, and plays) was decreed, the number of individual copies confiscated and destroyed is variously estimated at tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. As well as systematically destroying the written works, 53 authors of such works were executed, in some cases by lingering torture or along with their family members (see [[literary inquisition#Qing]], [[Qianlong Emperor#Burning of books and modification of texts]]). A famous earlier Chinese encyclopedia, ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' (Chinese: 天工開物) was included among the works banned and destroyed at this time, and was long considered to be lost forever – but some original copies were discovered, preserved intact, in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;needham volume 4 part 2 172&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s own masterpiece – the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'', produced only in seven hand-written copies – was itself the target of later book burnings: the copies kept in [[Zhenjiang]] and [[Yangzhou]] were destroyed during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], and in 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]] an Anglo-French expedition force burned most of the copy kept at Beijing's Old Summer Palace. The four remaining copies, though suffering some damage during [[World War II]], are still preserved at four Chinese museums and libraries.

===Anti-Wilhelm Tell tract (at Canton of Uri)===
The 1760 tract by Simeon Uriel Freudenberger from [[Luzern]], arguing that [[Wilhelm Tell]] was a myth and the acts attributed to him had not happened in reality, was publicly burnt in [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]], capital of the [[Swiss canton]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] – where, according to the legend, [[William Tell]] shot the apple from his son's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/in-search-of-william-tell-2198511/|title=In Search of William Tell|last=Wernick|first=Robert|date=August 2004|website=Smithsonian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books of Voltaire (by French authorities)===
[[Voltaire]], the pen name of François-Marie Arouet, was a writer whose works were burnt several times in pre-[[French Revolution|revolutionary]] France. In his ''Lettres philosophique'', published in [[Rouen]] in 1734, he described British attitudes toward government, literature, and religion, and clearly implied that the British constitutional monarchy was better than the French absolute one – which led to the book being burned.

Later, Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', which was originally called the ''Dictionnaire philosophique portatif'', had its first volume, consisting of 73 articles in 344 pages, burnt upon release in June 1764.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurois|first=André|title=The Sage of Ferney: An Appreciation (extracted from Voltaire, reprinted in Candide)|origyear=1932|year=1959|publisher=D.

An "economic [[pamphlet]]", ''Man With Forty Crowns'', was ordered to be burnt by [[French Parliament|Parliament]], and a bookseller who had sold a copy was [[pilloried]].

===Vernacular Catholic hymn books (at Mainz)===
In 1787, an attempt by the Catholic authorities at [[Mainz]] to introduce [[vernacular]] hymn books encountered strong resistance from conservative Catholics, who refused to abandon the old Latin books and who seized and burned copies of the new German language books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Blanning]], ''[[The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815]]'', Penguin, 2007, p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cluny Abbey's library (in the French Revolution)===

In 1790 and 1793 much of [[Cluny Abbey]]'s library – earlier targeted in 1562 by [[Huguenot]]s – was burnt during [[French Revolution]]ary violence.

===The Libro d'Oro (in the French-ruled Ionian Islands)===
With the [[Treaty of Leoben]] and the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] in 1797, the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] gained the [[Ionian Islands]], hitherto ruled by the [[Venetian Republic]]. France proceeded to annex the islands, organize them as the [[Département in France|départements]] of [[Mer-Égée]], [[Ithaque]] and [[Corcyre]], and introduce there the principles and institutions of the [[French Revolution]] – initially getting great enthusiasm among the islands' inhabitants. The abolition of aristocratic privileges was accompanied by the public burning of the ''[[Libro d'Oro]]'' – formal directory of nobles in the [[Republic of Venice]] which included those of the Ionian Islands.

===Egyptian archaeological finds (threatened burning by French scholars)===
Many French scholars accompanied [[Napoleon's invasion of Egypt]] in 1799, where they made many important finds. When forced to surrender to the British in 1801, the scholars initially strongly resisted the claim made by the British to have the collections of the expedition handed over. [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] ominously threatened that, were that British demand persisted in, history would record "a second burning of a library in [[Alexandria]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Things: A History of Egyptology: 1: From Antiquity to 1881|last=Thompson|first=Jason|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|year=2015|isbn=978-977-416-599-3|location=|pages= 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egyptologyforum.org/bbs/Rosetta.htm|title=Bicentenary of the discovery of the Rosetta Stone|last=Tilgner|first=Michael|date=|website=THE EGYPTOLOGISTS' ELECTRONIC FORUM|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat was, however, not carried out, and the finds were finally handed over and ended up in the [[British Museum]].

==="The Burned Book" (by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov)===
In 1808, [[Rabbi]] [[Nachman of Breslov]] burned the only copy or copies of one of his own books for an unknown reason.

===Musin-Pushkin's library (In Great Moscow Fire)===
The vast destruction caused by the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|great Moscow fire]] of 1812 (during the [[Napoleon]]ic occupation) included destruction of the entire library of Count [[Aleksei Musin-Pushkin]] – statesman, historian and art collector. Among the irreplaceable old books destroyed was the only known manuscript of the Medieval ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''. Fortunately, Musin-Pushkin had already published the text; still, historians mourn the lost original.

===Records of the Goa Inquisition (by Portuguese colonial authorities)===
In 1812 the [[Goa Inquisition]] was suppressed, after hundreds of years in which it had been enacting various kinds of religious persecution in the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], India. In the aftermath, most of the Goa Inquisition's records were destroyed – a great loss to historians, making it is impossible to know the exact number of the Inquisition's victims.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, H. P 2001 pp. 345–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original Library of Congress Collection (by British troops)===
On August 24, 1814,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021122145323/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm001.html]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Burning of Washington]], British and Canadian troops set fire to the Capitol building, thereby destroying some 3,000 volumes in the initial collection of the [[Library of Congress]] which was established fourteen years earlier. Most of these books had been ordered from London before the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]]. Immediately following the British withdrawal, former President [[Thomas Jefferson]] sold to the US Government his entire private library, 6700 volumes, to replace the loss – from which the Library of Congress went on to expand to its enormous present size though a fire in 1851 destroyed around two-thirds of Jefferson's collection. The material destroyed in 1814 is the modern digital storage equivalent of 3.42 gigabytes and could easily be hosted on one single present-day smartphone, tablet, or SD card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.globaldatavault.com/blog/information-destruction-history/ |title=Information Destruction Through History &amp;#124; Data Protection |website=Globaldatavault.com |date=January 14, 2014 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Code Napoléon (by German Nationalist students)===
On October 18, 1817 about 450 students, members of the newly founded German [[Burschenschaft]]en ("fraternities"), [[Wartburg festival|came together at Wartburg Castle to celebrate]] the German victory over Napoleon two years before, condemn conservatism and call for German unity. The [[Code Napoléon]] as well as the writings of German conservatives were ceremoniously burned 'in effigy': instead of the costly volumes, scraps of parchment with the titles of the books were placed on the bonfire. Among these was [[August von Kotzebue]]'s ''History of the German Empires''. [[Karl Ludwig Sand]], one of the students participating in this gathering, would assassinate Kotzebue two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dumas|first1=Alexandre|title=Celebrated Crimes|date=1843|publisher=Chapman and Hall|page=324|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Blake manuscripts (by Frederick Tatham)===

The poet [[William Blake]] died in 1827, and his manuscripts were left with his wife [[Catherine Blake| Catherine]]. After her death in 1831, the manuscripts were inherited by [[Frederick Tatham]], who burned some that he deemed heretical or politically radical. Tatham was an [[Edward Irving|Irvingite]], one of the many fundamentalist movements of the 19th century, and opposed to any work that smacked of "blasphemy".&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Blake was nearly forgotten, and Tatham could act with impunity. When Blake was re-discovered some decades later and recognized as a major English poet, the damage was already done.

===Early braille books (in Paris)===
In 1842, officials at the school for the blind in Paris, France, were ordered by its new director, [[Armand Dufau]], to burn books written in the new [[braille]] code. After every braille book at the institute that could be found was burned, supporters of the code's inventor, [[Louis Braille]], rebelled against Dufau by continuing to use the code, and braille was eventually restored at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/LouisBrailleMuseum/braillegallery.asp?GalleryID=49 |title=Changing of the Guard – Recognition of the Braille Code |website=Afb.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 1844, the Irish [[St. Augustine Church, Philadelphia]] was burned down by anti-Irish [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist]] rioters (see Philadelphia Nativist riots). The fire also destroyed the nearby St. Augustine Academy, with many of the rare books in its library – though in this case the arsonists did not specifically target the books, but rather sought to destroy indiscriminately everything belonging to Irish Catholic immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.library.villanova.edu/chaos-in-the-streets-the-philadelphia-riots-of-1844/churches/ Destruction of Catholic Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese literary works (By Anglo-French troops in Beijing)===
In 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]], twenty captive Westerners were tortured and killed by the Chinese government. In retaliation, the British High Commissioner to China, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], ordered the destruction of The [[Old Summer Palace]] in Beijing, which was then carried out by French and British troops. The palace complex had been built up by succeeding Chinese dynasties for nearly a thousand years, and many unique works of art were destroyed or looted by the soldiers. Also unique copies of Chinese literary work and compilations, stored there, were burned down as part of the general destruction.

==="The Bonnie Blue Flag" (by Union General Benjamin Butler)===
During the [[American Civil War]], when Union Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] captured [[New Orleans]] he ordered the destruction of all copies of the music for the popular Confederate song "[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]", as well as imposing a $500 fine on A. E. Blackmar who published this music.

===Libraries in Confederate cities (during Sherman's March to the Sea)===

During the [[American Civil War]] Union campaign known as [[Sherman's March to the Sea]], whole Confederate cities such as [[Atlanta]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Columbia]] were burned down. Though books were not specifically targeted, the conflagration destroyed various private and public libraries. For example, the wartime diaries of Columbia resident Emma LeConte include the following reference: "The library building opposite us seemed framed by the gushing flames and smoke, while through the windows gleamed the liquid fire".&lt;ref&gt;Earl Schnek Miers (ed.)

Following its publication in 1869, the book on the Ancient Cypriots by [[Greek Cypriot]] priest and scholar Ieronymos Myriantheus was banned by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and 460 copies of it were burned. In a punitive measure towards Myriantheus the Ottomans refused to recognize him as Bishop of [[Kyrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/80|title=Περί των αρχαίων Κυπρίων|website=Cyprus Digital Library|date= |accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library of Strasbourg (in German bombardment)===
In the [[Siege of Strasbourg]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Strasbourg was heavily and indiscriminately bombarded by the [[Prussian Army]], aiming to break the inhabitants' morale.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jacob, Histoire-Géographie – Alsachroniques – Strasbourg bombardé, in Lycée Marcel Rudloff, Strasbourg 2013, quoting "Illustrierte Geschichte des Krieges 1870/71, Stuttgart, Berlin, Leipzig";Raymond BONGRAND, 1870, Alsace, Metz-Sedan, Strasbourg, 1970.

Many of the destroyed books and artifacts formed part of the German historical and cultural heritage, dating to periods long before Strasbourg became a French city.

===Library of the Louvre (during suppression of the Paris Commune)===

On May 23, 1871, during the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]], 12 men under the orders of a ''Communard'', Dardelle, set various public buildings in Paris on fire. The library and other portions of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] were also set on fire and entirely destroyed. The museum itself was only miraculously saved.

==="Lewd" books (by Anthony Comstock and the NYSSV)===
[[Anthony Comstock]] founded the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]](NYSSV) in 1873 and over the years burned 15 tons of books, 284,000 pounds of plate, and almost 4 million pictures. The NYSSV was financed by wealthy and influential New York philanthropists. Lobbying the [[United States Congress]] also led to the enactment of the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/5508/Comstock-Law-1873.html Comstock Law of 1873]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedigrees and books of Muslim law and theology (By the Mahdi in Sudan)===

After establishing his rule over [[Mahdist Sudan|Sudan]] in 1885, [[Muhammad Ahmad]], known as the Mahdi, authorized the burning of lists of pedigrees – which is his view accentuated tribalism at the expense of religious unity – as well as books of Muslim law and theology because of their association with the old order which the Mahdi had overthrown.

===Emily Dickinson's correspondence (on her orders)===
Following the death of noted American poet [[Emily Dickinson]] in 1890, her sister Lavinia Dickinson burned almost all of her correspondences in keeping with Emily's wishes, but as it was unclear whether the forty notebooks and loose sheets all filled with almost 1800 poems were to be included in this, Lavinia saved these and began to publish the poems that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habegger|first=Alfred|title=My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson|year=2001|page=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farr (ed.)|first=Judith|title=Emily Dickinson: A Collection of Critical Essays|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall International Paperback Editions|isbn=978-0-13-033524-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ivan Bloch's research on Russian Jews (by Tsarist Russian government)===
In 1901 the [[Russian Council of Ministers]] banned a five-volume work on the socio-economic conditions of [[Russian Jew|Jews in the Russian Empire]], the result of a decade-long comprehensive statistical research commissioned by [[Iwan Bloch|Ivan Bloch]]. (It was entitled "Comparison of the material and moral levels in the Western Great-Russian and Polish Regions"). The research's conclusions – that Jewish economic activity was beneficial to the Empire – refuted antisemitic demagoguery and were disliked by the government, which ordered all copies to be seized and burned. Only a few survived, circulating as great rarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World War I: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection [5 volumes]: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2016|isbn=978-1-85109-964-1|location=|pages= 268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian Nationalist literature (by Austrian authorities in Trieste)===

In the tense period following the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–09, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] authorities in [[Trieste]] cracked down on the [[Italian irredentism|Italian Irredentists]] in the city, who were seeking to end Austrian rule there and annex Trieste to Italy (which would actually happen ten years later, at the end of [[World War I]]). A very large quantity of Italian-language books and periodicals whose contents were deemed "subversive" were confiscated and consigned to destruction. The authorities had the condemned material meticulously weighted, it was found to measure no less than 4.7 metric tons. Thereupon, on February 13, 1909, the books and periodicals were officially burned at the Servola blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;The Trieste book burnings are referenced in John Gatt-Rutter's comprehensive autobiographical work, ''Italo Svevo, A Double Life'' ([[Clarendon Press]], Oxford, 1988, Ch. 47, p.242). The site of the book burnings was very near the home of the writer [[Italo Svevo]], though Svevo's own works were spared. Servola is a suburb of Trieste.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early edition of ''Dubliners'' (by publisher)===

[[James Joyce]] had to go through considerable trouble before seeing his early book of short stories, ''[[Dubliners]]'', in print. Various publishers objected to sexually-explicit passages in the stories – in particular in ''[[Two Gallants (short story)|Two Gallants]]'' – which might have led to prosecution under British law as it then stood. In 1909 Joyce thought his trouble was over when Maunsel &amp; Roberts of Dublin consented to publish it and went as far as setting the book and printing sheets – at which stage the publisher suddenly got cold feet and refused to go through with publishing. Joyce offered to pay the printing costs himself if the sheets were turned over to him and he was allowed to complete the job elsewhere and distribute the book, but when Joyce arrived at the printers they refused to surrender the sheets. They burned them the next day. Joyce managed to save one copy, which he obtained "by ruse". These [[page proofs]] saved from Maunsel were used as [[copy (written)|copy]] when five years later Joyce found the publisher ready to publish the book.&lt;ref&gt;Jeri Johnson, "Composition and Publication History", in James Joyce, ''Dubliners'' (Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and interbellum era==
===Leuven University Library (by World War I German Army)===
On August 25, 1914, in the early stage of the First World War, the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|university library]] of [[Leuven]], Belgium was destroyed by the German army, using petrol and incendiary pastilles, as part of brutal retaliations for the extensive activity of "[[francs-tireurs]]" against the occupying German forces. Among the 300,000 books destroyed were many irreplaceable books, including [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Dynamic of Destruction, Culture and mass killing in the first world war |last= Kramer|first= Alan |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |isbn= 978-1-84614-013-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Gibson  |first= Craig |title= The culture of destruction in the First World War |journal=Times Literary Supplement |issue= January 30, 2008 |id= |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article3277792.ece |accessdate= 2008-02-18  |quote=  |location=London | date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this destruction aroused shock and dismay around the world.

One of the notable losses was that of [[Rongorongo text E]], which was one of only two dozen surviving examples of the as yet undeciphered [[rongorongo]] script of [[Easter Island]]. Rubbings and possibly 3-dimensional replicas were preserved in libraries and collections elsewhere.

===Books in Serbian (by World War I Bulgarian Army)===
In the aftermath of the Serbia defeat in the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I]], the region of [[Old Serbia]] came under the control of Bulgarian occupational authorities. Bulgaria engaged in a campaign of [[cultural genocide]]. Serbian priests, professors, teachers and public officials, were deported into prison camps in pre–war Bulgaria or executed, they were later replaced by their Bulgarian counterparts. The use of the Serbian language was banned. Books in Serbian were confiscated from libraries, schools and private collections to be burned publicly. Books deemed to be of particular value were selected by Bulgarian ethnographers and sent back into Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Pissari |first=Milovan |date=2013 |title=Bulgarian Crimes against Civilians in Occupied Serbia during the First World War|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2013/0350-76531344357P.pdf|journal=Balcanica |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies  |issue=44 |pages=373–380 |doi=10.2298/BALC1344357P |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Valley of the Squinting Windows'' (at Delvin, Ireland)===
In 1918 the ''[[Valley of the Squinting Windows]]'', by [[Brinsley MacNamara]], was burned in [[Delvin]], Ireland. MacNamara never returned to the area, his father James MacNamara was [[boycott]]ed and subsequently emigrated, and a court case was even sought. The book criticised the village's inhabitants for being overly concerned with their image towards neighbours, and although it called the town "Garradrimna," geographical details made it clear that Delvin was meant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-valley-of-the-squinting-windows-and-the-various-lives-of-marcus-igoe-by-brinsley-macnamara-anvil-books-6-95-each-in-uk-1.104550 The Valley of the Squinting Windows and The Various Lives of Marcus Igoe, by Brinsley MacNamara]&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Grosz's cartoons (By court order in Weimar Germany)===

In June 1920 the left-wing German cartoonist [[George Grosz]] produced a lithographic collection in three editions entitled ''[[Gott mit uns]]''. A satire on German society and the counterrevolution, the collection was swiftly banned. Grosz was charged with insulting the [[Reichswehr|army]], which resulted in a court order to have the collection destroyed. The artist also had to pay a 300 [[Deutsche Mark|German Mark]] fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQzdp1zN--oC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Gott+mit+uns&amp;lr=#PPA29,M1 |last=Crockett |first=Dennis |title=German Post-Expressionism: The Art of the Great Disorder, 1918–1924 |pages=28–29 |publisher=Penn State University Press |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-271-01796-9 |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish National Archives (in Civil War)===
At the culmination of the April 1922 fighting in and around the [[Four Courts]] in Dublin, as the Republican forces hitherto barricaded in the building were surrendering, the west wing was obliterated in a huge explosion, destroying the Irish [[National Archives of Ireland|Public Record Office]] located at the rear, with nearly one thousand years of irreplaceable archives being destroyed. Responsibility for the incident has never been established. Blame has been placed on either the national army which was shelling anti-Treaty forces or anti-Treaty forces who were believed to have purposely blown up the records in an act of defiance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/census-records-thought-lost-in-civil-war-explosion-put-online-1.1776778 Census Records Thought Lost in Civil War Explosion Put Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Irish Civil War]] in 1923, the IRA [[Irish Civil War#Attacks on former Loyalists|targeted]] various country houses – among them Kilteragh in [[Foxrock]], County Dublin, home of Sir [[Horace Plunkett]], hated by Irish Nationalists for his support of Ireland remaining part of the British Commonwealth. He himself was abroad at the time, but the fire took with it many of the records of the Plunkett family, which had played a significant part in Irish history for several generations, and which Sir Horace had gathered to prepare a work on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid Ferriter|Ferriter, Diarmaid:]]''The Transformation of IRELAND 1900–2000'' p.210, Profile Books (2004)({{ISBN|1 86197 443-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Sanger's ''Family Limitation'' (by British court order)===

In 1923 the anarchist [[Guy Aldred]] and his partner and co-worker [[Rose Witcop]], a [[birth control]] activist, published together a British edition of [[Margaret Sanger]]'s ''Family Limitation'' – a key pioneering work on the subject. They were denounced by a London magistrate for this "indiscriminate" publication.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', January 11, 1923, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The two lodged an appeal, strongly supported in their legal struggle by [[Dora Russell]] – who, with her husband [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]], paid the legal costs.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Dora, (1975) ''The Tamarisk Tree''&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was to no avail. Despite expert testimony from a consultant to [[Guy's Hospital]] and evidence at the appeal that the book had only been sold to those aged over twenty-one, the court ordered the entire stock to be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Times19230210"&gt;''The Times'', February 12, 1923, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish, anti-Nazi and "degenerate" books (by the Nazis)===
{{Main|Nazi book burnings}}
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|In 1933, Nazis burned works of Jewish authors, and other works considered "un-German", at the library of the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in Berlin.]]

The works of some Jewish authors and other so-called "degenerate" books were burnt by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in the 1930s and 1940s. [[Richard Euringer]], director of the libraries in [[Essen]], identified 18,000 works deemed not to correspond with Nazi ideology, which were publicly burned.

On May 10, 1933 on the [[Bebelplatz|Opernplatz]] in Berlin, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and Nazi youth groups burned around 25,000 books from the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] and the [[Humboldt University]], including works by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Vicki Baum]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Erich Maria Remarque]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[H.G. Wells]]. Student groups throughout Germany in 34 towns also carried out their own book burnings on that day and in the following weeks. [[Erich Kästner]] wrote an ironic account (published only after the fall of Nazism) of having witnessed the burning of his own books on that occasion. Radio broadcasts of the burnings were played in Berlin and elsewhere, and 40,000 turned up to hear [[Joseph Goebbels]] make a speech about the acts.

===Works of Goethe, Shaw, and Freud (by Metaxas dictatorship in Greece)===

[[Ioannis Metaxas]], who held dictatorial power in [[Greece]] between 1936 and 1941, conducted an intensive campaign against what he considered ''Anti-Greek literature'' and viewed as ''dangerous to the national interest''. Targeted under this definition and put to the fire were not only the writings of dissident Greek writers, but even works by such authors as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&lt;ref name="petrakis37"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Petrakis|first=Marina|title=The Metaxas myth: dictatorship and propaganda in Greece|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|page=37|isbn=1-84511-037-4|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works in the British Museum (by German bomber planes)===
In September 1940 during [[the Blitz]] in London, a plane commanded by [[Nazi Germany]] dropped a bomb on the [[British Museum]]. It is not believed that it was intended to hit the Museum in particular, but 124 volumes were destroyed and 304 other volumes were damaged past repair.

From May 10–11, 1941, the Museum's book collections (now the [[British Library]]) were bombed again, this time burning more than 150,000 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caygill|first=Marjorie and Christopher Date|title=Building the British Museum|year=1999|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishers and booksellers in Paternoster Row, London (by German bomber planes)===

On night of 29–30 December 1940, the German Air Force conducted one of the most destructive air raids of [[the Blitz]].

===Jean Genet's ''Our Lady of the Flowers'' (by French prison guard)===

In 1943 [[Jean Genet]] – then an obscure petty criminal – underwent one of the many prison terms in his life. The prison authorities provided to prisoners sheets of rough brown paper, from which they were supposed to make bags. Instead, Genet used the paper to write a largely autobiographical book which would eventually be named ''[[Notre Dame des Fleurs]]'' (''[[Our Lady of the Flowers]]''). As later recounted by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his forward to the book, a prison guard discovered that the prisoner Genet had been making this "unauthorized" use of the paper, confiscated the manuscript and burned it. Undaunted, Genet wrote it all over again. The second version survived and Genet took it with him when leaving the prison.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre Forward to the 1951 Gallimard edition of ''Notre Dame des Fleurs'', here quoted from the 1964 Bantam English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this book which eventually established Genet's literary credentials and enabled him to leave the world of crime and become an internationally known author.

===Jewish books in Alessandria (by pro-Nazi mob)===

On December 13, 1943 in [[Alessandria]], Italy, a mob of supporters of the German-imposed [[Italian Social Republic]] attacked the synagogue of the city's small Jewish community, on Via Milano. Books and manuscripts were taken out of the synagogue and set on fire at Piazza Rattazzi. The burning of the Jewish books was a prelude to a mass arrest and deportation of the Jews themselves, most of whom perished in [[Auschwitz]].

===André Malraux's manuscript (by the Gestapo)===
During [[World War II]] the French writer and anti-Nazi resistance fighter [[André Malraux]] worked on a long novel, ''The Struggle Against the Angel'', the manuscript of which was destroyed by the Gestapo upon his capture in 1944. The name was apparently inspired by the [[Jacob]] story in the Bible. A surviving opening part named ''The Walnut Trees of Altenburg'', was published after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacoue-Labarth|first1=Philippe|title=Ending and Unending Agony: On Maurice Blanchot|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780823264599|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Various libraries in Warsaw, Poland (during World War II)===

Much of [[Warsaw]], Poland was destroyed during World War II by the [[Nazi]]s: an approximated 85% of buildings, including 16,000,000 volumes. 10% of the buildings were destroyed in the [[Invasion of Poland]] that ignited the war in 1939, 15% in the reorganization of Warsaw and the first [[Warsaw Ghetto uprising]], 25% in the second and far more famous Uprising, and the last 35% due to systematic German actions after the Uprising was defeated. 14 libraries, not including the libraries in the [[University of Warsaw]] and the [[Warsaw Institute of Technology]] that were also razed, were completely burned to the ground. German ''Verbrennungskommandos'' (Burning detachments) were responsible for much of the [[Planned destruction of Warsaw#Burning of libraries|targeted attacks on libraries]] and other centers of knowledge and learning.

In October 1944, the [[National Library of Poland]]'s manuscript collection was burned to erase [[History of Poland|Polish national history]].

Part of the [[Krasiński Library]]'s building was destroyed in September 1939, leading to its collections, which had almost all survived, being moved in 1941. In September 1944, an original collection of 250,000 items was shelled by German artillery, although many books were saved by being thrown out the windows by library staff. In October, what had survived was deliberately burned by the authorities, including 26,000 manuscripts, 2,500 [[incunable]]s (printed before 1501), 80,000 early printed books, 100,000 drawings and printmakings, 50,000 note and theatre manuscripts, and many maps and atlases.

The [[Załuski Library]] – established in 1747 and thus the oldest [[public library]] in Poland and one of the oldest and most important libraries in Europe – was burned down during the Uprising in October 1944. Out of about 400,000 printed items, maps and [[manuscript]]s, only some 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials survived. Unlike earlier Nazi book burnings where specific books were deliberately targeted, the burning of this library was part of the general setting on fire of a large part of the city of Warsaw.

The extensive library of the [[Polish Museum, Rapperswil]], founded in 1870 in [[Rapperswil]], Switzerland, had been created when Poland was not a country and was thus moved to Warsaw in 1927. In September 1939, the National Polish Museum in Rapperswil along with the Polish School at Batignolles, lost almost their entire collection during the German bombardment of Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stam|first1=David|title=International Dictionary of Library Histories|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136777844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Douai Municipal Library===

on August 11, 1944, the [[Bibliothèque municipale de Douai]], France, was burned in an Allied bombing of the city following the [[Normandy landings]]. The library had been founded by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1767 and included many rare and valuable books.

===The books of Knut Hamsun (in post-World War II Norway)===

Following the liberation of Norway from Nazi occupation in 1945, angry crowds burned the books of [[Knut Hamsun]] in public in major Norwegian cities, due to Hamsun's having collaborated with the Nazis.

===Post-World War II Germany===
{{Main|Denazification}}
On May 13, 1946 the [[Allied Control Council]] issued a directive for the confiscation of all media that could supposedly contribute to Nazism or [[militarism]]. As a consequence a list was drawn up of over 30,000 titles, ranging from school textbooks to poetry, which were then banned. All copies of books on the list were to be confiscated and destroyed; the possession of a book on the list was made a punishable offence. All the millions of copies of these books were to be confiscated and destroyed. The representative of the Military Directorate admitted that the order was no different in intent or execution from [[Nazi book burnings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776847,00.html |title=GERMANY: Read No Evil |website=TIME.com |date=May 27, 1946 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; All confiscated literature was reduced to pulp instead of burning. In August 1946 the order was amended so that "In the interest of research and scholarship, the Zone Commanders (in Berlin the Komendantura) may preserve a limited number of documents prohibited in paragraph 1. These documents will be kept in special accommodation where they may be used by German scholars and other German persons who have received permission to do so from the Allies only under strict supervision by the Allied Control Authority.

In 1953 United States Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] recited before his subcommittee and the press a list of supposedly pro-communist authors whose works his aide [[Roy Cohn]] found in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] libraries in Europe. The Eisenhower State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves "material by any controversial persons, Communists, [[fellow traveler]]s, etc." Some libraries burned the newly forbidden books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/espionage/Lo-Mo/McCarthyism.html|title=McCarthyism|last=PATTERSON HYDER|first=JOSEPH|date=|website=faqs.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Dwight D.

===Memoirs of Yrjö Leino (By Finnish government, under Soviet pressure)===

[[Yrjö Leino]], a [[Communist]] activist, was [[Finland]]'s Minister of the Interior in the crucial 1945–1948 period. In 1948 he suddenly resigned for reasons which remain unclear and went into retirement. Leino returned to the public eye in 1958 with his memoirs of his time as Minister of the Interior. The manuscript was prepared in secret – even most of the staff of the publishing company [[Tammi (publishing company)|Tammi]] were kept in ignorance – but the project was revealed by Leino because of an indiscretion just before the planned publication. It turned out the [[Soviet Union]] was very strongly opposed to publication of the memoirs. The Soviet Union's [[Chargé d'affaires]] in Finland Ivan Filippov (Ambassador Viktor Lebedev had suddenly departed from Finland a few weeks earlier on October 21, 1958) demanded that Prime Minister [[Karl-August Fagerholm]]'s government prevent the release of Leino's memoirs. Fagerholm said that the government could legally do nothing, because the work had not yet been released nor was there censorship in Finland. Filippov advised that if Leino's book was published, the Soviet Union would draw "serious conclusions". Later the same day Fagerholm called the publisher, Untamo Utrio, and it was decided that the January launch of the book was to be cancelled. Eventually, the entire print run of the book was destroyed at the Soviet Union's request. Almost all of the books – some 12,500 copies – were burned in August 1962 with the exception of a few volumes which were furtively sent to political activists. Deputy director of Tammi Jarl Hellemann later argued that the fuss about the book was completely disproportionate to its substance, describing the incident as the first instance of Finnish self-censorship motivated by concerns about relations to the Soviet Union (see [[Finlandization]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hellemann, Jarl: ''Kustantajan näkökulma – kirjoituksia kirjallisuuden reunalta'', s. 56–60. Otava 1999, Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was finally published in 1991, when interest in it had largely dissipated.

===Wilhelm Reich's publications (by U.S. Food and Drug Administration)===
{{Main|Wilhelm Reich}}
Noted [[psychiatrist]] Wilhelm Reich was prosecuted in 1954, following an investigation by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in connection with his use of [[orgone]] accumulators. Reich refused to defend himself, and a federal judge ordered all of his orgone energy equipment and publications to be seized and destroyed. In June 1956, federal agents burned many of the books at Reich's estate near [[Rangeley, Maine]]. Later that year, and in March 1960, an additional 6&amp;nbsp;tons of Reich's books, journals and papers were burned in a public [[incinerator]] in New York.&lt;ref name="IDP"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/reich-wilhelm Reich, Wilhelm (1897–1957)], ''International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''&lt;/ref&gt; Reich died of heart failure while in federal prison in November 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/06_06_update.html#50 The Wilhelm Reich Museum: The burning of Reich's Publications]({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721073150/http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/06_06_update.html |date=July 21, 2011 |title=http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/06_06_update.html#50 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Algiers library (by OAS) ===

On June 7, 1962 the [[Organisation Armée Secrète]] (OAS), the movement of [[Pied-Noir|French colonists]] opposing Algerian independence, set fire to the [[University of Algiers]] library building, destroying about 500,000 books.&lt;ref&gt;n incendie criminel ravage l'universite, plusieurs autres batiments publics sont de ́truit', LeMonde(June 9, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; The burning of the library was considered either part of a desperate last-ditch effort to prevent Algerian independence – which was to be finally clinched a month later in the [[Algerian independence referendum, 1962|Algerian independence referendum]] – or as a savage [[scorched earth]] tactic intended to deny cultural resources to the future independent Algeria. The burning of the university library sent shock waves, especially across the Arab world. The effect on other countries in the region can be seen through commemorative stamps. Egypt, Iraq, Jordan (and Algeria itself, after independence) introduced stamps depicting either the burning of a book, or of the library itself.&lt;ref&gt;Fleury, Georges.

===Religious, Anti-Communist and Genealogy books (in the Cultural Revolution)===
It is the [[Chinese tradition]] to record family members in a book, including every male born in the family, who they are married to, etc. Traditionally, only males' names are recorded in the books. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), many such books were forcibly destroyed or burned to ashes, because they were considered by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] as among the [[Four olds|Four Old Things]] to be eschewed.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Chihua. Madsen, Richard P. [1995] (1995). ''The Red Mirror: Children of China's Cultural Revolution''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-2488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also many copies of classical works of Chinese literature were destroyed, though – unlike the genealogy books – these usually existed in many copies, some of which survived. Many copies of the [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]] and [[Confucian]] books were destroyed, thought to be promoting the "old" thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iws.punahou.edu/user/cshigemitsu/worldlit/dialogues/2/ChineseCulturalRevolution.htm|title=Chinese Cultural Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=punahou.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Communist Party|last=Sullivan|first=Lawrence R.|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2012|isbn=9780810872257|location=|pages= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the British publishing house [[Penguin Books]] was torn by an intense power struggle, with chief editor [[Tony Godwin]] and the board of directors attempting to remove the company founder [[Allen Lane]]. One of the acts taken by Lane in an effort to retain his position was to steal and burn the entire print run of the English edition of ''Massacre'' by the French cartoonist [[Siné]], whose content was reportedly "deeply offensive".&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by Lane biographer Jeremy Lewis on BBC Radio in 2010, http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b00tjrgz&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatles Burnings – Southern USA, 1966===

[[John Lennon]], member of the popular music group [[The Beatles]], sparked outrage from religious conservatives in the Southern 'Bible Belt' states when his quote '[[More popular than Jesus|The Beatles are more popular than Jesus]]' was taken out of context from an interview he had done in England five months previous to the Beatles' 1966 US Tour (their final tour as a group). Disc Jockeys, evangelists, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] implored the local public to bring their Beatles records, books, magazines, posters and memorabilia to Beatles bonfire burning events.

===The Nasir-i Khusraw Foundation in Kabul (by the Taliban regime)===
In 1987, the [[Nasir-i Khusraw]] Foundation was established in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan due to the collaborative efforts of several civil society and academic institutions, leading scholars and members of the [[Ismaili]] community. This site included video and book publishing facilities, a museum, and a library.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; The library was a marvel in its extensive collection of fifty-five thousand books, available to all students and researchers, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Pashto. In addition, its Persian collection was unparalleled – including an extremely rare 12th-century manuscript of [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi]]'s epic masterpiece ''The Book of Kings ([[Shāhnāma]])''. The Ismaili collection of the library housed works from [[Hasan-i Sabbah]] and [[Nasir-i Khusraw]], and the seals of the first [[Aga Khan]]. With the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan in the late 1980s and the strengthening of the [[Taliban]] forces, the library collection was relocated to the valley of [[Kayan Baghlan|Kayan]]. However, on August 12, 1998, the Taliban fighters ransacked the press, the museum, the video facilities and the library, destroying some books in the fire and throwing others in a nearby river.

===''The Hindus: An Alternative History'' (under court order in India)===

''[[The Hindus: An Alternative History]]'' by American [[Indologist]] [[Wendy Doniger]] was originally highly successful in India. According to the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', ''The Hindus'' was a No. 1 bestseller in its non-fiction category in the week of October 15, 2009. However, the author's proclaimed aim of setting "an alternative to the narrative of Hindu history" aroused controversy and the anger of more conservative Hindu groups. In February 2014, litigation was started against the book on the grounds of its being "deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the feelings of a religious community." As a result, the publisher – [[Penguin Books]]' Indian subsidiary, "Penguin India" – was obliged to withdraw the book from circulation and destroy all remaining copies within six months. The court order was not completely carried out; some bookshops in India are known to be still selling it, wrapped in brown envelopes.

'''The Moorish Castle''' is the name given to a [[medieval fortification]] in [[Gibraltar]] comprising various buildings, gates, and fortified walls, with the dominant features being the Tower of Homage and the Gate House. Part of the castle itself also housed [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|the prison]] of Gibraltar until it was relocated in 2010.&lt;ref name="Chronice 2010" /&gt; The Tower of Homage is clearly visible to all visitors to Gibraltar; not only because of its striking construction, but also because of its dominant and strategic position. Although sometimes compared to the nearby ''[[Alcázar|alcazars]]'' in [[Spain]], the Moorish Castle in Gibraltar was constructed by the [[Marinid dynasty]], making it unique in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=May 1998 | url=http://www.maltwood.uvic.ca/cam/publications/CAM_bulletins/004_heritage_of_gibralter.html | title=The Heritage of Gibralter: A Reply | work=CAM Bulletins | publisher=Commonwealth Association of Museums | accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:View of Moorish Castle from Grand Battery.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Moorish Castle's northern defences as seen from the [[Grand Battery]] in 1879]]
[[File:Queen Charlottes Battery.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Queen Charlotte's Battery]] at the Moorish Castle.]]
Gibraltar has always been of special significance to the numerous peoples and civilizations that have visited or occupied it over the ages, from the [[Neanderthal]] period, through the Classical and on to [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]], [[Spain|Spanish]], and the current [[United Kingdom|British]] rule.

The Moorish occupation is by far the longest in Gibraltar's recorded history, having lasted from 711 to 1309 and then again from 1350 to 1462, a total of 710 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.guide-to-castles-of-europe.com/moorish-castle.html | title=Moorish Castle | publisher=Guide to the Castles of Europe | accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical importance of Gibraltar to both [[Muslim]]s and [[Christian]]s lies in the fact that the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish invasion]] and occupation of parts of western [[Europe]] started from [[Gibraltar]] in 711 and, through to its final recapture by Spaniards in 1462, Moorish rule was gradually undermined until, with the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, Moorish occupation of parts of western Europe came to an end after 781 years.

The Moorish conquest of [[Spain]] was led by [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]] and [[Musa ibn Nusayr]], who may have landed in Europe at or near Gibraltar. Gibraltar thus became the stepping-stone to the Moorish conquests of most of Spain and part of France. This spectacular feat of arms took a mere twenty-one years, no mean task considering the distances and terrain involved, and the fact that mechanical transport on land was not then in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi | title=Information on the Moorish Castle Complex | publisher=Government of Gibraltar | accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic importance of Gibraltar rose in the last years of the Moorish rule, when, after the successful Spanish reconquest of the entire Guadalquivir valley, Gibraltar became one of the key elements in communication between the [[Kingdom of Granada]] and Moorish domains in northwestern Africa.

Construction of the Moorish Castle commenced in the 8th century AD (possibly AD 711);{{dubious|date=November 2012}} the date of its completion is not recorded. Its walls enclosed a considerable area, reaching down from the upper part of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] to the sea. The most conspicuous remaining parts of the Castle are the upper tower, or Tower of Homage, together with various terraces and battlements below it, and the massive Gate House, with its cupola roof.&lt;ref name="gib_gi"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gib.gi/heritage/castle.html#galley | title=Gibraltar Heritage Trust History of The Moorish Castle | accessdate=2007-02-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206031404/http://www.gib.gi/heritage/castle.html#galley | archivedate=2007-02-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tower of Homage==
The Tower of Homage is the highest tower of the period of Islamic rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], and the [[Qasbah]] of the Castle is the largest in the area. The Castle itself played a prominent part in the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, with Muslim forces overrunning a large portion of it in two years - an invasion which led to Islamic domination of parts of western Europe for more than seven centuries. It is therefore of historic significance not only for [[Gibraltar]] and [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], but also for all of western [[Europe]].

The present Tower of Homage, and most of what is visible today of the Castle, was rebuilt during the second Moorish period of occupation in the early 14th century, after its near destruction during a reconquest of Gibraltar by the Moors following a re-occupation by Spanish forces from 1309 to 1333.&lt;ref name="gib_gi" /&gt;

==Present day==
Today the Moorish Castle is one of the major tourist attractions of Gibraltar, and it is shown on the reverse of the 1995 design (still in circulation) of the [[Gibraltar Pound|Gibraltar five-pound banknote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.currencymuseum.net/images/gibraltar25-1995r.JPG | title=World Paper Money - Image of the reverse of a 1995 £5 Gibraltar banknote | format=JPEG | work=Will's Online World Paper Money Gallery | accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Moorish Castle" (or "''El Castillo''" in Spanish) is also used locally when referring to the residential area surrounding the Castle, location of the ''Moorish Castle Estate''.

Part of the castle itself housed [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|the prison]] of Gibraltar until the prison was relocated in 2010.&lt;ref name="Chronice 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=19885 | title=GATES CLOSE, ‘WINDY’ PRISON OPENS FOR BUSINESS | accessdate=2010-09-01 | last=Mascarenhas | first=Alice | date=2010-09-01 | work=The Gibraltar Chronicle | publisher=The Gibraltar Chronicle | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sQXDDEHx?url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=19885 | archivedate=2010-09-01 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31893">The '''MoveOn.org ad controversy''' began when the U.S. [[Opposition to the Iraq War#Opposition in the United States|anti-war]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[advocacy group]] [[MoveOn.org]] published a full-page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 10, 2007, accusing General [[David H. Petraeus]] of "[[cooking the books]] for the [[George W. Bush Administration|White House]]". The [[newspaper advertisement|ad]] also labeled him "General Betray Us".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/Decision2008/story?id=3581727&amp;page=1 ABC News: Ad Against Petraeus Strikes a Nerve&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization created the ad in response to Petraeus' [[Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq]]. MoveOn hosted pages on its website about the ad and their reasons behind it from 2007 to June 23, 2010.  On June 23, 2010, after President Obama nominated General Petraeus to be the new top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan (taking over the position from retiring General [[Stanley A. McChrystal|Stanley McChrystal]]), MoveOn erased these webpages and any reference to them from its website.&lt;ref name=removes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/moveon-org-removes-general-betray-us-ad-in-response-to-petraeus-appointment/|publisher=[[Mediaite]]|title=MoveOn.org Removes "General Betray Us" Ad In Response To Petraeus Appointment|first=Jon|last=Bershad|date=June 24, 2010|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] argued that the "ad has raised vital questions that need a thorough and open discussion.

Pete Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran and executive director of [[Vets for Freedom]], published an article in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' calling the ad "utterly shameful."

[[MoveOn.org]] stood by their ad, stating that the General "offered a twisted version of the truth designed to support prolonging the war" and that "the public needs to know that Petraeus is neither objective nor trustworthy when it comes to assessing progress in Iraq".

MoveOn hosted pages on its website about the ad and their reasons behind it from 2007 to June 23, 2010. On June 23, 2010, MoveOn erased these webpages and any reference to them from its website. The change took place in the aftermath of President Obama's nomination of Petraeus to be the new top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan upon General [[Stanley McChrystal]]'s retirement. Commentator Jon Bershad of [[Mediaite]] stated, "Since MoveOn is an advocacy group with no claims to unbiased content, there’s nothing unethical about scrubbing the site."&lt;ref name=removes/&gt;

'''Muhanna Durra''' ({{lang-ar|مهنا دره}}), {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Star of Jordan|OSJ]]}},  is a Jordanian painter widely regarded as a pioneer of the Jordanian Arts Movement and for being the first to introduce [[Cubism]] and [[abstract art]] into the Jordanian visual arts community. He is a professor at the Faculty of Fine Art and Design at [[University of Jordan]] and serves as the President of the [[Jordan Association of Fine Arts]].

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] in 1938 to a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] father and a Turkish mother,&lt;ref&gt;"Myhana Al Durra" in ''Guide to Jordanian Culture,'' Online: http://www.bourse-des-voyages.com/jordanie/guide-culture-peintres-muhanna-al-durra.php&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Dura was raised in a striking red hilltop villa in downtown Amman. The house is only a few blocks away from Amman's popular tourist attraction, the Roman amphitheater, and is commonly believed to rest atop an ancient Roman cemetery. As a child, spooky folklore about his neighborhood sparked a fascination with ghouls and "ignited fantasy in what was beyond the observable, physical world."&lt;ref name="colors"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuhur|first=Sherifa|title=Colors of enchantment: theater, dance, music and the visual arts of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOVPaLXjjsAC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;dq=Muhanna+Durra&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4h4cTbKaJM2r8AbgrfCOCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Muhanna%20Durra&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2001|publisher=American Univ. in Cairo Press|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A notoriously rebellious youth with a penchant for drawing, he was sent by his father to study art with George Allief (also known as ''[[George Aleef]]''), a former Russian officer with the Tsarist army. Allief taught him the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective. These lessons with Allief marked the young artist's transition from childhood drawing to the disciplined work of a professional artist. According to Dura's memoirs, Allief taught his students to meticuoulsy render a matchbox as an exercise in perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the formative years with Allief, the young Muhanna met Dutch painter, William Hallowin, who introduced him to Rembrandt and the Dutch school which sparked an obsession with the power of light. In 1954, he was sent to the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma|Academy of Fine Arts in Rome]] to become the first Jordanian to receive a formal art education.&lt;ref&gt;"Muhanna Durra," in ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Vol. 2, Jonathan M. Bloom and Sheila S. Blair (eds), Oxford University Press, 2009, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have been disillusioned by the academy and committed himself to studying the classics through art in museums and churches. After graduating in 1958, Durra returned to Amman to teach history of art at the Teachers' Training College. In 1964, Durra established the Fine Arts Section at the Department of Culture and Art, Amman, and then established the Jordan Institute of Fine Arts in 1970. &lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, pp 175-76&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1960 and 1970, Al-Durra returned to Rome, where he experimented with abstraction and cubism. In 1970, he returned to Jordan to receive the Kawkab Decoration from King Hussein. &lt;ref&gt;"Muhanna Al Durra," ''University of Jordan Newsletter,'' October, 2017, &lt;Online:http://ju.edu.jo/Lists/NewsLetter/Disp_form.aspx?ID=1418&amp;Issue=October%202017&amp;order=10&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Durra established an art studio; the first Jordanian to establish an art studio to teach local students.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Among his notable students was the Princess [[Wijdan Ali]] who is best known for her attempts to revive the traditions of Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Hashem Talham, G., ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013 p. 24; Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, pp 377-78 &lt;/ref&gt; Another student was Nawal Abdallah, who is one of the leading lights of Jordan's contemporary arts scene.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., "A Hit List of Jordanian Artists" in ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Durra is best known for his portraits and also for the way he treated shifting masses of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; He is also acknowledged as the first artist to introduce cubism and abstract art to the Jordanian arts community. &lt;ref&gt;"Muhanna Al Durra," ''University of Jordan Newsletter,'' October, 2017, &lt;Online:http://ju.edu.jo/Lists/NewsLetter/Disp_form.aspx?ID=1418&amp;Issue=October%202017&amp;order=10&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicky Imber working on head.jpg|thumb|250px|Nicky Imber working on sculpture]]

After escaping the Nazi concentration camp in [[Dachau]],&lt;ref name="TheDaily"&gt;The Daily Journal Friday September 22, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; he pledged to dedicate his art to perpetuating the memory of the Holocaust. Among his more famous works are "[[The Hope (Imber)|The Hope]]" and "The Love of Torah". His work can be seen around the world, in [[Northern Israel]], the [[United States]], and the Venezuelan Museum of Natural History in Caracas.

== Biography==
Nicky Imber was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. During his studies at the Academy of Arts in Vienna, he drew anti-Nazi caricatures for Jewish student publications.&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni"&gt;Meir Hareuveni, Ma'ariv newspaper, September 22, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; After several thwarted attempts by the family to leave Vienna, in 1938, in the wake of the '[[Anschluss]]', Imber was deported to [[Dachau]].&lt;ref name="TheDaily" /&gt; Witnessing the murders of family and friends, he plotted his escape. Using skills he had learned in art school, he made a face mask out of bread and sand, stole a Nazi soldier's uniform and walked out the front gate unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Carmiel]],1981 Yad Vashem Archives&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he boarded a ship headed to [[Haifa]]. The ship's passengers were refused entry by the British mandatory authorities and imprisoned in a detention camp in [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt;

In 1943, Imber worked out a deal with the authorities for his release by joining the British Army, serving as a war artist and a dental assistant in East Africa. After the war, he opened an art school in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and worked as a photographer and a safari guide.&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt;

In 1949 to 1954, he lived in [[Venezuela]], where he was contracted to do an East African [[Diorama]] series. The National Museum added an entire wing to display it.&lt;ref name="VeVenezuela"&gt;Ve Venezuela Vol.2 No.56 April–May 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this period he got married and had a daughter Raquel, who accompanied and assisted him.
[[File:Nicky Imber with one of the sculptures of the prehistoric animals.jpg|thumb|Nicky Imber with one of his prehistoric animal sculptures]]

In 1959, Imber was commissioned to create sculptures and dioramas for the Haifa Prehistory Museum at Gan Ha-em in [[Haifa]], Israel. In 1960 he returned to Venezuela to restaured the Phelps series of Dioramas for the Museum in Caracas.&lt;ref name="VeVenezuela" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münstersche Zeitung Friday August 22, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1961 and 1971 he travelled extensively around Europe and after establishing an international name for himself, returned to the United States. In New York he became famous for his realistic oil paintings of portraits of [[Aga Khan]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Sir Richard Burton]] and [[Simon Bolivar]].&lt;ref name="TheSun"&gt;The Sun Reporter Tuesday July 31, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Venezuela in 1976, Imber created huge sculptures of prehistoric animals, forming one of the world's largest historical animal parks. During this period he also created realistic sculptures of famous Venezuelans for the country's National Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;El Nacional, Caracas, Thursday, April 22, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In 1978, Imber spent three years designing and building a Holocaust memorial park at the entrance to the city of [[Karmiel]] located in the Galilee, entitled 'From Holocaust to Resurrection.'&lt;ref name="MeirHareuveni" /&gt; Imber also established animal theme playgrounds around the city. [[File:Nicky Imber building "Hope" in Carmiel, Israel.JPG|thumb|Nicky Imber building "Hope" in Carmiel, Israel]]

In the 1980s, Imber established residence in Karmiel, Israel. In Israel he was inspired to create highly emotional, life like collections.

Nicky Imber died in 1996 in Vienna, Austria.

[[File:Cawén, Alvar - Members of The November Group - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Alvar Cawén]], ''Members of the November Group'' (1921) currentlocation: [[EMMA – Espoo Museum of Modern Art]]]]
The '''November Group''' ({{lang-de|Novembergruppe}}) was a group of German [[expressionism|expressionist]] [[artist]]s and [[Expressionist architecture|architects]]. Formed on 3 December 1918, they took their name from the month of the [[German Revolution]].

The group was led by [[Max Pechstein]] and [[César Klein]]. Linked less by their styles of art than by shared [[socialist]] values, the group campaigned for radical artists to have a greater say in such issues as the organisation of art schools, and new laws around the arts. The group merged in December 1918 with [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] ([[Workers Council]] of the arts - or 'The Art Soviet').

==Weimar Republic==

The artists of the November group described themselves as radical and revolutionary. Their work, like that of the similar [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]], aimed to support a socialist revolution in Germany. A key objective of the group was the union of art and the people. Furthermore, the group tried to influence public and cultural aspects of society.

In 1921, artists from the left wing of the November Group called for an end to the "bourgeois development" of the artists. The declaration was signed by [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]] and [[Georg Scholz]].

In 1922, the decentralised November Group restructured away from a conglomeration of local groups and became part of the "Cartel of advanced artistic groups in Germany" (Kartell fortschrittlicher Künstlergruppen in Deutschland).

A synthesis of styles is a characteristic of the group, often referred to as cubo-futo-expressionism, (Kubofutoexpressionismus) but really the group had quite disparate output which makes classification rather problematic.

As well as painters, there were many artists from other disciplines such as architecture and music. The musicians became one of the driving forces under their leader [[Max Butting]] (later replaced by [[Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt]]).

The November Group held regular art festivals, costume parties, studio visits, literary and musical events.

==Founding members==
The group was initially founded mainly by painters [[Max Pechstein]], [[Georg Tappert]], [[César Klein]], [[Moriz Melzer]] and [[Heinrich Richter]]. At the first meeting on 3.12.1918 they were joined by [[Karl Jakob Hirsch]], [[Bernhard Hasler]], [[Richard Janthur]], [[Rudolf Bauer (artist)|Rudolf Bauer]], [[Bruno Krauskopf]], [[Otto Freundlich]], [[Wilhelm Schmid (painter)|Wilhelm Schmid]], the sculptor [[Rudolf Belling]] and the architect [[Erich Mendelsohn]]. From this group the first working committee were drawn.

==Members==
A definitive list of all the members of the group is rather difficult to establish due to a lack of early documentation. However, one of the exhibition catalogues was reprinted in 1925 with the following list of names:

An '''oil lamp''' is an object used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source. The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although not commonly anymore. 

Oil lamps are a form of [[lighting]], and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights. Starting in 1780, the [[Argand lamp]] quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form. These in turn were replaced by the [[kerosene lamp]] in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally [[Electrification|electrified]] and light bulbs could be used.

Sources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, seals). 

Most modern lamps (such as [[Lantern#Modern fueled lanterns|fueled lanterns]]) have been replaced by [[Propane|gas-based]] or [[Naphtha#Other applications|petroleum-based]] fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Therefore, oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce.

==Components==
[[Image:Oil lamp Fandaqomiyah.jpg|thumb|Double-nozzled [[terracotta]] oil lamp found in [[Samaria]]]]

The following are the main external parts of a [[terra-cotta]] lamp:
* '''Shoulder'''
* '''Pouring hole'''

: The hole through which fuel is put inside the fuel chamber. The width ranges from 0.5-5 cm in general. There may be single or multiple holes.

* '''Wick hole''', and the '''nozzle'''.
: It may be just an opening in the body of the lamp, or an elongated nozzle. In some specific types of lamps, there is a groove on the superior aspect of the nozzle that runs along to the pouring hole to re-collect the oozing oil from the wick.
* '''Handle'''
: Lamps can come with or without a handle. The handle can come in different shapes. The most common is a ring shaped for the forefinger surmounted by a [[palmette]], on which the thumb is pressed to stabilize the lamp. Other handles can be crescent shaped, triangular, or semi-ovalular. The handleless lamps usually have an elongated nozzle, and sometimes have a [[Lug (knob)|lug]] rising diagonally from the periphery. The lug may act as a small handle where the thumb rests. Some lugs are pierced. It was speculated that pierced lugs were used to place a pen or straw, called the ''acus'' or ''festuca'', with which the wick was trimmed. Others think that the pierced lugs were used to hang the lamp with a metal hook when not in use.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* '''Discus'''
* '''Fuel chamber'''
: The fuel reservoir. The mean volume in a typical terra-cotta lamp is 20 cc.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Lamp typology==
Lamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material ([[clay]], [[silver]], [[bronze]], [[gold]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e.g. symbolic, religious, mythological, erotic, battles, hunting).

==Lamp typological categories==
Typologically, lamps of the Ancient [[Mediterranean]] can be divided into seven major categories:

'''Wheel-made''': This category includes Greek and Egyptian lamps that date before the 3rd century BC. They are characterized by simple, little or no decoration, and a wide pour hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced [[Lug (knob)|lug]]. Pierced lugs occurred briefly between 4th and 3rd century BC. Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BC.

'''Volute, Early Imperial''': With spiral, scroll-like ornaments ([[volute]]s) extending from their nozzles, these lamps were predominantly produced in Italy during the [[History of the Roman Empire#27 BC—AD 14: Augustus|Early Roman]] period. They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder and no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration.

'''High Imperial''': These are late Roman. The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations. These lamps have handles and short plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing.

'''Frog''': This is a regional style lamp exclusively produced in [[Egypt]] and found in the regions around it, between c. 100 and 300 AD. The [[frog]] ([[Heqet]]) is an Egyptian fertility symbol.

'''[[African Red Slip]]''' lamps were made in North Africa, but widely exported, and decorated in a red slip. They date from the 2nd to the 7th century AD and comprise a wide variety of shapes including a flat, heavily decorated shoulder with a small and relatively shallow discus. Their decoration is either non-religious, [[Christian]] or [[Jewish]]. Grooves run from the nozzle back to the pouring hole, it is hypothesized{{by whom|date=September 2015}} that this is to take back spilled oil. These lamps often have more than one pour-hole.

'''Slipper''' lamps are oval-shaped and found mainly in the [[Levant]]. They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries AD.
Decorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters.

'''Factory lamps''': Also called  ''Firmalampen'' (from [[German language|German]]), these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance. They have a channeled nozzle, plain discus, and 2 or 3 bumps on the shoulder.  Initially made in [[factories]] in Northern Italy and Southern [[Gaul]] between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, they were exported to all Roman provinces. The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer.

==Oil lamps in religious contexts==

===Judaism===
[[Image:Three Oil Jews lamps from Sardegna MUSEO NAZIONA SANNA SASSARI.jpg|thumb|Jewish [[terracotta]] oil lamps from [[Sardinia]] in the Museo Nazionale Sanna, Sassari]]

Lamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of “lighting” the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals.
The oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and its religion.

*“And you shall command the people of Israel that they bring to you pure beaten olive-oil for the light, that a lamp may be set to burn continually”. Exodus 27:20
*“When you set the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the [[Menorah (Temple)|lamp stand]] (menorah).” Numbers 8: 1 -4
*"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path." (Psalm 119:105) 
*“There I shall cause pride to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.” (Psalms 132:16)
*“Your parents give you commands and teachings that are like lights to show you the right way. This teaching corrects you and trains you to follow the path to life.” (Proverbs 6:23);
*“The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all his innermost parts.” (Proverbs 20:27).
*“A lamp is called a lamp, and the soul of man is called a lamp.” (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 30B)

====Chanukah====

The Temple [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the [[Chanukah]] story and centers on the story of the [[Hanukkah#Traditional view|miracle of the oil]]: During the cleansing of the Second Temple in [[Jerusalem]] after its looting, the lamp was supposed to burn continuously, forever, but there was only oil enough for one day, and no more oil would be available for eight days. Miraculously, however, the oil expected to last for only one day burnt for eight full days instead.

===Christianity===&lt;!-- [[Lampada]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Saint Mercurius, bishop of Smolensk.jpg|thumb|Oil lamp burning before the [[icon]] of St. Mercurius of Smolensk, [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], [[Ukraine]]]]

There are several references to oil lamps in the [[New Testament]]:

This story was told by [[Jesus]]: “At that time God’s kingdom will be like ten bridesmaids who went to wait for the bridegroom. They took their lamps with them. Five of the bridesmaids were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish bridesmaids took their lamps with them, but they did not take extra oil for the lamps. The wise bridesmaids took their lamps and more oil in jars. When the bridegroom was very late, the bridesmaids could not keep their eyes open, and they all fell asleep. At midnight someone announced, ‘The bridegroom is coming! Come and meet him!’ Then all the bridesmaids woke up. They made their lamps ready. But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise girls, ‘Give us some of your oil. The oil in our lamps is all gone.’ The wise bridesmaids answered, ‘No! The oil we have might not be enough for all of us. But go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ So the foolish bridesmaids went to buy oil. While they were gone, the bridegroom came. The bridesmaids who were ready went in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast. Then the door was closed and locked. Later, the other bridesmaids came. They said, ‘Sir, sir! Open the door to let us in.’ But the bridegroom answered, ‘Certainly not! I don’t even know you.’ So always be ready. You don’t know the day or the time when the Son of Man will come."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|25:1-13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*“Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is sound, your whole body is sound, your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound, your body is full of darkness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|11:34|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:22|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*“He [i.e. [[John the Baptist]]] was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|5:35|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*“And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign for ever and ever.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rev|22:5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:22-23|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is in YLT: "The lamp of the body is the eye, if, therefore, thine eye may be perfect, all thy body shall be enlightened, but if thine eye may be evil, all thy body shall be dark; if, therefore, the light that [is] in thee is darkness -- the darkness, how great!"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:22-23|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Orthodox Church]] and many [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] oil lamps ({{lang-el|kandili}}, [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''lampada'') are still used both on the [[Holy Table]] (altar) and to illuminate [[icon]]s on the [[iconostasis]] and around the [[temple]] (church building). Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their [[icon corner]].

Traditionally, the [[sanctuary lamp]] in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp. It is lit by the [[bishop]] when the church is [[consecrated]], and ideally it should burn perpetually thereafter. The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally [[olive oil]].

In Greece and Cyprus, ''lampáda'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: λαμπάδα) is the special name for the [[candle]] held by the faithful on the [[Easter]] [[Easter Vigil#Byzantine Christianity: Eastern Orthodoxy .26 Greek Catholicism|service celebrating the Resurrection]]. Although any regular paraffin or beeswax candle can be used, a ''lampáda'' is usually a large, white candle or, in the case of children, a multicolored candle decorated with ribbons, beads, toys, dried flowers etc.  The ''lampáda'' is lit at midnight, with the [[Holy Fire|holy light]] from the priest's candle, and then carried home.  The sign of the cross is often made with soot from this flame on the [[lintel]] above the home's main door, and the flame is transferred to the [[icon corner]] oil lamp; only then can the ''lampáda'' be extinguished.  The cross over the door and the flame before the icons are believed to confer the Risen Lord's protection on the household.

In [[Eastern Christianity]] it is common to hang decorated ostrich eggs on the chains holding the oil lamps.&lt;ref name="CathDict"/&gt; The initial reason was probably to prevent mice and rats from climbing down the chain to eat the oil.&lt;ref name="CathDict"/&gt; Another, symbolical explanation is based in the [[Ostrich#Mating|fictitious]] tradition that female ostriches do not sit on their eggs, but stare at them incessantly until they hatch out, because if they stop staring even for a second the egg will addle.&lt;ref name="CathDict"/&gt; This is equated to the obligation of the Christian to direct his entire attention towards God during prayer, lest the prayer be fruitless.&lt;ref name="CathDict"&gt;{{cite book |article= Ostrich Eggs |title= A Catholic Dictionary |edition = 3 |editor= Rev.

===Islam===
"God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His light is, as it were, that of a niche containing a lamp; the lamp is [enclosed] in glass, the glass [shining] like a radiant star: [a lamp] lit from a blessed tree - an olive-tree that is neither of the east nor of the west  the oil whereof [is so bright that it] would well-nigh give light [of itself] even though fire had not touched it: light upon light! God guides unto His light him that wills [to be guided]; and [to this end] God propounds parables unto men, since God [alone] has full knowledge of all things". 24:35

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mankind errs here&lt;br&gt;
By folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom&lt;br&gt;
That darkness of the soul is chased by Light (of the Lord),&lt;br&gt;
Splendid and clear shines manifest the Truth&lt;br&gt;
As if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed&lt;br&gt;
Its beams of dawn. Him meditating still,&lt;br&gt;
Him seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,&lt;br&gt;
The souls illuminated take that road&lt;br&gt;

[[File:Paavai-vilakku8.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|left|''Paavai vilakku'': anthropomorphic brass oil lamp from Tamil Nadu]]
Oil lamps are commonly used in [[Hindu temple]]s as well as in home shrines. Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks. They are made of metal and either suspended on a chain or screwed onto a pedestal. There will usually be at least one lamp in each shrine, and the main shrine may contain several. Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions. The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of [[Aarti]].

In the home shrine, the style of lamp is usually different, containing only one wick. There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it. In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown. The lamp in the home shrine is supposed to be lit before any other lights are turned on at night.

A hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with [[ghee]]. On special occasions, various other lamps may be used for puja, the most elaborate having several tiers of wicks.

In [[South India]], there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals, some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well:a 
[[File:Deepalakshmi56.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|A Deepalakshmi oil lamp from [[Kumbakonam]]]]
*'''Deepalakshmi''', a brass lamp with a depiction of goddess [[Sri Lakshmi]] over the back piece. They are usually small and have only one wick.
*'''[[Nilavilakku]]''', a tall brass or bronze lamp on a stand where the wicks are placed at a certain height.
*'''Paavai vilakku''', a brass or bronze lamp in the form of a lady holding a vessel with her hands. This type of lamp comes in different sizes, from very small to almost life-size. There are also large stone versions of this lamp in [[Hindu temple]]s and shrines of [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]], especially at the base of columns and flanking the entrance of temples. They have only one wick.
*'''Thooku vilakku''', a brass or bronze lamp hanging from a chain, often with multiple wicks.

===Chinese folk religion===
[[Image:Malaysian god shrine.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Traditional Chinese shrine in [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Malaysia]], containing an oil lamp]]
Oil lamps are lit at traditional Chinese shrines before either an image of a deity or a plaque with Classical Chinese characters giving the name of the deity. Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (they look similar to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath. A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil.

Such lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
It is very difficult to say when and where the first oil lamp was used. This is partly because it is difficult to draw a line detailing when the primitive forms of creating a continuous source of light from fire can be termed a lamp.
The first lamps were made of naturally occurring objects, coconuts, sea shells, egg shells and hollow stones. Some believe that the first proper lamps were carved from stones. Curved stone lamps were found in places dated to the [[10th millennium BC]] (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, c. 10,300–8000 BC). The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in [[Lascaux]] in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epalladioartworkshop.com/OILLAMPS/HISTORY/index.htm Epalladio Art Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:千灯馆新石器时代石灯.jpg|thumb|Neolithic stone lamps in Thousand Lamp Museum in Qiandeng town of [[Kunshan]]]]
Some archaeologists claim that the first shell-lamps were in existence more than 6,000 years ago (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c. 8500–4500 BC). They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating 2600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that were used for a long time (Early Bronze, Canaanite / Bronze I-IV, c. 3300–2000 BC).

It is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout.

=== Chalcolithic Age, c. 4500–3300 BC ===
The first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared. These were of the round bowl type.

=== The Bronze Ages (3200–1200 BC)===
Lamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick. Later lamps had only one pinch. These lamps vary in the shape of the rim, the general shape of the bowl and the  shape of the base.

*Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)
The earliest lamps known from Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)
With the four wick lamps. These lamps are made from large bowls with four shallow pinches for wicks.
*Middle Bronze Age lamps (MB)
The four-wick oil lamps persist into this period, most of the lamps now have one wick. Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp's body. The bases are simple and flat. The crude potter’s wheel is introduced, transforming the handmade bowls to a more uniform container. The saucer style evolves into a single spout shape.
*Late Bronze Age lamps (LB)
A more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides. The shape is evolving to be more triangular, deeper and larger. All lamps are now wheel-made. The base is simple, usually flat.

===The Iron Age (1200–560 BC)===

The rim becomes wider and flatter with a deeper and higher spout. The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim.

The lamps are becoming variable in shape and distribution. We still find lamps similar to the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.

In the later Iron Age, we encounter variant forms. One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base. Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base.

===Arctic===
[[File:Descriptive booklet on the Alaska historical museum (1922) (14758775556).jpg|thumb|Seal oil lamps]]
{{see also|Seal-oil lamp}}
The [[seal-oil lamp]] ''(Qulliq)'' provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse inhabitants relied almost entirely on seal oil. This lamp was the most important article of furniture for the [[Inuit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and other [[Eskimo]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, T. A. &amp; Dalton, O. M. (1910) ''Handbook to the ethnographical collections.'' British Museum. Dept. of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography Joyce,&lt;/ref&gt;

The lamps were made of stone and their sizes and shapes of lamps could be different, but mostly were elliptical or half-moon shaped. The wicks were mostly made of dried moss or [[Eriophorum callitrix|cottongrass]] and was lit along the edge of the lamp. A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/GD/eskimo-reading.html Eskimos and the Long Winter Darkness]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian===
These large lamps have thin sides and a deep pinch, which flattens the mouth and makes it protrude outward.

===Greek===
Lamps are more closed to avoid spilling. They are smaller and more refined. Most are handleless. Some are with a lug, pierced and not pierced. The nozzle is elongated. The rim is folded over to make the nozzle, so it overlaps and is then pinched to make the wick hole.

They are round in shape, wheel-made.

===Chinese===
The earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the [[Warring States period]] (481-221 BC). The ancient Chinese created oil lamps with a refillable reservoir and a fibrous wick, giving the lamp a controlled flame.  Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan"&gt;{{cite book|title=China: Dawn of a Golden Age, 200-750 AD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbdS-R3y72MC&amp;pg=PA182|year=2004|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-126-1|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture |last=Handler |first=Sarah |publisher= University of California Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0520214842 |publication-date=October 1, 2001 |page=308-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Roman===
[[Image:Oil Lamp J 1.jpg|thumb|A terracotta oil lamp of the Roman Imperial era (replica)]]

Production of oil-lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply. Molds used. All lamps are closed in type. Lamps produced in large scale in factories. The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber. Most are of the characteristic  Imperial Type. It was round with nozzles of different forms (volute, semi-volute, U shaped), with a closed body and with a central disk decorated with reliefs and its filling hole.

===Late Roman===
The High Imperial Type. More decorations. Produced locally or imported in large scale. The multiple-nozzled lamps appear. Different varieties.

In this period we find the frog type lamps. These are kidney or heart shaped or oval. With the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes with geometrical motifs. They were produced around 100 AD. They are so variant that it is seldom that two identical ones are found.

===Byzantine===
Slipper shaped. Very decorative. The multiple nozzles continue. Most with handles. Some are complex in external anatomy.

===Early Islamic===
[[Image:Beja51.jpg|thumb|Early Islamic oil lamps (11th century), found in Southern Portugal]]

There is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps. The decoration on lamps of this transition period changed from crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, fish, etc., to plain linear, geometric, and raised-dot patterns.

The early Islamic lamps continued the traditions of Byzantine lamps. Decorations were initially a stylized form of bird, grain, tree, plant, or flower. Then they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots.

In 9th-century [[Baghdad]], [[al-Razi]] (Rhazes) described the first [[kerosene lamp]]; he referred to it as the "naffatah" in his ''Kitab al-Asrar'' (''Book of Secrets'').&lt;ref&gt;
Zayn Bilkadi ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), "The Oil Weapons", ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January–February 1995, p. 20-27.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the transition period some lamps had Arabic writing. Then writing disappears until the [[Mamluk]] period (13th to 15th centuries AD).

=== Industrial age ===

Oil-burning carriage lamps provided a model for the first bicycle lamps in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}

===Israel===
*Jerusalem oil lamp: Characteristic black color of the clay because the clay was burned without oxygen. Usually of high quality.
*Daroma oil lamp:
*Jerash oil lamp:
*Nabatean oil lamp:
*Herodian oil lamp: Considered to be used mainly by Jews. Wheel made, rounded. Nozzle with concave sides. The lamps are usually not decorated. If there is decoration, it tends to be simple. Very common throughout all of Israel, and some lamps have also been found in Jordan. Date from the 1st century BC to the end of the 1st century AD.
*[[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah oil lamp]], seven nozzles: Rare and are associated with Judaism because of the numerical connection with the seven branches or arms of the Menorah.
*Samaritan oil lamp: Characterized by a sealed filling hole, which was to be broken by the buyer. This was probably done to ensure ritual purity. A wider spout, and the concavities flanking the nozzle are almost always emphasized with a ladder pattern band. In general the lamps are uncoated. The decorations are linear and/or geometric.
**Type I: A distinct channel running from the pouring-hole to the nozzle, a small knob handle, a ladder pattern around the nozzle and shows no ornamentation on the bottom of the base.
**Type II: Pear-shaped and elongated, lined channel that extends from the filling-hole to the nozzle, continued to be used through to the early Muslim period.
*Candle Stick oil lamp: Menorah design on the nozzle and bunch of grapes on the shoulders.
*Byzantine oil lamp: The upper parts are covered with braided patterns and their handles.  All are made of a dark orange-red clay. A rounded bottom with a distinct X or cross appears inside the circled base.
*Early Islamic oil lamp: Large knob handle and the channel above the nozzle are dominant elements. The handle is tongue-shaped. Decoration is rich and elegant. The lower parts are extremely broad and the nozzles are pointed.

=== Importance of oil lamps in India ===
[[Image:Diya.jpg|thumb|A basic earthen oil lamp used for [[Diwali]]]]
[[Image:Diya-1.JPG|thumb|Traditional Indian earthenware oil lamp or [[diya (light)|diya]]]]

In [[Vedic period|Vedic times]], fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations. Later the presence of fire in the household or a religious building was ensured by an oil lamp. Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp.

For ''Deep Daan'', the gift of a lamp was and still is believed to be the best daan (donation). During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil. The presence of an oil lamp is an important aspect of ritual worship (the Shodashopachar Puja) offered to a deity. Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one amavasya (no moon) day in the month of [[Shravan]]. This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality – "tamaso ma jyotirgamaya".

Earlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells. The shape was like a circular bowl with a protruding beak. Later they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps. In the epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], there are references to gold and silver lamps as well. The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the matsya (fish), kurma (Tortoise) and other incarnations of god [[Vishnu]] and also in the shape of the many emblems of gods like conch shells, lotuses and so on. The birds like swans, peacocks, parrots and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp. For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone deepastambhas (towers of light) were created.

[[File:Lighting-a-lamp.jpg|thumb|left|Lighting of a ''Kuthuvilakku'']]
Erecting a deepastambha in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku made of brass can be seen. For adapting the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha (tree of light) was formed. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with aesthetically curvi-linear lines branching out from the base each holding a lamp. The Deepalakshmi is another common design where goddess Lakshmi holds the lamp in her hands. Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.

Oil lamps also became proverbial. For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, "Chiraag tale andhera", "the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp (chiraag)", meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (and indeed, a lamp's container casts a strong shadow).

== Oil tax ==
When the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple|Big Temple]] in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu was built, there were elaborate measures taken to provide lighting for the temple. Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective. The income from these lands would go towards providing the oil for the lights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O1b1N_Dx0jsC&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Royal Temple of Rajaraja: An Instrument of Imperial Cola Power'' by ''Geeta Vasudevan'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Opus vermiculatum''''' is a method of laying [[mosaic]] [[tesserae]] to emphasise an outline around a subject.  This can be of one or more rows and may also provide background contrast, eg as a shadow, sometimes with [[Opus tessellatum]].  The outline created is often light and offset by a dark background for greater contrast.  The name ''opus vermiculatum'' literally means "worm-like work", and has been described as one of the most demanding and elaborate forms of mosaic work.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Alan (2000). ''Floors''. frances lincoln ltd. {{ISBN|0-7112-1612-6}}. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually ''opus vermiculatum'' is meant to put emphasis on the main design and foreground details of a work, using a smooth and flowing halo-effect. Sometimes it was used only around the head of a figure. The tesserae used were often square but can be variously shaped.&lt;ref name=yal&gt;Strong, Donald (June 1, 1992). ''Roman Art: The Yale University Press Pelican History of Art''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05293-6}}. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''Opus vermiculatum'' originated in [[Greece]], later than other mosaic methods.  The earliest known example is the Sophilos Mosaic of [[Thmuis]], which has been dated to around 200 BC.  The method spread throughout the Hellenistic world; for instance, [[Mosaics of Delos|the large corpus of surviving examples]] found on the island of [[Delos]].&lt;ref name=yal/&gt; In [[Egypt]] it was used for tomb decoration from the late-3rd to 1st Centuries BC, and in [[Syria]], it survived into later times.  The Nile Mosaic has a very refined use of color and shows an advanced development.  This may indicate that the technique was based on paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Meyboom, P G P (January 1, 1994). ''The Nile Mosaic of Palestrina: Early Evidence of Egyptian Religion in Italy''. Brill Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|90-04-10137-3}}. p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1st Century BC, it reached Italy along with other mosaic methods.  Many fine examples of this style have been found at [[Pompeii]].  One remarkable work in particular portrays a crucial scene in the [[Battle of Issus]], and was possibly copied from a 4th-century BC Greek painting or fresco.  The use of ''opus vermiculatum'' declined after the 1st century AD, but continued to be employed for finer Roman mosaics until the 4th century.  By then, mosaics were becoming increasingly impressionistic, taking advantage of the crystalline reflection of the tesserae, which was better suited to ''opus tessellatum''.  It was eventually entirely abandoned for this style.&lt;ref&gt;"opus vermiculatum." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}
== What ''type'' of thing is sculpture? ==
Sculpture can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term "sculpture".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, sculpture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Sculpture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** A branch of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">'''Ray Korona''' (1946 - October 16, 2014) was an American [[folk music|folk]] musician, particularly known for [[topical songs]].

==Biography and repertoire==
Ray Korona wrote folk and folk rock songs about working, the environment, peace and social justice issues along with songs on the more traditional themes of love and friendship. Previously an attorney, Korona left the profession to pursue a career in music. In addition to songwriting and performance Korona helped organise events, ran a home studio, volunteered at a collective-run cafe and supported the [[Peoples Music Network]].&lt;ref&gt;http://local1000.org/2014/10/ray-korona/&lt;/ref&gt; A founding member of the Travelling Musician's Union, Local 1000 of the [[American Federation of Musicians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://local1000.com/about-us/memberslist |title=Local 1000 American Federation of Musicians » Our Members |publisher=Local1000.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712202636/http://local1000.com/about-us/memberslist |archivedate=2012-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Korona's songs vary from the satirical and topical to ballads, chorus and story songs. Due to the subject matter of many of these songs, they are often referenced in studies of political and economic issues and used in support of various public causes by their advocates as discussed here. 

A number of Korona's songs addressing such diverse subjects as homelessness, downsizing, gay rights and health care policies are included in the directory of some 3,000 songs identified for use in classrooms for teaching purposes maintained by the nonprofit corporation, M.U.S.I.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Chase |url=http://www.learningfromlyrics.org/songindex.html |title=songslink |publisher=Learningfromlyrics.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Teachers' Curriculum Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachtci.com |title=Interactive Social Studies Textbooks &amp; Curriculum for K-12 Schools &amp;#124; TCI |publisher=Teachtci.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published the lyrics to Korona's "Globalization Blues" song in a classroom text which includes a disc with a recording of the song to promote academic discussions on the subject of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Econ Alive! The Power to Choose, multiple authors, Teachers' Curriculum Institute, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-934534-28-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same song has likewise been published for classroom use in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Globalisation, text with CD, multiple authors, Ernst Klett Verlag, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-12-601002-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another song, "Where Do We Go From Here?" sparked a [[New York Magazine]] cover story reporting on the impact of the housing crisis' on the New York City artist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrisroe |first=Patricia |url=http://nymag.com/arts/all/features/48233 |title=The Exodus of Creative Young People Out of Manhattan - New York Magazine |publisher=Nymag.com |date=1985-11-25 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other songs by Korona have been utilized in advocating causes rather than in fostering learning. His health care rights song, "Send Me An Ambulance" was featured on [[National Public Radio]] and performed at major [[Jobs With Justice]] rallies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raykorona.com/urgent%20political%20songs.htm |title=Urgent Songs |publisher=Raykorona.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for national health care reform. "We Will Have Dignity," a song against child labor, has been published around the world in many languages by the UN’s [[International Labour Organization]] to lend support to its work on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Unions and Child Labour, Vol. I, p. 10, Manuel Simon Velasco, International Labour Office, Bureau for Workers' Activities, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ray Korona Band==
Korona performed both solo and with a unique collective of musical organizers, The Ray Korona Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raykorona.com/activists%20band.htm |title=BIO |publisher=Raykorona.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Band is a core group of musicians—Ivice (harmonies &amp; dulcimers), Barry Kornhauser (bass, cello &amp; mandola), Sharon Abreu (harmonies &amp; fiddle),  Ellen Davidson (harmonies &amp; piano) &amp; Gina Tlamsa (harmonies, flute, fiddle, mandolin &amp; bouzouki) that works with a wide variety of players who bring racial, cultural and musical diversity to its work. Occasionally, guest musicians like [[John McCutcheon]], Barry Mitterhoff and [[Perry Robinson]] sat in with the group and Korona often performed in concert with [[Pete Seeger]]. The names of those who have shared the stage with him suggest the orientation of his activist views and musical style, such as [[Patti Smith]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Anne Feeney]], [[Richie Havens]], Judy Gorman, [[Leon Rosselson]], Suni Paz, Pat Humphries, [[Lucy Kaplansky]], [[Gary US Bonds]]. Since many of Korona's songs are topical, he has also shared stages with noted speakers, such as [[Amy Goodman]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Greg Palast]], and [[Jim Hightower]]. Korona was a regular at the [[Cornelia Street Cafe]]'s Monday night songwriter workshop in the 1980s.

For decades in the U.S., there have been isolated incidents of '''removal of Confederate monuments and memorials''', although generally opposed in [[#Public opinion|public opinion]] polls, and [[#Laws hindering removals|several U.S. States]] have passed laws over 115 years to hinder or prohibit further removals.

In the wake of the [[Charleston church shooting]] in June 2015, several municipalities in the United States removed monuments and memorials on public property dedicated to the [[Confederate States of America]]. The momentum accelerated in August 2017 after the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-jindal-monuments-20150814-story.html |title=Jindal seeks to block removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans |first=Natalie |last=Schachar |date=August 15, 2015 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kenning2017&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/16/us/confederate-monuments-removed.html |title=Confederate Monuments Are Coming Down Across the United States |first=Chris |last=Kenning |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-statues-idUSKCN1AV0XE |title=U.S. cities step up removal of Confederate statues, despite Virginia |date=August 16, 2017 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The removals were driven by the belief that the monuments glorify [[white supremacy]] and memorialize a [[treason|treasonous]] government whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/08/charlottesville-confederate-memorials-civil-war-racism-history/ |title=Why the U.S. Capitol Still Hosts Confederate Monuments |date=August 17, 2017 |website=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-20/what-confederate-monument-builders-were-thinking |title=What Confederate Monument Builders Were Thinking |date=August 20, 2017|agency=[[Bloomberg News]] |access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future' |website=NPR.org |access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The History of Blaming 'Both Sides' and Why Language Matters |url=https://wnyc.org/story/history-blaming-both-sides-language-charlottesville-trump/ |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drum |first1=Kevin |title=The real story behind all those Confederate statues |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/08/the-real-story-of-all-those-confederate-statues/ |accessdate=August 27, 2017|magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who object to the removals, like [[President Trump]], believe that the artifacts are part of the [[cultural heritage]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://time.com/4904510/donald-trump-twitter-confederate-statues/ |title=Trump: It's 'Sad' to See U.S. Culture 'Ripped Apart' by Removing Statues |last=Zorthian |first=Julia |website=Time |access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of these Confederate monuments were built during the era of [[Jim Crow laws]] (1877–1954) and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] (1954–1968). Detractors claim that they were not built as memorials but as a means of intimidating African Americans and reaffirming [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Why Were Confederate Monuments Built? : NPR |last=Parks |first=Miles |date=20 August 2017|publisher=[[NPR]] |language=English |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/718507/striking-graphic-reveals-construction-confederate-monuments-peaked-during-jim-crow-civil-rights-eras |title=Striking graphic reveals the construction of Confederate monuments peaked during the Jim Crow and civil rights eras |date=15 August 2017|publisher=[[The Week]] |language=English |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAHUpton&gt;[https://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sah-blog/sah-blog/2017/09/13/confederate-monuments-and-civic-values-in-the-wake-of-charlottesville Confederate Monuments and Civic Values in the Wake of Charlottesville]. [[Dell Upton]], [[Society of American Historians]], 13 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments have thus become highly politicized; according to Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and a scholar of Civil War history: "If [[white nationalist]]s and [[neo-Nazi]]s are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again".&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

In some Southern states, [[state law (United States)|state law]] restricts or prohibits altogether the removal or alteration of public Confederate monuments. According to Stan Deaton, senior historian at the [[Georgia Historical Society]], "These laws are the [[Old South]] imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more. This is what led to the Civil War, and it still divides us as a country. We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In the South, Confederate monuments often protected, hard to remove thanks to state laws |last1=Bliss |first1=Jessica |last2=Meyer |first2=Holly |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=August 17, 2017 |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/08/17/south-confederate-monuments-often-protected-hard-remove-state-laws/573226001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Confederate monuments concerned were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when [[Jim Crow laws]] were being introduced in the late 19th century and at the start of the 20th century or during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.{{efn|Graham (2016) "Many of the treasured monuments that seem to offer a connection to the ''post-bellum'' South are actually much later, anachronistic constructions, and they tend to correlate closely with periods of fraught racial relations".&lt;ref name="graham-theatlantic-2016"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/the-stubborn-persistence-of-confederate-monuments/479751/ |title=Why Are There Still So Many Confederate Monuments? |last=Graham |first=David A. |date=April 26, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |access-date=August 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|Graham (2016) "A timeline of the genesis of the Confederate sites shows two notable spikes.

According to historian Jane Dailey from [[University of Chicago]], in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "[[white supremacy in the United States|white supremacist]] future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future' |website=npr.org |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian, Karyn Cox, from the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/16/the-whole-point-of-confederate-monuments-is-to-celebrate-white-supremacy/ |title=Analysis – The whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy |first=Karen L. |last=Cox |date=August 16, 2017 |accessdate=September 23, 2017|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historian from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], James Leloudis, stated that "The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article167619947.html |title=Durham Confederate statue: tribute to dying veterans or political tool of Jim Crow South? |website=heraldsun.com |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at [[Washington College]], stated in ''National Geographic'': "They're 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people."&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

==Academic commentary==
In an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy, the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) said that to remove a monument "is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history." The AHA noted that most monuments were erected "without anything resembling a democratic process," and recommended that it was "time to reconsider these decisions." According to the AHA, most Confederate monuments were erected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and this undertaking was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South." According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life." A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."&lt;ref&gt;American Historical Association, [https://www.historians.org/news-and-advocacy/statements-and-resolutions-of-support-and-protest/aha-statement-on-confederate-monuments AHA Statement on Confederate Monuments] (August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Adam Goodheart, the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/16/regime-change-in-charlottesville-215500 |title=Regime Change in Charlottesville|author= |date= |website=politico.com |accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elijah Anderson]], a professor of sociology at Yale University, said the statues "really impacts the psyche of black people."&lt;ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish"/&gt; [[Harold Holzer]], the director of the [[Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College]], agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaperstoilas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stoilas |first1=Helen|last2=Stapley-Brown|first2=Victoria |title=Charlottesville riot hastens removal of Confederate monuments throughout the US |url=https://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/charlottesville-riot-hastens-removal-of-confederate-monuments-throughout-the-us/ |accessdate=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Art Newspaper |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dell Upton]], chair of the Department of Art History at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], wrote that "the monuments were not intended as public art," but rather were installed "as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity," and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent, their removal from civic spaces was a matter "of justice, equity, and civic values."&lt;ref name=SAHUpton/&gt; In a 1993 book, author Frank McKenney argued otherwise; "These monuments were communal efforts, public art, and social history," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;McKenney, Frank M., The Standing Army: History of Georgia's County Confederate Monuments, WH Wolfe Associates, Alpharetta, Georgia, 1993 p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;  Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women, the "mothers widows, and orphans, the bereaved fiancees and sisters" of the soldiers who had lost their lives.{{sfn|McKenney|1993|p=1}}  Many ladies' memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War, most of them joining the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] following its inception in 1894.  The women were advised to "remember that they were buying art, not metal and stone;"{{sfn|McKenney|1993|p=5}} The history the monuments celebrated told only one side of the story, however—one that was "openly pro-Confederate," Upton argues. Furthermore, Confederate monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.&lt;ref name=SAHUpton/&gt; According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at [[Villanova University]], "White supremacy is really what these statues represent."&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;[https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0822/Confederate-monuments-What-to-do-with-them Confederate monuments: What to do with them?].

Robert Seigler in his study of Confederate monuments in South Carolina found that out of the over one hundred and seventy that he documented, only five monuments were found dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy working "on fortifications, and had served as musicians, teamsters, cooks, servants, and in other capacities," four of those were to slaves and one to a musician, Henry Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Seigler, Robert S., A Guide to Confederate Monuments in South Carolina: Passing the Cup, South Carolina Department of Archives and History, 1997 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheryl Benard, president of the Alliance for the Restoration of Cultural Heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archinternational.org/team/|title=Team - ARCH International|work=ARCH International|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued against the removal of Confederate war monuments in an op-ed for the [[The National Interest|National Interest]], writing, "From my vantage point, the idea that the way to deal with history is to destroy any relics that remind you of something you don't like, is highly alarming."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/destroying-confederate-monuments-hurts-us-all%E2%80%94-accomplishes-22142|title=Destroying Confederate Monuments Hurts Us All—and Accomplishes Nothing|last=Benard|first=Cheryl|work=The National Interest|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard compares the removal to "historic cleansing" in other countries, stating "Tour the archaeological ruins of any formerly great civilization, and you will invariably encounter inscriptions that have been chiseled away, faces that have been obliterated, heads that have been struck off the rumps of their statues. Someone overthrows or assassinates a predecessor and orders his or her name and image removed. ... What could have remained is their story, and any lessons later humans might draw from it."&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

[[Eric Foner]], a historian of the Civil War and biographer of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], argued that more statues of African-Americans like [[Nat Turner]] should be constructed.&lt;ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Munshi |first1=Neil |title=Trump says it is 'foolish' to remove Confederate symbols |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e7496854-82a1-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff |accessdate=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Brophy]], a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues "facilitates forgetting", although these statues were "re-inscribed images of white supremacy".

Civil War historian [[James I. Robertson Jr.]] referred to the current climate to dismantle or destroy Confederate monuments as an "age of idiocy" and motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of Americans have painfully constructed" and the monuments were not a "Jim Crow signal of defiance."&lt;ref&gt;Speech of James I.

The removals were marked by events in Louisiana and Virginia within the span of two years. In Louisiana, after the [[Charleston church shooting]] of 2015, the city of New Orleans removed its Confederate memorials two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Darran |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/us/new-orleans-confederate-monuments/index.html |title=New Orleans removes Gen.

Other events followed across the United States. In Baltimore, for example, the city's Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15–16, 2017.

==Organizations encouraging monument removal==
* Following the [[Unite the Right rally]] of 2017, a Twitter account named "Destroy This Statue"(@destroystatue) has been posting pictures of all the Confederate monuments identified by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], with links to a map showing their locations and a suggestion that it's "time for a road trip".&lt;ref name=Manatee/&gt;
* The [[Make It Right Project]] was founded in 2018 to encourage removal of Confederate monuments.

==Destruction of monuments==
In North Carolina and Georgia, where removal of Confederate monuments is prohibited by law, frustrated protestors have destroyed three monuments as of October, 2018.
* In [[Durham, North Carolina]], several protesters toppled and severely damaged the [[Confederate Soldiers Monument (Durham, North Carolina)|Confederate Soldiers Monument]] outside the Old Durham County Courthouse on August 15, 2017.

The removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a 2/3 vote of both houses of the legislature, as would the removal of any other Confederate monument in South Carolina.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse |title=Confederate flag removed from South Carolina capitol in victory for activists |last=Holpuch |first=Amanda |date=2015-07-10 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2017-10-10 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate monuments are largely located in cities, which, like other American cities, in the twentieth century became more black and more liberal politically than the remainder of the states in which they are located.

In another legal impediment to removal, the Board of Trustees of the [[University of North Carolina]] prohibited for 16 years the renaming of any university memorials. This was triggered by the University's 2014 decision to rename Saunders Hall (see [[Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials#North Carolina|below]]).

==Public opinion==
A 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of American adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. The results were split along racial and political lines, with Republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, and Democrats and minorities preferring their removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-protests-poll/a-majority-of-americans-want-to-preserve-confederate-monuments-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1B12EG |title=A majority of Americans want to preserve Confederate monuments: Reuters/Ipsos poll |date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-confederate-monuments-2017-08-22 |title=Reuters/Ipsos Data: Confederate Monuments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2017 poll, by HuffPost/YouGov, found that 48% of respondents favored the "remain" option, 33% favored removal, and 18% were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/confederate-statues-removal-polls_us_599de056e4b05710aa59841c |title=Polls Find Little Support For Confederate Statue Removal -- But How You Ask Matters |first=Ariel |last=Edwards-Levy |date=August 23, 2017|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPConfederateFlag20170815.pdf |title=HuffPost: Confederate Flag, August 15 - 16, 2017 - 1000 US Adults|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What to do with the plinths (pedestals)==
In the case of many monuments, after they are removed the pedestals or plinths remain. What to do with them has been the subject of some discussion. In the case of the toppled ''Silent Sam'' monument at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, two scholars propose leaving the "empty pedestal — shorn all original images and inscriptions — [which] eliminates the offending tribute while still preserving a record of what these communities did and where they did it.... The most effective way to commemorate the rise and fall of white supremacist monument-building is to preserve unoccupied pedestals as the ruins that they are — broken tributes to a morally bankrupt cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ethan J. |last1=Kytle |first2=Blain |last2=Roberts |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 22, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/silent-sam-confederate-monument-north-carolina.html |title=Broken Tributes to a Morally Bankrupt Cause}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baltimore, one of the four empty plinths has been used, with eventual city tolerance though not approval, for a statue of a pregnant black woman, naked from the waist up, holding a baby in a brightly-covered sling on her back, with a raised golden fist: ''Madre Luz'' (''Mother Light''). The statue was first placed in front of the monument before its removal, then raised to the pedestal. According to the artist [[Pablo Machioli]], "his original idea was to construct a statue of [[Harriet Tubman]] throwing a brick, but he rejected that as too violent and chose instead a pregnant mother as a symbol of life. 'I feel like people would understand and respect that'". (The statue has been vandalized several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

[[File:Roadies.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Road crews''' ('''roadies''') working on the stage construction of a concert by ''[[Grace Potter]] and the Nocturnals'' at [[Portsmouth Pavilion|Telos Wireless Pavilion]]&lt;!-- , Portsmouth, Virginia, --&gt; in 2013]]

The '''road crew''' (or '''roadies''') are the [[technician]]s or support personnel who travel with a band on [[concert#Concert tour|tour]], usually in [[sleeper bus]]es, and handle every part of the [[concert production]]s except actually [[performance|performing]] the music with the musicians. This catch-all term covers many people: [[tour manager]]s, [[production management|production managers]], [[stage management|stage managers]], [[audio engineering|front of house and monitor engineers]], lighting directors, [[lighting designers]], [[lighting technician|lighting techs]], [[guitar technician|guitar techs]], [[guitar technician#Bass technician|bass techs]], drum techs, keyboard techs, [[pyrotechnic|pyrotechnicians]], security/[[bodyguard]]s, truck drivers, merchandise crew, and caterers, among others.

==Road crew appearances==
The road crew are generally uncredited, though many bands take care to thank their crew in album sleeve [[liner notes]]. In some cases, roadies have stepped in to help out with playing onstage.
*On June 12, 1993, while performing "[[Bullet in the Head (song)|Bullet in the Head]]" in [[Reykjavik, Iceland]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]] and bassist [[Tim Commerford]] switched out with their guitar and bass technicians, respectively.
*[[The Doobie Brothers]]' lighting roadie, [[Bobby LaKind]], eventually became a full member of the band. After observing LaKind goofing around on the congas after a concert, the band took notice of his talent and asked him to join as a sideman for studio sessions in 1976.  He became a full member in 1979 and performed as a vocalist, songwriter, percussionist and backup drummer for live shows.
*[[Pink Floyd]] listed theirs on the rear sleeve of ''[[Ummagumma]]'' and recorded them speaking on ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. A roadie also delivered the spoken part of the studio version of the song "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]", on the ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' album. They had also written a song called "[[Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast]]" about a roadie, appearing on their 1970 album ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''.
* [[Bruce Berry]] was a professional roadie for the members of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], both as a group and individually. He died of a heroin overdose on June 4, 1973 and is immortalized in the lyrics of the title track of the album ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' by [[Neil Young]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bruce Berry was a working man&lt;br/&gt; He used to load that Econoline van...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*[[Pantera]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Godsmack]] even go so far as to feature their crew in their tour videos, and [[Motörhead]] wrote the song "(We Are) The Road Crew" about their crew.
* Exceptionally, in the former [[Manu Chao]] band [[Mano Negra]], the roadies were included as a part of the band when they signed for Virgin.
*[[Todd Rundgren]] and [[Roger Powell (musician)|Roger Powell]] invited roadie Jan Michael Alejandro to play piano with them, [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Bill Wyman]] on a live broadcast of the [[Jerry Lewis Telethon]] in Las Vegas. It was viewed by 33 million people. He also worked the last [[Led Zeppelin]] concert in [[Knebworth 1979]], and he was one of the roadies that [[Jackson Browne]] wrote about on the Running on Empty Tour. Jan owns Jan-Al Cases with his partner Muffie Alejandro.
*[[Jackson Browne]] on his 1977 tour, "Running on Empty", wrote his famous song "[[The Load-Out]]" (usually heard in a live version hybrid with a cover of the [[Maurice Williams (singer)|Maurice Williams]] tune "[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]") in order to honor his roadies.
*[[Perry Bamonte]] was a long-serving guitar tech for [[The Cure]], before filling in on keyboards during the final leg of the Disintegration tour after [[Roger O'Donnell]]'s departure in 1991. He went on to play guitar and keyboards on four Cure albums, including major hit ''[[Wish (The Cure album)|Wish]]''.
* [[Coldplay]]'s video ''[[Life in Technicolor ii]]'' features roadie puppets four times: picking up the cymbal dropped by the drummer, operating the rope that widens the stage, moving a ramp onstage and operating the sound mixer.
* [[Tupac Shakur]] joined [[Digital Underground]] as a roadie, backup singer and dancer in 1990, and appeared with the band in the film [[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|''Nothing but Trouble'']] to begin his rapping career.
* [[U2]]'s "[[One Tree Hill (song)|One Tree Hill]]" on the album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' is dedicated to Greg Carroll, who was a [[stagehand]] in New Zealand. He joined [[The Unforgettable Fire]] tour, and after the tour he stayed in Ireland and became Bono's personal assistant.
* Stuart Morgan, [[Adam Clayton]]'s bass tech, filled in for the U2 bassist for a concert in Sydney in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u2faqs.com/live/#2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021106104804/http://www.u2faqs.com/live/#2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-11-06|title=U2: U2faqs.com - Live / Concert FAQ|author=Matt McGee, Aaron Sams|work=u2faqs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James Hetfield]] of [[Metallica]] has been—at least twice—temporarily replaced in his guitar duties by his roadie John Marshall during his various injuries (such as breaking his arm while skateboarding and after suffering severe burns after standing over a pyrotechnical device).
* [[Tenacious D]] wrote the song Roadie on their 2012 ''[[Rize of the Fenix]]'' album to pay homage to their road crew. A video for the song featured [[Danny McBride]] as a stereotypical, long hair, black leather wearing roadie who grew jealous of the band as he watched their success from the sidelines.
* Violinist [[Lindsey Stirling]] starts off her show by introducing every crew member. Moreover, she records videos of interactions within the tour crew and puts them on YouTube.
* A picture of [[The Allman Brothers Band]] roadies appears on the back cover of their ''[[At Fillmore East]]'' album.
* In 2015, [[Built to Spill]] roadies Jason Albertini and Stephen Gere became the bassist and drummer, respectively, on the album ''[[Untethered Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/12/398340526/first-listen-built-to-spill-untethered-moon|title=Review: Built To Spill, 'Untethered Moon'|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''San Giobbe Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala di San Giobbe'') is a c. 1487 [[oil painting]] by the Italian Renaissance master [[Giovanni Bellini]], now in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]].

==History==
This altarpiece is one of the masterworks of Bellini's mature period, and was painted for the second left altar of the church of [[San Giobbe]] in Venice. It was probably inspired by the [[San Cassiano Altarpiece]] by [[ Antonello da Messina]] (1475-1476), and absorbed and further developed that work's innovations. Yet, as the dating of Bellini's painting is uncertain, such dependency cannot be proved.
The work is among Bellini's most famous, a claim made as early as ''De Urbe Sito'', a description of Venice by [[Marco Antonio Sabellico]] (1487-1491).

[[File:Pala di san giobbe 06.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Detail of the musician angels.]]
The depiction of Saints [[Saint Sebastian| Sebastian]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] indicates that the painting might be created in connection with the plague probably that of 1987&lt;sup&gt;[correct date?]&lt;/sup&gt;. The dating of the work is disputed, ranging from the early 1470s to the late 1480s.  [[Jacopo Sansovino]] wrote in 1581 that the work for San Giobbe was Bellini's first using oil painting, which would imply an earlier date, nearer to Antonello's altarpiece. Yet, many scholars have disputed such claim.

The altarpiece remained in the church of San Giobbe until 1814-1818&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rugolo |first=Ruggero |language=fr|date= 2013|title= Venise - Où trouver Bellini, Carpaccio, Titen, Tintoret, Véronèse |url= |location= |publisher=Scala  |page= 12|isbn= 9788881173891|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
The work can be read as an example of [[Holy Conversation]]: Mary sits on a tall marble throne, holding the Child; at her feet are three musician angels, while at the side are, in symmetrical positions, six saints. They are, on the left, Sts. [[Francis of Assisi|Francis]], [[John the Baptist]] and Job; on the right, Sts. [[Saint Dominic|Dominic]], Sebastian and [[Louis of Toulouse]]. The child's feature are very similar to those in the [[Contarini Madonna]], also housed in the Accademia Gallery.

The upper part features a perspective coffered ceiling, flanked with pillars which are copies of the real ones at the original altar. Behind the Madonna is a dark niche. In the latter's half-dome is a gilt mosaic decoration in the Venetian style.

The '''Shpilman Institute for Photography''' (SIP) was an Israeli non profit organisation which promoted [[photography]] worldwide.

==History==
SIP was founded in 2010 Shalom Shpilman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts-leisure/the-engineer-who-put-together-a-startlingly-efficient-photograph-collection.premium-1.433168|title=The engineer who put together a startlingly efficient photograph collection|author=Daniel Rauchwerger|date=29 May 2012|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote [[photography]] as an art in [[Israel]] and worldwide. The institute, located in [[Tel Aviv]], hosts exhibitions, lectures and various artistic activities by people in the field of photography and media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artandeducation.net/client/shpilman_institute_for_pho/|title=Shpilman Institute for Photography|work=Art &amp; Education | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIP also provides ground and holds academic research. It offers grants and scholarships to projects, both locally in [[Israel]] and internationally. 

In addition to hosting temporary exhibitions, the SIP had a permanent collection with over 900 works, including photographs by [[Erwin Blumenfeld]], Frederick Sommer, Berenice Abbott, [[Arthur Siegel]], Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, [[Man Ray]], Cecil Beaton, Elliott Erwitt, [[Bill Brandt]], Andre Breton, [[Claude Cahun]], [[Salvador Dali]], Harry Callahan, Paul Heismann, [[Yasuhiro Ishimoto]], [[Adi Nes]], [[Jeff Wall]], [[Uri Gershuni]], [[Ilit Azulay]], [[Deganit Berest]], [[Eli Lotar]], [[Ohad Matalon]], [[Lee Miller]] and [[Michal Heiman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thesip.org/language/en/artist/millerbio-en/ | title=Miller Lee | access-date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of end 2016, Shpilman Institute of Photography ceased its activities and sold its permanent collection at [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]]. Fifty-five works from the collection were purchased by [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.2784326|title=Israel Museum purchased 55 works from Shpilman collection|work=Haaretz.com | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation site's latest update was at the end of 2014 and the institute premises were vacated at the beginning of 2015.

'''Statuette of a Woman''' from the 6th to 5th centuries BC, is a bronze statue discovered in [[Ayrum]], [[Armenia]]. It is included in the [[History Museum of Armenia]]'s collection under the number 2225-1.

== Description ==
The figure is a miniature cast figure of a nude woman standing on the platform corner, with long legs, high hair, a flat face, and a large, straight nose. The eyes and ears are pronounced by round dimples. On her neck, she has on a thick necklace. Extended in her left hand, there is a pear-shaped jug, her right elbow is bent holding a [[drinking horn]]. Figures with forms of female deities, make use of [[temple]]s for various ritual ceremonies. The nude female statuettes were linked with the ritual belief of fertility and incorporated with the goddess [[Anahit]], who as a mother-goddess was also included in the [[Battle]], fertility, and functions of the goddess of love, being the [[gardening]], wheat, and patron goddess of [[animal]]s.

'''''The Accolade''''' is a painting by [[British people|British]] artist [[Edmund Leighton]]. It is one of many paintings produced by Leighton in the 1900s on the subject of [[chivalry]], with others including ''[[God Speed (painting)|God Speed]]'' (1901) and ''[[The Dedication (painting)|The Dedication]]'' (1908). It has been described as among Leighton's best known works&lt;ref name="All Art Classics"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.allartclassic.com/pictures_zoom.php?p_number=80&amp;p=&amp;number=LEE003| title ="The Accolade" |publisher =[[All Art Classics]]| accessdate = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Renewal Center"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artist.php?artistid=844| title ="Edmund Blair Leighton" |publisher =[[Art Renewal Center]]|author=Kara Ross | accessdate = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most recognizable paintings of the period.&lt;ref name="Art Renewal Center"/&gt;

==Background==
There are many stories considering the origin of and inspiration for the painting, although none of them are confirmed. The painting depicts an [[accolade]], a ceremony to confer [[knighthood]]. Such ceremonies took many forms, including the tapping of the flat side of a sword on the shoulders of a candidate or an embrace about the neck. In the first example, the "knight-elect" kneels in front of the monarch on a knighting-stool. The monarch lays the side of the sword's blade onto the accolade's right shoulder. The monarch then raises the sword gently just up over the apprentice's head and places it on his left shoulder. The newly appointed knight arises, and the administrator presents him with the insignia of their knightly order. In the painting, the ceremony is performed by a young queen, the knight bowed before her feet in a position of submission and fealty. An audience is gathered on the Queen's left, serving as witnesses to the ceremony. 

==Reception==
All Art Classics describes ''Accolade'' as Leighton's best-known work&lt;ref name="All Art Classics"/&gt;  and Kara Ross, Director of Operations for the [[Art Renewal Center]], describes it as "the epitome of medieval iconography" and as one of Leighton's most famous works, which "are among the most widely recognized paintings of the period."&lt;ref name="Art Renewal Center"/&gt; [[Sotheby's]] catalogue describes it as one of "the most memorable" of his medieval subjects.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/british-irish-art-l14132/lot.211.html| title ="A King and a Beggar Maid" |publisher =[[Sotheby's]]| accessdate = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also notes that among this collection, "the two qualities which can always be found... are beautifully meticulous studied detail and a sensitive capturing of humanity".&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt;

The painting is present as a [[puzzle]], in the film ''[[Russian Dolls (film)|Russian Dolls]]'' (2005).

[[File:Mantiq al-Tayr, The Language of the Birds, Farid al-Din Attar.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Scene from ''The Conference of the Birds'' in a [[Persian miniature]]. The [[hoopoe]], center right, instructs the other birds on the [[Sufi]] path.]]

'''''The Conference of the Birds''''' or '''''Speech of the Birds''''' ({{lang-fa|منطق الطیر}}, ''Manṭiq-uṭ-Ṭayr'', also known as {{lang|fa|مقامات الطیور}} ''Maqāmāt-uṭ-Ṭuyūr''; 1177), is a celebrated literary masterpiece of Persian literature by poet [[Farid ud-Din Attar]], commonly known as Attar of Nishapur. The title, which is in Arabic, is taken directly from the [[Qur'an|Qur’an]], [https://quran.com/27/16 27:16], where [[Solomon in Islam|Sulayman]] ([[Solomon]]) and [[David in Islam|Dāwūd]] ([[David]]) are said to have been taught the language, or speech, of the birds (''manṭiq al-ṭayr'').

==Synopsis==
In the poem, the birds of the world gather to decide who is to be their sovereign, as they have none. The [[hoopoe]], the wisest of them all, suggests that they should find the legendary [[Simorgh]]. The hoopoe leads the birds, each of whom represents a human fault which prevents human kind from attaining enlightenment.

The hoopoe tells the birds that they have to cross seven valleys in order to reach the abode of Simorgh. These valleys are as follows:.&lt;ref&gt;quoted from ''The Conference of the Birds'' by Attar, edited and translated by [[Sholeh Wolpé]], W. W. Norton &amp; Co 2017 {{ISBN|978-0-393-29218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''1.	Valley of the Quest, where the Wayfarer begins by casting aside all dogma, belief, and unbelief.
:''2.	Valley of Love, where reason is abandoned for the sake of love.
:''3.	Valley of Knowledge, where worldly knowledge becomes utterly useless.
:''4.	Valley of Detachment, where all desires and attachments to the world are given up. Here, what is assumed to be “reality” vanishes.
:''5.	Valley of Unity, where the Wayfarer realizes that everything is connected and that the Beloved is beyond everything, including harmony, multiplicity, and eternity.
:''6.	Valley of Wonderment, where, entranced by the beauty of the Beloved, the Wayfarer becomes perplexed and, steeped in awe, finds that he or she has never known or understood anything.
:''7.	Valley of Poverty and Annihilation, where the self disappears into the universe and the Wayfarer becomes timeless, existing in both the past and the future.&lt;ref&gt;quoted from ''The Conference of the Birds'' by Attar, edited and translated by [[Sholeh Wolpé]], W. W. Norton &amp; Co 2017 {{ISBN|978-0-393-29218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When the birds hear the description of these valleys, they bow their heads in distress; some even die of fright right then and there. But despite their trepidations, they begin the great journey. On the way, many perish of thirst, heat or illness, while others fall prey to wild beasts, panic, and violence. Finally, only thirty birds make it to the abode of Simorgh. In the end, the birds learn that they themselves are the Simorgh; the name “Simorgh” in Persian means thirty (si) birds (morgh). They eventually come to understand that the majesty of that Beloved is like the sun that can be seen reflected in a mirror. Yet, whoever looks into that mirror will also behold his or her own image."&lt;ref&gt;quoted from ''The Conference of the Birds'' by Attar, p17-18, edited and translated by [[Sholeh Wolpé]], W. W. Norton &amp; Co 2017 {{ISBN|978-0-393-29218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
:''If Simorgh unveils its face to you, you will find 
:''that all the birds, be they thirty or forty or more,
:''are but the shadows cast by that unveiling.
:''What shadow is ever separated from its maker? 
:''Do you see?
:''The shadow and its maker are one and the same, 
:''so get over surfaces and delve into mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;quoted from ''The Conference of the Birds'' by Attar, translated by [[Sholeh Wolpé]], W. W. Norton &amp; Co 2017 {{ISBN|978-0-393-29218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attar's masterful use of symbolism is a key, driving component of the poem. This adroit handling of symbolisms and allusions can be seen reflected in these lines:

It was in China, late one moonless night,
The Simorgh first appeared to mortal sight –
Beside the symbolic use of the Simorgh, the allusion to China is also very significant. According to [[Idries Shah]], China as used here, is not the geographical China, but the symbol of mystic experience, as inferred from the Hadith (declared weak by Ibn Adee, but still used symbolically by some Sufis): "Seek knowledge; even as far as China".[5] There are many more examples of such subtle symbols and allusions throughout the Mantiq.
Within the larger context of the story of the journey of the birds, Attar masterfully tells the reader many didactic short, sweet stories in captivating poetic style. 

[[Sholeh Wolpé]], in the foreword of her modern translation of this work writes:
"The parables in this book trigger memories deep within us all. The stories inhabit the imagination, and slowly over time, their wisdom trickles down into the heart. The process of absorption is unique to every individual, as is each person’s journey.  We are the birds in the story. All of us have our own ideas and ideals, our own fears and anxieties, as we hold on to our own version of the truth. Like the birds of this story, we may take flight together, but the journey itself will be different for each of us. Attar tells us that truth is not static, and that we each tread a path according to our own capacity. It evolves as we evolve. Those who are trapped within their own dogma, clinging to hardened beliefs or faith, are deprived of the journey toward the unfathomable Divine, which Attar calls the Great Ocean." .&lt;ref&gt;quoted from ''The Conference of the Birds'' by Attar, translated by [[Sholeh Wolpé]], W. W. Norton &amp; Co 2017 {{ISBN|978-0-393-29218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is meant to be not only instructive but also entertaining.

==''La Conférence des oiseaux''==
[[Peter Brook]] and [[Jean-Claude Carrière]] adapted the poem into a play titled ''La Conférence des oiseaux'' (''The Conference of the Birds''), which they published in 1979. Brook toured the play around rural Africa before presenting two extremely successful productions to Western audiences&amp;mdash;one in [[New York City]] at [[La MaMa E.T.C.]] and one in [[Paris]]. [[John Heilpern]] gives an account of the events surrounding these performances in his 1977 book ''[[Conference of the Birds: The Story of Peter Brook in Africa]]''.

'''''The Four Elements''''' is a series of paintings by Italian artist [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] in 1566 during the [[Renaissance]]. They were commissioned by [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The portraits display figures in profile formed by different animals or objects. ''Earth'' is represented by land animals, ''Air'' by birds, ''Water'' by marine creatures and ''Fire'' by burning wood and cannons. This series attempts to express harmony out of chaos with wild animals forming distinct faces. It also praises Maximilian, suggesting that he is a ruler who controls even the four primal elements. 

[[File:ArcimboldoFourElements.jpg|1000px]]

==Historical Background==
After training in Milan, Arcimboldo moved to Vienna and became the court painter for the Habsburgs. Giuseppe gained knowledge of exotic and local animals because at the time Prague was a cultural center. Exotic creatures such as the lion and elephant came from all over the world.

==Description==
''Air'' displays a cornucopia of small birds that combine to create a slender male face. The majority of the birds are only partially visible which allow the artist to create the face and hair. The body is formed by a [[peacock]]; the goatee is a tail of a [[pheasant]], and a [[duck]] forms the eyelids. The [[eagle]] and peacock are references to the Habsburg dynasty. Giuseppe included this reference to please his patrons and form a permanent bond between the painting and the Habsburgs.

Unlike the others, ''Fire'' is formed from inanimate objects. ''Flint'' and ''steel'' form the nose and ear. Burning wood creates a crown of glowing hair. Arcimboldo uses guns to create the main part of the body. ''Fire'' has the most references to the Habsburg dynasty. The [[golden fleece]] hangs in front of the body, which is a reference to the most important knightly orders time. The double headed eagle, a symbol of the Holy Roman Empire, sits proudly on the torso. The two large cannons refer to the strength of the Habsburg armies in their ongoing war with the Turks.

''Earth'' is perhaps the most skilfully blended piece the land animals curving together to create a strong, thick face. Antlered creatures surround the head, forming a crown. An [[elephant]] creates the cheek and ear while a [[wolf]] eating a [[mouse]] forms the eyelid and pupil. A full [[cow]] represents the neck. Like its siblings, the lion and the fleece are references to the Habsburg dynasty.

''Water'' features the most realistic depictions. A chaotic mess of sea creatures create a woman's face. Her breast plate is a [[crab]], [[turtle]] and [[lobster]] along with an [[octopus]] on her shoulder. The animals that make up her head are obscure but a clear crown is formed by the spines on the back of a fish and long pieces of [[coral]]. Almost seeming out of place, a [[pearl]] necklace lies across her neck framing her face and completing the pattern of order from confusion. She also wears a pearl earring.

This series matched another of Arcimboldo’s sets called ''[[The Four Seasons (Arcimboldo)|The Four Seasons]]''. They have the same number of pieces, and correspond to each other. ''Air'' goes with ''Spring'', fire with ''Summer'', ''Earth'' with ''Autumn'' and ''Water'' with ''Winter''. This creates linked themes of chaos brought into harmony and the glorification of the Habsburg dynasty.

'''''The Wheat Field''''' is a series of oil paintings executed by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]. All of them depict the view Van Gogh had from the window of his bedroom on the top floor of the asylum: a field enclosed by stone walls just beneath his window and excluded from normal life by the rear wall of the asylum grounds; beyond this enclosure farm land, accompanied by olive groves and vineyards, ran up to the hills at the foot of the mountain range called [[Alpilles|Les Alpilles]].

From May 1889 to May 1890, Van Gogh recorded this view in changing settings: after a storm, with a reaper in the field, with fresh wheat raising in autumn and with flowers in the spring. This is one of Van Gogh's major series from Saint-Rémy, comprising wonderful works such as the ''Wheat Field at Sunrise'' in the Kröller-Müller Museum.  Van Gogh included the ''Enclosed Field with Rising Sun'' (F737) made in December 1889 in his [[The Display at Les XX 1890|Display at Les XX 1890]] in Brussels.

Van Gogh worked on a group of paintings "The Wheat Field" that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital.  From the studio room he could see a field of wheat, enclosed by a wall.  Beyond that were the mountains from Arles.  During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains.&lt;ref name="PMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/82820.html?mulR=32251%7c1 |title=Rain |year=2011 |work=Collections |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, "Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=104 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.&lt;ref name="Fell40"/&gt;

==Spring and summer, 1889==
The [[Kröller-Müller Museum]]'s ''Enclosed Wheat Field with Rising Sun'' was painted in May 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20106.596/Enclosed-wheat-field-with-rising-sun |title=Enclosed Wheat Field with Rising Sun  |year= |work=Collection |publisher=[[Kröller-Müller Museum]] |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh used the rising sun above fields of wheat to represent its life giving energy.&lt;ref name="Fell40"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Gardens | author=Fell, D | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location=United Kingdom | year=2001 | page=40 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Green Wheat Field'' was painted in June 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/179/Green-Wheat-Field.html |title=Green Wheat Field |year=2011 |work=Saint-Rémy |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh had a tender feeling about green wheat, likening it to that of a baby:  "Young wheat has something inexpressibly pure and tender about it, which awakens the same emotion as the expression of a sleeping baby."  Towards the end of his life he regarded his most delicate works, a young wheat field with the rising sun or a blooming orchard, as his "babies."&lt;ref name="Lubin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stranger on the Earth: A Psychological Biography of Vincent van Gogh | author=Lubin, A | publisher=De Capo Press | location=United States | year=1996 | origyear=1972 | page=17 | isbn=0-306-80726-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHVwceHVI5cC&amp;pg=PR17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh describes ''Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Rémy,'' also made in June, as a view taken in the hills seen from his bedroom window: "In the foreground, a field of wheat ruined and hurled to the ground by a storm. A boundary wall and beyond the grey foliage of a few olive trees, some huts and the hills. Then at the top of the canvas a great white and grey cloud floating in the azure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/594.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, c. 9 June 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June Van Gogh painted ''Wheat Field with Reaper and Sun''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20101.173/Wheat-field-with-reaper-and-sun |title=Wheat Field with Reaper and Sun | year= | work=Collection |publisher=Kröller-Müller Museum | accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he described as "a wheat field, very yellow and very light, perhaps the lightest canvas I have done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/596.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 25 June 1889  | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July he painted Kröller-Müller Museum's ''Landscape with Wheat Sheaves and Rising Moon''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20107.656/Landscape-with-wheat-sheaves-and-rising-moon |title=Landscape with Wheat Sheaves and Rising Moon |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Kröller-Müller Museum |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he describes as "a moonrise over the same field as the sketch in Gauguin's letter, but in it some stacks take the place of the wheat. It is dull yellow-ochre and violet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/603.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 6 July 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enclosed Field with Ploughman'' was made in August 1889, which is held in a private collection (F625).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/108/Enclosed-Field-with-Ploughman.html |title=Enclosed Field with Ploughman |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two complementary fall paintings==

The ''Wheat Field with a Reaper'' was started in the summer before a bout of illness and completed in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/604.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 5 or 6 September 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here Van Gogh depicts a reaper in a sun-drenched wheat field. Referring to a Biblical metaphor, Van Gogh wrote of the meaning of this painting, "In this reaper – a vague figure laboring like the devil in the terrible heat to finish his task – I saw an image of death, in the sense that the wheat being reaped represented mankind... But there is nothing sad in this death, it takes place in broad daylight, under a sun that bathes everything in a fine, golden light."&lt;ref name="VGM WF with Reaper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2935&amp;lang=en |title=Wheat Field with Reaper |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enclosed Field with Peasant'' was painted over several days in October, working just outside the hospital. It accurately reflects the topography of the walled wheat field with the peaks of the Alpilles in the background.  Van Gogh's brushwork brings life to this picture of furrowed soil and craggy mountains.  At the center, a peasant carries a bundle of straw, a symbol of the cycles of life.  Van Gogh described this painting as a pendant to ''The Reaper'', which resides at the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], both in vivid complementary colors of yellow and blue-violet.&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-saint-r%C3%A9my-enclosed-field-peasant-gogh-vincent-van |title=Landscape at Saint-Rémy (Enclosed Field with Peasant) |year=2010 |work=Collection |publisher= |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both he considers harsh studies, but instead of being almost entirely yellow like ''The Reaper'', the "picture is almost entirely violet. Broken violet and neutral tints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/610.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, c. 8 October 1889  | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall and winter, 1889==

In September Van Gogh worked on ''Wheat Field behind Saint-Paul Hospital with a Reaper.'' Intending to paint a pure sulfur yellow, he wrote to [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] that he had taken up the "devil of a question of yellow".  He explained to his brother Theo, "I see in this reaper – an undefined figure, struggling in the intense heat like the devil to finish his work – I see him as an image of death in the sense that the humans are the corn that is being cut down. So it is, if you will, the opposite of the sowing that I tried earlier. But this death is not sad, it takes place in bright light with a sun that covers everything with a light like pure gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collection-online.museum-folkwang.de/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultLightboxView/result.t1.collection_lightbox.$TspTitleImageLink.link&amp;sp=10&amp;sp=Scollection&amp;sp=SfieldValue&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=3&amp;sp=Slightbox_4x5&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=Sdetail&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=F&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=5 |title=Wheat Field behind Saint-Paul Hospital with a Reaper |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Museum Folkwang |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rain'' also called ''Enclosed Wheat Field in the Rain'' is unique to Van Gogh's work in the South. He represented falling rain by diagonal lines of paint.  The style is reminiscent of Japanese prints, but the effect is stylistically personal to Van Gogh.&lt;ref name="PMA"/&gt;

In December Van Gogh made ''Wheat Field with a Rising Sun,'' held in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/109/Enclosed-Field-with-Rising-Sun.html |title=Enclosed Field with a Rising Sun |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work, started in late November, shows a sunrise above a field of young wheat in the complementary colors of yellow-green and purple.  Deep furrows run towards the enclosed wall behind which is a row of purple hills. The sun is surrounded by a large yellow halo.  Van Gogh sough to "express calmness, great peace."  Further, he expresses "without making direct reference to the actual [[Christ's Agony at Gethsemane|Gethsemane]]... and there is no need to portray figures from the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in order to express a comforting and gentle motif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/B21.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Emile Bernard, Saint-Rémy, c. 20 November 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the six canvases he selected for the exhibit at Les Vingt [XX] in Brussels in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Vincent van Gogh: Between Earth and Heaven: The Landscapes  |author1=van Gogh, V |author2=Blotkamp, C |author-link2=Carel Blotkamp |author3=Zimmer, N | year=2009 | page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The ''Wheat Field with Cypresses'' paintings were made when Van Gogh was able to leave the asylum. Van Gogh had a fondness for cypresses and wheat fields of which he wrote: "Only I have no news to tell you, for the days are all the same, I have no ideas, except to think that a field of wheat or a cypress well worth the trouble of looking at closeup."&lt;ref name="Edwards102"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=102 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo of a work he began in June, ''[[Wheat Field with Cypresses]]'': "I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of [[Scotch plaid]]; the former painted with a thick impasto . . . and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too." Van Gogh who regarded this landscape as one of his "best" summer paintings made two additional oil paintings very similar in composition that fall.  One of the two is in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/wheat_field_with_cypresses_vincent_van_gogh/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110000977 |title=Wheat Field with Cypresses |year=2000–2011 |work= |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janson describes: "the field is like a stormy sea; the trees spring flamelike from the ground; and the hills and clouds heave with the same surge of motion.  Every stroke stands out boldly in a long ribbon of strong, unmixed color."&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Basic History of Art | author=H. W. Janson | publisher=Harry N.

Van Gogh describes the ripening ''Green Wheat Field with Cypresses'' painted in June: "a field of wheat turning yellow, surrounded by blackberry bushes and green shrubs. At the end of the field there is a little house with a tall somber cypress which stands out against the far-off hills with their violet-like and bluish tones, and against a sky the color of forget-me-nots with pink streaks, whose pure hues form a contrast with the scorched ears, which are already heavy, and have the warm tones of a bread crust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/W12.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Wilhelmina van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 16 June 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Warrior of Capestrano''''' is a tall [[limestone]] statue of a [[Picentes|Picene]] warrior, dated to around the 6th century BC. The statue stands at around 2.09 m. It was discovered accidentally in 1934 by a labourer ploughing the field in the Italian town of [[Capestrano]], along with a female statue in civilian attire, called ''Lady of Capestrano''.&lt;ref name="Basile"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.academia.edu/959298/The_Capestrano_Warrior_and_Related_Monuments_of_the_Seventh_to_Fifth_Centuries_B.C| title =The Capestrano Warrior and Related Monuments of the Seventh to Fifth Centuries B.C. |author=Joe Basile|website=Revue des archéologues et historiens d’art de Louvain|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|date=1993| accessdate =30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''The Warrior'' statue has traces of pink paint, and features a warrior wearing a hat with a huge brim, and a disk-type armor (''[[kardiophylax]]'') protecting his chest and back,&lt;ref name="Basile"/&gt; a wide belt, necklace, and armlets. Additionally, the warrior bears a short sword, knife, axe, and a defensive device known to the Greeks as ''mitra'' (a short apron covering the back).

A [[South Picene language|South Picene]] inscription incised on the pillar standing to the right of the warrior reads: "''Makupri koram opsút aninis rakinevíi pomp[úne]í''" ("Aninis had this statue made most excellently for Rakinewis, the Pomp[onian]").{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Investigation subsequent to the statue's discovery revealed that the vineyard where the statue was found was situated above an [[Iron Age]] cemetery.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
