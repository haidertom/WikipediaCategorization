'''''Atlas Shrugged Part III: Who Is John Galt?''''' is a 2014 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[drama film]] based on [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. It is the third installment in the [[Atlas Shrugged (film series)|''Atlas Shrugged'' film series]] and the [[sequel]] to the 2012 film ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part II]]'', continuing the story where its predecessor left off.

==Plot==
The owner of the 20th-century Motor Company has died and his children have taken over, with a new plan to operate the company: that everyone work as hard as he can, but that salaries be [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|"based on need"]]. A lab [[Mechanical engineering|engineer]] named [[John Galt]] objects and announces, "I'll stop the motor of the world."

Twelve years later, the [[economy of the United States]] spirals downward. Shortages have grounded airlines and returned the railroads to dominance; over-regulation has led to financial disaster. Galt seems to be behind the disappearances of corporate executives and other experts. The latest disappearance is that of Dagny Taggart, the executive officer of the largest railroad company, Taggart Transcontinental. She had chased Galt in a private plane and crashed hers.

Dagny has reached Galt's Gulch, and Galt himself rescues her from the crashed plane. She meets several "disappeared" achievers, such as banker Midas Mulligan, who say they quit after coming to believe that government was enslaving them. On the outside, government develops a classified new weapon called "Project F" and [[Nationalization|nationalizes]] the railroads, including Taggart Transcontinental.

The public grows increasingly frustrated with the [[Economic planning|central planning]], comes to view Galt as the solution, and holds rallies calling for him to reform the [[Federal government of the United States|government]]. Thompson, the Head of State,&lt;ref&gt;Rand deliberately avoided referring to the American "President" so that her novel not be taken as commentary on specific Presidents.&lt;/ref&gt; offers Galt a job in the government, but Galt rebuffs the offer. Later, the government tortures Galt using the power of "Project F". However, others from the gulch arrive to free him and they escape back to their refuge.

==Production==

===Development===
In an interview with Bill Frezza of ''[[Forbes]],'' the producer [[John Aglialoro]] mentioned that the film would include a short dialogue between the heroine [[Dagny Taggart]] and a priest, a character which he said Rand struggled with and ultimately cut out of the original book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Frezza |title=Atlas Shrugged Producer Shares Insights And A Surprise That Awaits In Atlas III |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrezza/2013/02/06/atlas-shrugged-producer-shares-insights-and-a-surprse-that-awaits-in-atlas-iii/ |date=February 6, 2013 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scene did not appear in the final cut.

A month prior to the release of [[Atlas Shrugged: Part I|Part I]], Aglialoro suggested that Part III might be made into a [[Musical film|musical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TheDC Exclusive: Producer of 'Atlas Shrugged' movie says part three of trilogy could be a musical |url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/03/03/thedc-exclusive-producer-of-atlas-shrugged-movie-says-part-three-of-trilogy-could-be-a-musical/ |date=March 3, 2011 |publisher=Daily Caller |accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he promised to create "something closer to the book," and predicted that critics would pan the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ayn Rand's 'Atlas' shrugs for third time |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/atlas-shrugs-forthe-third-time-88775.html |date=March 12, 2013 |publisher=Politico |accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[YouTube]] promotional piece where organizers discussed the film, he asserted that it was vital for the team to have a director who is professional, collaborative, and knows Rand's work: "I don't care if I've got to fire five directors — that's fine. We're going to get it right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube promo |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9oWW3yHuAQ |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was directed by J. James Manera, whose experience included directing a documentary in 2010 and a 1996 episode of the television show ''[[Nash Bridges]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Manera - IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2690726/ |accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cinematographer was [[Gale Tattersall]].

===Writing===
[[David Kelley]], founder of [[The Atlas Society]] and an expert on the philosophical themes of ''Atlas Shrugged'', consulted on the script, as he did for Parts I and II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlas Shrugged Part 3 Greenlit; Photography Begins Fall 2013 |url=http://atlassociety.org/atlas-shrugged/movie-and-news/5545-atlas-shrugged-part-3-greenlit-photography-begins-fall-2013 |publisher=[[The Atlas Society]] |access-date=October 21, 2016 |date=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
As with the second part, a new set of actors was cast to play the major characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=IMDB|title=Atlas Shrugged III: Who is John Galt|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2800038/|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Congressman and Presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]], and network commentators [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Sean Hannity]], played themselves giving responses to John Galt's speech.&lt;ref name="av140619"&gt;{{cite news |first=Todd |last=VanDerWerff |work=[[The A.V.

===Filming===
The trade press reported that filming began in January 2014,&lt;ref name=HollRep /&gt; after the film posted on [[Facebook]] that its target start date was Autumn 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlas Shrugged Part 3 Heads Into Production (Press Release) |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/AtlasShrugged/Part3Greenlit/prweb10568410.htm |publisher=PRWeb |accessdate=March 27, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FQi4qVlj?url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/AtlasShrugged/Part3Greenlit/prweb10568410.htm |archivedate=March 27, 2013 |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=March 26, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget was partially funded by a [[Kickstarter]] campaign that raised $446,907 against a goal of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeSapio|first=Scott|title=ATLAS SHRUGGED Movie "Who is John Galt?"|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/atlasshrugged/atlas-shrugged-movie-who-is-john-galt|work=Kickstarter|publisher=Kickstarter, Inc.|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The film was universally panned, and is one of the few films to hold a 0% at review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 10 reviews for an average rating of 1.4/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt - Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_shrugged_who_is_john_galt|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 9/100 rating based on 7 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/atlas-shrugged-iii-who-is-john-galt | title=Atlas Shrugged: Part III - Who Is John Galt? | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Scherstuhl of the [[Village Voice]] wrote: "Rand's parable is meant to showcase just how much our world needs the best of us, but this adaptation only does so accidentally – by revealing what movies would be like if none of the best of us worked on them."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/film/atlas-shrugged-who-is-john-galt-has-the-years-funniest-sex-scene-6444302&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[Austin Chronicle]], Louis Black said "In 1949, when Warner Bros. filmed The Fountainhead, Rand threatened to burn down the studio if they compromised her novel. I'd like to think that if she were alive she'd be looking for lighter fluid for this one."&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt;

''Atlas Shrugged: Part III'' was nominated for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel at the [[35th Golden Raspberry Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.razzies.com/history/2015/2015-noms-remake.html | title=The 35th Annual Golden Raspberry (RAZZIE®) Awards Nominees for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel 2014 | accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernardo Gómez Martinez''' (born 1968) is the executive vice president of [[Grupo Televisa]] and [[Emilio Azcárraga Jean]]’s closest and most important adviser. Overseeing the news department, he has full authority in overall content, newscasts, political satire, and anchors; vice president of news Leopoldo Gomez reports to him. Mr. Gómez Martinez is also in charge of government relations. He handles affairs with the legislative branch, and has been Televisa’s only liaison with the past two presidential campaigns, successfully securing the company’s interests.

Until recently, Gómez was president of the Mexican National Chamber of Radio and Television Industry, where he headed the repeal of several regulations enacted during the '60s that restricted the liberty of electronic media. He is a highly regarded intellectual and political analyst among Mexico’s business elite. His close bond with Azcárraga, his closest friend, goes back to childhood; and although Azcarraga's father didn't approve of their relationship, as soon as he died, Emilio Jr. brought him into the company, where he has surpassed expectations.

Within Televisa, he works closely with [[Alejandro Quintero]], a board member and group vice president of sales.

'''Blairo Borges Maggi''' (born 29 May 1956) is a  Brazilian [[billionaire]] businessman, and former [[governor]] of the state of [[Mato Grosso]]. 

Maggi owns the [[Amaggi Group]], a large company that harvests, processes, and exports soybeans, and owns soy terminals, highways, and waterways.

==Early life==
Blairo Borges Maggi was born in [[São Miguel do Iguaçu]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Brazil, the son of [[Andre Maggi]], founder of the [[Amaggi Group]]. He graduated from [[Federal University of Paraná]], majoring in [[agronomy]].

==Career==
Maggi is the world's largest soybean producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8099007 | title = The Economist | date=30 October 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His accusers hold him responsible for the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. His defenders say he is taking Brazil forward. In this respect he is unapologetic, telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohter|first1=Larry|title=Relentless Foe of the Amazon Jungle: Soybeans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/17/world/relentless-foe-of-the-amazon-jungle-soybeans.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"To me, a 40 percent increase in deforestation doesn't mean anything at all, and I don't feel the slightest guilt over what we are doing here [...] We're talking about an area larger than Europe that has barely been touched, so there is nothing at all to get worried about".

Maggi received the Golden Chainsaw Award in 2006 from [[Greenpeace]] for being the Brazilian who most contributed to the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Soya King' wins Golden Chainsaw award|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/soya-king-wins-chainsaw/|website=Greenpeace International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Maggi's net worth was estimated by ''[[Forbes]]'' at US$1.2 billion, based on his 16% stake in Grupo Andre Maggi.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forbes profile: Blairo Maggi |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/blairo-maggi/ |website=Forbes |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradise Papers ==

{{See also|Paradise Papers}}In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|International Consortium of Investigative Journalism]] cited his name in [[List of people and organisations named in the Paradise Papers|the list of politicians named in]] "[[Paradise Papers]]" allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=Explore The Politicians in the Paradise Papers - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical engineering''' is a speciality within HTM (Healthcare Technology Management) [[biomedical engineering]] responsible primarily for applying and implementing medical technology to optimize healthcare delivery. Roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs)]], working with governmental regulators on hospital inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (i.e. physicians, administrators, IT, etc.). {{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}Clinical engineers also advise medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state-of-the-art in order to redirect hospital procurement patterns accordingly.

Their inherent focus on ''practical'' implementation of technology has tended to keep them oriented more towards ''incremental''-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to ''revolutionary'' R&amp;D or cutting-edge ideas that would be many years from clinical adoptability; however, there is an effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a sort of "bridge" between product originators and end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both close to the point-of-use, while also trained in product and process design. Clinical engineering departments at large hospitals will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also IT, industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research, human factors, cost analyses, safety, etc.

==History==
While some trace its roots back to the 1940s, the actual term ''clinical engineering'' was first used in 1969. The first explicit published reference to the term appears in a paper published in 1969 by Landoll and Caceres.&lt;ref&gt;Landoll JR and Caceres CA, Automation of Data Acquisition in Patient Testing, Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 57, No. 11, November 1969, 1941-1953&lt;/ref&gt; Cesar A. Caceres, a cardiologist, is generally credited with coining the term ''clinical engineering''.  Of course, the broader field of biomedical engineering has a relatively recent history as well. The first modern professional intersociety engineering meeting to be focused on the application of engineering in medicine was probably held in 1948, according to the Alliance for Engineering in Medicine and Biology.&lt;ref&gt;Zambuto RP, Clinical Engineers in the 21st Century, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, May/June 2005, 37-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The general notion of the application of engineering to medicine can be traced back centuries; for example, [[Stephen Hales]]'s work in the early 18th century which led to the invention of a ventilator and the discovery of blood pressure certainly involved the application of engineering techniques to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright FF, A Short History of Blood Pressure Measurement, Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, Volume 70, November 1977, 793-799&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent history of this sub-discipline is somewhat erratic. In the early 1970s, clinical engineering was thought to be a field that would require many new professionals. Estimates for the US ranged as high as 5,000 to 8,000 clinical engineers, or five to ten clinical engineers for every 250,000 of population, or one clinical engineer per 250 hospital beds.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer MJ, Clinical Engineering: An In-Depth Review of Its Economic Potential, Medical Care, July 1977, Vol. XV, No. 7, 552-567&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of its formal credentialization and accreditation procedures has also been somewhat unstable. The International Certification Commission for Clinical Engineers (ICC) was formed under the sponsorship of the [[Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation]] (AAMI) in the early 1970s, to provide a formal certification process for clinical engineers. A similar certification program was formed by academic institutions offering graduate degrees in clinical engineering as the American Board of Clinical Engineering (ABCE). In 1979, the ABCE agreed to dissolve, and those certified under its program were accepted into the ICC certification program. By 1985, only 350 clinical engineers had become certified.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer MJ, Clinical Engineer Cost-Effectiveness Measurements in the USA, Medical and Biological Engineering &amp; Computing, November 1985, 505-510&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1999, the AAMI after lengthy deliberation, and analysis of a 1998 survey demonstrating that there was not a viable market for its certification program decided to suspend that program, no longer accepting any new applicants as of July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aami.org/certification/cce.1299.mins.html Minutes and Report of USCC Task Force on Certification Clinical Engineering Conference Call December 2, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710164058/http://www.aami.org/certification/cce.1299.mins.html |date=July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new, current clinical engineering certification (CCE) program was started in 2002 under the sponsorship of the American College of Clinical Engineering (ACCE), and is administered by the ACCE Healthcare Technology Foundation. In 2004, the first year that the certification process was actually underway, 112 individuals were granted certification based upon their previous ICC certification, and three individuals were awarded the new certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acce-htf.org/documents/2004-2005_Progress_Report.pdf|title=ACCE Healthcare Technology Foundation 2004/2005 Progress Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the publication of the 2006-2007 AHTF Annual Report (c. June 30, 2007), a total of 147 individuals were included in the ranks of HTF certified clinical engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acce-htf.org/documents/HTF-006_Annual_Report_Mech-b.pdf|title=ACCE Healthcare Technology Foundation 2006/2007 Progress Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New name for the profession==
In 2011, AAMI arranged a meeting to discuss a new name for clinical engineering and/or [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|biomedical equipment technology]].  After careful debate, the vast majority decided on "Healthcare Technology Management".  Due partly to common confusion about the line between clinical engineers (engineers) and BMETs (technicians), the word ''engineering'' was deemed limiting from the administrator's perspective and unworkable from the educator's perspective.  (An ABET-accredited college could not name an associate degree program "engineering".)  Also, the adjective ''clinical'' limited the scope to hospitals.  It remains unresolved how widely or officially accepted this change is or will be, and how this will affect Clinical Engineering Certification (CCE) or the formal recognition of clinical engineering as a subset of [[biomedical engineering]]. For [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|regulatory and licensure reasons]] true engineering specialities must be definable in a way that distinguishes them from technicians with whom they work.

==Definition==
A clinical engineer is defined by the ACCE as "a professional who supports and advances patient care by applying engineering and managerial skills to healthcare technology."&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.accenet.org The American College of Clinical Engineering].&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition was first adopted by the ACCE Board of Directors on May 13, 1991.  Clinical engineering is also recognized by the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), the major professional organization for biomedical engineering, as being a branch within biomedical engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310113903/http://www.bmes.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=71344&amp;orgId=bes|title=About BME|date=10 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least two issues with the ACCE definition that cause some confusion. First, it is phrased so broadly that it's not readily evident that "clinical engineer" is a subset of "biomedical engineer". Many times the terms are used interchangeably: some hospitals refer to their relevant departments as "Clinical Engineering" departments, while others call them "Biomedical Engineering" departments. Indeed, as noted above, the ''technicians'' are almost universally referred to as "biomedical equipment technicians," regardless of the name of the department that they might work under. However, the term ''biomedical engineer'' is generally thought to be more all-encompassing, including engineers who work in the primary design of medical devices for manufacturers, or in original R&amp;D, or in academia—whereas clinical engineers generally work in hospitals solving problems that are very close to where equipment is actually used in a patient care setting. The clinical engineers in some countries such as India are trained to innovate and find technological solutions for the clinical needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmes.org/careers.asp BMES - Biomedical Engineering Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908184519/http://www.bmes.org/careers.asp |date=2007-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other issue not evident from the ACCE definition is the appropriate educational background for a clinical engineer. Generally, the expectation of the certification program is that an applicant for certification as a clinical engineer will hold an accredited bachelor's degree in engineering (or at least engineering technology).

==The future==
The management of healthcare technology is becoming increasingly complex.&lt;ref&gt;The driving factors and opportunities presented are examined in [http://www.ieee.org/products/onlinepubs/resources/clinical_eng.pdf The Future of Clinical Engineering], published in the IEEE EMBS magazine in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree programs==
The University of Connecticut offers a two-year clinical engineering internship program where students work part-time as clinical engineers during the Fall and Spring semester at a hospital in New England. Clinical engineering classes are attended throughout the academic semesters in core and trending topics of the clinical engineering field.

The University of Toronto offers a two-year master of health sciences in clinical engineering program where students complete internships as clinical engineers in industry or at hospitals. In addition to internships, students are required to complete a research thesis. Clinical engineering classes are attended throughout the first year of the program in core and trending topics within the clinical engineering field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibbme.utoronto.ca/students/graduate/prospective/mhsc/|title=MHSc in Clinical Engineering - IBBME, University of Toronto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility requirements==
To be eligible for certification in clinical engineering (CCE), a candidate must hold appropriate professional or educational credentials (an accredited engineering or engineering-technology degree&lt;ref&gt;2014 Candidate Handbook, American College of Clinical Engineering, 5/15/2014, p.4. {{cite web |url=http://www.accenet.org/downloads/cecertification/CCE%20Handbook%202014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034052/http://www.accenet.org/downloads/cecertification/CCE%20Handbook%202014.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have certain relevant experience and pass an examination. The Examination for Certification in Clinical Engineering involves a written examination composed of a maximum of 150 multiple-choice objective questions with a testing time of three hours, and a separate oral exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acce-htf.org/certification.asp|title=ACCE-Healthcare Technology Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular weight is given to applicants for CE certification (CCE) who are already licensed as registered [[Professional Engineer]]s (PE), which itself has extensive requirements (including an accredited engineering degree and engineering experience).

== Clinical engineering in the UK ==
Clinical engineers in the UK typically work within the NHS.   Clinical engineering is a modality of the clinical scientist profession, registered by the [http://www.hcpc-uk.org HCPC].  The responsibilities of clinical engineers are varied, and can include providing specialist clinical services, inventing and developing medical devices, and medical device management.    The roles typically involve both patient contact and academic research.    Clinical engineering units within an NHS organisation are often part of a larger medical physics department.   Clinical engineers, are supported and represented by the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM), within which the clinical engineering special interest group oversees the engineering activities.  The three primary aims of Clinical Engineering with the NHS are:
# To ensure medical equipment in the clinical environment is available and appropriate to the ''needs of the clinical service''. 
# To ensure medical equipment functions ''effectively and safely.'' 
# To ensure medical equipment and its management represents ''value for patient benefit'':

=== Skills required ===
Clinical engineering supports a broad range of healthcare activities, and therefore the specific person requirements for the role are equally varied.  However clinical scientist must be able to work with patients, clinical staff and a range of other professionals, therefore being able to communicate often in complex situations appropriately is essential.   As a scientist you will be required to keep up to date with advances in your area, and will often have the opportunity to communicate research and development to others.    Clinical engineers will have a scientific first degree (often engineering or physics) before going on to train and register as a clinical scientist., and many also are educated to a doctoral level, either as part of their clinical engineering training, or prior to training.

=== Registration in the UK ===
Clinical engineers are registered as clinical scientists by the [http://www.hcpc-uk.org HCPC].   Assessment of trainees prior to registration is provided by the Association of Clinical Scientists (ACS) and the Academy of Healthcare Science (AHCS).   There are two programmes for attaining registration from the HCPC as a clinical scientist.   The first is a Certificate of Attainment, awarded on successful completion of the NHS Scientist Training Programme (STP), and the second is through the Certificate of Equivalence, awarded on successful demonstration of equivalence to the STP.   This second route is normally chosen by individuals that have significant scientific experience prior to seeking registration.   In March 2017 IPEM published a policy document stating their position on the routes of entry to clinical scientist registration.

==Clinical engineering in India==
Healthcare has increasingly become technology driven and requires trained manpower to keep pace with the growing demand for professionals in the field. An [[M. Tech Clinical engineering|M-Tech Clinical Engineering]] course was initiated by [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]] (IITM), [[Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology]], [[Trivandrum]] and [[Christian Medical College, Vellore]] (CMC), to address the country's need of human resource development. This was aimed at indigenous biomedical device development as well as technology management, and thereby contribute to the overall development of healthcare delivery in the country.

During the course, students of engineering are given an insight into biology, medicine, relevant electronic background, clinical practices, device development and even management aspects. Additionally, students are paired with clinical doctors from CMC and SCTIMST to get hands-on experience during internships. An important aspect of this training is simultaneous, long term and detailed exposure to clinical environment as well as to medical device development activity. This is aimed at making students understand the process of identifying unmet clinical needs and thus, contributing to the development of new medical devices in the country. A unique feature of the course is clinical attachment which exposes the students to the clinical environment. The program also trains engineers to manage and ensure safe and effective use of technology in health care delivery points.

The minimum qualification for joining this course is a bachelor's degree in any discipline of engineering except civil engineering and a valid [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering|GATE]] score in that field.

The term '''cosmetic packaging''' is used for [[cosmetic container]]s (primary packaging) and secondary packaging of [[Aroma compound|fragrances]] and [[cosmetics|cosmetic products]].&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Purposes of Cosmetic Packaging|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Cosmetic packaging compliant to ISO 22715|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/cosmetic-packaging-compliant-to-iso-22715|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetic products are substances intended for human cleansing, beautifying and promoting an enhanced appearance without altering the body's structure or functions.&lt;ref name="FDA-Cosmetics Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is It a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both? (Or Is It Soap?)|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm074201.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic packaging is standardized by an international norm set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]]. Marketers and manufacturers of cosmetic products must be compliant to these regulations to be able to market their cosmetic products in the corresponding [[Jurisdiction (area)|areas of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the Standard ISO 22715 on Cosmetic Packaging legally binding?|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/is-the-standard-iso-22715-on-cosmetic-packaging-legally-binding|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The term cosmetic packaging includes primary and the secondary packaging. Primary packaging, also called cosmetic container, is housing the cosmetic product. It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic containers. An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging. 
The cosmetic container shall carry the name of the [[distributor]], the [[ingredient]]s, define storage, nominal content, product identification (e.g., batch number), warning notices and directions for use.
The secondary packaging shall in addition carry the address of the distributor and information on the cosmetic's mode of action. The secondary packaging does not need to carry any product identification notice.
In cases where the cosmetic product is only wrapped by one single container, this container needs to carry all the information.&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of cosmetic packaging==
There are multiple reasons why care must be put into cosmetic containers. Not only must they protect the product, they need to provide conveniences for vendors and ultimately consumers.

===Protection===
The  main purpose of a container is to store the product so that it is not degraded through storage, shipping and handling.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt; Degradation and damage can be caused by various causes. These causes can be categorized into [[Biological process|biological]], [[Chemical reaction|chemical]], [[temperature|thermal]] causes, damage caused by [[Radiation damage|radiation]] and damage caused by human interaction, by electric sources or by [[pressure]].&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA" /&gt;

In addition to protecting the product, packaging also play a big role [[marketing]] cosmetic products. While product quality is a major factor in the product's success, its packaging must be attractive since that's the essence of beauty marketing. Package design must capture the imagination and be associated with enhancing appearance. One of the keys to attractive packaging is artistic use of colors. Most relevant for the marketer is the outer secondary packaging. However, there are cosmetics which are distributed in one single cosmetic container.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

===Creation of brand awareness===
Cosmetic packages must not only convey [[beauty]], they must equate to [[brand awareness]]. Since the package is what the consumer initially sees, it is very influential in shaping perceptions about the product. Part of building brand awareness for a cosmetic product is associating it with [[emotion]]. Since it's not a survival product it's marketed to appeal to the desire to enhance appearance. The packaging must stimulate this emotion.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

===Labelling===
[[Label]]s tell consumers what they need to know about the product, as far as how to use it and where it comes from. Companies must list the ingredients and the function of the product, especially when it is unclear. The label  must contain contact information of the entity responsible for putting the product on the market. Labels also provide product tracking information.

The label must be easy to read, particularly for a customer where the product is being displayed. Certain compositions, such as perfumes, can be listed as one ingredient. Secondary packages are what the consumer sees as the outermost package. Primary packages are within the secondary package. Certain information can appear just on secondary packages. The most important information, particularly if the product is prone to misuse, must be displayed on both the primary and secondary packaging.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CosmeticsEurope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the label|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetic-products/understanding-label/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information accuracy====
One of the most important aspects of regulations on labelling is that the information is accurate. Although the FDA does not have the resources to inspect all cosmetic products on the market, it can issue penalties for various violations involving packaging and labelling. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to make sure that its product is safe for public consumption.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

====Avoidance of misleading information====
None of the information, including name and address, may be misleading. Words can be abbreviated only if it is clear what they represent. All text must be printed clearly on the packaging. Smaller packages in which text is too difficult to read, should include tags with legible text.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

====Listing of ingredients====
Ingredients must be listed in a certain order with priority given to ingredients that represent 1% or more of the volume. These ingredients must be listed in descending order, based on weight. This group of ingredients is then followed by those that represent 1% or less of the product and listed in any order. Colorants may also be listed in any order.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

===Packaging in multiple layers===
Many times cosmetic products are packaged in multiple layers. Whenever it is difficult to detect for the consumer, the number of units should be listed on the outer package, which should contain details about how to use the product and warnings on what to do if it is misused. It is essential that the product is protected from environmental elements such as [[mould]] and [[bacteria]].

The packaging must be sufficient enough to protect the mechanical, thermal, biological and chemical properties of the product. It should also be strong enough to withstand human tampering and [[radiation damage]].&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

==FDA and EU regulations==
The FDA overseas cosmetic packaging but does not test products. It leaves testing for safety up to manufacturers. It still provides regulations and can issue recalls when a product is associated with safety hazards. While the FDA does not have many restrictions on ingredients for cosmetic products, it does require that certain chemicals and colorants be listed.&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA-CosmeticsLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetics &amp; U.S. Law |url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as [[EU regulation]]s regarding packaging, manufacturers must be compliant with EC No. 1223/2009. One of these requirements involves the manufacturer issuing a safety report before putting the product on the market. The manufacturer must also disclose any serious undesirable effects (SUE) to the EU. Marketers are required to list nano-materials. 
The EU's definition of "ingredients" does not include raw or technical materials used in production that do not end up in the final product. In some cases when durability is an issue, the manufacturer must list an expiration date after the product has been opened. The words "best used before" are common for identifying the product expiration date.&lt;ref name="EU-Regulation-On-Cosmetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 30 November 2009  on cosmetic products|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R1223|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper-Packaging-in-EU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CosmeticsEuropeRegulation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO-Standard==
Standard [[ISO 22715]] provides specifications for the packaging and labeling of all cosmetic products that are sold or distributed at no charge; i.e. free samples. National regulations dictate what products are to be regarded as cosmetics. While ISO 22715 is not legally binding, national regulations regarding cosmetic products can be even stricter than those laid out in ISO 22715. The link between [[International standard|standards]] and [[regulation]]s is that a standard often represents the common denominator of [[national law]], as the [[standardization]] committee consists of members of most countries.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3449">A '''cost driver''' is the unit of an activity that causes the change in activity's cost.

{{quote|cost driver is any factor which causes a change in the cost of an activity|[[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]]}}

"Cost drivers are the structural determinants of the cost of an activity, reflecting any linkages or interrelationships that affect it".&lt;ref&gt;"Competitive Advantage", by [[Michael Porter]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore we could assume that the cost drivers determine the cost behavior within the activities, reflecting the links that these have with other activities and relationships that affect them.

The [[Activity Based Costing]] (ABC) approach relates [[indirect cost]] to the activities that drive them to be incurred. 
Activity Based Costing is based on the belief that activities cause costs and therefore a link should be established between activities and product. The cost drivers thus are the link between the activities and the cost.

Generally, the cost driver for short term indirect [[variable costs]] may be the volume of output/activity; but for long term indirect variable costs, the cost drivers will not be related to volume of output/activity.

In traditional costing the cost driver to allocate indirect cost to cost objects was volume of output. With the change in business structures, technology and thereby cost structures it was found that the volume of output was not the only cost driver. 
John Shank and Vijay Govindarajan list cost drivers into two categories:&lt;ref&gt;''Strategic Cost Management: The New Tool for Competitive Advantage'' by Shank and Govindarajan&lt;/ref&gt;
Structural cost drivers that are derived from the business strategic choices about its underlying economic structure such as scale and scope of operations, complexity of products, use of technology, etc., and
Executional cost drivers that are derived from the execution of the business activities such as [[capacity utilization]], plant layout, work-force involvement, etc.
Resource cost Driver is measure of quantity of resources consumed by an activity. It is used to assign cost of a resource to activity or cost pool.
Activity Cost Driver is measure of frequency and intensity of demand placed on activities by cost object. It is used to assign activity costs to cost objects.

To carry out a [[value chain]] analysis, ABC is a necessary tool. To carry out ABC, it is necessary that cost drivers are established for different cost pools.

==Examples==
Some examples of indirect costs and their drivers are: indirect costs for maintenance, with the possible driver of this cost being the number of machine hours; or, the indirect cost of handling raw-material cost, which may be driven by the number of orders received; or, inspection costs that are driven by the number of inspections or the hours of inspection or production runs. In marketing, cost drivers are  Number of advertisements, Number of sales personnel etc. In Customer service, cost drivers are Number of service calls attended, number of staff in service department, number of warranties handled, Hours spent on servicing etc..

'''Country attractiveness''' is a multidisciplinary concept at the crossroads of [[development economics]], [[financial economics]], [[comparative law]] and [[political science]]: it aims at tracking and contrasting the relative appeal of different territories and [[jurisdiction]]s competing for “scarce” investment inflows, by scoring them [[Numerical data|quantitatively]] and [[qualitative data|qualitatively]] across ''ad hoc'' series of variables such as [[GDP growth]], [[tax rate]]s, capital [[repatriation]] … etc.

There are multiple factors determining host country attractiveness in the eyes of large foreign direct [[institutional investor]]s, notably [[pension fund]]s and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s. Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) suggests that perceived legal/political stability over time and medium-term economic growth dynamics constitute the two main determinants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=M. Nicolas Firzli &amp; Vincent Bazi |title= Infrastructure Investments in an Age of Austerity : The Pension and Sovereign Funds Perspective|url= http://worldpensions.org/uploads/Infra_Investments...Pension___SWF_Perspective__4Q_2011.pdf| work=Revue Analyse Financière, volume 41, pp. 34-37 |date=October 2011|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[development economist]]s believe that a sizeable part of [[Western Europe]] has now fallen behind the most dynamic amongst Asia’s [[emerging markets]], notably because the latter  adopted policies more propitious to long-term investments: “Successful countries such as [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and [[South Korea]] still remember the harsh adjustment mechanisms imposed abruptly upon them by the IMF and World Bank during the 1997-1998 ‘Asian Crisis’ […] What they have achieved in the past 10 years is all the more remarkable: they have quietly abandoned the “Washington consensus” [the dominant Neoclassical perspective] by investing massively in infrastructure projects […] this pragmatic approach proved to be very successful.”&lt;ref name="Euromoney "&gt;{{Cite news|author=M.

The '''EBS Symposium''' is an economic congress organized solely by students of the [[European Business School International University Schloss Reichartshausen|EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht]] and it is one of the biggest collegiate events in Germany with 1000+ participants each year. During the Symposium various events take place on the campus. Besides topical speeches of renowned people, the participants also have the opportunity to visit the Recruiting Fair in order to get in contact with companies. During the panel discussions they can discuss with several high-ranking personalities from the worlds of business, society and politics and on the Innovations Fair they are introduced to new, creative products by up-and-coming, innovative companies.

== History ==

In 1989, three student initiatives founded the economic symposium under the name of “Pro 90”. The idea and goal behind this event was the convergence and entering into dialog of students of different branches of study and representatives of politics, science and economics.

The first EBS Symposium was conducted under the topic of “Made in Germany – a term to be redefined” and received fantastic responses from students and participants alike. From then on, the students' aim was to establish their project as a fixed annual event at the European Business School (EBS) - and they succeeded. For the first time, in 1992, the “Bankenforum” was organized by students. This international event focused its attention on financial issues.

With students from the first and second semester organizing the event and bringing in of new ideas and fresh concepts, they are supported by the “Wirtschaftsrat”, former chairmen, as well as EBS alumni and representatives of renowned companies, who ensure that knowledge based on experience is used and implemented

In 2008, under the patronage of [[Thomas Enders]], the 19th Symposium took place with about 1,500 participants, including 200 representatives of several companies. Among the 55 speakers were [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], [[John Major]] and [[Jochen Zeitz]].
The 20th Symposium took place from 17th-19 September 2009 with [[Dieter Zetsche]] as its patron and, in 2010, [[Axel A. Weber|Axel Weber]] the former President of the German Federal Bank served as patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesbank.de/download/presse/reden/2010/20100917.weber.en.pdf "Speech at the 21st EBS Symposium"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the topic “Dawn of Demography – Import Growth or Export Knowledge?”, the 22nd EBS Symposium took place from 21st-23 September 2011 on the campus of the EBS in Oestrich-Winkel under the patronage of [[Philipp Rösler]], the Vice Chancellor of Germany.

== Content ==

A great number of speakers is invited to join this event and contribute to the current topic through presentations or key-note speeches. During the presentations, the participants of the congress have the opportunity of asking questions directly to the speakers. Besides the presentations, also several panel discussions take place during the event. For the first time, in 2010, a student panel was organized in which three selected students could discuss current economic problems together with business representatives.
Furthermore, each year the Symposium also hosts an additional Recruiting Fair on the campus, where the supporting partner companies are given the opportunity to present themselves. Besides, an Innovation Fair is also organized each year, where the participants of the EBS Symposium can marvel at innovative works and ideas or even try them out and enter into dialogue with the presenting company. The fair offers companies not only the exposition of their products but they also have the opportunity to conduct market research and find common grounds with other exhibitors. The spectrum ranges from companies in the automotive industry to manufacturers of TVs. In 2011, the congress was framed by the integration of the partner countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark). Several Scandinavian speakers were invited on campus, e.g. the Danish ambassador to Germany, and the countries were also included content-wise in presentations and discussions.

'''Esaias Wechter''' (1701 — 17 May 1776) was a [[Österland|Finnish]] [[merchant]], early [[industrialist]] and [[politician]].

Wechter started the first [[baize]] [[manufactory]] of [[Turku]] and was co-founder of the local [[shipbuilding]] industry together with his business partner [[Henric Rungeen]]. Wechter became one of the richest merchants of the city.

Wechter took part in the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Diet of Sweden]] for three times in 1734–1743 representing the estate of [[bourgeoisie]]. He was also involved local politics starting from the 1730s; between 1741 and 1769 he was a [[councillor]]. For the end of his political career Wechter was passive and embittered. By time he also lost most of his property.

== Early years ==
Wechter was born in [[Turku]], [[Finland Proper (historical province)|Southwest Finland]]. His parents were [[merchant]], [[mayor]] Henric Wechter and Anna née Simolenia. The Wechters were an old Turku [[bourgeois]] family. The city fell under [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] occupation during the [[Finland during the Great Northern War|great wrath]] in 1713 and the family could not escape. Henric Wechter hide a part of his large property and could not manage to tell the location of the treasure before his death. The cache was found at [[Royal Academy of Turku|academy]] construction site as late as in 1802, when Esaias Wechter had already passed away.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

== Industrial career ==
Soon after the end of the [[Great Northern War]] in 1723 Esaias Wechter got [[bourgeois]] rights. He became [[shipowner]] and did foreign trade. Although Turku was a poor city back then, Wechter's business ran well. In 1726 he married Catharina Schele, which further advanced his financial situation. in 1730 he was the second richest bourgeois of Turku after [[Henric Rungeen]]. In the 1730s Wechter was involved in developing many industrial companies.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

In 1732 Wechter and Rungeen founded a small [[shipyard]] to east side of [[Aura (Archipelago Sea)|River Aura]], next to [[Korppolaismäki]]. At first the yard repaired ships of the local merchants. Shipbuilding began in 1737, and the owners recruited [[England|English]]-born master shipbuilder [[Robert Fithie]] to lead the operations. The yard built at least three large ships during 1738–1741. This was the beginning of industrial shipbuilding in Turku and led later to development of [[Åbo Skeppswarf|Turku Old Shipyard]].&lt;ref name="Knorring: s.13-16"&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Knorring |first1=Nils |title= Aurajoen veistämöt ja telakat |trans-title=Aurajoki boatworks and shipyards |year=1995 |publisher=Schildts Förlags Ab |location=Espoo, Finland |language=Finnish |isbn=951-50-0735-6 |pages=13–16 |chapter=1. Turun veistämön varhaisvaiheet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1738 Wechter and few other bourgeois rented the Teijo iron mill.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

Wechter and Rungeen founded a [[baize]] [[manufactory]] in Turku in 1738. They applied for privileges, and in 1739 they were awarded a ten-year-long exclusive right to baize production, and a certain part of the production was sold to military stationed in Finland. The co-operation with Rungeen ended in the same year due to political dissensions and Wechter owned the manufactory alone thereafter. The production started first in temporary facilities and was moved in 1742 to two complexes on west side of Aura river. The machinery consisted of four [[loom]]s. A [[fulling]] facility was built at a mill in [[Littoinen]] and the [[cloth]] was [[Dyeing|dyed]] in another facility owned by Wechter. Soon the number of personnel reached 60.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

The bottleneck in production was availability of [[yarn]]. A new facility for yarn [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] was started in a new [[Prison|penitentiary]] founded in 1738. Wechter was the facility manager in 1738–1750. The employees were some dozen women who were [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] or convicted for crimes. The conditions of the workers were inhumane; one week's amount of food was enough for just two days and the women suffered of coldness and maltreatment by guards. Reportedly, three women killed their infants to get a [[death penalty]]. Due to the extremely poor conditions [[productivity]] remained low, which frustrated Wechter.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

When Sweden went to [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–43)|war against Russia]] and the Russian troops advanced towards Turku in 1743, Wechter dismounted the looms, brought them to [[Stockholm]] and continued the operations in temporary facilities. The shipyard was closed shortly before arrival of the Russian army; the last ship produced transported [[refugee]]s to Stockholm. Wechter transported the machinery back to Turku after the war and Russian [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]]. The business ran well and the company got its first competitor as late as in 1756. But Wechter had funded the business by beneficial public [[loan]]s, which he eventually could not pay back. The situation was further worsened during recession in the 1760s. Due to financial problems caused by the manufactory and other businesses, Wechter had to sell the operations to [[Joseph Bremer]] in 1770.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

== Political career ==

=== Diet of Sweden ===
Wechter was selected to represent the bourgeoisie in the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Swedish Diet]] for the first time in 1734. He got directly into the political core, as he was set to the Secret Committee. In the committee Wechter supported the [[Caps (party)|Caps' party]] and Arvid Horn. He was selected for the second time to the Diet and Secret Committee in 1738–1739. In the committee he resisted the plan of [[Hats (party)|the Hats]] to start a war against Russia. He also participated in discussions about requirement of [[Finnish language]] knowledge for officials serving in Finland.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

Supporters of Wechter wanted to send him to the Diet of 1740, but the governor denied the plan. Wechter participated in the 1742 Diet during his exile in Stockholm. He reached for participating in the 1746 Diet but lost the elections. The craftsmen of Turku selected Wechter to represent them in the Diet but his attorney letter was denied in Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

=== Local politics ===
Wechter was a difficult person to get along with; he was eager to criticise others and his property decreased by time. One reason for this was his large family. He lost his supporters among bourgeois during the 1740s but gathered popularity among craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

Since the 1730s Wechter was the chairman of the city elders and in 1741 he became [[councillor]]. In 1745 he sought to mayor position, but lost against Anders Roos. Wechter could not swallow his defeat. Following the election, he neglected his role as councillor. He still held the post until 1769.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Esaias Wechter"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11201">An '''extended warranty''', sometimes called a '''service agreement''', a '''service contract''', or a '''maintenance agreement''', is a prolonged [[warranty]] offered to [[consumer]]s in addition to the standard warranty on new items.  The extended warranty may be offered by the warranty administrator, the retailer or the manufacturer.  Extended warranties cost extra and for a percentage of the item's retail price. Occasionally, some extended warranties that are purchased for multiple years state in writing that during the first year, the consumer must still deal with the manufacturer in the occurrence of malfunction. Thus, what is often promoted as a five-year extended guarantee, for example, is actually only a four-year guarantee.

Extended warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, "acts of God", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and [[lubrication]] on a vehicle.

These types of warranties are provided for various products, but [[automobile]]s and [[Small appliance|electronics]] are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as [[Best Buy]] may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of [[reverse competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker T, Siegelman P. (2013). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199569 Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance Regulation].&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an auto warranty from a [[car dealership]] may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts.

==Overview==
An extended warranty is coverage for electrical or mechanical breakdown. It may or may not cover peripheral items, wear and tear, damage by computer viruses, re-gassing, normal maintenance, accidental damage, or any consequential loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/garden/28repairside.html | work=The New York Times | title=Should You Buy an Extended Warranty? | first=Julie | last=Scelfo | date=2009-05-28 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most state insurance regulators have approved the inclusion of normal wear and tear, accidental damage from handling, rental car and towing, power surge and other coverages in addition to the standard coverage for defects in materials and workmanship. The indemnity is to cover the cost of repair and may include replacement if deemed uneconomic to repair. It is important for consumers to read and understand the terms and conditions offered at the point of sale. In retail consumer electronics, extended warranties cost 20% to 30% of the price, and give sales associates up to 15% commission at some retailers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/money/extended_warranties/ "Extended warranties: A deal or dud?" article] from CBC Marketplace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20061024.html "Extended Warranty Pricing"] from WarrantyWeek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer advocate]] groups, such as the [[non-profit]] [[Consumers Union]], advise against purchasing extended warranties unless they can be purchased at manufacturers cost. David Butler of the Consumers Union says, "The extended warranty is definitely in the best interest of the company because if the product breaks down they want you to be satisfied with it and buy another one when the time comes, but isn't often in the best interest of the consumer unless it can be purchased at cost with no or very little markup." Consumers Union says only two products deserve extended warranty consideration: [[projection television|projection TVs]] and [[digital camera]]s, as both are expensive to repair and require frequent repairs.&lt;ref name="cbcnews"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2006/11/15/consumer-warranty.html "Skip extended warranties, Consumers Union urges"] from [[CBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended auto warranty ==

An extended auto warranty is a service contract between the owner of a vehicle and an auto warranty provider, the latter which may be either the original manufacturer or a third party. All new cars come with a warranty that cover repairs for a certain period of time and a certain number of miles, such as 3 years and 36,000 miles. Auto warranties do not generally cover vandalism or theft, dings or dents, road salt damage, environmental or natural disaster-related damage. car wash damage, or normal routine maintenance.&lt;ref name="CARCHEX"&gt;{{cite web|title = Facts About Extended Auto Warranties|url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of sale, auto dealers may sell car buyers an extended warranty offered by the manufacturer. When that time period runs out, consumers have the option to purchase an extended auto warranty from a third-party, which is not an extension of the terms and coverages provided in the original car manufacturer’s warranty, rather it is a new contract provided a third-party provider.  According to the [[Automobile Protection Association]] (APA), which publishes the ''Lemon-Aid Car Buyer’s Guides'', extended warranties are a good idea if they cover items likely to break down within the warranty period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-tips/should-i-buy-a-third-party-extended-warranty-for-my-car/article13615611/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Should I buy a third-party extended warranty for my car? | date=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extended auto warranties often offer other perks not included in a general factory warranty, such as trip interruption insurance and roadside assistance.

== By region ==

=== Canadian province of Québec ===
Based upon the Québec civil code and the ''Loi sur la protection du consommateur'' every merchant is responsible to uphold the legal guarantee of a product. This legal guarantee protects the consumer from: purposefully hidden malfunctions, defaults that could not be readily identified at the moment of purchase, the guarantee that the item purchased can be used for its stated uses and finally guarantees a reasonable life expectancy based on the price paid. This guarantee survives even when the initial purchaser sells his goods to another person. A merchant cannot ask a consumer to pay any fees or shipping charges in order to be eligible to receive their legal guarantee. The [[Office de la protection du consommateur|office for the protection of consumers]] does not take a particular stance towards extended warranties. However, they recommend that consumers should be vigilant and question themselves whether the warranty really adds anything to the already applicable legal warranty. Finally they point out that the number of consumers who go to court against merchants in order for them to apply the legal warranty is almost proportional to the number of consumers who take legal means against a merchant for failing to respect extended warranties they have sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/publications/dep_garantie_garantie.asp Office de la protection du consommateur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818163424/http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/publications/dep_garantie_garantie.asp |date=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, extended warranties are regulated by many state insurance commissioners as "service contracts."  Service contracts can cover automobiles, consumer goods (such as appliances, electronics, lawn equipment, etc...) and homes.  The regulatory structure requires licensure or registration of the warranty providers, financial solvency regulation, and service contract consumer disclosures. Service warranty "providers" apply for licensure or registration, and then may sell their products, usually at the point of sale of the product, for example at the car dealership, or at the retail consumer electronics store, but some companies such as [[afterinc.com|After, Inc]], [[SquareTrade]], [[Warranty Direct]]  and MotorEasy also sell directly to consumers. In the United States, a type of extended warranty called vehicle service contracts are typically regulated by the states as insurance. In July 2010, California issued a cease and desist letter to several corporations which were selling the insurance illegally in the state; the corporations contended that it was not insurance because the contracts required that certain additives be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2010/release082-10.cfm Commissioner Poizner Orders Vehicle Warranty Company to End Illegal Telemarketing, Stop Operating as Unlicensed Insurance Company]. California Department of Insurance.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://go-scic.com/ Service Contract Industry Council] was founded by [[Fredrick D. Schaufeld]] in 1988 and is a [[trade association]] of members of the industry.

=== United Kingdom ===
The extended warranty market has been subject to several investigations. In 2002 the [[Office of Fair Trading]] decided that self-regulation of the industry had failed and passed the case onto the [[Competition Commission]]. This concluded that the market was not acting in the interests of consumers. The [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] have expressed concerns about extended warranties being mis-sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elise Cross |url=http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/pressoffice/press_index/press-050407.htm |title=New protection for consumers taking out extended warranties welcomed - but many offer little value for money says Citizens Advice |publisher=Citizensadvice.org.uk |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012141931/http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/pressoffice/press_index/press-050407.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Fair trading investigated the extended warranty market again and published a [http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/othermarketswork/electrical-goods/#named4 market review] in 2012. They said that the UK market is worth an estimated £1billion&lt;ref&gt;The OFT has completed a [[market study]] of extended warranties which highlighted competition concerns in the £1 billion per year extended warranties market.&lt;/ref&gt; a year. Out of this £1billion they estimate 75% of people do not compare prices before buying an extended warranty.

Factiva has also partnered with EuroSpider, [[Comintelli]], [[PeopleSoft]], MediaMap, Biz360, ChoicePoint, [[BTRadianz]], AtHoc, and Reuters.  Factiva has also been included as of March 2003 in [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft's Office 2003]] program as one of the News research options within the Research Pane.

In 2005, Factiva acquired two private companies: [[London]]-based 2B Reputation Intelligence Ltd. and [[Denver, Colorado]]-based [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] services and software firm, [[Synapse, the Knowledge Link Corporation]]. 2B was a technology and consulting business, specializing in media monitoring and reputation management. Synapse provided taxonomy management software, pre-built taxonomies and taxonomy-building and indexing services.

This acquisition brought with it Synaptica, the taxonomy management software tool developed by Synapse, and Taxonomy Warehouse, a website developed by Synapse. Both Synaptica and Taxonomy Warehouse were developed by Factiva after the acquisition and are now owned by Dow Jones.

In 2006, Reuters sold its 50 percent share of Factiva to Dow Jones. Factiva was integrated into the Enterprise Media Group within Dow Jones.&lt;ref&gt;http://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/news/read/300150/Dow_Jones_to_buy_rest_of_Factiva_for_$160_mln&lt;/ref&gt; Clare Hart was the executive vice president of this operating group.

In 2007, Factiva was included as a Dow Jones company sold to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Jul31/0,4675,DowJonesMurdochGlance,00.html|title=FOXNews.com - Thumbnails of Dow Jones and News Corp. - Business And Money - Business News - Financial News|author=|date=|website=www.foxnews.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This toolkit allows organisations to embed Factiva content and services within enterprise workflow applications.

In 2008 Dow Jones launched the website Synaptica Central to highlight the Synaptica tool and to discuss controlled vocabularies and semantic technologies etc.

{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}

{{Contract law}}

In [[contract law]], '''impossibility''' is an excuse for the nonperformance of duties under a [[contract]], based on a change in circumstances (or the discovery of preexisting circumstances), the nonoccurrence of which was an underlying assumption of the contract, that makes performance of the contract literally impossible.

For example, if Rachel contracts to pay Joey $1000 to paint her house on October 1, but the house burns to the ground before the end of September, Rachel is excused from her duty to pay Joey the $1000, and he is excused from his duty to paint her house; however, Joey may still be able to sue under the theory of [[unjust enrichment]] for the value of any benefit he conferred on Rachel before her house burned down.

The parties to a contract may choose to ignore impossibility by inserting a [[hell or high water clause]], which mandates that payments continue even if completion of the contract becomes physically impossible.

In common law, for the defense of "impossibility" to be raised performance must not merely be difficult or unexpectedly costly for one party, there must be no way for it to actually be accomplished; however, it is beginning to be recognized that "impossibility" under this doctrine can also exist when the contemplated performance can be done but only at an excessive and unreasonable cost, i.e., commercial impracticability.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite court |litigants=Transatlantic Financing Corp. v. United States |vol=363 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=312 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Cir.]] |date=1966 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/363/312/264117/ |accessdate=2018-07-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some sources see "impossibility" and [[impracticability]] as being related but separate defenses.

The [[English law|English]] case that established the doctrine of impossibility at [[common law]] is ''[[Taylor v. Caldwell]].''&lt;ref&gt;3 B.&amp;S. 826, 122 Eng.Rep. 309 (K.B. 1863).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia''' (the Institute) was the professional accounting body representing [[Chartered Accountant]]s in [[Australia]] before it merged with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants to become [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]].  

It had over 61,000 members and some 12,000 students. It was one of three major legally recognised Professional Accountancy bodies in Australia. The others being [[CPA Australia]] and [[Institute of Public Accountants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/Certificates+issued+by+a+qualified+accountant ASIC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianaccountantsdirectory.com.au/about-accountants Australians Accountants Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a founding member of the [[Global Accounting Alliance]] (GAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globalaccountingalliance.com/globalaccountingalliance/Alliance-Members | title=Alliance Members | publisher=Global Accounting Alliance | accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Institute are part of the international accounting coalition of the world’s premier accounting bodies, the GAA. Chartered Accountants audit 100 per cent of the Top ASX-listed companies in Australia.

In November 2013 Members of The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants voted yes on a proposal to create One New Institute: "Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/professions/accountants_vote_yes_to_trans_tasman_IGAgmpm5z3ewYnh98mbJVM | title=Accountants vote yes to trans-Tasman Institute.

==History==

===Corporation of Accountants of Australia===
[[File:Armorial.gif|thumb|Coat of Arms for Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia]]
The Corporation of Accountants of Australia was granted the official coat of arms by the College of Arms in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/bookofpublicarms00foxd#page/8/mode/2up | title=The book of public arms : a complete encyclopedia of all royal, territorial, municipal, corporate, official, and impersonal arms | publisher=London, Edinburgh : T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack | author=Fox-Davies, Arthur Charles | year=1915 | location=London | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the Corporation of Accountants of Australia and the Sydney Institute of Public Accountants moved to create a national accounting body of all practising public accountants in Australia.&lt;ref name="Cooper14"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/accfinwp/14 | title=Accounting by Women: Fear, Favour and the Path to Professional Recognition for Australian Women Accountants | publisher=School of Accounting &amp; Finance, University of Wollongong | work=Working Paper 14 | year=2007 | accessdate=12 December 2013 | author=Cooper, K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australasian Corporation of Public Accountants===
In 1907, negotiations between the Corporation of Accountants of Australia, the Sydney Institute of Public Accountants and the Institutes in Melbourne, resulted in the formation of the Australasian Corporation of Public Accountants (ACPA) on June 14. The ACPA membership was composed exclusively of practising public accountants.&lt;ref name="Cooper14" /&gt;

===Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia===
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia was formed with the granting of a [[Royal Charter]] on 19 June 1928, to Thomas Brentnall, George Mason Allard and Henry Joshua Wise on behalf of the public accountants of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/accfinwp/68 | title=Some Professionalisation Strategies Of Australian Accountancy | publisher=School of Accounting &amp; Finance, University of Wollongong | work=Working Paper 2 | year=1995 | accessdate=12 December 2013 | author=Cooper, K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ISSN=1548-6583 | url=http://www.davidpublishing.org/DownLoad/?id=7815 | title=The Accounting Profession: A Descriptive Study of the Common and Code Law Countries | author=Altintas, Nalan | journal=Journal of Modern Accounting and Auditing |date=July 2012 | volume= 8 | issue= 7 | pages=932–950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICAA was the first accountancy body outside the United Kingdom to receive a Royal Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.cengagebrain.com/content/jones82010_0170182010_02.01_chapter01.pdf | title=Financial Accounting Theory, 3rd Edition | publisher=Cengage Learning Australia | author=Jones, Stewart | year=2010 | location=Victoria Australia | isbn=9780170182010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 1929 The Earl Marshal of England granted the current arms to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/241140?uid=3737536&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102546083277 | title=Comparative Professional Accountancy - Australia | author=Murphy, Mary | journal=The Accounting Review |date=Jan 1959 | volume=34 | issue=1 | pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms include the Latin motto 'Nec Timens Nec Favens' which translates to 'Without Fear or Favour'.

The Institute now operates under a Supplemental Royal Charter (amended from time to time) granted by the [[Governor-General]] on behalf of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 19 August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/files/documents/Institute_Supplemental_Royal_Charter2005.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand===
After voting on the merger with the [[New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants]] the bodies formed [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]] 31 December 2014.

CA ANZ is a professional body of over 120,000 Chartered Accountants around the world. CA ANZ focuses on the education and lifelong learning of its members, and on advocacy and thought leadership in areas of public interest and business.

==Admission to membership==
To become a member of the Institute, Chartered Accountants complete the Chartered Accountants Program which includes study of the Graduate Diploma in Chartered Accounting (GradDipCA) and three years of practical experience. Entry to the Program is available for graduates who hold an accounting degree, however those holding non-accounting degrees may also be permitted entry after some additional requirements are met.

===Accounting degree===

To take this path you will have either a bachelor or master's degree in commerce, business or accounting from an Institute accredited Australian university.  The commerce and business degrees will require a major in accounting, in order to qualify.

===Non Accounting degree===

# Institute accredited Graduate Conversion course: Available from most Australian universities
# Entrance exam: Available for non-accounting graduates with significant on-the-job accounting experience and employer support

===Graduate Diploma in Chartered Accounting===
The GradDipCA component of the Chartered Accountants Program consists of the following five modules which each take approximately 14 weeks of part-time study to complete:
* Auditing and Assurance
* Taxation
* Management Accounting and Applied Finance (As of 1 January 2013)
* Financial Accounting and Reporting
* Capstone (as of 1 January 2014)

The Institute is the only Australian professional accounting body that is a government accredited Higher Education provider.
Unlike other Australian accounting designations, the Chartered Accountants Program leads to the awarding of a Graduate Diploma.
The Australian Chartered Accountant qualification is recognised as an “approved qualification” - a significant requirement for auditor registration purposes in the UK.

# Be employed with an organisation recognised by the Institute for at least 17.5hpw whilst completing the GradDipCA

'''Jesse William Markham''' (April 16, 1916 – June 21, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]]. Markham was best known for his work on antitrust policy, price theory and industrial organization. Markham was the Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration at [[Harvard Business School]] (HBS), and the former chief economist to the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

==Early life and education==
Markham was born in [[Sharps, Virginia]]. Markham attended the [[University of Richmond]], where he played baseball.&lt;ref name=HBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Emeritus Jesse W. Markham Dead at 93|url=http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/Pages/jessemarkham.aspx|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he earned an undergraduate degree in economics and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; After graduating from Richmond, he began graduate school in economics that fall at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt;

In 1942, Markham enlisted in [[World War II]] where he served as an officer in the [[U.S. Navy]] for three years.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; Markham served in the Atlantic theater on the {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|6}}, which was the heavy cruiser acting as the flagship for the [[Normandy invasion]], where he saw combat from the first attack on [[D-Day]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse William Markham Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=128846620|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Markham began studies at [[Harvard University]], and earned a master's degree in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1949 in economics.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt;

==Career==
In 1948, Markham began his career as an associate professor at [[Vanderbilt University]] where he worked until 1952.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Federal Trade Commission===
In 1953, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] selected Markham to be the FTC's chief economist. Markham recalled: "At a time when Congress had passed an act putting arbitrary constraints on corporate mergers, the Eisenhower administration saw me as a voice in favor of a standard of [[effective competition|workable]], as opposed to perfect, competition. I could advocate the benefits of letting certain firms work together to foster innovation, which buyers value just as much as temporary price advantages - the traditional yardstick of competitiveness."&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; Markham left the FTC in 1955.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt;

In 1964, Markham wrote an article for the [[Columbia Law Review]] entitled "The Federal Trade Commission's Use of Economics."&lt;ref name=colum&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markham|first1=Jesse W.|title=The Federal Trade Commission's Use of Economics|jstor=1120730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markham criticized the FTC for relying on oversimplified rules of thumb, instead of the tedious analysis Congress seemed to have in mind as one of the agency's principal functions.&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silberman|first1=Alan|title=The FTC as an Antitrust Enforcement Agency, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsY7TzxtyCAC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=markham+federal+trade+commission&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Nl2mBUA_f&amp;sig=cTfqr86oAM-ccatafRZ2V2anMUQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMIwfe5koaFxwIV0JeICh3HmQFB#v=onepage&amp;q=markham%20federal%20trade%20commission&amp;f=false|publisher=ABA|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Markham returned to the FTC to comment on economists’ role in antitrust during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC History: Bureau of Economics Contributions to Law Enforcement, Research, and Economic Knowledge and Policy|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/roundtable-former-directors-bureau-economics/directorstablegood.pdf|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor of economics===
From 1955 until 1968, Markham was Professor of Economics at Princeton University, but visited as a professor in the Harvard economics department and at the Harvard Business School.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; In 1958, Markham served as an economic delegate for the [[European Common Market]] (now the OEEC).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Markham was [[Dennis Mueller]]'s thesis advisor at Princeton.&lt;ref name=exemp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Backhouse|first1=Roger|title=Exemplary Economists: North America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHnGSiiK4dUC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=dennis+c+mueller+markham&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M-G8-PouS7&amp;sig=NY4XlAJussik8cBCXdhKGKSRv4U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBGoVChMIvefV2o2FxwIVUDWICh3MXgBK#v=onepage&amp;q=dennis%20c%20mueller%20markham&amp;f=false|publisher=Edward Elgar|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Markham accepted [[George P. Baker]]'s invitation to serve as Harvard Business School's Charles E. Wilson Professor of Business Administration.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; While at HBS, Markham worked alongside [[Paul Samuelson]], the first American Nobel laureate in economics.&lt;ref name=sara&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Billy|title=Noted economist wintered in Sarasota|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20091215/article/912151054|publisher=Herald-Tribune|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he served as a Commissioner on the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13886">'''Lars Jaeger''' (born 1969 in Heidelberg, Germany) is a Swiss-German author, entrepreneur, financial theorist, and alternative investment manager. He writes on the history and philosophy of science and technology, and has in the past been an author on hedge funds, [[quantitative investing]], and risk management. In his widely read blog as well as other media he frequently writes on issues concerning scientific developments, new technologies, and their meaning for society. In 2014, Jaeger published a universal history of science (in German), and in September 2016 a book on the interplay of science and spirituality (again in German). His next book "Supermacht Wissenschaften" ("Superpower Science", 2017, again in German) outlines scenarios of mankind's technological future. His latest book "The Second Quantum Revolution - From Entanglement to Quantum Computing and Other Super-Technologies" (2018, available in English as well as German) deals with the latest quantum technologies. Jaeger has for many years been an influential voice in the hedge fund industry on fostering developments towards more transparency, liquidity, and cost efficiency. He is the founder and CEO of Alternative Beta Partners AG and currently serves GAM as Head of Alternative Risk Premia.

== Background ==

Prior to founding Alternative Beta Partners in early 2010 Jaeger had served [[Partners Group]] as a partner for eight years. He is a co-founder of saisGroup, a hedge funds asset management firm, which merged into [[Partners Group]] in 2001. Jaeger started his finance career in 1997 at the quantitative research firm Olsen &amp; Associates in Zurich. Before he studied physics and philosophy at the University of Bonn in Germany and [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris and holds a doctorate degree in theoretical physics from the [[Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems]] in Dresden, where he also performed post-doctoral studies in the field of non-linear dynamics.

== Commentaries on hedge funds ==

Jaeger frequently comments in print, online, and on television on financial issues, particularly around hedge funds, their return sources and risk management for alternative investment strategies.

&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjm63rEqiSQ "Lars Jaeger on Wiley Finance "]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been an early public advocate for independent risk management, transparency, and cost reduction for hedge funds &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipe.com/magazine/transparency-liquidity-needs-of-alternative-invest_14594.php "2002 Article in IPE (pension fund magazine)"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedgeworld.com/research/download/risk_management_for_multi%20.pdf "2000 Article on risk management for hedge fund portfolios"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, based on his investment experience as well as his academic research on hedge funds return sources, he (jointly with Bill Fung and David Hsieh) coined the term [[alternative beta]]
&lt;ref&gt;"The Risk in Hedge Fund Strategies: Alternative Alphas and Alternative Betas," David Hsieh, Bill Fung, in Lars Jaeger (ed.), The New Generation of Risk Management for Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds, London: Euromoney Institutional Investors PLC, 2003, 72-87"&lt;/ref&gt; identifying this as the most important component of hedge fund returns (increasingly referred to "alternative risk premia" today). The research by Jaeger
&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=811185 such as "Factor Modeling and Benchmarking of Hedge Funds: Can passive investments in hedge funds strategies deliver?"]&lt;/ref&gt;
initiated an industry wide discussion on the return attributes (and cost features) of hedge funds which starting in 2007 led to the appearance of hedge funds replication products and more recently to the growth of the "alternative risk premia" industry into a major investment topic of the global asset management industry. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edhec-risk.com/research_news/choice/RISKReview1089704613542419134 "Hedge Fund Indices: a new way to invest in alternative investment strategies?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaeger is author of several research articles in leading academic journals. He received the Martello award "best paper of the year" by the Journal of Alternative Investment in 2005 for his influential and much cited paper "Factor Modeling and Benchmarking of Hedge Funds: Can passive investments in hedge funds strategies deliver?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=811185 "Factor Modeling and Benchmarking of Hedge Funds: Can passive investments in hedge funds strategies deliver?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing about the history and philosophy of science and technology ==
In September 2014 Jaeger published "Die Naturwissenschaften – Eine Biographie" with Springer Spektrum, a book which aims at outlining the history of science from its origins to today for a broad range of readers from little scientific background to scientific expertise in a clear and comprehensible way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/new+%26+forthcoming+titles+(default)/book/978-3-662-43399-7 "Die Naturwissenschaften – Eine Biographie"]&lt;/ref&gt; His second book "Wissenschaft und Spiritualität" was published in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783662502839 "Wissenschaft und Spiritualität: Universum, Leben, Geist – Zwei Wege zu den großen Geheimnissen"]&lt;/ref&gt; Here Jaeger discusses the interplay of science and spirituality. In his third book "Superpower Science – Our future between heaven and hell" (2017) Lars Jaeger outlines a journey into our immediate technological future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.randomhouse.de/Buch/Supermacht-Wissenschaft/Lars-Jaeger/Guetersloher-Verlagshaus/e522801.rhd "Supermacht Wissenschaft - Unsere Zukunft zwischen Himmel und Hölle"]&lt;/ref&gt; His latest book "The Second Quantum Revolution
From Entanglement to Quantum Computing and Other Super-Technologies" provides insights into developments and possibilities of the latest quantum technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319988238 "The Second Quantum Revolution - From Entanglement to Quantum Computing and Other Super-Technologies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On his web page Jaeger publishes a bi-weekly blog on matters of science, technology, philosophy, and spirituality. He also blogs regularly on the German platform [http://www.scilogs.de scilogs.de].

== History ==
In 1851, the company was founded in the [[Alsace]] region of [[France]] by [[Léopold Louis-Dreyfus|Léopold Dreyfus]], the 18-year-old son of a farmer from [[Sierentz]], under the name of his father, Louis Dreyfus. Léopold purchased wheat from local farmers in Alsace and transported it to [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]], {{convert|8|mi|km|order=flip}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ldcom.com/global/en/about-us/our-heritage/|title=Louis Dreyfus Company :: Our heritage|website=www.ldcom.com|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Léopold developed a fortune whilst still a teenager through cross border cereal trading. He rapidly diversified across shipping, [[weapons manufacturing]], agriculture, oil and banking, thus establishing one of the wealthiest dynasties in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Saatchi &amp; Saatchi: The Inside Story'', By Alison Fendley, page 100, Arcade Publishing, 8 Oct 1996&lt;/ref&gt; His descendants still own the company to this day. By the early 20th century, the Louis-Dreyfus family was described as one of the "top five biggest fortunes of France". However, as a [[Jewish]] family during the Second World War much of the family assets were confiscated by the [[Vichy government]] and some members of the family fled to America.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Foreign Investment in the United States, 1914-1945'', Harvard University Press, 2004, By Mira Wilkins, page 479&lt;/ref&gt;

Léopold Louis-Dreyfus's great-grandson, [[Gérard Louis-Dreyfus]], was chairman of '''Louis Dreyfus Energy Services''', a subsidiary of the group involved in [[crude-oil trading]], gas investments and infrastructure. Gérard is also the father of American actress [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], the Emmy-winning star of ''[[Seinfeld]]''. Another branch of the dynasty, based in Paris, was headed by [[Robert Louis-Dreyfus]] (who was also the CEO of [[Adidas]]) until his death in 2009. It is currently overseen by his widow, Russian-born [[Margarita Louis-Dreyfus|Margarita Bogdanova Louis-Dreyfus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bermant|first1=Yoel|title=Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, Head of Louis Dreyfus Holdings, Is Winning the Battle to Keep the Company in Family Hands|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/04/28/margarita-louis-dreyfus-head-of-louis-dreyfus-holdings-is-winning-the-battle-to-keep-the-company-in-family-hands/|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third branch of the family's business is headed by Philippe Louis-Dreyfus (born 1945) and is concerned primarily with offshore industrial activities and freight shipping operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Advisors|url=https://www.londoninternationalshippingweek.com/board-of-advisors/|website=London International Shipping Week|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis Victor Gerverot''' (8 December 1747 – 6 January 1829) was a French [[porcelain painter]] and businessman.

==Life==
===Early life===
Gerverot was born in [[Lunéville]]. His father was a "musicus" (singer) at the court of [[Stanisław Leszczyński]], former king of Poland, who became in 1737 the [[duke of Lotharingen]]. His mother, Barbe Oubert, sent him to the porcelain factory in [[Sèvres porcelain|Sèvres]] in 1764, to learn his trade. Possibly he had himself already asked to specialize in the painting of porcelain with flowers and (fantastical) birds. Gerverot became extremely able in the preparation of colour, clay mixtures, and (since his stay in [[Niderviller]]) in other trade secrets.&lt;!---Are we sure "in other trade secrets" or "in the secrets of the arcanum" is the best translation for "op de hoogte van het productieproces"?---&gt;  His urge to travel and to turn his knowledge into money (or his inability to stay in any one place for long) resulted in his short periods in various porcelain factories. In succession, he was active in [[Ludwigsburg]], [[Ansbach]], [[Höchst Porzellanmanufaktur|Höchst]], [[Fürstenberg China|Fürstenberg]] and [[Frankenthal]].

===Weesp and Loosdrecht===
In 1767, Gerverot won a large sum in the city lottery of [[Mainz]]. In 1769, he came to [[Weesp]], and worked in the porcelain factory of [[Bertrand Philip, count of Gronsveld]], former envoy in Berlin, and now [[landdrost|drost]] of [[Muiden]] and president of the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]]. Production and activity did not take off and thus this enterprise, Holland's first porcelain factory, closed in 1771. Gerverot left for the [[faience]]- or porcelain factory of [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Höchst Porzellanmanufaktur|Höchst]] and [[Ellwangen]]. In nearby Schrezheim, Gerverot worked at his own expense.  

Minister [[Joannes de Mol]] sent Gerverot a portrait of a minister-colleague in 1774 from which he made a bust, and in return de Mol brought Gerverot up to [[Oud-Loosdrecht]] as a manager, painter and pigment-maker. The designing of new models was not his strongest suit, but nevertheless Gerverot deserved his new salary, of 150 guilder per month.

===Amsterdam===
Gerverot possibly lived an unconventional life, as may be seen from the fact that in 1776 he witnessed the christening of a child in the French Roman Catholic chapel. The child was named Louis Victor George d' Onis, with his father noted as George Alexander d' Onis and his mother a black woman, named Coba. The legality of their marriage was called into doubt by the authorities.  

Gerverot in 1777 married Modesta Johanna Salomons, from Hamburg. In Amsterdam, they had three children:  Louis Victor (born 1778), Johannes Victor (born 1780) and Georg Samuel (born in 1783, but buried in Amsterdam in 1784). L.V. Gerverot lived in the Plantage ([[plantation]]), then a large park with inns, speelhuizen (playhouses, where billiards was played) and brothels, now [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]] and its surroundings. All his children were baptized at home, since he did not belong to a particular church.  

On 1 March 1779, Gerverot was dismissed in [[Loosdrecht]], having lent De Mol 28,000 guilder. Cooperation seemed to be impossible. Gerverot opened a porcelain store in Amsterdam, but early in 1788 had to declare bankruptcy.  (This period in the life of Gerverot is unclear. It may be that he also worked in [[Cologne]], [[Münster]] and [[Hanover]]).  

Gerverot traveled to England and took employment with [[Turner (potters)|John Turner]], one of [[Wedgwood]]'s most significant competitors. In 1795, his purse again empty, he arrived in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and was taken on once more at the Fürstenberg factory. Two years later he was its manager. Under his leadership the factory became commercially successful for the first time in its existence. In 1814, Gerverot was dismissed for collaboration with the French. He died at [[Bevern, Lower Saxony|Bevern]].

'''Maurice Robert Josse Marie Ghislain, Count Lippens''' (born 9 May 1943 in [[Knokke]], [[Belgium]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman and [[banker]]. He is the grandson of [[Maurice Lippens (governor)|Maurice Lippens]] (1875) and brother of Leopold Lippens, mayor of [[Knokke-Heist]].

==Education==
He obtained a [[doctorate]] in [[law]] from the [[Universite Libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB) ([[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]) in 1967, and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree from the [[Harvard Business School]] ([[United States|U.S.]]) in 1972.

==Career==
He started his professional career in [[South Africa]] to assist with reorganisation of the ''Maatschappij voor Zeevisserij'' where he stayed for five months, and then fulfilled his military service in the Belgian army. this was
followed by traineeships at the ''[[Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas]]'' (financial analysis) and then the {{Interlanguage link multi|Société Générale de Banque|nl|3=Generale Bank}} with a traineeship in financial management. After he graduated from Harvard Business School (MBA), he held management positions at ''Scienta S.A.'', the ''Société Européenne de Venture Capital'', whose shareholders are the [[Agnelli|Agnelli Group]], [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild Group]], [[Société Générale de Belgique]], [[Robert Bosch]] and [[Paribas]] (France). He then took over a company in [[Brussels]] on his own account, the main department of which was resold in 1979.

Maurice Lippens joined the {{Interlanguage link multi|AG Group|nl|3=AG Groep}} in 1981, in 1983 becoming Managing Director and then Chairman / Managing Director in 1988. He has been the Chairman of [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] since 1990, but was relieved of his position after a government bailout of the bank in September 2008.
The bailout came after Fortis had been over ambitious and made Fortis take over [[ABN-AMRO]], an acquisition Fortis could probably not afford and therefore Fortis was close to bankruptcy when the government took over.

Mr Lippens has been involved in numerous [[law suit]]s and has been blamed by many for the downfall of Fortis due to his over ambitious merger plan with ABN Amro during the economic crisis.

==Other positions==
Director Total, Director [[Groupe Bruxelles Lambert|GBL]] (Group Bruxelles Lambert), Director [[Belgacom]], Director [[Suez-Tractebel]], Chairman [[Companie Het Zoute]], Director {{Interlanguage link multi|Iscal Sugar|nl}}, Director [[Finasucre]], Director [[Groupe Sucrier]], Member Trilateral Commission, Member [[Harvard Business School European Advisory Council]], Member [[Insead Belgium Council]]. He is a member of the Belgian businessclub [[Cercle de Lorraine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12220">'''Mossom Boyd''' (7 December 1814 &amp;ndash; 24 July 1883) was an Anglo-Irish entrepreneur who developed and operated a large lumber business on the Trent river system in [[Ontario, Canada]].&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;Curtis, C. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mossom-boyd/ "Mossom Boyd"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Mossom Boyd was born in [[India]] to Captain Gardiner Boyd, ‘a North of Ireland officer of the [[Bengal Army]],’ and his wife Arabella Chadwick.&lt;ref name="Wurtele, J 1958. p. 177"&gt;Wurtele, J. ‘Mossom Boyd: Lumber King of the Trent Valley.’ Ontario Historical Society L:4 (1958.) p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his parents died in 1829 during the [[cholera]] epidemic, after which, Mossom Boyd and his sister Anne were sent to live with guardians in London.&lt;ref name=barker14&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because their behaviour was considered ‘difficult’, they were promptly relocated to Ireland’s [[Derry]] district to live with an aunt.&lt;ref name=barker14 /&gt; Boyd expected to be called upon to serve in the [[British Army]], but after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] fewer men were recruited. At the same time, modern production methods were reducing other opportunities for employment in Ireland.  Boyd, encouraged by his friend John Darcus, decided to join the many others emmigrating to Britain’s [[North American]] colonies, and left for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Gallery. {{cite web |url=http://www.canadianheritage.org/books/canada6.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917085908/http://www.canadianheritage.org/books/canada6.htm |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }} (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life in Canada ===
Landing in Canada in 1834, Boyd made the long trek to his newly acquired {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land in Verulam Township.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, Boyd began clearing the land, and soon befriended some of the ‘gentleman' farmers, including members of the Need, Langton, and Dunsford families.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, L. [http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7233 Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online](2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The connections made with these members of the local gentry helped Boyd make the transition from working farmer to a successful entrepreneur.  [[Anne Langton]] described him as a ‘most resolute home-stayer and a very industrious settler,’ who ‘has chopped all his own land himself.’&lt;ref&gt;Langton, A. A Gentlewoman in Upper Canada. (Canada: Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company Ltd. 1950.) p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; She declared ‘he is a favourite of mine; he is not brilliant or animated, but has much goodness and kindness, and simplicity of character, and is an example to all our young men for industry, attention to business, and study of economy.’&lt;ref&gt;Langton, A.  A Gentlewoman in Upper Canada. (Canada: Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company Ltd. 1950.) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844 Boyd solidified his connections with John Langton and the Dunsford family by marrying Caroline Dunsford.  This led to a short-lived partnership between Boyd and John Langton.&lt;ref name=curtis /&gt; In 1845 Mossom and Caroline’s first son, Gardiner Boyd, was born.  Caroline and Mossom had six children altogether: Gardiner, Anne, Mary Arabella, Caroline, Mossom Martin, and Emma Blackall.&lt;ref name="Boyd Genealogy 1998"&gt;Boyd Genealogy: Boyd Heritage Museum. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd’s wife Caroline died a year after the birth of her last child, Emma, in 1857; Boyd was left with six children under twelve.  Unable to maintain his business while caring for the children Boyd contacted Letitia Magee Cust, a childhood friend from Derry, proposing marriage.&lt;ref name=barker18&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  He warned her that she ‘may not find me at all what you imagine or be able to conceive what effects such a rough life may have had on me, both in appearance and in all other respects.’&lt;ref name=barker18 /&gt; Letitia agreed to undertake the long journey alone to [[Bobcaygeon]].  Upon her arrival she married Boyd and took control over house and children, eventually adding to the brood with three of her own, one of which died.&lt;ref name="Boyd Genealogy 1998"/&gt;   Mossom Martin attended school until age sixteen, after which he worked in his father's lumbering business.  One of Boyd’s other sons, William (W.T.C.) from his marriage with Letitia, was also inducted into the family business.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 an addition was built over the south wing of the Boyd home; these new rooms were for Boyd’s private use during his illness.&lt;ref&gt;Short, P.D. ‘The Boyd House and a Century of the Boyd Enterprises.’ Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 1969.) p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Mossom Boyd died on the evening of July 24, 1883, and was buried in the [[Peterborough]] cemetery on July 27, 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, W. T.C. ‘Diary.’ p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lumbering ==
Boyd was a hard worker, clearing all of his own land upon arrival in Verulam Township.  When after a few years Boyd found farming to be less profitable than expected, he hired himself out to mind Thomas Need’s sawmill and store, on the site which is now Bobcaygeon, while Need returned to England for business.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This provided Boyd with some cash, and opportunity for future advancement.  Need increasingly relied on Boyd to look after his property and mill as he made more and more frequent trips to England.  On March 15, 1843 Need began leasing ‘part of lot 15 in Concession X, Verulam, the mill reserve, with "[[gristmill]], [[sawmill]] and tenement thereon", for a term of seven years,’ costing £40 per annum to Boyd.&lt;ref&gt;Short, P.D. ‘The Boyd House and a Century of the Boyd Enterprises.’ Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 1969) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year as Boyd’s marriage to Caroline (1844) Need received his inheritance, which enabled him to permanently return to England.

John Langton writes about Boyd: &lt;blockquote&gt;
‘Boyd is an Irishman whose blood got an extra boiling by being born in India… Boyd is admirably adapted in many respects for the work he is at.  When a raft is once started almost everything must yield to dispatch, and a restless being who can keep himself and everything that comes in contact with him in a state of excitement for two or three months at a time is just the man to drive a river." &lt;ref&gt;Wurtele, J. ‘Mossom Boyd: Lumber King of the Trent Valley.’ Ontario Historical Society L:4 (1958.) p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because of Langton's ill-health, Boyd and Langton’s partnership in 1849 did not last, and upon his recovery in 1851, Langton made a transition from lumbering to politics.&lt;ref name="Wurtele, J 1958. p. 177"/&gt;

In 1851, Need leased his roughly {{convert|8|acre|m2}}, and two mills to Boyd for 21 years with an annual rent of  £15 a year for the first seven years. Boyd was given the right to purchase the lot and mills for £500 after five years.  By paying £100 a year Boyd was able to buy Need out by 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Short, P.D. ‘The Boyd House and a Century of the Boyd Enterprises.’ Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 1969) p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quebec ===
There was a large demand for Canadian white pine, oak, and elm, both in European and America, with the result that lumber prices were high.&lt;ref name="Wurtele, J 1958. p. 177"/&gt; Conditions at the [[Quebec City]] harbour were conducive to [[lumber]] trade,&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and the superior quality of Boyd’s pine logs gave him an edge in the competitive Quebec market.  Boyd manned his first river driving expedition to Quebec City in 1848, with the help of a neighbour, Kelly.&lt;ref name=barker47&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  He began his journey early in the spring with a quantity of masts, but the strong current caused by melting snow and heavy rainfall delayed their arrival at Peterborough until July, three months after they began.  At this point Kelly dropped out; Boyd continued on, reaching Quebec late in the season, and selling all of the pine.&lt;ref name=barker47 /&gt;

The following year, Boyd formed a partnership with John Langton and James Dunsford, but both lacked enthusiasm for the Quebec trade and soon removed themselves from the business.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Langton remained involved with Boyd after he withdrew, often backing Boyd when his credit was low.  After 1851 Boyd operated on his own. Boyd was one of the last lumbermen to participate in the Quebec market.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===

Around the 1850s Mossom Boyd began to expand his lumbering activities.  He purchased Crown land ‘in the northern part of Verulam as well as in Somerville and Harvey townships.’&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd was able to clear these lands of their best pine, and later sell them to prospective settlers.  These partially cleared lands were a more favourable purchase for the settlers, who often found clearing heavily forested areas daunting.

In the 1860s the Department of Crown lands began to recognize the advantages of having land cleared before settlement commenced.  The Crown auctioned rights to clear Snowdon, Glamorgan, and Monmouth townships, which Boyd was able to acquire.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time these rights would remain available to Boyd was not guaranteed, so he was reluctant to expand further without gaining a contract that would survive a minimum of ten years.  The opportune moment came in 1861, when The Canadian Land &amp; Emigration Company purchased the townships which are now in the county of [[Haliburton County, Ontario|Haliburton]].  Because fewer than eighty families moved onto the land that they had purchased from CL&amp;E, the company decided to sell one township with little viable farmland to the lumbering company Thompson and Dodge.&lt;ref name=barker82&gt;Barker, G. Timber Empire. (Huntsville: Fox Meadow Creations. 1997) p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The outright sale of the land angered company member C.R. Stewart, who resigned. He advised his brother Hartley Stewart to contract with a lumberman to harvest the larger trees in the remaining nine townships.&lt;ref name=barker82 /&gt; With existing operations on the Trent water system, Boyd was able to get the cutting rights on Canadian Land &amp; Emigration Company Land for ten years.

Boyd's business expanded as far as [[Ottawa]] and Quebec, and by 1882 he had begun sending rangers to explore [[Nipissing District, Ontario|Nipissing]], Manitoba, and [[Minnesota]].  A [[Gravenhurst, Ontario|Gravenhurst]] firm cut the lumber from his land in Havelock, which was later, shipped into [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;Short, P.D. ‘The Boyd House and a Century of the Boyd Enterprises.’ Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 1969) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, lumbering around northern Peterborough had come to a halt, as well as in Burnt River. His last timber raft went to Quebec in 1883.

== Legacy ==
Mossom Boyd’s lumbering company was taken over by his two sons: Mossom Martin Boyd, and William Thornton Cust Boyd.  They continued to operate the company until the [[First World War]].

'''Nasser David Khalili''' ({{lang-fa|ناصر داوود خلیلی}}, born 18 December 1945) is a [[British Iranian|British-Iranian]] scholar, [[collecting|collector]], and philanthropist based in London. He is a British citizen.&lt;ref name=Zeshin&gt;"Biographical Notes" in Earle, Joe (ed.) ''Shibata Zeshin: Masterpieces of Japanese Lacquer from the Khalili Collection''. London: Kibo Foundation, 1997. p80.&lt;/ref&gt; Khalili is the founder of the Khalili Collections, which is said to include the finest and most comprehensive collection of Islamic art in private hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing the world with art|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/healing-the-world-with-art-560103.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=April 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalili was born in [[Iran]], before leaving the country to study in the [[United States]]. He graduated from [[Queens College, City University of New York]] in 1974 with a computer science degree. He later received a PhD degree in Islamic art in 1988, from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], London, writing his thesis on Islamic [[lacquer]].

He first started to collect art in New York during the 1970s, while also spending a lot of time in London investing in property during the 1980s. Over the coming decades, Khalili created eight distinct art collections under the auspices of the Khalili Family Trust. Khalili is said to have initially generated capital in the 1980s through the sale of a company and also [[venture capital]]. Since then his wealth has grown substantially, which he stated in an interview was due to "dealing in art, commodities and real estate." Khalili is known for the purchase of a number of large properties in London. One of his properties in [[Kensington Palace Gardens]], was sold to [[Bernie Ecclestone]] for £57 million. He was also the co-owner of Sixty London on [[Holborn Viaduct]], London. It is currently leased by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] as their London office.

In 1995, he founded the Maimonides Interfaith Foundation where he serves as Chairman. Khalili is a [[UNESCO]] [[Goodwill Ambassador]] and has addressed a number of high-level dignitaries on behalf of the [[United Nations]] and UNESCO. He is also a trustee of the City of Jerusalem and has received knighthoods from two Popes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maimonides Interfaith Foundation|url=http://www.charterforcompassion.org/index.php/maimonides-interfaith-foundation|publisher=Charter for Compassion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jerusalem&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Khalili Trustee of the City of Jerusalem certificate|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/Prof._Khalili_Trustee_of_the_City_of_Jerusalem_certificate.jpg|publisher=[[Wikimedia commons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goodwill&gt;{{cite web|title=British entrepreneur Nasser David Khalili named UNESCO goodwill ambassador|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43298|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have drawn up different values for his works over the years, many valuations were made without public knowledge of what the collections contained. More accurate values have been published more recently after publications and [[art exhibition|exhibition]]s demonstrated what the collections contained.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

When asked about his [[art collection|collections]] and wealth, Khalili stated in an interview that he "took it upon himself to buy everything that was available...I found things that belonged to a great heritage that was just sitting there unnoticed...They were displaced from history and deserved to be preserved and recognised".&lt;ref name=FTMay12/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Khalili was born in 1945 in the city of [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]], the fourth of five children, to a Jewish family of art dealers and traders of artefacts.&lt;ref name=BloomMar10&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-03-29/iranian-student-with-750-turns-billionaire-made-by-islamic-art|title=Iranian Student with $750 Turns Billionaire Made by Islamic Art|date=30 March 2010|author=William Green|work=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalili and his family moved to [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], when he was only a few months old. By the age of eight, he was accompanying his father on buying expeditions, often buying items such as [[lacquerware|Persian lacquer]] and other Islamic arts.&lt;ref name=ESMar09&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollingsworth|first1=Mark|title=The Treasure Seeker|publisher=[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard magazine]]|date=March 27, 2009|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied in [[Tehran]] and wrote a book about the "geniuses of the world", aged 14. It was suggested in many news articles that Khalili had written the book following an argument with one of his teachers. After the book was published, Khalili featured on television discussing his book and also wrote columns in newspapers.&lt;ref name=IndDec92&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Geraldine|title=Art Market: Mysterious gifts from the East: Who is the man who has collected Islam's finest treasures and offered them to Britain as a pounds 1bn bequest? Geraldine Norman finds out|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-market-mysterious-gifts-from-the-east-who-is-the-man-who-has-collected-islams-finest-treasures-1563284.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|archivedate=March 8, 2015|date=December 13, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalili completed his national service in Iran as a medic in the Iranian Army,&lt;ref name='Debretts'&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Nasser D. Khalili|url=http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/28828/Nasser-David-KHALILI|work=Debretts People of Today|publisher=[[Debretts]]|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before leaving [[Iran]] in 1967 for the [[United States]] with $750 earned from sales of his book. He studied [[computer science]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in the subject at [[Queens College, City University of New York]], and graduated in 1974.&lt;ref name=BloomMar10/&gt;

==Business and collecting career==
Khalili started his business career trading in art, before moving into property development and commodities. Khalili began collecting art in [[New York City]] in the 1970s, keeping the best pieces for his own collection.&lt;ref name=IndDec92/&gt;&lt;ref name=FTMay12&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f526cb06-98f5-11e1-9da3-00144feabdc0.html|title=A leap of faith|date=May 12, 2012|author=Susan Moore|work=[[The Financial Times]]|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began visiting [[London]] auction houses in the mid 1970s, and established his own gallery in [[Mayfair]], [[London]] between in 1978 to 1980.&lt;ref name=ESMar09/&gt; Khalili initially traded in Persian [[lacquerware]], and subsequently wrote a thesis on the subject, receiving a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in Islamic art from [[SOAS, University of London]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=IndDec92/&gt; His focus on [[lacquerware]] also coincided with many undervaluing this art form. In 1978, the price of [[Islamic art]] fell substantially according to an article in [[Saudi Aramco World]].&lt;ref name=aramco&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Tahir|title=The Khalili Collection of Islamic Art|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/199406/the.khalili.collection.of.islamic.art.htm|publisher=[[Saudi Aramco World]]|date=December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aramco World stated in the article that Khalili continued to invest in [[Islamic art]] during this period and this was one of the reasons he was able to acquire so many quality works for low prices.&lt;ref name=aramco /&gt;

People close to Khalili stated that he invested wisely and often discreetly. In a [[London Evening Standard]] article, Michael Spink stated the following about Khalili's collection and growth of wealth; ''"he would buy items for £2,000 which, over a long period, appreciated to £200,000. People did not always realise that it was him doing the buying."'' Khalili's dealership was based in [[Mayfair]]'s Clifford Street in the 1980s. When asked directly how he had gathered his wealth during the 1970s and 1980s, Khalili stated it was from sugar and coffee trading, the options market, property investments and works of art.&lt;ref name=ESMar09 /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, the scale of Khalili's collection greatly expanded. In the early 1990s, he began to publish a 27-volume catalogue of his Islamic art collection, for which he commissioned a number of leading [[Islamic]] [[scholar]]s. In 1992, he was interviewed by [[The Independent]] following the launch of the first volume of this catalogue of [[Islamic art]]. According to the article, suspicions in the art industry were that Khalili was assembling the collection on behalf of a rich investor. The release of the collection under his own name stopped those suspicions and showed Khalili's collection as belonging to himself and his family.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Geraldine|title=Art Market: Mysterious gifts from the East: Who is the man who has collected Islam's finest treasures and offered them to Britain as a pounds 1bn bequest?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-market-mysterious-gifts-from-the-east-who-is-the-man-who-has-collected-islams-finest-treasures-1563284.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=December 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, Khalili was an art advisor to [[Hassanal Bolkiah]], The Sultan of Brunei. Khalili subsequently helped persuade the sultan to donate £10 million to create the Brunei Gallery at [[SOAS, University of London]].&lt;ref name=independent /&gt;&lt;ref name=BloomMar10/&gt;

In 1992, Khalili offered to lend his [[Islamic art]] collection to the British government for a period of 15 years and on condition it is publicly displayed in a "museum building in central [[London]]." It was suggested that the [[museum]] would be known as the Khalili Museum, with the running costs of the museum and insurance to be publicly funded. The offer was made with the potential for turning the donation into a gift at the expiration of the 15-year period. The Conservative politician [[Lord Young of Graffham]] and the public relations executive [[Tim Bell|Lord Bell]] lobbied the government to accept Khalili's offer.&lt;ref name=IndDec92/&gt; Many expressed an interest in the proposal by Khalili for a [[London]]-based Islamic museum, including [[Prince Charles]].

==Khallili Collections==
Khalili has assembled eight distinct [[art collection]]s under the auspices of the Khalili Family Trust and they are collectively referred to as the Khalili Collections. The collections are divided into [[Islamic Art]], with artifacts dating from 700 to 2000; Hajj and the Arts of Pilgrimage from 700 to 2000; Aramaic Documents from 535BC to 324 BC; Japanese Art of the Meiji Period from 1868 to 1912; Japanese Kimono from 1700 to 2000; Swedish Textiles from 1700 to 1900; Spanish Damascened Metalwork from 1850 to 1900 and Enamels of the World from 1700 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight Collections|url=http://www.khalili.org|publisher=The Khalili Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khalili Collection of Islamic Art is a 27-volume series, which was curated by Dr. Julian Raby, the Director of the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] and the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]. The collection has holdings of more than 28,000 objects documenting arts from Islamic lands over a period of 1,400 years. It ranks amongst the best collection of its kind in the world. Calligraphy plays an essential role in [[Islamic art]] and has a central place in the collection. It includes manuscripts of the Holy [[Qur'an]], along with decorative arts of Miniature Paintings, Bookbinding, Lacquer, Pottery and Ceramics, Glass and Rock Crystal, Metalwork, Scientific Instruments, Arms and Armour, Jewellery, Carpets and Textiles, Coins and Architecture.&lt;ref name=khalilicollections&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Khalili Family Trust|title=The Khalili Collections - A Publication and Exhibition History|date=2014|publisher=Park Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hajj and the arts of pilgrimage collection is one of the most important groups of works globally, relating to [[Hajj]] and the arts associated with it. The works in the collection range from the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]] to the 20th century. The collection aims to represent an overview of the subject, illustrating various religious and artistic aspects of the pilgrimages to various [[holy city|holy cities]]. The collection contains approximately 3,000 objects, including over 250 textiles and many other objects relating to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. The combined collection is the second largest collection of its kind, with the [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapı Palace museum]] the only larger collection globally.&lt;ref name=khalilicollections /&gt;

The Khalili Collection of Aramaic documents is a small but special collection of 48 [[Aramaic]] documents from [[Bactria|Ancient Bactria]]. The majority of the collection is made up of part letters and accounts connected with the court of the [[Satrap]] of [[Bactria]]. The significance of the documents is that they are the oldest correspondence of the administration of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]]. The documents are written in [[Old Aramaic language|Official Aramaic]] and were likely from the historical city of [[Balkh]]. The documents are dated in a period of less than 30 years, between 353BC to 324BC. The newest of the documents were written during [[Alexander the Great]]'s early reign in the region.&lt;ref name=khalilicollections /&gt;

The Japanese Art of the [[Meiji period]] collection is made up of the world's greatest collection of [[Meiji period|Meiji]] decorative art. It comprises over 1,400 pieces in the collection, including metalwork, enamels, Lacquerwork and ceramics. The pieces are from the period of [[Emperor Meiji]]'s rule from 1868-1912. The period saw an art revolution in [[Japan]], where traditional tastes in Japan were met with international tastes. From the beginning of Meiji's reign in Japan, European and international collectors have avidly sought pieces of Japanese art from this era.&lt;ref name=khalilicollections /&gt;

Khalili's second Japanese-based collection is The Khalili Collection of [[kimono]]. The collection consists of three hundred years of the [[Japan]]ese [[textile]] industry and contains over 450 garments. While the [[kimono]]'s t-shaped design hasn't altered much over the centuries, yet the collection reveals an astonishing variety in [[kimono]] designs. The garments have been used to demonstrate gender, age, status and wealth throughout Japan's history. The collection represents four separate period's, the [[Edo period]] (1603-1868), the [[Meiji period]] (1868-1912), [[Taisho]] (1912-1926) and early [[Shōwa period|Showa]] (1926-1989).&lt;ref name=khalilicollections /&gt;

The Khalili Collection of Swedish Textiles comprises textile panels, dating between 1700-1900. The majority of the works are from a one hundred-year period, when little is known about the area of [[Scania]], the southern-most region of [[Sweden]]. The textile collection contains art mostly made for wedding ceremonies in the region. While they played a part in the ceremonies, they were also a reflection of the artistry and skill of the weaver. Their designs often consist of symbolic illustrations of fertility and long life, along with a sense of hope and joy. The entire collection is made up of 95 pieces.&lt;ref name=khalilicollections /&gt;

Spanish damascene metalwork collection, is one of the largest collections of its kind. The collection pay homage to the Zuloga family, who played a major part in the preservation of damascening in [[Spain]]. The collection contains some of the most important pieces commissioned by Plácido Zuloga between 1834-1910. Some of the pieces were originally acquired by the great 19th-century English collector, Alfred Morrison. The entire collection contains over 100 pieces, 22 of which are signed by Plácido Zuloga. The collection is said to be an excellent representation of Spanish metalwork art during the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=khalilicollections /&gt;

The formation of the Enamels of the World collection was based upon the global significance of enamelling. The entire collection consists of over 1,300 pieces and seeks to explore the unique art form in a wider scope. What makes the collection unique, is enamels are usually studied with a particular focus, such as a geographical region, era or enamelling technique. The collection aims to tell a story of how enamelling has evolved throughout history on a global scale.&lt;ref name=khalilicollections /&gt;

Together, the eight collections comprise some 35,000 works. The Khalili Collections will be fully represented in a series of 100 books, including exhibition catalogues, of which 72 have already been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=afLUS9oJKzr4&amp;refer=uk | work=Bloomberg | title=Mittal Tops Sunday Times U.K. Rich List; Billionaire Club Grows | date=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalili estimated that the publication of the catalogues and associated research papers would cost him between £20-30 million.&lt;ref name=IndDec92/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Khalili's collections have featured in numerous museums and specialist exhibitions around the world. Selected objects from his collections have been shown in several major worldwide museums and been displayed as part of international exhibitions such as the British Museum,&lt;ref name="FTMay12"/&gt; the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and Somerset House (London); the State Hermitage Museum (St Petersburg); the Alhambra Palace (Granada); the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York); Portland Art Museum (Oregon, US); and the Van Gogh Museum (Amsterdam) to name a few.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The majority of Khalili's artworks are kept in storage in London and Geneva.&lt;ref name=ESMar09/&gt;

==Property development==

===18–19 Kensington Palace Gardens===
[[File:18-19 Kensington palace Gardens London.jpg|thumb|right|250px|18–19 Kensington Palace Gardens]]
In 1995 Khalili bought 18 and 19 [[Kensington Palace Gardens]] for £40 million. 19 had been the former Egyptian embassy and 18 was formerly part of the Russian embassy.&lt;ref name=ESMar09/&gt; Khalili's purchase of the property and its subsequent refurbishment cost £84 million. The works involving 400 craftsmen were believed to have been second in scale only to the restoration of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire. Marble was imported from the same Indian quarry that had been used to build the [[Taj Mahal]] for pillars for the building. It was bought by businessman [[Bernie Ecclestone]] in 2001 for £54 million. Ecclestone later sold the property to industrialist [[Lakshmi Mittal]].&lt;ref name=TelegMar06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/4946068/Bernie-Ecclestone-sold-57m-dream-home-after-his-wife-refused-to-move-in.html|title=Bernie Ecclestone sold £57m dream home after his wife refused to move in|date=6 March 2009|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixty London===
[[File:Sixty London.jpg|thumb|right|250px|60 Holborn Viaduct]]
In 1997, Khalili bought Bath House, an office building on [[Holborn Viaduct]] for £7 million. In 2007 planning permission was granted for an 11-storey office building called The Wave and subsequently in 2009 Khalili acquired the freehold from the crown estates. The building, which eventually completed in 2013, designed by the architects Kohn Pederson Fox Associates. Since 2010 the project had been a partnership between Khalili's property company Favermead and AXA Real Estate Investment Managers.&lt;ref name=EGiDec10&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.egi.co.uk/news/axa-real-estate-and-favermead-complete-bath-house-tie-up/|title=AXA Real Estate and Favermead complete Bath House tie-up|date=2 December 2010|author=James Buckley|work=[[Estates Gazette]]|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new 230,000 sq ft building was later leased by Amazon in 2013.&lt;ref name=ESMay10&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/qataris-have-sticky-time-while-judge-struggles-to-tell-ancient-from-modern-6474850.html|title=Qataris have sticky time while judge struggles to tell ancient from modern|date=28 May 2010|work=[[Evening Standard]]|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teleg13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10089867/Amazon-signs-lease-on-210000-sq-ft-central-London-offices.html|title=Amazon signs lease on 210,000 sq ft central London offices|date=28 May 2010|author=Christopher Williams|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the building became one of the 13 winners in the [[Urban Land Institute]]’s Global Awards for Excellence, citing the blending of modern and historic architectural elements.&lt;ref name=Uli14&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uli.org/awards/sixty-london-2014-global-awards-excellence-finalist/|title=Sixty London 2014 Global Awards for Excellence|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
===Philanthropic work===
Through his foundations and trusts, Khalili has made many substantial donations to a number of different organisations, institutions, and charities. Donations in the field of education include an endowment of £2.5 million to the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=£2m gift for Middle Eastern art|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/3879653.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=July 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds were used for the establishment of the Khalili Research Centre for the Art and Material Culture of the Middle East, which was opened by the Chancellor of [[Oxford University]], [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten]], in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/krc/index.php/en/|title=The Khalili Research Centre|author=Webmaster|publisher=[[Oxford University]]|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khalili Family Trust’s support continues to the present day, notably with another substantial donation in 2011.

In 1989, Khalili donated £600,000 to establish The Khalili Chair of Islamic Art at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]]. He also gave a further £200,000 in 2003 for the refurbishment of the lecture theatre at the school. Furthermore, in 1992, he made an endowment of £51,000 to the University of Oxford for a Research Fellowship in Islamic Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Chairman|url=http://www.maimonides-foundation.org/about-us/chairman/|publisher=Maimonides Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial==
In a 2010 interview Khalili said that his collecting in the mid 1980s was funded by his dealings in [[venture capital]], having profited from shares in a company that developed technology to treat tumors, and that he made $15 million from the sale of a company that manufactured indigestion pills in 1987.&lt;ref name=BloomMar10/&gt; In 1992, Khalili had described his wealth as deriving from "dealing in art, commodities and real estate".&lt;ref name=IndDec92/&gt; Khalili has said that his collecting was primarily funded by his property investments from 1980.&lt;ref name=BloomMar10/&gt;

In 2007 Khalili's wealth was estimated at £5.8 billion by the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'', but he was removed from subsequent editions of the list. In 2007 and 2008 ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated Khalili's wealth at $1.3 billion, but he dropped off the 2014 edition of the list.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/nasser-khalili/|title=Nasser Khalili|work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 ''The Art Newspaper'' wrote that 'a £1 billion valuation is believed more likely' than previously claimed higher amounts.&lt;ref name=ESMar09/&gt; Khalili has claimed that he has spent $650 million on art.&lt;ref name=ESMar09/&gt;

The '''New Zealand Framework (NZ Framework)''' is an accounting conceptual framework based on the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) Framework. It was issued by the [[Financial Reporting Standards Board]] (FRSB) of the [[New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants]] and approved by the [[Accounting Standards Review Board]] in [July] 2004 under the Financial Reporting Act 1993. At the time the framework was issued, New Zealand financial reporting standards were sector-neutral.  Accordingly, relative to the IASB Framework, the NZ Framework incorporates additional material applicable to public benefit entities.

The NZ Framework outlines the concepts which underpin information presented in general purpose financial statements, and in non-financial information which is included in or accompanies the financial statements.  It is used by the FRSB in working with the IASB to develop [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) or in developing local Financial Reporting Standards (FRS).  It may also be used by various parties to the financial reporting process (e.g., preparers, [[auditors]], etc.) as a basis for the application of judgment in resolving accounting issues.

'''Old Street''' is a [[street]] in central and east [[London]] that runs west to east from [[Goswell Road]] in [[Clerkenwell]], in the [[London Borough of Islington]], via [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] and [[Old Street Roundabout]], to the crossroads where it meets [[Shoreditch High Street]] (south), [[Kingsland Road]] (north) and [[Hackney Road]] (east) in [[Shoreditch]] in the [[London Borough of Hackney]].

The nearest [[List of London Underground stations|London Underground station]] is [[Old Street tube station|Old Street]] on the [[Northern line]]. It is also on the [[National Rail]] [[Northern City Line]].

The western part of Old Street, the area in central London, is inside the boundary of the Central London Congestion Charging Zone.

==History==
[[File:Finsbury Met. B Ward Map 1952.svg|thumb|left|A map showing Old Street ward of Finsbury Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1952.]]
Old Street was recorded as ''Ealdestrate'' in about 1200, and ''le Oldestrete'' in 1373. As befits its name there are some suggestions that the road is of ancient origin. It lies on the route of an old Roman or possibly pre-Roman track connecting [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]] and [[Camulodunum|Colchester]], skirting round the walls of [[Londinium]], today the areas known as the [[City of London]]. 

The western part was widened between 1872 and 1877, but it narrows east of Coronet Street; there survive, at Nos. 340-342 on the south side of the street and Nos. 323 and 325-329 on the north side, some domestic buildings from the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, though somewhat battered and altered in function. At the east end of Old Street there is a notable deviation of the line of the street as it joins the old Roman Road north to [[York]]. This deviation is visible on old maps but unexplained, and is today fronted by [[Shoreditch Town Hall]] and the former Shoreditch Magistrates Court (now a hotel). Together with [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]] at the east end of Old Street, this was the civic hub of the former [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch]].

The eastern half of the road is on the [[London Inner Ring Road]] and forms part of the boundary of the [[London congestion charge]] zone. Old Street and the surrounding areas of [[Hoxton Square]] and Great Eastern Street host a thriving night life. The street and its adjacent areas have attracted IT and tech companies, both established and start-ups, and Old Street Roundabout, located at the junction with [[City Road]], has been dubbed [[Old_Street_Roundabout#Silicon_Roundabout|Silicon Roundabout]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/silicon-roundabout London's Silicon Roundabout] Wired UK, 29 January 2010, accessed November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Street station]] is located under the roundabout. With the increase in passenger numbers using the station, in 2014 [[Transport for London]] announced that it was to offer [[pop-up retail]] space there as part of a drive to increase its revenue.&lt;ref&gt;https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/april/pop-up-shops-arrive-at-old-street-tube-station-to-reflect-the-vibrancy-of-tech-city&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the past few years Old Street has become a favoured location for notable graffiti artists such as [[Banksy]] and [[Jef Aérosol]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Banksy has featured several pieces on "Shoreditch Bridge".&lt;ref name="Bankys Old Street Art"&gt;[http://www.artofthestate.co.uk/Banksy/Banksy_Have_A_Nice_day_cops.htm "Example of Banksy Art on Old Street"], 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pakola''', derived from '''Pakistan-Cola'''  is a line of flavored carbonated [[soft drink]]s originating from [[Pakistan]]. It is produced and manufactured by '''Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited'''.

==Origin==
[[Pakola]] was the creation of seven brothers from the [[Teli]] [[Family]] of Surat who migrated to [[Pakistan]] in [[1947]]. The idea of Pakola came from its founder [[Haji Ali Mohammad]] who had a dream to develop a drink that portrays the true reflection and taste of Pakistan. In order to pursue his dream, Haji Ali Mohammad opened a small factory with only two machines at the Lawrence Road (still known as Pakolagali) in Karachi with Pakola Ice-cream Soda being the initial product. 

The famous iconic drink Pakola was launched at the Pakistan Air Force Base on the day of Pakistan’s Independence, 14th August 1950, in the presence of the 1st Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan. Since then, Pakola has made an enduring association between itself as a brand and the country. 

Later when [[Pakistan Beverages]] (PB) came into existence at SITE Karachi, the brand Pakola was produced there. In [[1979]] when Pakistan Beverages was announced as a production facility for [[PEPSI]], Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited came into existence and continued to produce the iconic drink Pakola along with other products like [[Apple Sidra]] and [[Bubble Up]].

Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited was managed by his nephews late Zafar Habib and Arif Habib. In 2004, Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited and Pakistan Beverages started manufacturing cans in Pakistan. 

Later in 2004, '''Zeeshan Z. Habib''' took charge as the '''Chief Executive Officer''' of Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited. Not only did he actively participate in all operational tasks but also learnt every aspect of it with keen interest and responsibility. He joined the family business soon after he graduated from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited is now among the few companies that are certified [[HALAL]], [[HACCP]], [[ISO]] and the [[FDA]]. Owning to his brilliant leadership, Pakola is one of the most successful brands in Pakistan. Pakola connects our hearts and minds with the national spirit, using the slogan '''“Dil Bola Pakola”'''.
In [[2007]], with the exception of Karachi, the Teli family gave the franchise rights of Pakola to the Leghari family who previously owned Pepsi Sukkur. The Leghari family has the right to sell Pakola nationally with the exception of Karachi, while all exports are done from the Karachi plant. 

Pakola is one of the benchmark brands directly associated with the image of Pakistan. As per its slogan “Dil Bola Pakola”, Pakola is the heartbeat of the nation. 

Over the past 68 years, many [[beverages]] have been introduced in the local as well as the international market, but nothing could ever replace the taste, color and the iconic flavor of Pakola. Pakola still is the most preferred drink of Pakistani’s including those living abroad. For most people who grew up in the 80’s/90’s, Pakola evokes intense nostalgia whenever they see the brand. 

==Brand Portfolio==
Here is a list of several variants that have been introduced by Pakola:

*''Pakola Ice Cream Soda {14th Aug 1950} - Company’s Trademark Product
*''Pakola Orange'' {1985}
*''Pakola Raspberry'' {1985}
*''Pakola Lychee'' {1991}
*''Pakola Fresh Lime'' {2006}
*''Pakola Water'' {2015}
*''Pakola Pomegranate'' {2016}

==Ingredients== 
Pakola is made with carbonated water, [[sugar]], [[citric acid]], Cream Soda Artificial Flavor, Color: FD&amp;C Bleu No 1 (E 133), FD&amp;C Yellow No.5 (E 102), Sodium Benzoate {as a preservative}. A typical can of Pakola (8.5 fl ounces/250 ml) has 33 g of sugar, 15 mg of sodium, 0 g of cholestrol, 0 g fat, 0 g of protien, and 130 calories.

==Production==
Pakola is currently produced by two companies, Mehran Bottlers (Pvt) Limited and Gul Bottlers. 

==Distribution==
Pakola is now available in America, Africa, Australia, Canada, Middle East, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It the only carbonated beverage manufactured in Pakistan that is exported globally. 

==Glass Bottles==

==Discontinuation of the Glass Bottle==
Due to the introduction of the capacity tax in 2013, Pakola discontinued the production and distribution of all glass-bottled products. The tax was levied on the overall production and distribution of the machinery instead of the actual output which made it an unfair system for those with lower productions or smaller markets. After the collapse of this system, Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited instantly set up their PET lines to grasp the market once again.

==Events==
*Gulf Food Festival: One of the largest food, beverages and hospitality fair. The event attracts food and beverage industries and professionals to Dubai from all over the world. 
*Pakistan Single Country Exhibition in New Dehli: Pakola was a big hit among Indian consumers.
*Saudi Agro Expo in Riyadh
*Shan-e-Pakistan in India

==Campaigns &amp; Advertising==
'''To appeal the younger audience in terms of message and appearance, Pakola has revamped itself through different campaigns in recent years.''' 
*'''Pakistan’s 70th Indepence Day (2017-Limited Edition):'''
By launching its Limited Edition Azaadi cans in 2017, Pakola celebrated freedom and joy with Pakistan. The cans paid tribute to Quaid-e-Azam Mohd Ali Jinnah, while they also showcased the flag of Pakistan and incorporated truck art peacock motif on the cans, thereby emphasizing the brand as being the drink of Pakistan. These cans had its own attraction and uniqueness defined amongst consumers which created a buzz throughout social media appreciating Pakistan and its existence. #PakolaAurPakistan #70thBirthday.                                                                               

*'''Celebrating Pakistani Culture (2018-Limited Edition):''' 
In 2018, Pakola launched its Limited Edition cans to celebrate Pakistani Culture. These cans depicited passion, craze, patriotism and love for Pakistan. 
Each can depicts its own story exhibiting the message of peace and harmony, beautifully potraying the Pakistani culture through truck art, sharing the love for folk music, displaying our favourite sport and honoring the Pakistan armed forces.  

*'''From Retro to Contemporary (TVC):'''
A TVC was conceptualized on the theme from Retro to Contemporary. It takes you through a nostalgic journey from your early days to the present, portraying how old times have evolved but the taste, quality and fondness of Pakola has still remained the same.

==History==
ParAccel was a venture-backed company focused on developing software for data analysis.
It acquired some [[intellectual property]] from the company XPrime, which ended operations in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Warehouse appliances: boom or bust? |work= The Register |date= December 13, 2005 |author= Philip Howard |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/13/warehouse_appliances/ |accessdate= January 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ParACCEL up and running: The new boy on the data warehouse appliance block  |work= The Register |date= March 30, 2006 |author= Philip Howard |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/30/paraccel_enters_datawarehouse_market/ |accessdate= January 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was officially incorporated in February 2006, founded by Barry Zane who became chief technology officer, and was first funded by [[angel investor]]s.
In August 2006 the first series of [[venture capital]] came from  [[Mohr Davidow Ventures]], Bay Partners and Tao Venture Partners.
In 2007 the company was based in [[San Diego, California]], with an office in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. David J. Ehrlich was chief executive, and Bruce Scott, vice president of engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Company: Accelerating Business Intelligence |work= Old ParAccel web page |url= http://www.paraccel.com/company.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070820103518/http://www.paraccel.com/company.html |archivedate= August 20, 2007 |accessdate= December 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2007, a second round of $20 million included previous investors and was led by Walden Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Notice of Sale of Securities [Regulation D and Section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933], item 06 |publisher= US Securities and Exchange Commission |date= November 28, 2007 |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/07/9999999997-07-050041 |format= PDF |accessdate= November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December the company opened an office in [[Cupertino, California]] (part of [[Silicon Valley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ParAccel Secures $20 Million in Venture Financing and Opens Cupertino Office |date= December 10, 2007 |work= Press release |url= http://paraccel.com/pdf/ParAccel_Secures_Financing.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517045326/http://paraccel.com/pdf/ParAccel_Secures_Financing.pdf |archivedate= May 17, 2008 |accessdate= December 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third round of $22 million in June 2009 was led by [[Menlo Ventures]].

==Products==
In 2008 ParAccel offered two different products: Amigo and Maverick.&lt;ref name="part2"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Getting to Know ParAccel, Part II |author= Thomas C.

In contrast Maverick was designed as a stand-alone data store.&lt;ref name="part2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ParAccel Corporate Brief |work= HP partner web site |date= March 4, 2009 |url= http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/download/partner/Corporate%20Brief%20on%20ParAccel%20Data%20Warehousing%20v6_1236198035276.pdf |accessdate= January 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
ParAccel discontinued Amigo in favor of the stand-alone offering which evolved into the ParAccel Analytic Database (PADB).{{When |date= January 2014}}

The ParAccel Analytic Database was a parallel relational database system using a [[shared-nothing architecture]] with a columnar orientation, [[adaptive compression]], memory-centric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Partial join order optimization in the paraccel analytic database |work= Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data |pages= 905–908 |authors= Yijou Chen,  Richard L.

ParAccel's DBMS engine is built for analytics, initially based on [[PostgreSQL]].  ParAccel began phasing in a new optimizer (Omne) in release 2.0 and made significant changes to Omne in subsequent releases (3.1 released in June 2011).
ParAccel implements compiled queries, and a proprietary interconnect protocol for inter-node communications. It integrated with [[storage area network]] technologies such as those from [[EMC Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ParAccel Update |author= Thomas C.

ParAccel offered on-demand integration (ODI) modules for analytics and data outside of the ParAccel Analytic Platform.

'''Puan Chan Cheong''' is a Malaysian born entrepreneur (born 21 October 1968 in [[Johor]], [[Malaysia]]). Also known as CC Puan, he is the founder of [[Green Packet|Green Packet Berhad]] (Green Packet Inc incorporated in the USA, Green Packet International Inc and Green Packet Holdings Ltd) and [[Packet One Networks]] (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd.

==Early years==
CC Puan was born in Jagoh, [[Johor]] to a family of 10 siblings and spent his childhood in a rubber estate in the backwaters of [[Kuantan]], [[Pahang]].  His early days saw CC Puan growing up in a humble plantation household, experiencing running water and electricity for the first time only at 13.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

CC Puan became the first in his family to be given the opportunity to attend college and study abroad. He graduated with a double degree in [[Business Administration]] and Management Information Systems and Finance from the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]], USA.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Green Packet ==
[[File:GreenPacket official logo.png|300px|left|GreenPacket company logo]]
In year 1999, CC Puan invested in setting up a technology company with some partners in the [[Silicon Valley]]. It had a good one-year run as a new business in a time when technology assimilation was high and funding was plenty. After a year into business, came the dot.com bust. Green Packet came to a dead end where the then CEO decided to call it quits.

Not wanting to give up, CC Puan stepped in and took the CEO role and determined to sustain the employment of his hopeful and talented team. CC Puan maintained a small R&amp;D team in the US and moved its headquarter and its entire operations back to [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia, forming Green Packet Berhad (GPB). This reduced operating cost substantially and allowed the company to refocus its business on the emerging markets of the Southeast Asian countries.

Green Packet was listed on the [[MESDAQ]] market of the Malaysian bourse within 5 years where the company’s market capitalization peaked to RM 2.7 billion. After 2 years being listed in the MESDAQ market, in 2007, Green Packet transitioned to the Main Market.

With operations in nine different countries; USA, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Australia, Bahrain, Thailand and Hong Kong. Green Packet is a supplier of [[4G]] devices and connectivity [[solution]]s for telecommunication companies and operators.

Under his stewardship, Green Packet is today the world’s third largest vendor for [[WiMAX]] devices and the No.1 connection management [[solution]]s provider in Asia.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Packet One Networks ==

[[File:P1 Official Logo.png|200px|left|P1 official company logo]]

Packet One Networks (P1) is a Malaysian converged telecommunication, broadband and [[4G]] service provider. It was founded in 2002 as a subsidiary of Green Packet Berhad. P1 was one of four companies awarded the 2.3&amp;nbsp;GHz spectrum licenses by the Malaysian Government to deploy 4G services throughout Malaysia in March 2007. Later in August 2008, P1 became the first company to launch commercial [[WiMAX]] services in Malaysia.

Fast forward, on 27 March 2014, [[Telekom Malaysia Berhad]] (TM), the country’s largest integrated information and communications group and [[SK Telecom]] Co. Ltd. (SK Telecom), South Korea’s largest wireless telecommunications operator entered into a strategic investment agreement with Green Packet Berhad (Green Packet) to collaborate on developing Packet One Networks into a leading 4G Converged Telco with next generation [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] infrastructure, Fiber and rich content to offer Malaysia a full-suite of converged communication services.

'''Safika Holdings (PTY)''' Limited [http://www.safika.co.za/ www.safika.co.za] is a [[South Africa]]n investment [[holding company]] headed by [[Nelson Mandela]]'s fellow political prisoners Sakumzi 'Saki' Macozoma and Moss Ngoasheng.  The company was founded in 1995.
 
In 2003, when the South African government decreed that major businesses must ensure a certain percentage of their shareholding be held by black people&lt;ref name="Act No 53 of 2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act|publisher=South African Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safika became the preferred Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) partner for a number of prominent South African companies. Their head office is in Johannesburg.

Safika has interests in financial services, mining, transport, manufacturing, human resources, media, gaming and technology. The company has close ties with the Standard Bank Group, Africa's largest banking group by assets and earnings and with Liberty Holdings, a leading South African-based assurance conglomerate that has operations in 15 African countries. In 2004 Standard and Liberty took shares in Safika which in turn acquired stakes in Standard and Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liberty.investoreports.com/liberty_iar_2011/financial-reports/group-financial-statements-and-notes/notes-to-the-group-financial-statements/notes-to-the-group-financial-statements-note-41/] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Standard increased its shareholding in Safika to 20 per cent.

On October 1, 2005, Safika bought a stake in Oosthuizens Transport, a major short-haul trucking company based in Mpumulanga that is heavily involved in the transport of coal to power stations. It subsequently acquired an effective 75 per cent stake after which the company was renamed Safika Oosthuizens Transport.

Safika holds a significant interest in Spartan Truck Hire, a South African national truck and crane rental company based in Kempton Park near Johannesburg. It is active in the packaged cement market through Castle Cement Holdings.

In 2010 Safika expanded its operations to Australia taking a stake in the Wingate Group, a privately held investment company.

Safika is the controlling shareholder in Ntsimbintle Mining (PTY) Ltd. which, through its subsidiary Tshipi Manganese Mining (PTY) Limited, is creating a multi-billion rand manganese mine called Tshipi Borwa in South Africa's Northern Cape. Production started in late 2012.

'''Store brands''', also called '''own brands''',{{cn|date=October 2018}} are [[private label]] brands managed solely by a retailer for sale in only a specific chain of stores. The retailer will design the manufacturing, packaging and marketing of the goods in order to build on the relationship between the products and the store's customer base. Store-brand goods are generally cheaper than national-brand goods, because the retailer can optimize the production to suit [[consumer]] demand and reduce [[advertising]] costs. Goods sold under a store brand are subject to the same regulatory oversight as goods sold under a national brand. Consumer demand for store brands might be related to individual characteristics such as demographics and socioeconomic variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baltas|first1=George|title=A combined segmentation and demand model for store brands|journal=European Journal of Marketing|date=2003|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1499–1513|doi=10.1108/03090560310487211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[Image:Wal-Hist package.jpg|thumb|right|Wal-Hist, store-brand antihistamine medication from [[Walgreens]]]]
A Food Marketing Institute study found that store brands account for an average of 14.5 percent of in store sales with some stores projecting they will soon reach as high as 20 percent of all sales.&lt;ref name="sbd"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Store branding is a [[Product life cycle management|mature industry]]; consequently, some store brands have been able to position themselves as premium brands. Sometimes store-branded goods mimic the shape, packaging, and labeling of national brands, or get premium display treatment from retailers. (For example, "Dr. Thunder" and "Mountain Lightning" are the names of the [[Sam's Choice]] store brand equivalents of [[Dr Pepper]] and [[Mountain Dew]], respectively.)

==Economic assessment==
Research has found that some retailers{{Who|date=December 2009}} believe that, while advertising by premium national brands brings shoppers to the store, the retailer typically makes more profit by selling the shopper a store brand. This assumption has led to a spurt in the academic and trade literature on the subject of positioning the store brand as compared with the national brand.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] publishes research on store branding and store positioning.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, while store brands are usually cheaper than national (or even regional) brands, they remain more expensive than [[generic brand]]s sold at the store. (e.g. [[Pittsburgh]]-based [[Giant Eagle]] selling their store brands for less than national brands but more than [[Topco Associates, LLC|Topco]]'s ''Valu Time'' generic brand.)

Grocery chains such as [[Aldi]] and [[Save-A-Lot]] primarily sell store brands to promote overall lower prices, compared to [[supermarket]] chains that sell several brands. [[Richelieu Foods]], for example, is a [[private label]] company producing frozen pizza, salad dressing, sauces, marinades, condiments and deli salads for other companies, including [[Hy-Vee]], Aldi, Save-A-Lot, [[Sam's Club]],&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite web

| date=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[President's Choice]] in Canada, a major shop brand found in Loblaw group supermarkets.

==Advantages of private branding==
Private branding means a large [[distribution (business)|distribution channel]] member (usually a [[retailer]]) buys from a manufacturer in bulk and puts its own name on the product. This strategy is generally only practical when the retailer does very high volume of sales. The advantages to the retailer are:
*more freedom and flexibility in [[pricing]]
*more control over product attributes and quality
*higher margins (or lower selling price)
*eliminates much of the manufacturer's promotional costs
* can fill category gaps that are not being filled by National Brands
* can aid in differentiation for the retailer as exclusive lines that are only available at that retailer
* can keep the National Brands competitive and innovative as they will now be fighting for shelf space with the Private Brands
The advantages to the manufacturer are:
*reduced promotional costs
*stability of sales volume (at least while the contract is operative)
* increase production capacity if not currently running at 100%
* can grow smaller local businesses as retailer would prefer using non National Branded manufacturers

'''''The Exchange''''' was a Canadian business news television series which aired weekdays on [[CBC News Network]], with an overnight rebroadcast on [[CBC Television]], from October 26, 2009 to September 9, 2016.

The show originally launched as '''''The Lang and O'Leary Exchange''''', a half-hour daily series co-hosted by CBC's senior business correspondent [[Amanda Lang]] and [[entrepreneur]]/[[investor]] [[Kevin O'Leary (entrepreneur)|Kevin O'Leary]], starting at 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]. Lang and O'Leary had previously co-hosted the [[Business News Network]] series ''[[SqueezePlay]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaincanada.com/articles/mic/20090831/olearycbc.html?__b=yes; "O'Leary joins Lang on Newsworld"]. Media in Canada, August 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2010 ''The Lang and O'Leary Exchange'' became an hour-long show starting at 7 p.m., pre-taped earlier in the evening, and aired on the CBC News Network. In September 2012, the show was revised into two half-hour formats, and gained an airing at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time for the first half hour on [[CBC Television]] following local newscasts.

Guest hosts, when Lang or O'Leary have been absent, have included [[Rudyard Griffiths]], [[Bruce Sellery]], [[Preet Banerjee]], Som Seif, Mike Abramsky, [[Dianne Buckner]], Danielle Bochove, Michael Hyatt, [[David Chilton (businessman)|David Chilton]] and David Kaufman.

On August 11, 2014, it was announced that Kevin O'Leary would leave the CBC, and join [[Bell Media]] to return to his previous home of BNN. As a result of the change, Amanda Lang became the sole host of the program, which was renamed ''The Exchange with Amanda Lang'' the following Monday.&lt;ref name=np-olearyleaving&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin O’Leary quits CBC’s ‘The Lang and O’Leary Exchange’ to join rival network|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/08/11/kevin-oleary-quits-cbcs-the-lang-and-oleary-exchange-to-join-rival-network/|accessdate=August 18, 2014|work=National Post|date=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later the program was relaunched, doing away with most of the ''Lang &amp; O'Leary''-era segments.

On October 13, 2015, the CBC announced that Lang would leave CBC News to move to [[Bloomberg TV Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/10/15/amanda-lang-to-host-new-show.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hpcanada-langleaving&gt;{{cite news|title=Amanda Lang Is Leaving The CBC|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/13/amanda-lang-leaving-cbc_n_8285968.html|accessdate=13 October 2015|work=Huffington Post Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Exchange'' continued with a number of rotating hosts, until [[Peter Armstrong (journalist)|Peter Armstrong]] was named the program's new permanent host in 2016.  The program ended on September 9, 2016;  its successor, ''[[On the Money (2016 TV series)|On the Money]]'' (hosted by Armstrong), launched in the same 7 - 8 PM (Eastern) time slot on September 12, 2016.

'''The Trump Network''' was a [[multi-level marketing]] company named after businessman and current [[U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]]. The company, which sold vitamins and health products, was initially founded as Ideal Health in 1997, before being renamed in 2009 as part of a licensing agreement between Trump and the owners. The licensing agreement expired at the end of 2011, and the company's remaining assets were sold to Bioceutica the following year.

Ideal Health, Inc. was founded as a [[multi-level marketing]] company in March 1997.&lt;ref name=founders&gt;{{cite web|title=The Founders|url=http://www.idealhealth.com:80/Company/Founders.aspx|publisher=Ideal Health, Inc.|accessdate=July 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123233635/http://www.idealhealth.com/Company/Founders.aspx|archivedate=November 23, 2005|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.businessforhome.org/2012/02/the-trump-network-lawsuit-going-down-fast/|title= The Trump Network Lawsuit – Going Down Fast?|last= Nuyten|first= Ted|date= February 1, 2012|website= Business for Home|access-date=July 12, 2017|quote=In March of 1997, Ideal Health started [...].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company, headquartered in [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact us|url=http://www.idealhealth.com:80/contact.htm|publisher=Ideal Health Systems, Inc.|accessdate=July 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010203222300/http://www.idealhealth.com/contact.htm|archivedate=February 3, 2001|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by Lou DeCaprio and brothers Scott and Todd Stanwood,&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; who were friends of DeCaprio.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The three men had previously opened New England Wine and Spirits in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] in 1991. After the Stanwoods' sister had joined a direct sales company in 1989, she encouraged them to get involved in the industry.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The three men worked for [[Nu Skin Enterprises]], a multi-level marketing company, and decided to form Ideal Health after seeing how successful Nu Skin had become.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt;

Ideal Health hired salespeople who would then conduct their own marketing to sell a customized vitamin supplement program, which was determined through a [[urinalysis]] test to learn about the customer's health.&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt; Salespeople made money through [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] on sales and by recruiting other salespeople.&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The products were shipped directly to customers rather than being stored by company salespeople.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohn|first=Ari|title=Chandler teacher turns to Trump in lean times|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/chandler-teacher-turns-to-trump-in-lean-times/article_02293d77-9a11-56ca-b62f-0a22324f6889.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[East Valley Tribune]]|date=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, numerous complaints had been filed with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) against Ideal Health, by salespeople who alleged that they spent thousands of dollars on company products that did not generate revenue.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=NR/&gt; One of Ideal Health's products, Supreme Greens, was the subject of an FTC lawsuit for its false claim of being able to cure cancer.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; In 2004, Ideal Health acquired and began selling a line of skin-care products known as  BIO Essentials.&lt;ref name=founders/&gt;

===The Trump Network===
In 2008 Donald Trump began searching for a [[Multi-level marketing|network marketing]] company with which to become associated. Trump's lawyer Jerry Schrager met DeCaprio during a business presentation that DeCaprio was doing in New York City.&lt;ref name=NYMag&gt;{{cite news|last=Pressler|first=Jessica|title="If I Can't Trust Donald Trump, Who Can I Trust?"

Trump later recalled, "We hit it off. I checked into their past, and they were solid people. They had a nice track record, but even more importantly they had a lot of people who thought highly of them."&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt; 

In March 2009 Trump agreed to license his name to the company, which would be re-branded as The Trump Network. Trump also agreed to make occasional appearances at events to promote the company's products.&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; Trump had initially considered taking a financial stake in the company.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; DeCaprio remained as the [[President (corporate title)|president]] of the company,&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; while Todd Stanwood served as the [[chief executive officer]] and Scott Stanwood served as the vice president of communications.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The Trump Network launched on November 13, 2009, with a ceremony attended by Trump and held at the Hyatt Regency hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nobile|first1=Phil|title=Donald Trump's biggest business hits and misses|url=http://www.newsday.com/business/donald-trump-s-biggest-business-hits-and-misses-includes-trump-steaks-the-apprentice-1.11614966|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Newsday]]|date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{cite news|last=McConville|first=Christine|title=Newbury vitamin company gets boost with Donald Trump as partner|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2009/11/newbury_vitamin_company_gets_boost_donald_trump_partner|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=The Donald in Destin: As Trump Network forms, can towers be far behind?|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=The Destin Log|date=November 18, 2009|url-access=subscription|via=[[NewsBank]]|quote=McKinney attended the official launch of The Trump Network, which was attended by The Donald himself, in Miami on Nov. 13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump referred to the company as a "rescue and recovery program" for people who were suffering from the effects of the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]] and who needed extra income. For $48 people who wanted to be salespeople could buy a marketing kit and three months of access to a personalized web site to promote the company products. Also available was a $497 package that also included coupons, CDs, and sales tips. Marketers had the right to sell any unsold inventory back to the company.&lt;ref name=TheStar&gt;{{cite news|last=Lush|first=Tamara|title=Donald Trump wants you to sell his nutrition products|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2009/11/19/donald_trump_wants_you_to_sell_his_nutrition_products.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=The Star|agency=Associated Press|date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packaging for the company's products was imprinted with Trump's family crest, but the lineup of products remained mostly the same.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; Trump created a scientific advisory committee to evaluate the products sold by the company.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; Trump also registered 18 negative Internet [[domain name]]s, including TrumpNetworkFraud.com and DonaldTrumpPonziScheme.com, to prevent websites from being registered with those names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sisak|first=Micharl R.|title=Trump is master of his domains, even ones that bash him|url=https://apnews.com/2c17b3bf329147a4bcf92ec6f3dfa2d7/trump-master-his-domains-even-ones-bash-him|accessdate=July 12, 2017|agency=Associated Press|date=November 1, 2016|quote=Trump and his team didn't take any chances in 2009 when he created the Trump Network brand to sell vitamins and other health products.

As of March 2010 Trump Network products were available in each U.S. state, with plans to expand to other countries.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; By then the company had relocated to a larger building at 428 [[Newburyport Turnpike]] in [[Rowley, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowley&gt;{{cite news|last=Curley Katzman|first=Katie|title=Trump builds a new empire... in Rowley|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/news/local_news/trump-builds-a-new-empire-in-rowley/article_bc1436c9-9ec8-5219-babf-d06a546c9aee.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Eagle-Tribune]]|date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trump Network|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-trump-network_13|website=LinkedIn|accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company had previously been headquartered at 12 Kent Way in [[Byfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trump Network Corporate Headquarters|url=http://www.trumpnetwork.com:80/Contact/Default.aspx|publisher=The Trump Network|accessdate=July 12, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629050008/http://www.trumpnetwork.com/Contact/Default.aspx|archivedate=June 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Trump's surname increased the number of salespeople who signed up with the company.&lt;ref name=Moniker&gt;{{cite news|last=Ailworth|first=Erin|title=Firm's new moniker may be its Trump card: After partnering with the Donald, the former Ideal Health takes off|url=http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2010/12/07/firms_new_moniker_may_be_its_trump_card/|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2010, the company had grown 373 percent since Trump became involved,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nbcs-the-apprentice-leads-candidates-to-the-trump-network-111679704.html|title= NBC's The Apprentice Leads Candidates to The Trump Network|date= December 10, 2010|website= [[PR Newswire]]|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had doubled its staff to approximately 50, with an additional 20,000 salespeople worldwide, up from 5,000 people prior to Trump's involvement. The company stated that revenue, at that time, was nearly $40 million.&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt; Stephanie Castagnier, Liza Mucheru-Wisner, and Steuart Martens, who were candidates on the [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 10)|tenth season]] of Trump's [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', became salespeople for The Trump Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tine|first=Victor|title='Apprentice' makes house call in Rowley|url=http://www.newburyportnews.com/news/local_news/apprentice-makes-house-call-in-rowley/article_e2a9276a-5986-5fbb-92aa-4e9577dc7317.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=Newburyport News|date=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PR/&gt;

As of January 2011, The Trump Network had plans to add additional products and expand to Europe and Asia, while Trump hoped for the company to ultimately become larger than [[Amway]], its largest competitor.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; That month, DeCaprio addressed claims that salespeople were not earning money through the company: "Many times, if people aren't having success in recruiting, it has to do with not believing in themselves." Trump stated, "This is supposed to be a second income for people. This is not about them quitting their job. [Though] for some of them, it ''might'' lead to that."&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; In late 2011, Trump's licensing contract with the company ended.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ana|title=The Trump Network sought to make people rich, but left behind disappointment|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/23/the-trump-network-sought-to-make-people-rich-but-left-behind-disappointment/|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioceutica purchased the Trump Network's assets in early 2012 for an undisclosed amount of money,&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{cite news|title=Exactly How Bogus Were Those 'Trump Vitamins?'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/healthline-/exactly-how-bogus-were-th_b_10268610.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuttle|first=Ian|title=Add Another Yuuge Failure to Trump's Pile: The Trump Network|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432468/trump-networks-failure-harmed-small-investors|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[National Review]]|date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marking the end of the company.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;

Some salespeople were disappointed to learn that Trump did not have a larger role in the company.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=NR/&gt; In January 2016, Scott Stanwood declined to discuss the company because of confidentiality agreements. Trump's lawyer, Alan Garten, said many salespeople did "very well" and noted that Trump's role in the company was limited to the licensing of his surname and to providing motivational speeches to salespeople:&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; "Anyone who claims that they were not aware of the extent of Mr. Trump's role is lying to himself." The company's website had included a disclaimer that read, "The Trump Network is not owned nor are any products sold over 'The Trump Network' developed or manufactured by Donald J. Trump or any entity owned or controlled by Donald J. Trump."&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|title=Losses, regrets and questions at companies Trump endorsed|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-trump-companies-20160127-story.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garten later stated that Trump's role "was clearly disclosed, to everyone involved in the company and its members, whether it be in the member's independent contractor agreements, the marketing materials, or on the products themselves."&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

==Products==
As of 2011, The Trump Network offered two multivitamins: Prime Essentials and Custom Essentials, the latter being more expensive. Custom Essentials used a urinalyses test known as PrivaTest to determine the vitamins required by each customer.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; At the time, Trump Network also offered children's health snacks known as Snazzle Snaxxs, as well as QuikStik [[energy drink]]s and a diet program known as Silhouette Solutions. After Trump became involved, the company added a line of skin-care products known as BioCé Cosmeceuticals.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; As of July 2017, the PrivaTest was still available via Bioceutica's website.&lt;ref name=HuffPo/&gt;

Some nutritional experts noted that there was no evidence that the vitamins provided any benefits to people who consumed them; they also criticized the PrivaTest, stating that no urine test can reveal whether a person has a vitamin deficiency.&lt;ref name=HuffPo/&gt; [[Harvard University]] doctor Pieter Cohen considered the PrivaTest to be a "scam," calling it "a bogus program to make profit for the people who are selling it. It's fantasy."&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haglage|first1=Abby|last2=Mak|first2=Tim|title=Trump Vitamins Were Fortified With B.S.|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-vitamins-were-fortified-with-bs|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Малкин Виталий Борисович.jpg|thumb|Vitaly Malkin]]
'''Vitaly Borisovich Malkin''' ({{lang-ru|Виталий Борисович Малкин}}) (born 16 September 1952) is a Russian-Israeli [[business oligarch]] and politician who was born in [[Pervouralsk]] near [[Ekaterinburg]] in central Russia, the administrative center of [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]]. He is married and has three children. His fortune is estimated by ''Forbes'' to be $1 billion.

==Business/political career==
Malkin built his fortune in the banking sector, notably with his business partner [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]]. The two men founded [[Rossiysky Kredit]], which was the third largest Russian bank until the financial crisis of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/people/Malkin_Vitaly_633387564.aspx Zoom Info Business, Vitaly Malkin]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a member of Russian Senate since 2004 and is now officially retired from business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Vitaly-Malkin_5DJW.html Vitaly Malkin, Forbes 2008 billionaires list]&lt;/ref&gt; He represents the east Siberian republic of [[Buryatia]] in the Federation Council since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moscowtimes.ru/articles/detail.php?ID=378307 Moscow Times - Billionaire Senator Can't Get Canadian Visa]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, headed a delegation of four Russian senators in Washington lobbying against the [[Magnitsky Act]]. Vitaly Malkin and his colleagues tried to convince American senators that [[Sergei Magnitsky]] was a criminal and that he died from pancreatitis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2012/07/13/oleg-kashins-dismissive-take-on-the-russian-delegations-visit-to-washington/ Oleg Kashin's Dismissive Take on the Russian Delegation's Visit to Washington], Forbes, 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
According to the ''National Post'' (Canada), Malkin was denied entry to Canada in May 2009 after a 15-year legal dispute. The Canadian government has accused him of involvement in alleged money laundering and international arms deals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1656093 "Oligarch Vitaly Malkin just can't get into Canada"], ''National Post'', 2 June 2009 {{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Russian anti-corruption activist [[Alexey Navalny]] published documents in his blog, showing that Malkin has failed to declare ownership of 111 condominiums in Canada and that he has an Israeli passport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/navalny-targets-senator-malkin/476967.html#ixzz2OuL9y3Y6 Navalny Targets Senator Malkin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Malkin resigned from Federation Council amid his double nationality scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/03/27/3123091/russian-senator-resigns-over-accusations-of-israeli-citizenship |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330092952/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/03/27/3123091/russian-senator-resigns-over-accusations-of-israeli-citizenship |archive-date=30 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
