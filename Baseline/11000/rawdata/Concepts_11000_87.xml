      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">In [[mathematics]], '''6-sphere coordinates''' are the [[coordinate system]] created by [[Inversive geometry|inverting]] the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] across the [[unit sphere]].  They are so named because the [[locus (mathematics)|loci]] where one coordinate is constant form [[sphere]]s tangent to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] from one of six sides (depending on which coordinate is held constant and whether its value is positive or negative).

The three coordinates are
:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{x}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\quad v = \frac{y}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\quad w = \frac{z}{x^2+y^2+z^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since inversion is its own [[inverse function|inverse]], the equations for ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in terms of ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'' are similar:
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{u}{u^2+v^2+w^2},\quad y = \frac{v}{u^2+v^2+w^2},\quad z = \frac{w}{u^2+v^2+w^2}.&lt;/math&gt;  
This coordinate system is [[Separable partial differential equation|&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-separable]] for the 3-variable Laplace equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8013">{{Evolutionary biology}}
[[Evolutionary biology]], in particular the understanding of how organisms evolve through natural selection, is an area of science with many practical applications.&lt;ref name=Bull&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bull JJ |author2=Wichman HA |title=Applied evolution |journal=Annu Rev Ecol Syst |volume=32 |pages=183–217 |date=2001 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114020 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mindell|first=DP|title=The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life|date=2007|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0674025585|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists often claim that the theory of evolution lacks any practical applications; however, this claim has been refuted by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claim CA215:  The theory of evolution is useless, without practical application|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA215.html|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider biology==
The evolutionary approach is key to much current research in biology that does not set out to study evolution per se, especially in organismal biology and [[ecology]]. For example, evolutionary thinking is key to [[life history theory]]. [[gene finding|Annotation of genes]] and their function relies heavily on comparative, that is evolutionary, approaches. The field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] investigates how developmental processes work by using the comparative method to determine how they evolved.

==Artificial selection==
{{main|Artificial selection}}
A major technological application of evolution is [[artificial selection]], which is the intentional selection of certain traits in a population of organisms. Humans have used artificial selection for thousands of years in the [[domestication]] of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doebley JF |author2= Gaut BS |author3=Smith BD |title=The molecular genetics of crop domestication |journal=Cell |volume=127 |issue=7 |pages=1309–21 |date=2006 |pmid=17190597 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, such selection has become a vital part of [[genetic engineering]], with [[selectable marker]]s such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA in [[molecular biology]]. It is also possible to use repeated rounds of mutation and selection to evolve proteins with particular properties, such as modified [[enzyme]]s or new [[antibody|antibodies]], in a process called [[directed evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jäckel C |author2=Kast P |author3=Hilvert D |title=Protein design by directed evolution |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |pages=153–73 |date=2008 |pmid=18573077 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
[[File:Antibiotic resistance.svg|thumb|right|Schematic representation of how antibiotic resistance evolves via natural selection. The top section represents a population of bacteria before exposure to an antibiotic. The middle section shows the population directly after exposure, the phase in which selection took place. The last section shows the distribution of resistance in a new generation of bacteria. The legend indicates the resistance levels of individuals.]]
[[Antibiotic resistance]] can be a result of point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure; those bacteria which have a mutation allowing them to survive will live on to reproduce. They will then pass this trait to their offspring, which will result in a fully resistant colony.

Understanding the changes that have occurred during organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human [[genetic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maher B. |title=Evolution: Biology's next top model? |journal=Nature |volume=458 |issue=7239 |pages=695–8 |date=2009 |doi=10.1038/458695a |pmid=19360058 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Mexican tetra]] is an [[albino]] cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Borowsky R |title=Restoring sight in blind cavefish |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=R23–4 |date=2008 |pmid=18177707 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.023 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation, such as [[crystallin]]s and the [[melanocortin 1 receptor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gross JB |author2=Borowsky R |author3=Tabin CJ |title=A novel role for Mc1r in the parallel evolution of depigmentation in independent populations of the cavefish Astyanax mexicanus |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=e1000326 |date=2009 |pmid=19119422 |pmc=2603666 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000326 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, comparing the genome of the [[Notothenioidei|Antarctic icefish]], which lacks [[red blood cell]]s, to close relatives such as the Antarctic rockcod revealed genes needed to make these blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yergeau DA |author2=Cornell CN |author3=Parker SK |author4=Zhou Y |author5=Detrich HW |title=bloodthirsty, an RBCC/TRIM gene required for erythropoiesis in zebrafish |journal=Dev.

==Computer science==
{{main|Evolutionary computation}}
As evolution can produce highly optimised processes and networks, it has many applications in [[computer science]]. Here, simulations of evolution using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |date=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |date=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |date=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |date=1992 |title=Genetic Programming |issue=On the Programming of Computers by Means of [[Natural Selection]] |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jamshidi M |title=Tools for intelligent control: fuzzy controllers, neural networks and genetic algorithms |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=361 |issue=1809 |pages=1781–808 |date=2003 |pmid=12952685 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2003.1225 |ref=harv|bibcode=2003RSPTA.361.1781J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}
{{Hinduism}}

An '''avatar''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अवतार, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|avatāra}}''), a concept in [[Hinduism]] that means "descent", refers to the material appearance or [[incarnation]] of a [[deity]] on earth.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Parrinder |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|title=Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkV5AAAAMAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Oneworld |isbn=978-1-85168-130-3|pages=19–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative verb to "alight, to make one's appearance" is sometimes used to refer to any [[guru]] or revered human being.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt;{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}}

The word ''avatar'' does not appear in the Vedic literature,&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel E Bassuk |title=Incarnation in Hinduism and Christianity: The Myth of the God-Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3iwCwAAQBAJ |year=1987|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-08642-9 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but appears in verb forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the [[Purana|Puranic]] literature after the 6th century CE.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=424, also 405–409, 414–417}} Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the [[Upanishads]] as it is symbolic imagery of the [[Saguna Brahman]] concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The ''[[Rigveda]]'' describes [[Indra]] as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will.&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 3.53.8 (Maghavan); 6.47.18 (Indra)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swami Harshananda, ''A Concise Encyclopaedia of Hinduism'', Ramakrishna Math, Bangalore (2008) Vol.1, page 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Commenting out the following, because we don't interpret WP:Primary in Wikipedia, please also add a secondary source for this: Some of the Avataras from the list of the ten Avataras of Vishnu, are mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature.

==Etymology and meaning==

The Sanskrit noun (''{{IAST|avatāra}}'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|v|ə|t|ɑr|,_|ˌ|æ|v|ə|ˈ|t|ɑr}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/avatar "avatar"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-hns|əʋˈtaːr|lang}}) is derived from the Sanskrit roots ''ava'' (down) and {{IAST|''tṛ''}} (to cross over).{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=98}} These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to ''-taritum'', ''-tarati'', ''-rītum''.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA90|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Avatar'' literally means "descent, alight, to make one's appearance",&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=98}} The word also implies "to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; In Hindu traditions, the "crossing or coming down" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from "eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude".&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"/&gt; An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a ''saguna'' (with form, attributes) embodiment of the ''[[nirguna]]'' [[Brahman]] or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin Edwards Abbott |title=Life of Tukaram: Translation from Mahipati's Bhaktalilamrita |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-UmxAoX2wYC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0170-7|pages=335–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the [[Vedas]] nor the [[Principal Upanishads]] ever mention the word ''avatar'' as a noun.&lt;ref name="Bassuk1987p3"/&gt; The verb roots and form, such as ''avatarana'', do appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as "action of descending", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}} The related verb ''avatarana'' is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as "laying down the burden of man" suffering from the forces of evil.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=415-417}}

The term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar/&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to empower the good and fight against evil, uses other terms such as the word ''sambhavāmi'' in verse 4.6 and the word ''tanu'' in verse 9.11 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}} as well as other words such as ''akriti'' and ''rupa'' elsewhere.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=405-409}} It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.{{Sfn|Paul Hacker|1978|pp=424, also 405-409, 414-417}} The idea proliferates thereafter, in the [[Purana|Puranic]] stories for many deities, and with ideas such as ''ansha-avatar'' or partial embodiments.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=98-99}}&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldavatar&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Avatar" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''avatar'', in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=98}} In some contexts, the term ''avatara'' just means a "landing place, site of sacred pilgrimage", or just "achieve one's goals after effort", or retranslation of a text in another language.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsavatar/&gt; The term ''avatar'' is not unique to Hinduism. It is found in the ''Trikaya'' doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the [[Dalai Lama]] in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=115-116 with note 2}}

===Avatar versus incarnation===
The manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an [[incarnation]].&lt;ref name=kimctap192&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastian C. H. Kim |title=Christian Theology in Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXh3iq94MWIC |year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-47206-7 |pages=169–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of avatar as "incarnation" has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|pp=107-109}}&lt;ref name="Matchett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matchett|first=Freda|title=Krishna, Lord or Avatara?: the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu|publisher=9780700712816|year=2001|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1oqTYiPeAxMC&amp;pg=PA4 | isbn=978-0-7007-1281-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in [[Christology]], presents the Christian concept of incarnation. According to Oduyoye and Vroom, this is different from the Hindu concept of avatar because avatars in Hinduism are unreal and is similar to [[Docetism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercy Amba Oduyoye, H. M. Vroom, ''One gospel&amp;nbsp;– many cultures: case studies and reflections on cross-cultural theology'', Rodopi, 2003, {{ISBN|978-90-420-0897-7}}, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}{{Refn|group=note|Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}}}} Avatars are true embodiments of spiritual perfection, one driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as [[Vaishnavism]].{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=108}}

==Avatars of Vishnu==
{{Main|Vishnu}}
The concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or [[Trimurti]] of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring [[Dharma]]. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as "Hindu", but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality  has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World- Traditions and Transformations, 3rd Edition|last=Woodhead, Partridge, Kawanami|first=Linda, Christopher, Hiroko|publisher=Routeledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;.An oft-quoted passage from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:&lt;ref name="Gale's" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matchett" /&gt;
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.
For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,
and for the establishment of righteousness,
I come into being age after age.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8|
}}

The Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.{{Sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|p=228}} The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.{{Sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|p=228}}

The most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the [[Vaishnavism]] traditions of Hinduism, are [[Krishna]], [[Rama]], [[Narayana]] and [[Vasudeva]]. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.&lt;ref name="Matchett" /&gt; The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Anna S.|title=The intimate other: love divine in Indic religions|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2005|pages=32–33|isbn=978-81-250-2801-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0FvH1aCXETwC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dashavatara===
{{Main|Dashavatara}}

The [[Bhagavata Purana]] describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations (''[[Dashavatara]]''), are celebrated therein as his major appearances.&lt;ref name="Bryant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matchett" /&gt;  The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the [[Agni Purana]], the [[Garuda Purana]] and the Bhagavata Purana;&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Vibhuti Bhushan|title=Religious beliefs and practices of North India during the early mediaeval period, Volume 1|publisher=BRILL|year=1973|pages=4–5|isbn=978-90-04-03610-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nAQ4AAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rukmani"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rukmani|first=T.

The ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the ''Dasavatara'' (a [[Sanskrit compound]] meaning "ten avatars"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.{{Sfn|Matchett|2001|p=160}}

 | [[Matsya]]
 | Half narwhal-half man avatar. He saves the world from a cosmic deluge, with the help of a boat made of the [[Vedas]] (knowledge), on which he also rescues Manu (progenitor of man) and all living beings. Demon, Hayagriva steals and tries to destroy the Vedas, but Matsya finds the demon, kills him, and returns the Vedas.

He supports the cosmos, while the gods and demons churn the cosmic ocean with the help of serpent Vasuki to produce the nectar of immortality (just like churning milk to produce butter). The churning produces both the good and the bad, including poison and immortality nectar. Nobody wants the poison, everyone wants the immortality nectar. The demons attempt to steal the nectar, wherein Vishnu appears as enchantress Mohini avatar, for whom they all fall, and give her the nectar.

 | [[Narasimha]]
 | Half lion-half man avatar. Demon king Hiranyakashipu becomes enormously powerful, gains special powers by which no man or animal could kill him, then bullies and persecutes people who disagree with him, including his own son. The Man-Lion avatar creatively defeats those special powers, kills Hiranyakashipu, and rescues demon's son [[Prahlada]] who opposes his own father. The legend is a part of the Hindu festival [[Holi]] folklore.

 | [[Vamana]]
 | Dwarf avatar. Demon king Bali gains disproportionately enormous powers, ruling the entire universe and abusing it. The dwarf avatar approaches Bali in the form of a monk, when Bali is trying to show off by giving alms at a sacrifice. Bali offers the dwarf any riches he wants, the monk refuses and asks for three steps of land. Bali grants it to him. The dwarf grows, in his first step takes the earth, the second all of the heavens, and for the third the netherworld where Bali returns to.

[[File:Mohini in Belur temple.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Mohini]], the female avatar of Vishnu (statue at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] temple, Karnataka.)]]
The ''avatar'' concept was further developed and refined in later Hindu texts. One approach was to identify full avatar and partial avatars; Krishna, Rama and Narasimha were full avatars (''purna avatars''), while others were partial avatars (''ansha avatars'').{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}} Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an ''avatar'' of Vishnu.{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}} The [[Pancharatra]] text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatar include those that are direct and complete (''sakshad''), indirect and endowed (''avesha''), cosmic and salvific (''vyuha''), inner and inspirational (''antaryamin''), consecrated and in the form of image (''archa'').{{Sfn|Sheth|2002|p=99}}

==Avatars of Ganesha==
The [[Linga Purana]] declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimes|first=John A.|title=Gaṇapati: song of the self|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|year=1995|page=105|isbn=978-0-7914-2439-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aoqB4n95pSoC&amp;pg=PT105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[upapurana]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Ganesha Purana]] and [[Mudgala Purana]]&amp;nbsp;– detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the [[Ganapatya]] sect&amp;nbsp;– exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.

Four avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, Mayūreśvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose&amp;nbsp;– to slay demons.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, pp. 100–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mudgala Purana describes eight avatars of Ganesha:&lt;ref name=Granoff&gt;Phyllis Granoff, "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa as Metaphor}}," in Robert L. Brown (ed.) Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God, pp. 94–5, note 2. {{ISBN|0-7914-0657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vakratunda ({{IAST|Vakratuṇḍa}}) ("twisting trunk"), his mount is a lion.
#Ekadanta ("single tusk"), his mount is a mouse.
#Mahodara ("big belly"), his mount is a mouse.
#Gajavaktra (or Gajānana) ("elephant face"), his mount is a mouse.
#Lambodara ("pendulous belly"), his mount is a mouse.
#Vikata ({{IAST|Vikaṭa}}) ("unusual form", "misshapen"), his mount is a peacock.
#Vighnaraja ({{IAST|Vighnarāja}}) ("king of obstacles"), his mount is the celestial serpent {{IAST|Śeṣa}}.
#Dhumravarna ({{IAST|Dhūmravarṇa}}) ("grey color") corresponds to Śiva, his mount is a horse.

==Avatars of Shiva==

Although [[Puranas|Puranic scriptures]] contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the avatar doctrine is neither universally accepted nor commonly adopted in [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parrinder| first= Edward Geoffrey |title=Avatar and incarnation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1982 |pages= 87–88 |isbn=978-0-19-520361-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The views on the doctrine of incarnation has been one of the significant doctrinal differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism, in addition to their differences on the role of householder life versus monastic life for spiritual release.&lt;ref name=laiengavatar&gt;{{cite book|author=Lai Ah Eng |title=Religious Diversity in Singapore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C |year=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore|isbn=978-981-230-754-5|pages=221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ryanjonesavatar&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D.

When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird [[Sharabha]] which calms down lion-bird Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, and Shiva then gives Vishnu a chakra as gift.

Avatars are also observed in [[Shaktism]], the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess ([[Devi]]), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The [[Devi Bhagavata Purana]] describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous – much as the [[Bhagavata Purana]] does with the avatars of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Triumph"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Cheever Mackenzie|title=The triumph of the goddess: the canonical models and theological visions of the Devī-Bhāgavata Purāṇa|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1990|page=32|isbn=978-0-7914-0363-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=erENsMcblGAC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Vishnu, his consort [[Lakshmi]] incarnates as [[Sita]] and [[Radha]]&amp;nbsp;– the consorts of Rama and Krishna avatars.&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu Avatāra and Christian Incarnation: A Comparison'', Noel Sheth Philosophy East and West, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Jan., 2002), pp. 98, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Nilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana&amp;nbsp;– which includes the Devi Gita&amp;nbsp;– says that various avatars of the Goddess includes [[Shakambhari]] and even the masculine Krishna and Rama&amp;nbsp;– generally thought to be Vishnu's avatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Devī Gītā: the song of the Goddess|page=272|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OxayHczql9EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Devi+Gita&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=Devi%20avatara | isbn=978-0-7914-3940-1 | year=1998 | publisher=SUNY Press|author1=Brown, Cheever Mackenzie}} verses 9.22cd-23ab&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lakshmi]] and [[Saraswati]] are main goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatars of Lakshmi==

Sridevi and [[Bhudevi]] are two different forms of Goddess [[Lakshmi]]. Dharini, the consort of [[Parashurama]], [[Sita]], the consort of [[Rama]] and [[Yashodhara]], the consort of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] along with the consorts of the previous incarnations of Vishnu are all considered full incarnations of Lakshmi.On the other hand, [[Radha]] and the [[gopi]]s, [[Rukmini]], [[Satyabhama]] and the rest of [[Krishna]]'s wives with the exception of [[Kalindi|Yamuna]] are all considered partial incarnations of [[Lakshmi]].

Note the difference between Chekhov's Gun and [[foreshadowing]]. Foreshadowing only vaguely implies that an event will take place in the future, meanwhile, the Chekhov's Gun principle guarantee's that an event will happen further along in the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Chekhov's Gun and How to Use It • The Reedsy Blog |url=https://blog.reedsy.com/chekhovs-gun/ |website=Reedsy |date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चिन्ता) in Hindu philosophy refers to mentation i.e. mental activity, especially thinking.

==Meaning==

The word, Chintā (चिन्ता), is derived from the root – चिन्त् meaning -  to think, consider, reflect, ponder over; and by itself means – thinking, thought, sad or sorrowful thought, reflection, consideration, anxiety  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.apte.1968613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==

Chintā is one of thirty-three ''Vyabhichāri bhavas'', the transient feelings which rise irregularly and support the permanent basic sentiments, because of their fleeting nature they are also called ''sanchāri bhavas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Sanskrit Literature|author=Mohan Lal|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=4603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4603&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ytNHU7r2OMaGrgeY4IDwAw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manas'', which is the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, is the perceiving and arranging mind. In Samkhya system it refers to the personal organ of thought, not diffused like the''ātman'' but localized in the individual. ''Manas'' has its own illumination (''chetas'') which gives man awareness or consciousness (''chetna''), faculties of perception (''[[pratyaksha]]''), thought (''chintā''), imagination (''kalpanā'') and volition (''praytana''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia|author=subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publications|page=5839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDh2WjvLo7gC&amp;pg=PA5839&amp;dq=chinta+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wtRHU6LbFMaxrgfM94HAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chintā is the faculty whereby the current of thought dwells, thinks and contemplates upon the subject so recalled by ''Samarnam'' (memory), and previously known and determined by ''[[buddhi]]'' (intellect)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Serpent Power|author=Kalicarana|publisher=Ganesh|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CWgwAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chinta+vedanta&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItNHU5CLG4GGrQevm4GQDw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

Rishi Shant Vaikhānsa of the [[Rig Veda]] (IX.66.25) in a mantra addressed to Soma tells us that

: पवमानस्य जङ्घ्नतो हरेश्चन्द्रा असृक्षत |
: जीरा अजिराशोचिषः ||

when the material darkness is dispelled by the powerful purifying (पवमानस्य) light emanating from the divine source, coinciding therewith is also the destruction of the darkness of the mind (जङ्घ्नतः) (which darkness is ignorance), then that light (जीराः) (the bright divine source) which is Brahman (अजिराशोचिषः) is seen which delivers the ''yogins'' beyond all (imaginable) folds (barriers) of existence, which existence with reference to the body is gross but is subtle with reference to the mind. The epithet – [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] as the ever glowing one, is used with regard to [[Agni]], [[Aditya]] and [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|page=181|url=https://openlibrary.org/search?author_key=OL6886704A&amp;has_fulltext=false&amp;publisher_facet=GBD+Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his [[Vivekachudamani]] (Sloka 539) uses the term – चिन्ताशून्यम् (''chintashoonyam'') as meaning without anxiety or worry (''chinta'' here means anxiety). [[Chinmayananda Saraswati]] explains that it refers to the man of perfection to whom no thought comes to mind so as to disturb and destroy him because worry cannot reach him who refuses to worry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekcoodamani|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=593|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mArVw7yUkCsC&amp;pg=PA593&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=itJHU7vcO8XarAfWxoH4Cw&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vedanta]], ''Chinta'', along with and therefore interconnected with ''[[vāsanā]]'' and ''[[karma]]'', is a factor which represents the chain of causation. ''Chinta'' and ''karmas'' create powerful ''vasanas'' and by themselves are the effects of ''vasanas''.  ''Vasanas'' are not destroyed if ''chinta'' and ''karmas'' are not destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta, the Science of Life|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Central Chinmaya Mission Trust|page=527,1291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=chinta+vedanta&amp;dq=chinta+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItNHU5CLG4GGrQevm4GQDw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBjgU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

[[Gaudapada]] in his ''Karika'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] (Slokas III.31-48) explains that all that there is, is perceived by the mind; when the mind ceases to be (stops thinking) duality is not perceived; the mind ceases to think as a consequence of the realisation of the Truth that it is the Self, it becomes a non-perceiver. Truth is known through knowledge and both are birth-less; the mind that does not lose itself when under control becomes the fearless Brahman possessed of the light of Consciousness; then all mentation (चिन्ता) stops, he states:-

: सर्वभिलापविगतः सर्वचिन्तासमुत्थितः |
: सुप्रशान्तः सकृज्ज्योतिः समाधिरलोऽभयः ||

: " The Self is free of all sense-organs, and is above all internal organs. It is supremely tranquil, eternal effulgence, divine absorption, immutable, and fearless. "

In this verse, the word ''chinta'' derived in the sense of that by which things are thought of, means - the intellect. Gaudapada calls the moment of direct apprehension of the [[Paramatman]] (whose presence is known through the mind) the state of the highest [[Samadhi]] in which all talk is at an end, all anxiety is at an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=306-313|url=https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/263}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The learned people are those who are aware of the existence of Truth, and the enlightened one are those who have in their own way personally experienced, both know about the true nature of Truth.

In [[political ecology]] and [[environmental policy]], '''climate governance''' is the diplomacy, mechanisms and response measures "aimed at steering social systems towards preventing, mitigating or adapting to the risks posed by [[climate change]]".&lt;ref name=Jagers2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jagers|first=S.C.|author2=Stripple, J.|title=Climate Governance beyond the State|journal=Global Governance|year=2003|volume=9|issue=3|pages=385–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; A definitive interpretation is complicated by the wide range of political and social science traditions (including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]] and [[multilevel governance]]) that are engaged in conceiving and analysing climate governance at different levels and across different arenas. In academia, climate governance has become the concern of [[geographers]], [[anthropologists]], [[economists]] and [[business studies]] scholars.&lt;ref name=Bulkeley2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=H.|title=Climate Policy and Governance: an editorial essay|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|year=2010|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past two decades a paradox has arisen between rising awareness about the causes and consequences of [[climate change]] and an increasing concern that the issues that surround it represent an intractable problem.&lt;ref name=Bulkeley2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulkeley,H.|first=Newell, P.|title=Governing Climate Change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, climate change was approached as a [[global issue]], and climate governance sought to address it on the international stage. This took the form of [[Multilateral Environmental Agreement]]s (MEAs), beginning with the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in 1992. With the exception of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[international agreements]] between nations have been largely ineffective in achieving legally binding emissions cuts&lt;ref name="Andonova, L. B., Betsill, M. M. &amp; Bulkeley, H 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andonova, L. B., Betsill, M. M. &amp; Bulkeley, H|title=Transnational climate governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the end of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period in 2012, starting from 2013 there is no legally binding [[Global climate regime]]. This inertia on the international political stage contributed to alternative political narratives that called for more flexible, cost effective and participatory approaches to addressing the multifarious problems of climate change.&lt;ref name=Backstrand2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Bäckstrand, K. &amp; Lövbrand, E. in Pettenger, M.

==Background==

The development of climate governance can be traced firstly to climate diplomacy between inter-state actors and secondly to the development of transnational networks and non-state actors. The timeline above highlights key points throughout this process.  The point of ‘creation’ is difficult to determine exactly, however a definitive point in its history is the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in Rio. This has been termed “the first major milestone in the history of climate diplomacy”.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009 22"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bulkeley, H.  |author2=Newell, P.|title=Governing climate change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference addressed nations from across the globe and sought to emulate the diplomatic success of the Montreal Protocol in phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009 22"/&gt;

As climate governance has continued to develop on the international stage, a string of transnational public and public-private actor networks have sought to implement its aims within their own arena, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]], the [http://www.wmsc2010.org/list-of-cities/ Global Cities Covenant on Climate] (also known as the 'Mexico City Pact'), and the [[Cities for Climate Protection Programme]] (CCPP). The [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNFCED) in 1992 was a 'trigger' for this process. Existing regional and local networks adopted its emissions reduction targets and began to consider how they could be achieved at a local level. An example is [[ICLEI|ICLEI ‘Local Governments for Sustainability’]] that adopted the convention's [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) as part of its commitment to link local action to internationally agreed-upon goals.&lt;ref name=ICLEI2011&gt;{{cite web|last=ICLEI ‘Local Governments for Sustainability’|title=AboutICLEI|url=http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=about|accessdate=15 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the umbrella of internationally agreed climate targets, innovative climate governance methods have also developed that seek to reduce emissions using market based mechanisms, for example the [[emissions trading|'cap and trade']] mechanism.

Thus, while the interstate process of treaty making continues to play a key part in mitigating anthropogenic climate change, it now exists as part of a wider tapestry of private and public climate governance initiatives that operate at multiple scales.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein, S., Betsill, M., Hoffmann, M. &amp; Paterson, M.|title=A tale of two Copenhagens: Carbon markets and climate governance|journal=Millennium-Journal of International Studies|year=2010|volume=39|issue=1|pages=161–173|doi=10.1177/0305829810372480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North-South divide==

The [[North-South divide]] is a [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] division. Applied to climate governance, the divide separates 'developed' northern countries that have historically emitted disproportionately high emissions from 'undeveloped' southern countries that have emitted considerably less emissions.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bulkeley, H.  |author2=Newell, P.|title=Governing climate change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divide has also been used to highlight differences in vulnerability to climate change (the global south is considered more vulnerable due to a higher incident of natural disasters, less developed infrastructure and less wealth).&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; These divides have fed into all issues of international climate governance, bringing with them questions of [[social justice]] and equity that remain current today.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; A criticism of the divide is that it simplifies an increasingly complex landscape. In recent years, international trade, free capital flows and the development of some southern nations (for example [[China]] and [[India]]) have redefined global socio-economic and political relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jean-Philippe Therien|title=Beyond the North-South divide: The two tales of world poverty|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2009|volume=20|issue=4|doi=10.1080/01436599913523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate Governance ‘in perspective'==

Climate governance has been identified as multi-scale, multi-actor and deeply embedded in our social and physical infrastructure:&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt;

*'''Multiple scale:''' Climate governance takes place and has policies enacted across diverse levels and spaces at each scale of governance. This includes [[supranational]], [[nation]]al, [[regional]] and [[local government|local]] scales. The interaction between these arenas raises important questions about where the power and authority for governing climate change lie.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; Traditional interpretations of ‘top down’ authority do not necessarily apply in the realm of climate governance which exhibits a far more complex landscape. Local initiatives can be networked horizontally, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]], while some national interests feed back into international agreements.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
*'''Multi actor:''' The fragmented and blurred roles of state and non-state actors raises ambiguities concerning their relative roles in the realm of climate governance.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Non-state actors play critical roles in shaping the positions adopted by national governments in relation to international climate agreements, for example the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; These actors include scientific, business, lobbyists and community actors. Until the late 1990s, their influence was considered to be ‘latent’, existing outside common governance arenas. More recently, that role has been reassessed as private actors offer new sites and mechanisms that seek to address climate change.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
*'''Embedded''': The involvement of non-state actors in climate governance is partly a reflection upon the deeply embedded social and economic nature of many of the processes that lead to [[Greenhouse gas emissions|Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions]].&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; The difficulties in addressing climate change are compounded by the complex range of processes that involve GHG emissions across the planet at all scales.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Furthermore, decisions reached in other domains, including trade, energy security and employment inevitably impact on the efforts of climate governance to address anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;

==Role of science==

Particular scientific and technical practices shape and inform our understanding of climate change and in doing so define how environmental problems are defined as objects of governance. For example, recent advances in [[carbon cycle]] research, [[remote sensing]] and [[carbon accounting]] techniques have revealed that [[tropical deforestation]] accounts for 15% of global [[carbon dioxide emissions]].&lt;ref name="Boyd, W. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyd, W.|title=Ways of seeing in environmental law: how deforestation became an object of climate governance|journal=Ecology Law Quarterly|year=2010|volume=37|pages=843–857}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it has become a viable concern of climate governance. Previous to its quantification, tropical deforestation had been expressly excluded from the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name="Boyd, W. 2010"/&gt; However, the translation of scientific or policy research findings into governance through the political process remains difficult as science and politics have very different ways of dealing with the issue of uncertainty that is naturally a component of research&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M.; Peet, J.; Vincken, M. (2009): Coping with uncertainty. Accountability challenges in global climate governance, One World Trust Briefing paper number 123, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community engagement in climate governance==

[[Community engagement]] plays an important role in the implementation of climate governance policy. There are two main reasons for this. First, where climate governance necessitates change at a behavioural level, there is a need to educate the public in order to achieve this (for example reducing car travel). Where successful, this offers the possibility that communities can become [[self governing]], for example choosing to drive less.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
Second, effective community engagement ensures that climate governance policies are relevant to the communities in which they are intended to be applied. This necessitates a process of ‘bottom up learning’, as ideas are passed up from a local to national level. This approach has been identified as the normative framework of  ‘learning organisations’ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Power, G., Maury, M. &amp; Maury, S.|title=Operationalising bottom-up learning in international NGOs: Barriers and alternatives|journal=Development in Practice|year=2002|volume=12|issue=3|pages=272–284|doi=10.1080/0961450220149663}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular within environmental organisations that seek to encourage grassroots development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roper, L.  |author2=J. Pettit|title=Development and the Learning Organisation: An Introduction|journal=Development in Practice|year=2002|volume=12|issue=3/4|pages=258–271|doi=10.1080/0961450220149654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market Based Climate Governance==

The history of climate governance has seen increasing emphasis placed on market based solutions, or “flexibility mechanisms”.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; This is a development that complements, rather than replaces traditional ‘command and control’ regulation. The decision to favour market mechanisms has been identified as inevitable given the growth in popularity of [[neoliberalism]] over the past two decades.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; Thus, targets set at international climate governance conventions have been achieved through the application of markets (for example the [[European ETS|EU-ETS]]), [[public-private partnerships]] (for example “type II partnerships”) and the self-regulation of industry (for example the [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,menuPK:578075~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:578069,00.html Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership]).

Significantly, the Kyoto Protocol offers participating countries three market based mechanisms as means to meeting their binding emissions reduction targets. These are '[[emissions trading]]' (known as “the carbon market"), 'the [[clean development mechanism]]' (CDM) and '[[joint implementation]]' (JI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The  Kyoto Protocol|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three Kyoto market mechanisms have been identified as forms of carbon market governance, a market based form of climate governance. Carbon market governance allows carbon emissions in one place to be exchanged with emissions reductions in another.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F. 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F.|title=Global climate governance beyond 2012: architecture, agency and adaptation|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on measuring, monitoring and verification techniques to commensurate carbon, allowing seemingly disparate activities to appear on the same balance sheet.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F. 2010"/&gt;

The largest working example of carbon market governance to date is the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]. It is a multinational [[emissions trading]] scheme. Advocates of this mechanism cite its focus on improving efficiency, reducing carbon where it is most cost efficient to do so. Its critics identify that it has so far allowed participating industries to profit from excess carbon credits while having little or no effect on their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandbag|title=Sandbag ETS S.O.S: Why the flagship 'EU Emissions Trading Policy' needs rescuing|url=http://www.sandbag.org.uk/site_media/pdfs/reports/Sandbag_ETS_SOS_Report.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of climate governance stakeholders that climate action was a costly burden has somehow changed in recent years: According to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, up to 90% of the actions required to get onto a 2°C pathway would be compatible with the goals of boosting national development, equitable growth and broadly shared improvements in living standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tänzler et. al|first=Dennis|year=2015|title=Catalyzing the Climate Economy|url=https://library.ecc-platform.org/file/2162/download?token=90f6h_Bj|journal=Climate Diplomacy Brief|volume=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three phenomena are behind this cost-benefit analysis: First, "negative [[Marginal abatement cost|cost abatement]]" means that curbing emissions reduces overall costs (e.g. energy savings). Second, economies of scale and learning-by-doing innovation potentially lead to falling costs over time. Third, so-called "co-benefits"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/146590200|title=Climate Diplomacy - Co-Benefits of Climate Change Policy - Sample1|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as health benefits through less air pollution or livelihood security through land restoration can be beneficial for individual countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

==Transnational networks of climate governance==

In addition to the efforts of nation-states to coordinate internationally on matters of climate governance, nation-states, non-state actors and private actors are becoming increasingly involved in multiple parallel climate governance partnerships on a global scale.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; These actors include [[cities]], [[regions]], [[NGOs]] and [[corporations]]. Their increasingly prominent involvement has led scholars to reassess the nature of power in climate governance as well as the relationship between public and private authority &lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;

To distinguish between types of climate governance networks currently in existence, it is useful to separate components into sub-categories. Studies into climate governance have distinguished between modes of governance&lt;ref name="Bailey, I 2007 431–442"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey, I|title=Neoliberalism, climate governance and the scalar politics of EU emissions trading|journal=Area|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=431–442|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00770.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (self-governing, governing through enabling, governing by provision and governing by authority), types of actors and political scale of governance.&lt;ref name="Bailey, I 2007 431–442"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Betsill, M. M.  |author2=H. Bulkeley|title=Cities and the multilevel governance of global climate change|journal=lobal Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations|year=2006|volume=12|issue=2|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of this section they are separated according to the type of actors involved – ‘public climate governance partnerships’, ‘public-private climate governance’ partnerships and ‘private climate governance partnerships’. 'Modes of governance' and ‘scale’ (e.g. [[supranational]], [[Central government|national]], [[regional]], and [[local government|local]]) represent equally viable alternatives to this categorisation. While none of these approaches are definitive (each approach exhibits overlaps), defining partnerships according to participating actor is here considered to draw the clearer distinction.

==='Public' climate governance partnerships===

*'''[[Multilateral Environmental Agreement]]s (MEA's):''' MEA's can take the form of non-legally binding declarations, or legally binding treaties. Treaties between nations include framework conventions like the [[Rio Declaration]] on Environment and Development, signed at the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). There are four main criticisms of MEAs.  First, their policies have been weakened by successive compromises between bargaining nations.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=James Evans|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, where one nation refuses to participate (as occurred with the United States withdrawal from [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]]), they can still benefit from measures taken by participating nations  (for example measures to reduce their [[GHG emissions]]), even though they have not had to take action themselves &lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt; Third, developing country governments lack the capacity to shape and influence negotiating processes, giving developed countries disproportionate power to influence proceedings .&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Fourth, the number of countries involved in international meetings inevitably leads to conflicts of interest between nations that can make it difficult to reach legally binding agreements.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt;
* '''Global city and regional partnerships''': Beyond the local scale, the success of urban climate governance depends on horizontal and vertical collaboration between regions and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alber, G.  |author2=K. Kern|title=Governing climate change in cities: modes of urban climate governance in multi-level systems|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/63/42545036.pdf|accessdate=15 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global city and regional partnerships have been identified as showing particular promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnatio  nal climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be built into public non-state networks, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]] network, the [http://www.wmsc2010.org/list-of-cities/ Global Cities Covenant on Climate], the [[Cities for Climate Protection Programme]] (CCPP) and the [[International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]]. Through these  networks, [[mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] measures and [[adaptation]] strategies can be adopted by participating cities worldwide. A criticism of global city and regional partnerships is that their exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and regions which risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.

===‘Public-private’ climate governance partnerships===

* '''Type II Partnerships''': Type II Partnerships are public-private initiatives between public, private and civic organisations that are the outcome of international treaties. The ‘type II’ label serves to contrast them against ‘type I’ partnerships which are the multilateral agreements that more traditionally arise from international treaties. An example of a Type II partnership is the (approximately) 300 partnerships upon which the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002 was based.
* '''Vertical ‘[[supply chain]]’ public-private partnerships''': These are partnerships that seek to implement internationally agreed outcomes such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through supply chain partnerships. This is achieved firstly by facilitating and coordinating interaction between private stakeholders and secondly through constructive engagement between public and private stakeholders  regarding the development and delivery of government [[policies]], [[regulations]], programmes and schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes|title=What We Do|url=http://www.eeph.org.uk/what-we-do/|accessdate=14 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [http://www.eeph.org.uk/what-we-do/ Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes] in the UK.

===='Private' climate governance partnerships====

* '''Self regulating private networks''': In recent years, transnational corporations have established partnerships through private networks in a variety of schemes that encourage self-regulation of industry.&lt;ref name="Pattberg, P. and O. Enechi 2009 76–98"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=O. Enechi|title=The business of transnational climate governance: legitimate, accountable, and transparent|journal=St Antony's International Review|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=76–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These partnerships are often coordinated by [[NGOs]] and funded by government.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt; Existing networks include the [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,menuPK:578075~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:578069,00.html Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership] and the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]]. Both of these evidence the importance of NGOs in bringing market actors into the realm of environmental climate governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and  private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-regulating private networks have been identified as having the potential to lead to behavioural change that could lead to successful global climate governance.&lt;ref name="Pattberg, P. and O. Enechi 2009 76–98"/&gt; At present however, the networks themselves remain largely unregulated and have been criticised for lacking legitimacy, accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The use of adaptive governance in climate governance ==
A relatively new approach to governing climate impacts upon social systems is to use the flexible technique of adaptive governance, introduced by [[C. S. Holling|Holling]] in 1978 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holling|first=CS|title=Adaptive environmental assessment and management|year=1978|publisher=Chichester|pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the more mitigation-focused approaches which have generally dominated efforts thus far. Adaptive governance “refers to the ways in which institutional arrangements evolve to satisfy the needs and desires of the community in a changing environment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatfield-Dodds|first=Steve |author2=Nelson, Rohan |author3=Cook, David C|title=Adaptive Governance: An introduction, and implications for public policy|journal=Anzsee conference paper|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several theorists believe that it is within a society’s capacity to adapt to the gradual climate changes we are experiencing currently, and those felt in the future.&lt;ref name="Young and Lipton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Kenneth. R|author2=Lipton, Jennifer. K|title=Adaptive governance and climate change in the tropical highlands of Western South America|journal=Climate Change|year=2006|volume=78|issue=1|pages=63–102|doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9091-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, utilizing adaptive governance is perhaps the ideal solution as its experimental approach allows newly created institutions to “experiment with different solutions and learn from them in order to adapt and transform".&lt;ref name="James Evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of these institutions is to then formulate policies to strengthen the resilience between complex climate and social systems, and therefore the system’s ability to adapt and remain stable in the face of climate changes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Emma. L|author2=Adger, Neil|title=Does adaptive governance of natural resources enhance resilience to climate change?|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, institutions encourage communication between different levels of power (local, regional, national and international) to govern resources, whilst also engaging a broad set of stakeholders e.g. [[Non-governmental organization|NGO’s]] and the public.&lt;ref name="James Evans" /&gt;  Therefore, the approach takes a predominantly ‘bottom up’ strategy, focusing on community-based actions.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brunner, Ronald  |author2=Lynch, Amanda|title=Adaptive governance and climate change|year=2010|publisher=American Meteorological Society|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of climate change this provides an alternative to the ‘top down’ [[IPCC]] proceedings and world negotiations, which many perceive as having no effect in addressing climate issues.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;

Adaptive governance has been successfully implemented in a number of local society’s around the world in building their ability to adapt to climate change associated impacts such as extreme weather&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt; and altering plant biodiversities.&lt;ref name="Young and Lipton" /&gt;  Success has mainly been attributed to the fact that through adaptive governance, the social impact is dealt with locally to achieve a more effective result&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;  whilst still allowing communication to flow between low to high levels of command. For example, Brunner &amp; Lynch in 2010 studied how the Barrow community in Alaska successfully communicated with local and regional governments to develop adaptive strategies for minimizing extreme weather impacts.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;

===Critique===
Several limitations have arisen when applying the adaptive governance strategy to climate governance. Firstly, when applied at local level, adaptive governance is evidently successful; however, Evans (2011) found problems when applying such techniques over a large scale.&lt;ref name="James Evans" /&gt; For example, the technique could have limited success when adapting to a national or international problem as the system may become too complex. A further weakness highlighted by [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]] in 2007 is that many adaptive governance systems have been implemented to build resilience to gradual changes but anthropogenic climate change could cause rapid alterations and so challenge the robustness of the whole governance system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Elinor|title=Sustainable social-ecological systems:an impossibility?|journal=Social Science Research Network|year=2007|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folke|first=Carl |author2=Hahn T |author3=Olsson P |author4=Norberg J |title=Adaptive governance of social-ecological systems|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2005|volume=9|issue=2|pages=441–473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, using this experimental approach for such a precarious and influential system as our climate has been considered too risky, especially as Earth is potentially nearing the 2 degree global warming [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=IPCC AR4 WG2|first=Parry, M.L.; Canziani, O.F.; Palutikof, J.P.; van der Linden, P.J.; and Hanson, C.E., ed|title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with these limitations, adaptive governance is evidently a successful strategy at local scale in addressing unique climate change impacts on social systems. Therefore, the idea of focusing on and monitoring localized problems to achieve a global goal may well be highly influential as the impacts of climate change become increasingly widespread and complex.

==Future climate governance==
It is said with some imprecision by some popular observers that the core commitments of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] expire in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The Kyoto Protocol|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the first commitment period for Annex B Parties (commonly known as Annex 1 Parties) to the Kyoto Protocol run from 2008 to 2012 inclusive, with a carbon accounting truing up period that may run for some time after 2012. The other obligations of parties to the Kyoto Protocol are not time limited in the way that the First Commitment Period QELEROs of Annex B Parties are. While the more recent [[Copenhagen Accord]] endorses these commitments, it does not commit signatory countries to agree on a binding successor. Future global consensus will require the respective roles of developed and developing countries to be determined according to their relative responsibilities and capabilities. Furthermore, all participating countries will need to agree that resultant legal architecture is fair and therefore acceptable.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F.Pattberg, P.Zelli, F"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Biermann, F.Pattberg |author2=P.Zelli, F. |title=Global climate governance beyond 2012: architecture, agency and adaptation|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key limitation in achieving this is the refusal of the United States to commit to legally binding negotiations. The re-engagement of the United States in this field has been cited as a potential future "trigger" that could lead to multilateral legally binding emissions reductions in GHG emissions.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F.Pattberg, P.Zelli, F"/&gt;

Movement at a national level could also stimulate multilateral negotiations as some countries look set to press ahead with legally binding emissions cuts. On 17 May 2011, the UK Government introduced the Fourth Carbon Budget which aims to "set an ambitious target in law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . . . and build momentum toward a legally global climate change deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth Carbon Budget: Oral Ministerial Statement (Chris Huhne).|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/cb_oms/cb_oms.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a [[Global Climate Regime|multilateral emissions reduction agreement]], the future direction of climate governance remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt; Supranational and national legislation could legislate the continuation of market based emissions reduction mechanisms, for example the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]. The increased agency of non-state actors in the realm of global governance and the growth of public and public-private networks offer the potential for the global climate arena to develop at a sub-national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=Enechi, O.|title=The business of transnational climate governance: legitimate, accountable, and transparent?|journal=St Antony's International Review|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent attempts to 'territorialise' the carbon cycle seek to frame climate change as a local rather than global problem by rearticulating the global carbon cycle as a combination of national 'sinks'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stripple, Johannes|title=The climate as political space: On territorialisation of the global carbon cycle|journal=Review of International Studies|year=2006|volume=32|pages=217–235|doi=10.1017/s0260210506006991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''complaint system''' (also known as a '''conflict management system''', '''internal conflict management system''', '''integrated conflict management system''',&lt;ref&gt;See Lynch, below{{full|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dispute system''') is a set of procedures used in organizations to address complaints and resolve disputes. Complaint systems in the US have undergone several innovations especially since about 1970 with the advent of extensive workplace regulation. Notably in many countries, conflict management channels and systems have evolved from a major focus on labor-management relations to a much wider purview that includes [[labor union|unionized]] workers and also managers, non-union employees, professional staff, students, trainees, vendors, donors, customers, etc.

==History==

There is a substantial early history of scholarly work on [[due process]], and union and non-union [[grievance]] procedures within organizations. This work focused primarily on [[rights]]-based [[conflict resolution]] between union and non-union workers and their managers. Scholarly work has evolved to cover both a wider range of conflict management channels, and, also, a much wider range of disputants.

In the 1970s and 1980s much interest arose in the United States, in dealing with conflict informally as well as formally, and in learning from conflict and managing conflict. In contemporary language, these discussions centered on the "interests" of all who would consider themselves stake-holders in a given conflict—and on systems change—as well as resolving grievances.

These discussions led to questions of how to think about complaint systems and how to link different conflict management offices and processes within an organization. Papers by Ronald Berenbeimmason djordje bentions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Berenbeim, Non-union Complaint Systems: A Corporate Appraisal (NY: The Conference Board, Report No 770, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, PhD, "Are You Hearing Enough Employee Concerns?" with Michael Baker, in Harvard Business Review, Vol. 62, No. 3, (May–June, 1984), pp. 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, "The Non-Union Complaint System at MIT: An Upward-Feedback Mediation Model," in Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation, Vol. 2, No. 4, (April, 1984), pp. 10–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors extended the work of Berenbeim, Rowe, and Rowe and Baker, on the topic of internal complaint systems. They included: Douglas M. McCabe,&lt;ref&gt;"Corporate Non-union Complaint Procedures and Systems" (NY: Praeger, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Ury]], Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;Ury, William J., Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg, Getting Disputes Resolved: Designing Systems to Cut the Costs of Conflict, the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; (Ury, Brett and Goldberg in particular described conflict resolution within organizations in terms of interests, rights and power and the possibility of looping back from rights-based processes to interest-based solutions.) Cathy Costantino and Cristina S Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;Costantino, C. and C.S. Merchant. 1996, Designing conflict management systems. San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl A. Slaikeu and Ralph H. Hasson&lt;ref&gt;Slaikeu. K.A. and R.H. Hasson. 1998. Controlling the costs of conflict: How to design a system for your organization. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; extensively explored issues of designing conflict management systems.

The concept of an ''integrated'' conflict management system was conceived and developed by Mary Rowe, in numerous articles in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;See http://web.mit.edu/ombud/publications/ for a list&lt;/ref&gt; She saw the need to offer options for complainants and therefore a linked system of choices within an organizational system.&lt;ref&gt;See "People Who Feel Harassed Need a Complaint System with both Formal and Informal Options" in ''Negotiation Journal'', April, 1990, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 161–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a systems approach has endured well. In recent years however, there has been discussion as to whether conflict should be "managed" by the organization—or whether the goal is to understand, deal with and learn from conflict. There is also concern about practical and theoretical issues in "integrating" a system, with some observers{{Who|date=November 2010}} preferring the idea of "coordinating" a conflict system. However 2012 research by David Lipsky ''et al.'', suggests that an increasing number of corporations see themselves as having "integrated conflict management systems," or "ICMS."

There is also a major need{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} to collect, review and understand the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the world. Studies and citations are needed about how complaint systems work for women as well as men. Research is needed as to how systems work for many different national groups, for people of different socio-economic classes, and different ages, and different religions, and especially for contract workers and immigrant workers, in every country. Studies (and citations) are needed about complaint systems in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military and in many specialized occupations. Studies are needed{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} about important specialized issues like free speech.

A number of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies are helpful in complaint resolution process, understanding the attitudes of involved parties and reasoning about them, in particular, based on the [[belief–desire–intention model]]. Concept learning is an adequate formalism to reason about complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Galitsky, B. and Josep Lluis de la Rosa ''"Concept-based learning of human behavior for customer relationship management"'' [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510004007 Information Sciences] Volume 181, Issue 10, 15 May 2011, pp 2016-2035 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Conscription}}
A '''conscientious objector'''  is an "individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform [[military service]]"&lt;ref&gt;On July 30, 2001, explicit clarification of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Para. 11: {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/IstandardsI3k.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

In some countries, conscientious objectors are assigned to an alternative [[civilian service]] as a substitute for conscription or military service. Some conscientious objectors consider themselves [[pacifism|pacifist]], [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]], [[nonresistance|non-resistant]], [[non-aggression principle|non-aggressionist]], [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] or [[antimilitarist]].

On March 8, 1995, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] resolution 1995/83 stated that "persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c22523,4565c25f2c9,3b00f0d220,0.html |title=UN Commission on Human Rights, Conscientious objection to military service., 8 March 1995, E/CN.4/RES/1995/83 (See point #2)|author=UN Commission on Human Rights |date=March 8, 1995 |work=|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was re-affirmed in 1998, when resolution 1998/77 recognized that "persons [already] performing military service may ''develop'' conscientious objections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/5bc5759a53f36ab380256671004b643a?Opendocument|title= Conscientious objection to military service; Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77; see preamble "Aware..."|author= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=April 22, 1998|work=|publisher= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=3b00f0be10&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;query=1998/77|title=Conscientious objection to military service; E/CN.4/RES/1998/77; See introductory paragraph|date=April 22, 1998|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=1&amp;se=10&amp;t=11|title= Conscientious objection to military service, Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77, Navigation to document: press "next" four times, see bottom listing, and at the right choose letter for language ("E" for English) Document:  CHR 54th 4/22/1998E/CN.4/RES/1998/77 |year=1998|publisher= United Nations Human Rights, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D.

==History==
Many conscientious objectors have been executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized when their beliefs led to actions conflicting with their society's legal system or government. The legal definition and status of conscientious objection has varied over the years and from nation to nation. Religious beliefs were a starting point in many nations for legally granting conscientious objector status.

The first recorded conscientious objector, [[Maximilian of Tebessa|Maximilianus]], was conscripted into the Roman army in the year 295, but "told the Proconsul in Numidia that because of his religious convictions he could not serve in the military." He was executed for this, and was later canonized as Saint Maximilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/ConscientiousObjection_en.pdf |title=Conscientious objection to military service |author=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early recognition of conscientious objection was granted by [[William the Silent]] to the Dutch [[Mennonite]]s in 1575. They could refuse military service in exchange for a monetary payment.&lt;ref name="co"&gt;Robert Paul Churchill, "Conscientious Objection", in Donald K. Wells,
''An Encyclopedia of War and Ethics''. Greenwood Press 1996. {{ISBN|0313291160}} (p.99- 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal legislation to exempt objectors from fighting was first granted in mid-18th century [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] following problems with attempting to force [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] into military service. In 1757, when the first attempt was made to establish a [[Militia (Great Britain)|British Militia]] as a professional national military reserve, a clause in the Militia Ballot Act allowed Quakers exemption from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/171|title=Conscientious Objection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], conscientious objection was permitted from the country's founding, although regulation was left to individual states prior to the introduction of [[conscription]].&lt;ref name="co" /&gt;

==International law==

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
In 1948, the issue of the right to "conscience" was dealt with by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. It reads:

{{Quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}}

The proclamation was [[ratified]] during the General Assembly on 10 December 1948 by a vote of 48 in favour, 0 against, with 8 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912162219/http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }} under "Who are the signatories of the Declaration?"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|"I ain't got no quarrel with them [[Viet Cong]] ... They never called me [[nigger]]."&amp;nbsp;– [[Muhammad Ali]], 1966]]
In 1974, the Assistant [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Sean MacBride]] said, in his Nobel Lecture, "To the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be added. It is ' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#"The Right to Refuse to Kill"|The Right to Refuse to Kill]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1974/macbride-lecture.html|title= The Imperatives of Survival|year=1974|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the United Nations [[treaty]] the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] [[coming into force|entered into force]]. It was based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and was originally created in 1966. Nations that have signed this treaty are bound by it. Its Article 18 begins: "Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |accessdate=2008-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights left the issue of conscientious objection inexplicit, as we see in this quote from [[War Resisters International]]: "Article 18 of the Covenant does put some limits on the right [to freedom of thought, conscience and religion], stating that [its] manifestations must not infringe on public safety, order, health or morals. Some states argue that such limitations [on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion] would [derivatively] permit them to make conscientious objection during time of war a threat to public safety, or mass conscientious objection a disruption to public order,...[Some states] even [argue] that it is a 'moral' duty to serve the state in its military."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/books/co-guide-un.htm|title=A Conscientious Objector's Guide to the UN Human Rights System|publisher=War Resisters International|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 1993, explicit clarification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Paragraph 11: "The Covenant does not explicitly refer to a right to conscientious objection, but the Committee believes that such a right can be derived from article 18, inasmuch as the obligation to use lethal force may seriously conflict with the freedom of conscience and the right to manifest one's religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/I3k.htm|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

Republic of Korea, communications nos. 1321-1322/2004|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, an announcement of [[Amnesty International]]'s forthcoming campaign and briefing for the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] included this quote: "The right to conscientious objection to military service is not a marginal concern outside the mainstream of international human rights protection and promotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur01/004/1997/en/ |title=Out of /http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR010041997?open&amp;of=ENG-2EU |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Human Rights Commission reiterated previous statements and added "states should . . . refrain from subjecting conscientious objectors . . . to repeated punishment for failure to perform military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3b00f0be10.html|title=Conscientious objection to military service; E/CN.4/RES/1998/77; See Point #5|date=April 22, 1998|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encouraged states "to consider granting asylum to those conscientious objectors compelled to leave their country of origin because they fear persecution owing to their refusal to perform military service . . . ."&lt;ref name="D. CHRISTOPHER DECKER, AND LUCIA FRESA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/5bc5759a53f36ab380256671004b643a?Opendocument|title= Conscientious objection to military service; Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77; see point *7|author= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=April 22, 1998 |work=|publisher= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] recognised the right to conscientious objection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], Article 10, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status===
The Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (the Handbook) of the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;171. Not every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming [[refugee]] status after [[desertion]] or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the [[international community]] as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d58e13b4.pdf Source: Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Selective conscientious objection==
[[Air Commodore]] [[Lionel Charlton]], of the British Royal Air Force (RAF), served in the military from 1898 to 1928. In 1923 he ''selectively'' refused to serve in the [[RAF Iraq Command]]. (He later went on to serve as [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[No. 3 Group RAF|No 3 Group]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[Sven Lindqvist]], "A History of Bombing" (''Nu dog du: bombernas århundrade''), 1999, relevant quotation at [http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/culture/lawrence.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1967, [[John Courtney Murray]], an American [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and theologian, delivered an address at [[Western Maryland College]] concerning a more specific type of conscientious objection: "the issue of selective conscientious objection, conscientious objection to particular wars, or as it is sometimes called, discretionary armed service."&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://woodstock.georgetown.edu/library/Murray/1967L.htm|title = Selective Conscientious Objection; Editor Note: An address given at Western Maryland College, June 4, 1967.

On March 8, 1971, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case of ''[[Gillette v. United States]]'' that "the exemption for those who oppose "participation in war in any form" applies to those who oppose participating in all war and not to those who object to participation in a particular war only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=401&amp;invol=437|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2003, in [[Israel]], [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military#The pilots.27 letter|27 reserve pilots and former pilots refused to serve in only specific missions]]. These specific missions included "civilian population centers" in "the [occupied] territories." These pilots clarified: "We ... shall continue to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and the Air Force for every mission in defense of the state of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seruv.org.il/english/article.asp?msgid=55&amp;type=news Courage to Refuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308102144/http://www.seruv.org.il/english/article.asp?msgid=55&amp;type=news |date=2010-03-08 }} Pilots letter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20031013/infact |title=In Fact...

On May 25, 2005, journalist Jack Random wrote the following: "The case of Sergeant [[Kevin Benderman]] ([[List of Iraq War resisters|Iraq War Resister]]) raises the burning issue of selective conscientious objection: While it is universally accepted that an individual cannot be compelled against conscience to war in general, does the same hold for an individual who objects, in the depths of the soul, to a particular war?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Jack|last= Random|title= Just Say No: The Case for Selective Conscientious Objection|work= |page= |date= May 25, 2005|accessdate= 26 January 2009|quote= |url= http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/5-25-2005-70478.asp}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious motives==
{{main|List of pacifist faiths|Freedom of religion}}
Cases of behavior which could be considered as religiously motivated conscientious objection are historically attested long before the modern term appeared. For example, the Medieval ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'' mentions that [[Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney]]&amp;nbsp;– the future Saint Magnus&amp;nbsp;– had a reputation for piety and gentleness, and because of his religious convictions refused to fight in a Viking raid on [[Anglesey]], [[Wales]], instead staying on board his ship singing [[psalm]]s.

The reasons for refusing to perform military service are varied. Many conscientious objectors cite religious reasons. [[Unitarian Universalists]] object to war in their sixth principle "The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all". Members of the [[Peace Churches|Historic Peace Churches]] such as Quakers, Mennonites, [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], [[Conservative Mennonites]], the [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Church of the Brethren]] object to war from the conviction that [[Christian]] life is incompatible with military action, because [[Jesus]] enjoins his followers to love their enemies and to refuse violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the American Civil War, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] have been known as non-combatants, and have done work in hospitals or to give medical care rather than combat roles, and the church has upheld the non-combative position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christadelphians]], refuse to participate in the armed services on the grounds that they believe they should be neutral in worldly conflicts and often cite the latter portion of [http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Isaiah+2:4%E2%80%932:4&amp;version=nrsv Isaiah 2:4] which states, "...neither shall they learn war anymore." Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from simple denial that any government possesses the [[moral authority]] to command warlike behavior from its citizens.

The varied experiences of non-combatants are illustrated by those of Seventh-day Adventists when there was mandatory military service:  "Many Seventh-day Adventists refuse to enter the army as combatants, but participate as medics, ambulance drivers, etc. During World War II in Germany, many SDA conscientious objectors were sent to concentration camps or mental institutions; some were executed. Some Seventh-day Adventists volunteered for the US Army's [[Operation Whitecoat]], participating in research to help others. The Church preferred to call them "conscientious participants", because they were willing to risk their lives as test subjects in potentially life-threatening research. Over 2,200 Seventh-day Adventists volunteered in experiments involving various infectious agents during the 1950s through the 1970s in Fort Detrick, MD. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sda3.htm "The Seventh-day Adventist Church: Controversies, books and other resources"],''religioustolerance.org,''Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] arose during and after World War I between Seventh-day Adventists in Germany who agreed to serve in the military if conscripted and those who rejected all participation in warfare&amp;nbsp;— the latter group eventually forming a separate church (the [[Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm "Origin of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815073949/http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm |date=2010-08-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]].]]
In the [[early Christian Church]] followers of [[Christ]] refused to take up arms.

{{quote|In as much as they [Jesus' teachings] ruled out as illicit all use of violence and injury against others, clearly implied [was] the illegitimacy of participation in war... The early Christians took Jesus at his word, and understood his inculcations of gentleness and non-resistance in their literal sense. They closely identified their religion with peace; they strongly condemned war for the bloodshed which it involved.|{{cite book|title=The Early Christian Attitude to War}}}}

After the [[Roman Empire]] officially embraced [[Christianity]], the [[Just War]] theology was developed in order to reconcile warfare with Christian belief. After Theodosius I made Christianity an official religion of the Empire, this position slowly developed into the official position of the Western Church. In the 11th century, there was a further shift of opinion in the Latin-Christian tradition with the [[crusade]]s, strengthening the idea and acceptability of [[religious war|Holy War]]. Objectors became a minority. Some theologians see the [[Constantinian shift]] and the loss of  [[Christian pacifism]] as a great failing of the Church.

[[Ben Salmon]] was a Catholic conscientious objector during World War I and outspoken critic of Just War theology. The Catholic Church denounced him and ''The New York Times'' described him as a "spy suspect." The US military (in which he was never inducted) charged him with desertion and spreading propaganda, then sentenced him to death (this was later revised to 25 years hard labor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| pages =| id =| url =http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 1917, Salmon wrote in a letter to President Wilson:

{{quote|Regardless of nationality, all men are brothers. God is "our Father who art in heaven." The commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is unconditional and inexorable. ... The lowly Nazarene taught us the doctrine of non-resistance, and so convinced was he of the soundness of that doctrine that he sealed his belief with death on the cross. When human law conflicts with Divine law, my duty is clear. Conscience, my infallible guide, impels me to tell you that prison, death, or both, are infinitely preferable to joining any branch of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unsung Hero of the Great War: The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon|year=1989|author=Torin Finney|pages= 118 and 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of their conscientious objection to participation in military service, whether armed or unarmed, Jehovah's Witnesses have often faced imprisonment or other penalties. In [[Greece]], for example, before the introduction of alternative civilian service in 1997, hundreds of Witnesses were imprisoned, some for three years or even more for their refusal. In [[Armenia]], young Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned because of their conscientious objection to military service; this was discontinued in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/news/by-region/europe/armenia/armenia-releases-imprisoned-jehovahs-witnesses/ Armenia Releases All Imprisoned Jehovah's Witnesses].&lt;/ref&gt; The government of South Korea also imprisons hundreds for refusing the draft. In [[Switzerland]], virtually every Jehovah's Witness is exempted from military service. The [[Finland|Finnish]] government exempts Jehovah's Witnesses from the draft completely.

For believers in [[Indian religions]], the opposition to warfare may be based on either the general idea of [[ahimsa]], [[nonviolence]], or on an explicit prohibition of violence by their religion, e.g., for a [[Buddhist]], one of the [[five precepts]] is "Pānātipātā veramaṇi sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi," or "I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures," which is in obvious opposition to the practice of warfare. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated that war "should be relegated to the dustbin of history." On the other hand, many Buddhist sects, especially in Japan, have been thoroughly militarized, warrior monks (''yamabushi'' or ''[[sōhei]]'') participating in the civil wars. Hindu beliefs do not go against the concept of war, as seen in the [[Gita]]. Both Sikhs and Hindus believe war should be a last resort and should be fought to sustain life and morality in society.

[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter |last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ud1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practitioners of [[paganism|pagan religions]], particularly [[Wicca]], may object on the grounds of the [[Wiccan rede]], which states "An it harm none, do what ye will" (or variations). The [[threefold law]] may also be grounds for objection.

A notable example of a conscientious objector was the [[Austrians|Austrian]] devout [[Roman Catholic]] Christian [[Franz Jägerstätter]], who was executed on August 9, 1943 for openly refusing to serve in the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]], consciously accepting the penalty of death. He was [[Beatification|declared Blessed]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2007 for dying for his beliefs, and is viewed as a symbol of self-sacrificing resistance.

==Alternatives for objectors==
Some conscientious objectors are unwilling to serve the military in any capacity, while others accept noncombatant roles. While conscientious objection is usually the refusal to collaborate with military organizations, as a combatant in war or in any supportive role, some advocate compromising forms of conscientious objection. One compromising form is to accept [[non-combatant]] roles during conscription or [[military service]]. Alternatives to military or civilian service include serving an imprisonment or other punishment for refusing conscription, falsely claiming unfitness for duty by feigning an allergy or a heart condition, delaying conscription until the maximum drafting age, or seeking refuge in a country which does not extradite those wanted for military conscription. Avoiding military service is sometimes labeled [[draft dodger|draft dodging]], particularly if the goal is accomplished through dishonesty or evasive maneuvers. However, many people who support conscription will distinguish between "[[bona fide]]" ''conscientious objection'' and ''draft dodging'', which they view as evasion of military service without a valid excuse.

Conservative Mennonites do not object to serving their country in peaceful alternatives ([[alternative service]]) such as hospital work, farming, forestry, road construction and similar occupations. Their objection is in being part in any military capacity whether noncombatant or regular service. During World War II and the Korean, Vietnam war eras they served in many such capacities in alternative I-W service programs initially through the Mennonite Central Committee and now through their own alternatives.

Despite the fact that international institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) regard and promote conscientious objection as a human right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122030613/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 November 2011 |title=THE STATUS OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, 33 N.Y.U.

Among the roughly one-hundred countries that have conscription, only thirty countries have some legal provisions, 25 of them in Europe. In Europe, most countries with conscription more or less fulfill international guidelines on conscientious objection legislation (except for [[Conscription in Greece|Greece]], [[Conscription in Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Conscription in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Conscription in Finland|Finland]] and [[Conscription in Russia|Russia]]) today. In many countries outside Europe, especially in armed conflict areas (e.g. [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), conscientious objection is punished severely.

While conscientious objectors used to be seen as deserters, traitors, cowards, slackers or simply un-patriotic, their image has changed drastically in the Western world in past decades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Especially in Europe, where objectors usually serve an alternative civilian service, they are regarded as making an equally important contribution to society as conscripts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Parallel to that, the number of objectors has risen significantly, too:{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} e.g., in [[Germany]], where conscientious objection is a constitutional right, from less than one percent of all eligible men to more than fifty percent in 2003.  In 1991, The Peace Abbey established the National Registry for Conscientious Objection where people can publicly state their refusal to participate in armed conflict.

==Conscientious objection around the world==

===Belgium===
Conscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Belgium|Belgian]] males until 1994, when it was suspended. Civilian service was possible since 1963. Objectors could apply for the status of conscience objector. When granted, they did an alternative service with the civil service or with a socio-cultural organisation. The former would last 1.5 times as long as the shortest military service, the latter twice as long.

After their service, objectors are not allowed to take jobs that require them to carry weapons, such as police jobs, until the age of 42.

Since conscription was suspended in 1994 and military service is voluntary, the status of conscience objector can not be granted anymore in Belgium.

===Canada===
{{see also|Canada and Iraq War resisters|War Resisters Support Campaign}}

Mennonites and other similar peace churches in Canada were automatically exempt from any type of service during [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canada's involvement in World War I]] by provisions of the [[Order in Council]] of 1873 yet initially, many were imprisoned until the matter was again resettled. With pressure of public opinion, the Canadian government barred entry of additional [[Mennonite]] and [[Hutterite]] immigrants, rescinding the privileges of the Order in Council.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 321. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] also barred immigrants and objectors from voting.

This bar on entry was overturned in the 1920s, allowing immigrants to escape Soviet repression.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Military history of Canada during the Second World War|Canada's involvement in World War II]], Canadian conscientious objectors were given the options of noncombatant military service, serving in the medical or dental corps under military control or working in parks and on roads under civilian supervision. Over 95% chose the latter and were placed in Alternative Service camps.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Peter Dueck |author2=Conrad Stoesz |author3=Grant Klassen |author4=Lynette Wiebe |author5=Elsie Rempel |author6=Lawrence Klippenstein |author7=Alf Redekopp |author8=Dan Dyck |author9=John C.

After May 1943, as the labour shortage developed within the nation and another [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription Crisis]] burgeoned, men were shifted into agriculture, education and industry. The 10,700 Canadian objectors were mostly Mennonites (63%) and [[Doukhobor|Dukhobors]] (20%).&lt;ref&gt;Krahn, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
Conscientious objection is not recognised in Colombia, which has occasionally resulted of the detention and forced recruitment of those who refuse the draft. This is despite the fact that the Colombia constitutional court has ruled that conscientious objection is protected by the constitution in 2012. [https://www.wri-irg.org/en/programmes/world_survey/country_report/en/Colombia War Resisters' International's report on conscientious objection in Colombia] Before being ruled unconstitutional by the court as illegal in Sentence T-455/14, people were at risk of ''batidas'' - raids in the street and public spaces - where young people were rounded up and forcibly recruited if they could not prove they had already undergone military service.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Czechoslovakia===
In [[Czechoslovakia]], those not willing to enter mandatory military service could avoid it by signing a contract for work lasting years in unattractive occupations, such as mining. Those who didn't sign were imprisoned. Both numbers were tiny. After the [[Velvet Revolution|communist party lost its power]] in 1989, alternative civil service was established. As of 2006, both the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] have abolished conscription.

===Denmark===
Any male getting drafted, but unwilling to serve, has the ability to avoid military service by instead serving community service for the duration of the conscription.

===Eritrea===
There is no right to conscientious objection to military service in Eritrea - which is of an indefinite length - and those who refuse the draft are imprisoned. Some Jehovah's Witness conscientious objectors have been in jail since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wri-irg.org/en/programmes/world_survey/reports/Eritrea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
{{See also|Siviilipalvelus}}
Finland introduced conscription in 1881, but its enforcement was suspended in 1903 as part of [[Russification]]. During the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, conscription was reintroduced for all able-bodied men. In 1922, the option of noncombatant military service was introduced, but service in the military remained compulsory on pain of imprisonment. After the struggle of pacifist [[Arndt Pekurinen]] a law was passed providing for a peacetime-only alternative to military service, or civilian service (Finnish ''siviilipalvelus''). The law was dubbed "Lex Pekurinen" after him. During the [[Winter War]], Pekurinen and other conscientious objectors were imprisoned, and Pekurinen was eventually executed at the front in 1941, during the [[Continuation War]].

After the war, a conscientious objector's civilian service lasted 16 months, whereas military service was 8 months at its shortest. To qualify for civilian service, an objector had to explain his conviction before a board of inspection that included military officers and clergymen. In 1987, the duration of the service was shortened to 13 months and the board of inspection was abolished. In 2008, the term was further shortened to 12 months to match the duration of the longest military service (that of officer trainees and technical crew). Today, a person subject to conscription may apply for civilian service at any time before or during his military service, and the application is accepted as a matter of course. A female performing voluntary military service can quit her service anytime during the first 45 days, however, if she wants to quit after those 45 days she would be treated like a male and assigned to civilian service.

Persons who have completed their civilian service during peacetime have, according to the legislation enacted in 2008, the right to serve in non-military duties also during a crisis situation. They may be called to serve in various duties with the rescue services or other necessary work of a non-military nature. Persons who declare themselves to be conscientious objectors only after a crisis has started must, however, prove their conviction before a special board. Before the new legislation, the right to conscientious objection was acknowledged only in peacetime. The changes to the service term and to the legal status of objectors during a crisis situation were made as a response to human rights concerns voiced by several international bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakieltäytyjiä! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements. These organisations had demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning conscientious objectors, which they considered discriminatory. None of these organisations have yet raised concerns on the current legislation.

There are a small number of total objectors who refuse even civilian service, and are imprisoned for six months. This is not registered into the person's criminal record.
&lt;!---Text from [[Conscientious objection throughout the world]] - needs merging into existing text -
For many decades, the civilian service remained unpopular and difficult to choose. Refusing military service would have been very strongly discouraged by all state officials, and getting accepted as a conscientious objector required a trial by an examination board, whose judgement was often very harsh and strongly biased towards military service. These boards included army officers and clergy. A typical hypothetical presented to the examinee was "If a group of men threatened to beat your girlfriend up, would you try to stop them?".

The examinations were abolished in the 1980s, and today a conscientious objector is only required to check a box in the draft form and state whether his reasons are religious or ethical. Severe social stigma attachs to conscientious objection, and the military, which is responsible for the draft, does not advertise the option beyond their legal obligation to mention the option to draftees.

The civilian service of conscientious objectors lasts 395 days, over twice as long as the shortest and most common military service (180 days) and thirty days longer than the longest and mostly voluntary service (365 days).

The first four weeks of the civilian service are spent in training, which mostly consists of general-purpose lectures on various topics. The first three weeks of the training are held at the [[Lapinjärvi Educational Center]], and the fourth week is a free vacation.

In Finland today, the right to conscientious objection is still acknowledged only in peacetime. In recent years several international bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakieltäytyjiä! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example UN's Human Rights Committee&lt;ref name="unhchr.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements, have demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning COs, since they have found it to be discriminatory. Sources of criticism have been the punitive length of the civilian alternative to military service, the release of conscientious objectors from military duty only during peace time and the negligence in arranging accommodation for the servicemen{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur20/001/1999/en/&lt;/ref&gt; has considered Finnish ''total objectors'', who have refused to carry out non-military service, as prisoners of conscience, because of the punitive length of civilian service.

The main 12-month period of service can be performed in any institution that is both non-profit and beneficial to the society. Examples include state bureaus, schools, universities, hospitals, libraries, theatres and independent non-profit organisations such as [[Amnesty International]]. Institutions wishing to accept conscientious objectors must comply with rules laid down by the Finnish Ministry of Labour.

From the state's point of view, conscientious objectors are subject to the same rights and obligations as military enlisted men. How the service is handled in practice depends on the place of service, but a typical service consists of a common 40-hour week in the institution.

Some 2,500 men opt for the civilian service every year, which is ca. 10% of the men drafted.

Men who refuse both the military and the civilian services are known as total objectors (Finnish ''totaalikieltäytyjä''). Total objectors are sentenced unconditionally to a prison term equal to half their remaining service. In 2002, some 80 men were convicted as total objectors. It is usual for total objectors to cite in their defence the Finnish Constitution, several international human rights bodies (for example UN's Human Rights Committee&lt;ref name="unhchr.ch"/&gt;), and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which bans forced labour except in emergencies and wartime, as well as the arguably discriminatory and unconstitutional exemption from military service granted to women, men living in demilitarised Åland and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; have considered the excessive length, as compared to military service, of the civilian service to be punitive and accordingly classifies Finnish total objectors as [prisoners of conscience]. In one recent case (namely ''Case-Hermaja''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hermaja.org/&lt;/ref&gt;), a total objector Jussi Hermaja has sought asylum from another country, Belgium. While asylum was eventually not granted, he was not extradited because the state of Finland never filed a formal request.

Since some 80% of Finnish men undergo military service and since military training and rank are considered merits at the job market, conscientious objectors experience discrimination. A reserve officer's or NCO's rank is considered a more significant merit for management positions than university degrees or work experience (see [[management by perkele]]). However, in most cases employers legally have no defensible reason to favour or even ask about a candidate's military training.---&gt;

===France===
[[File:Objecteurs.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Stamp created by the ''Centre de défense des objecteurs de conscience'' (around 1936).]]
The creation of a legal status for conscientious objectors in France was the subject of a long struggle involving for instance or the much-publicised trials of Protestant activists [[Jacques Martin (pacifist)|Jacques Martin]], Philippe Vernier and Camille Rombault in 1932–1933&lt;ref name = JPC&gt;Jean-Paul Cahn, Françoise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste à la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe siècle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, {{ISBN|9782757400388}}, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; or the hunger strike of [[anarchist]] [[Louis Lecoin]] in 1962.

The legal status law was passed in December 1963, 43 years (and many prison sentences) after the first requests.

In 1983, a new law passed by socialist Interior Minister [[Pierre Joxe]] considerably improved this status, simplifying the conditions under which the status would be granted. Conscientious objectors were then free to choose an activity in the social realm where they would spend their civil service time. However, in order to avoid too many applications for civil service at the expense of the military, the duration of the civil service is however kept twice as long as the military service.

The effect of these laws was suspended in 2001 when compulsory military service was abolished in France. The special prison at Strasbourg for Jehovah's Witnesses, who refuse to join any military, was also abolished.

Since 1986, the associations defending conscientious objection in France have chosen to celebrate their cause on 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/fr/node/1394|title=15 mai – Journée internationale de l'objection de conscience - Internationale des Résistant(e)s à la Guerre|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany|Conscription in Germany}}
Under the Nazis, conscientious objection was not recognized in the law. In theory, objectors would be drafted and then court-martialled for desertion. The practice was even harsher: going beyond the letter of an already extremely flexible law, conscientious objection was considered [[Wehrkraftzersetzung|subversion of military strength]], a crime normally punished with death. On September 15, 1939 August Dickmann, a Jehovah's Witness, and the first conscientious objector of the war to be executed, died by a firing squad at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;September 17, 1939 ''The New York Times'' See also:  ''A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust'' by Florida Center for Instructional Technology [http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/people/JWTIMELN.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed after his conscientious objection, on the grounds that he could not fight in the forces of the evil side. He is now somewhat the patron saint of conscientious objectors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

After World War II, there was no official right to conscientious objection in the [[German Democratic Republic]]. Nevertheless, and uniquely among the Eastern bloc, objections were accepted and the objectors assigned to construction units. They were however part of the military, so that a fully civilian alternative did not exist. Also, "[[w:de:Bausoldat|construction soldiers]]" were discriminated against in their later professional life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Eisenfeld]]: Das Verhältnis der Partei- und Staatsführung der DDR zu den Bausoldaten a) die agitatorische Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten b) die substantielle Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten. pp. 115–125. in: Kriegsdienstverweigerung in der DDR&amp;nbsp;– ein Friedensdienst?

''In German''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 4(3) of the German constitution ([[Grundgesetz]]): "No person may be forced against their conscience to perform armed military service. Details shall be regulated by a federal law."

According to Article 12a, a law may be passed to require every male from the age of 18 to military service called ''Wehrdienst''; also, a law can require conscientious objectors to perform non-military service instead called ''Wehrersatzdienst'', literally "military replacement service", or colloquially ''Zivildienst''. These laws were applicable and demanded compulsory service in the German [[Bundeswehr]] until the abolition of draft in 2011. Initially, conscientious objectors each had to appear in person to a panel hearing at the draft office (or contest a negative decision at the [[administrative court]]). The suspension of the procedure (1977), allowing to "object with a post card", was ruled unconstitutional in 1978. Beginning in 1983, competence was shifted to the ''Kreiswehrersatzamt'' (military replacement office), which had discretion to either approve or reject a conscientious objection, which had to consist of a detailed written statement by an applicant giving reasons as to why the applicant was conscientiously objecting. This was generally just a formality, and objections were not often rejected. In later years in particular however, with the rise of the Internet, conscientious objections fell into disrepute because of the ease of being able to simply download existing example objections. It earned some conscientious objections the suspicion of an applicant simply attempting an easy way out of military service. On the other hand, certain organizations within the German peace movement had been offering pamphlets for decades giving suggestions to applicants as to the proper wording and structure of an objection which would have the greatest chances of success.

Following a 1985 Federal Constitution Court decision, Wehrersatzdienst could be no simple choice of convenience for an applicant, but he had to cite veritable conflict of conscience which made him unable to perform any kind of military service at all. If there was doubt about the true nature of an objector's application, he could be summoned to appear before a panel at the Kreiswehrersatzamt to explain his reasons in person. An approved conscientious objection in any case then meant that an applicant was required by law to perform Wehrersatzdienst. Complete objection both to military and replacement service was known as ''Totalverweigerung''; it was illegal and could be punished with a fine or a suspended custodial sentence.

Nearly the only legal way to get both out of military service and replacement service was to be deemed physically unfit for military service. Both men who entered military service and those who wanted to go into replacement service had to pass a military physical examination at the military replacement office. Five categories/levels of physical fitness, or ''Tauglichkeitsstufen'', existed. ''Tauglichkeitsstufe 5'', in short ''T5'', meant that a person was rejected for military service and thus also did not need to enter replacement service. ''T5'' status was usually only granted if a person had physical or mental disabilities or was otherwise significantly impaired, such as due to very poor eyesight or debilitating chronic illnesses.

Another way to get out of service completely was the ''two brothers rule'', which stated that if two older brothers had already served in the military, any following male children of a family were exempt from service.

Due to [[West Berlin]]'s special status between the end of the Second World War and 1990 as a city governed by foreign military powers, draft did not apply within its borders. This made Berlin a safe haven for many young people who chose to move to the city to prevent criminal court repercussions for ''Totalverweigerung''. As ''Totalverweigerer'' were often part of the far-left political spectrum, this was one factor which spawned a politically active left-wing and left-wing radical scene in the city.

Wehrersatzdienst was for a long time considerably longer than military service, by up to a third, even when the duration of service was gradually reduced following reunification and the end of the Cold War. This was held by some as a violation of constitutional principles, but was upheld in several court decisions based on the reasoning that former service personnel could be redrafted for military exercises called ''Wehrübungen'', while somebody who had served out his replacement service could not. Moreover, work conditions under military service typically involved more hardship and inconvenience than Wehrersatzdienst. In 2004, military service and Wehrersatzdienst were then made to last equal lengths of time.

Military service and draft were controversial during much of their existence. Reasons included the consideration that Germans could be made to fight against their fellow Germans in East Germany. Moreover, draft only applied to men, which was seen as gender based discrimination by some, but was often countered by the argument that women usually gave up their careers either temporarily or permanently to raise their children. With the end of the Cold War and the German military's primary purpose of defending its home territory increasingly looking doubtful, draft also began to become more arbitrary, as only certain portions of a particular birth year were drafted (usually those in very healthy physcial condition), while others weren't. This was seen as a problem of ''Wehrgerechtigkeit'', or equal justice of military service.

Then-German President [[Roman Herzog]] said in a 1994 speech (which was frequently cited as an argument for draft abolition) that only the necessity for national defense, not any other arguments can justify draft. On the other hand, this logic tended to not be extended to men serving Wehrersatzdienst, as they usually worked in fields of public health, [[elderly care]], medical assistance or assistance for the disabled. Their relatively low-paid work was seen as an ever more important backbone of a health sector which was grappling with rapidly increasing costs of care.

Draft was finally abolished in Germany in 2011, mainly due to a perceived lack of aforementioned necessity. The German Bundeswehr now solely relies on service members who deliberately choose it as a career path. Neither Article 12a (establishing the possibility of draft) nor Article 4 (3) (permitting conscientious objection) have been removed from the German Constitution. In theory, this makes a full reversion to draft (and Wehrersatzdienst) possible if it is thought to be necessary.

===Israel===
{{main|Refusal to serve in the IDF}}
All Israeli citizens and permanent residents are liable to military service. However, the Ministry of Defense has used its discretion under article 36 of this law to automatically exempt all non-Jewish women and all Arab men, except for the Druze, from military service ever since Israel was established. Israeli Arabs may volunteer to perform military service, but very few do so (except among the Bedouin population of Israel).&lt;ref name="wri-irg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wri-irg.org/co/co-isr-03.htm|title=Conscientious objection to military service in Israel: an unrecognised human right - War Resisters' International|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the status of the armed forces shortly after the founding of the State of Israel, representatives of orthodox religious parties argued that yeshiva students should be exempt from military service. This derives from the Jewish tradition that if a man wants to dedicate his life to religious study, society must allow him to do so. The request of orthodox political parties to 'prevent neglect of studying the Torah' was granted by the authorities. But in recent years this exemption practice has become the subject of debate in Israeli society, as the absolute and the relative numbers of the men who received this exemption rose sharply.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Torato Omanuto]] entry: "from 800 men in 1968 to 41,450 in 2005 compared to 7 million for the entire population of Israel. In percentage terms, 2.4% of the soldiers enlisting to the army in 1974 were benefiting from Torato Omanuto compared to 9.2% in 1999, when it was projected that the number would reach 15% by the year 2012."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in the case of ''Ressler et al. v. The Knesset et al.''.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/07/980/062/n18/07062980.n18.htm|title=בבית המשפט העליון בשבתו כבית משפט גבוה לצדק|date=February 21, 2012|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the blanket exemption granted to ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students was ''ultra vires'' the authority of the Minister of Defence, and that it violated Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and was, therefore, unconstitutional.

As for conscientious objection, in 2002, in the case of ''David Zonschein et al. v. Military Advocate General et al.'',&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; the Supreme Court reiterated its position that selective conscientious objection was not permitted, adding that conscientious objection could only be recognized in cases of general objection to military service.

Women can claim exemption from military service on grounds of conscience under arts. 39 (c) and 40 of the Defense Service Law, according to which religious reasons can be grounds for exemption.&lt;ref name="wri-irg.org"/&gt;

===Italy===
Until 2004 conscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Italy|Italian]] males. Those who were born in the last months of the year typically used to serve in the Navy, unless judged unable for ship service (in this case they could be sent back to Army or Air Force). Until 1972, objectors were considered as [[Treason|traitors]] and tried by a military tribunal; after 1972, objectors could choose an alternative civilian service, which was eight months longer than standard military service (fifteen months, then twelve, as for Army and Air Force, 24 months, then eighteen, then twelve as for the Navy){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. Since such length was judged too punitive, an arrangement was made to make the civilian service as long as the military service. Since 2004, Italian males no longer need to object because military service has been turned into volunteer for both males and females.

===Marshall Islands===
In the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]] no person can be conscripted if, after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so, he has established that he is a conscientious objector to participation in war (Marshall Islands Constitution Article II Section 11).

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], as of 23 October 2006 conscription was suspended, therefore, the status of conscience objector does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20061023-023126-3463r Romania drops compulsory military service], United Press International, 23 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This came about due to a [[Constitution of Romania|2003 constitutional amendment]] which allowed the parliament to make military service optional. The [[Romanian Parliament]] voted to abolish conscription in October 2005, with the vote formalizing one of many military modernization and reform programs that Romania agreed to when it joined [[NATO]].

===Russia===
{{Main|Conscription in Russia}}
The [[Russian Empire]] allowed [[Russian Mennonite]]s to run and maintain [[Forestry service (Russia)|forestry service]] units in South Russia in lieu of their military obligation. The program was under church control from 1881 through 1918, reaching a peak of seven thousand conscientious objectors during World War I. An additional five thousand Mennonites formed complete hospital units and transport wounded from the battlefield to [[Moscow]] and [[Ekaterinoslav]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], [[Leon Trotsky]] issued a decree allowing alternative service for religious objectors whose sincerity was determined upon examination.&lt;ref&gt;The decree was issued in October 1918. Smith, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Chertkov]], a follower of [[Leo Tolstoy]], chaired the ''United Council of Religious Fellowships and Groups'', which successfully freed 8000 conscientious objectors from military service during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The law was not applied uniformly and hundreds of objectors were imprisoned and over 200 were executed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}The United Council was forced to cease activity in December 1920, but alternative service was available under the [[New Economic Policy]] until it was abolished in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Braun, Abraham, Th.

In the present day,{{when|date=July 2015}} Russian draft legislation allows people to choose an alternative civilian service for religious or ideological reasons. Most objectors are employed in healthcare, construction, forestry and post industries, serving 18 to 21 months.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South African resistance to war|End Conscription Campaign}}

During the 1980s, hundreds&lt;ref&gt;The National Registry of Conscientious Objectors launched in 1989, listed some 700 plus objectors for that year alone. Source: Argus, Thursday, September 21, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; of South African white males dodged the draft, refused the call-up or objected to conscription in the [[South African Defence Force]]. Some simply deserted, or joined organisations such as the [[End Conscription Campaign]], an anti-war movement banned in 1988, while others fled into exile and joined the [[Committee on South African War Resistance]]. Most lived in a state of internal exile, forced to go underground within the borders of the country until a moratorium on conscription was declared in 1993. [[South African Border War|Opposition to the Angolan War]], "South Africa's Vietnam," was rife in English-speaking campuses, and later the war in the townships became the focus of these groupings.

===South Korea===
The terminology conscientious objector technically has not existed in Korean dictionary until recently. In fact, significant majority of Korean citizens simply associate conscientious objectors with draft dodging, and are unaware of the fact that conscientious objector draftees in other westernized countries are required to serve in alternative services. Since the establishment of the [[Republic of Korea]], thousands of conscientious objectors had no choice but to be imprisoned as criminals. Every year about 500 young men, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses,&lt;ref name="jw-media"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/kor/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525232027/http://www.jw-media.org/kor/index.htm |archivedate=2012-05-25 |df= }} Imprisonment of conscientious objectors to military service]&lt;/ref&gt; are arrested for refusing the draft.&lt;ref name="nojail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-objectors-idUSSEO29904620080902|title=South Korea military objectors say don't jail pacifists|date=2 September 2008|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea's stance has drawn criticism from The U.N. Human Rights Committee, which argues that South Korea is violating article 18 of the ICCPR, which guarantees freedom of thought and conscience. In 2006, 2010, and again in 2011 the U.N. Human Rights Committee, after reviewing petitions from South Korean conscientious objectors, declared that the government was violating Article 18 of the ICCPR, the provision that guarantees the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"&gt;http://koreaherald.heraldm.com/common/redirect.jsp?news_id=20110919000963&amp;category_id=020604000000&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's National Action Plan [https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150820/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/plan_actions/docs/Korea_Summary_NHRAP.doc (NAP)] for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has not shown a clear stance on the pressing human rights issues such as, among other things, the rights of conscientious objectors to military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.peoplepower21.org/English/20784 Second Session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726144917/http://blog.peoplepower21.org/English/20784 |date=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007 the government announced a program to give conscientious objectors an opportunity to participate in alternative civilian service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2007/09/205_10373.html Conscientious Objectors to Get Non-Armed Services for 36 Months]&lt;/ref&gt; The program stipulates three years of civilian service that is not connected with the military in any way. However, that program has been postponed indefinitely after the succeeding administration took office in 2008.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"/&gt;

The government argues that introducing an alternative service would jeopardize national security and undermine social equality and cohesion. This is amid an increasing number of countries which retain compulsory service have introduced alternatives. In addition, some countries, including those with national security concerns have shown that alternative service can be successfully implemented.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"/&gt;

On January 15, 2009, the Korean Presidential Commission on Suspicious Deaths in the Military released its decision acknowledging that the government was responsible for the deaths of five young men, who were Jehovah's Witnesses and had forcibly been conscripted into the army.
The deaths resulted from "the state's anti-human rights violence" and "its acts of brutality" during the 1970s that continued into the mid-1980s. This decision is significant since it is the first one recognizing the state's responsibility for deaths resulting from violence within the military.&lt;ref name="deaths"&gt;[http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20090126.htm Korean government held responsible for deaths of five conscientious objectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111130234/http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20090126.htm |date=2010-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/01/17/200901170008.aspAbuseblamed|title=The Korea Herald|first=The Korea|last=Herald|website=koreaherald.co.kr|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Commission's decision, "the beatings and acts of brutality committed against them by military officials were attempts to compel and coerce them to act against their conscience (religion) and were unconstitutional, anti-human rights acts that infringed severely upon the freedom of conscience (religion) guaranteed in the Constitution."&lt;ref name="deaths"/&gt;

The records of conscientious objectors to military service are kept by a governmental investigative body as criminal files for five years. As a consequence, conscientious objectors are not allowed to enter a government office and apply for any type of national certification exam. It is also very unlikely that they will be employed by any company that inquires about criminal records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jw-media.org/kor/20081231rpt.htm Restrictions on Religious Freedom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218010933/http://jw-media.org/kor/20081231rpt.htm |date=2010-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2008, Korean Military Manpower Administration said that at least 4,958 men have objected to service in the military because of religious beliefs. Among those, 4,925 were Jehovah's Witnesses, 3 were Buddhists, and the other 30 refused the mandatory service because of conscientious objections other than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/01/117_37552.htmlConscientious|title=Objectors Top 5,000|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1950, there have been more than 16,000 Jehovah's Witnesses sentenced to a combined total of 31,256 years for refusing to perform military service. If alternative service is not provided, some 500 to 900 young men will continue to be added each year to the list of conscientious objectors criminalized in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20110902.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007145556/http://jw-media.org/kor/20110902.htm |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Lee Yeda was the first conscientious objector to be allowed to live in France via asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/a-korean-conscientious-objector-in-paris/|title=A Korean Conscientious Objector in Paris|first=Yena Lee, The|last=Diplomat|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/news-item/south-korea-authorities-wrecking-lives-by-jailing-conscientious-objectors|title=News &amp; Stories – Amnesty International USA|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the Constitutional Court ruled 6-3 that Article 5 of the country's Military Service Act is unconstitutional because it fails to provide an alternative civilian national service for conscientious objectors. {{as of|2018}}, 19,300 South Korean conscientious objectors had gone to prison since 1953. The Defense Ministry said it would honor the ruling by introducing alternative services as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/world/asia/south-korea-military-service-conscientious-objectors.html |title=South Korea Must Offer Civilian Alternatives to Military Service, Court Rules |last=Sang-Hun |first=Chloe |date=June 28, 2018 |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Conscientious objection was not permitted in [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,
''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century''. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}} 
(pp. 96–7, 311).&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objectors usually refused to serve on religious grounds, such as being Jehovah's Witnesses, and were placed in prison for the duration of their sentences. The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] acknowledged conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Spanish Constitution of 1978/Part I#Division 2. Rights and Duties of Citizens|Spanish Constitution section 30.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish parliament established a longer service (''Prestación Social Sustitutoria'') as an alternative to the Army. In spite of this, a strong movement appeared that refused both services. The [[Red Cross]] was the only important organisation employing objectors. Because of this, the waiting lists for the PSS were long, especially in areas like [[Navarre]], where pacifism, [[Basque nationalism]] and a low unemployment rate discouraged young males from the army{{Original research inline|date=January 2011}}. Thousands of ''insumisos'' (non-submittants) publicly refused the PSS, and hundreds were imprisoned. In addition a number of those in the military decided to refuse further duties. A number of people not liable for military service made declarations of self-incrimination, stating that they had encouraged ''insumisión''. The government, fearing popular reaction, reduced the length of service and instead of sentencing ''insumisos'' to prison declared them unfit for public service.

Fronting the decreasing birth rate and the popular opposition to the army, the Spanish government tried to modernise the model carried from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, professionalizing it. The new army tried to provide an education for civilian life and participated in peace operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].

===Turkey===
{{update|section|date=July 2015}}
[[Conscription in Turkey#Conscientious objection|The issue]] is highly controversial in [[Turkey]]. Turkey, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are the only three countries refusing to recognize conscientious objection and sustain their membership in the Council of Europe. In January 2006, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) found Turkey had violated article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of degrading treatment) in a case dealing with the conscientious objection of [[Osman Murat Ulke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2006/Jan/Chamberjudgment%C3%9ClkevTurkey240106.htm "Chamber Judgement Ulke vs. Turkey"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009185413/http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2006/Jan/Chamberjudgment%C3%9ClkevTurkey240106.htm |date=2006-10-09 }}, Accessed June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Mehmet Tarhan]] was sentenced to four years in a military prison as a conscientious objector (he was unexpectedly released in March 2006). Journalist [[Perihan Magden]] was tried by a Turkish court for supporting Tarhan and advocating conscientious objection as a human right; but later, she was acquitted.

{{as of|2011|March}}, there were 125 objectors including 25 female objectors in Turkey. Another 256 people of Kurdish origin also had announced their conscientious objection to military service.&lt;ref&gt;See the list on the [http://www.savaskarsitlari.org/arsiv.asp?ArsivTipID=2 pages of the "opponents to war"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020211/http://www.savaskarsitlari.org/arsiv.asp?ArsivTipID=2 |date=2011-06-04 }}(tr:''savaş karşıtları''), accessed on 15 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objector [[İnan Süver]] was named a [[prisoner of conscience]] by Amnesty International.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur44/003/2011/en/ |title=Prisoner of conscience escapes and is rearrested |date=28 April 2011 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2011, the [[Ministry of Justice (Turkey)|Ministry of Justice]] announced a draft proposal to legalise  conscientious objection in Turkey and that it was to take effect two weeks after approval by the President to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25297170/|title=NTV Haber - Türkiye ve Dünya Gündemi Güncel Son Dakika Haberleri|website=ntvmsnbc.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision to legalize by the Turkish government was because of pressure from the European Court of Human Rights. The ECHR gave the Turkish government a deadline until the end of 2011 to legalize conscientious objection. The draft was withdrawn afterwards.

A commission was founded within the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly of the Republic]] to write a new constitution in 2012. The commission is still in negotiations on various articles and conscientious objection is one of the most controversial issues.

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom recognised the right of individuals not to fight in the 18th century following problems with attempting to force Quakers into military service. The Militia Ballot Act of 1757 allowed Quakers to be excluded from service in the [[Militia (Great Britain)|Militia]]. It then ceased to be a major issue, since Britain's armed forces were generally all-volunteer. However, [[press gangs]] were used to beef up army and navy rolls on occasions from the 16th to the early 19th centuries. Pressed men did have the right of appeal, in the case of sailors, to the [[Admiralty]]. The [[Royal Navy]] last took pressed men in the [[Napoleonic War]].

[[File:Conscientious Objector memorial, Tavistock Sq Gardens.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Conscientious Objector memorial in [[Tavistock Square]] Gardens, London&amp;nbsp;— dedicated on [[May 15#Holidays and observances|15 May]] 1994]]

A more general right to refuse military service was not introduced until the [[First World War]]. Britain introduced conscription with the [[Military Service Act (United Kingdom)|Military Service Act]] of January 1916, which came into full effect on 2 March 1916. The Act allowed for objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or to serve as a non-combatant in the army's [[Non-Combatant Corps]], according to the extent to which they could convince a [[Military Service Tribunals|Military Service Tribunal]] of the quality of their objection.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 16,000 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers, traditionally pacifist, forming a large proportion: 4,500 objectors were exempted on condition of doing civilian 'work of national importance', such as farming, forestry or social service; and 7,000 were conscripted into the specially-created Non-Combatant Corps. However, 6,000 were refused any exemption and forced into main army regiments; if they then refused to obey orders, they were [[Court-martial#United Kingdom|court-martialled]] and sent to prison. Thus, the well-known pacifist and religious writer [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] was called up in 1916: he and many other Quaker activists took the unconditionalist stand, refusing both military and alternative service, and on enforced enlistment were court-martialled and imprisoned for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Peter,''These strange criminals: an anthology of prison memoirs by conscientious objectors to military service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0802087078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objectors formed only a tiny proportion of Military Service Tribunals' cases over the whole conscription period, estimated at around 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Gregory, 'Military Service Tribunals, 1916–1918' in J. Harris (ed.) ''Civil Society in British History''. (Oxford, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Tribunals were notoriously harsh towards conscientious objectors, reflecting widespread public opinion that they were lazy, degenerate, ungrateful 'shirkers' seeking to benefit from the sacrifices of others.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Bibbings, ''Telling Tales About Men''(Manchester University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-five objectors, including the [[Richmond Sixteen]], were taken to France and formally sentenced to death by court-martial but immediately reprieved, with commutation to ten-years' penal servitude.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10507058.Silence_in_castle_to_honour_First_World_War_conscientious_objectors/ Silence in castle to honour First World War conscientious objectors] dated 25 June 2013 at thenorthernecho.co.uk, accessed 19 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions were very hard for conscientious objector prisoners, many of whom were not used to manual work, lack of regular exercise, and the often cold, damp conditions; ten died in prison, and around seventy more died elsewhere as a result of their treatment.

Although a few objectors were accepted for non-combatant service in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], acting as nursing/paramedic assistants, the majority of non-combatants served in the Non-Combatant Corps on non-lethal stores, road and railway building and general labouring in the UK and France. Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution to the state were formally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchised]] (through a clause inserted in the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] at the insistence of back-bench MPs) for the five years 1 September 1921 - 31 August 1926, but as it was a last-minute amendment there was no administrative machinery to enforce such disfranchisement, which was admitted to be a "dead letter".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 116; [http://www.spartacus-educational.com/FWWpacifists.htm FWW Pacifists] at spartacus-educational.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's conscription legislation of 1916 did not apply to [[Ireland]], despite it being then all part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. However, in 1918 the Army's continuing demand for more troops led to passing a further act enabling conscription in Ireland if and when the government saw fit. In the event, the government never saw fit, although the legislation led to the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]]. Similarly, British conscription in the [[Second World War]] did not apply to [[Northern Ireland]]. Nevertheless, many [[Irishmen]] volunteered to fight in both world wars. The various parts of the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] had their own laws: in general, all the larger countries of the Empire participated, and some were, in proportion to their population, major participants in the First World War.

In the Second World War, following the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]], there were nearly 60,000 registered Conscientious Objectors. Testing by tribunals resumed, this time by special Conscientious Objection Tribunals chaired by a judge, and the effects were much less harsh. If you were not a member of the Quakers or some similar pacifist organisation, it was generally enough to say that you objected to "warfare as a means of settling international disputes", a phrase from the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928. The tribunals could grant full exemption, exemption conditional on alternative service, exemption only from combatant duties, or dismiss the application. Of the 61,000 who were registered, 3,000 were given complete exemption; 18,000 applications were initially dismissed, but a number of such applicants succeeded at the Appellate Tribunal, sometimes after a "qualifying" sentence of three-months' imprisonment for an offence deemed to have been committed on grounds of conscience. Of those directed to non-combatant military service almost 7,000 were allocated to the Non-Combatant Corps, re-activated in mid-1940; its companies worked in clothing and food stores, in transport, or any military project not requiring the handling of "material of an aggressive nature". In November 1940 it was decided to allow troops in the NCC to volunteer for work in [[bomb disposal]].&lt;ref name=UXB92 /&gt; In total over 350 volunteered.&lt;ref name=UXB92&gt;{{cite book |title= Danger UXB The Remarkable Story of the Disposal of Unexploded Bombs During the Second World War |last=Jappy |first=M.J |year=2001 |publisher=Channel 4 books |isbn=0-7522-1938-3 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-combatants worked in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. For conscientious objectors exempted conditional upon performing civil work, acceptable occupations were [[farm]] work, [[mining]], [[firefighting]] and the [[Emergency medical services|ambulance service]]. About 5,500 objectors were imprisoned, most charged with refusal to attend a medical examination as a necessary preliminary to call-up after being refused exemption, and some charged with non-compliance with the terms of conditional exemption. A further 1,000 were court-martialled by the armed forces and sent to military detention barracks or civil prisons. Differently from the First World War, most sentences were relatively short, and there was no pattern of continually repeated sentences. Nevertheless, the social stigma attached to 'conchies' (as they were called) was considerable; regardless of the genuineness of their motives, cowardice was often imputed.

[[Conscription in the United Kingdom]] was retained, with rights of conscientious objection, as [[National Service]] until the last call-up in 1960 and the last discharge in 1963. The use of all volunteer soldiers was hoped to remove the need to consider conscientious objectors. Ever since the First World War, however, there have been volunteer members of the armed forces who have developed a conscientious objection to continuing in service; a procedure was devised for them in the Second World War, and, with adaptations, it continues to this day.

===United States===
{{Main|Conscientious objection in the United States}}
{{see also|New York Draft Riots|Conscription in the United States}}
There are currently legal provisions in the United States for recognizing conscientious objection, both through the [[Selective Service System]] and through the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The United States recognizes religious and moral objections, but not selective objections. Conscientious objectors in the United States may perform either civilian work or noncombatant service in lieu of combatant military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sss.gov/consobj |title=Conscientious Objection and Alternative Service |website=Selective Service System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, conscientious objectors have been persecuted in the United States. After the Selective Service System was founded during [[World War I]], such persecutions decreased in frequency, and recognition for conscientious objectors grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Other countries===
As of 2005, conscientious objectors in several countries may serve as field paramedics in the army (although some do not consider this a genuine alternative, as they feel it merely helps to make war more humane instead of preventing it). Alternatively, they may serve without arms, although this, too, has its problems. In certain European countries such as Austria, Germany, Greece and Switzerland, there is the option of performing civilian service, subject to the review of a written application or after a hearing about the state of conscience. In Germany, however, the draft was suspended in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-suspend-compulsory-military-service/a-6315122|title=Germany to suspend compulsory military service - Germany - DW - 10.12.2010|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, civilian service is twice as long as the corresponding military service; the [[Swiss Civilian Service]] is one and one-half times longer. In 2005, the Swiss parliament considered whether willingness to serve one and a half times longer than an army recruit was sufficient proof of sincerity, citing that the cost of judging the state of conscience of a few thousand men per year was too great.

==Conscientious objection in professional forces==
Only three European Union countries&amp;nbsp;– Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– recognize the right to conscientious objection for contract and professional military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;War Resisters' International, ''Professional Soldiers and the Right to Conscientious Objection in the European Union'' October 2008, p. 6, downloadable from {{cite web |url=http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175710/http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, military personnel who come to a conviction of conscientious objection during their tour of duty must appear in front of a panel of experts, which consists of psychiatrists, military chaplains and officers.

In Switzerland, the panel consists entirely of civilians, and military personnel have no authority whatsoever. In Germany, the draft has been suspended since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten online|last=GmbH|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|website=FAZ.NET|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common questions==

Investigators ask questions to determine the sincerity of an individual's convictions. Responses such as "the army is senseless," "it is not just to wage wars," or opposing participation in merely some wars, indicate sociological, philosophical, or political objections, which are not accepted alone.&lt;ref&gt;50 U.S.C. 3806(j)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42159">{{about|philosophical concept of a Universal Fashioner|other uses|Demiurge (disambiguation)}}
{{God| expanded=representations}}

In the [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Neopythagorean]], [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]], and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] schools of philosophy, the '''demiurge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|m|i|ˌ|ɜr|dʒ}}) is an [[artisan]]-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe. The [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] adopted the term "demiurge". Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered to be consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered to be either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.

The word "demiurge" is an English word derived from ''demiurgus'', a [[List of Latinised names|Latinized]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δημιουργός}} or ''dēmiourgos''. It was originally a common noun meaning "craftsman" or "artisan", but gradually came to mean "producer", and eventually "creator". The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Plato's ''Timaeus'']], written {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;310–90 BC) and Middle Platonic ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;90 BC – AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the [[Theory of Forms|&lt;!-- capitalized--&gt;Ideas]], but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself "[[Form of the Good|the One]]". In the arch-[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is [[Evil|malevolent]], as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of [[Valentinianism|Valentinus]], the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.

==Platonism and neoplatonism==
[[Plato]], as the speaker Timaeus, refers to the Demiurge frequently in the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (28a [[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]), {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;360 BC. The main character refers to the Demiurge as the entity who "fashioned and shaped" the material world. Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly [[:wikt:benevolence|benevolent]], and so it desires a world as good as possible. The world remains imperfect, however, because the Demiurge created the world out of a [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaotic]], [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminate]] non-being.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Plato's work ''Timaeus'' is a philosophical reconciliation of [[Hesiod]]'s cosmology in his ''[[Theogony]]'', [[syncretism|syncretically]] reconciling Hesiod to [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origin|year=1974|first=Joseph|last=Fontenrose|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h56ansk4SyQC&amp;pg=PA226 | isbn=978-0-8196-0285-5 | publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chorology: On Beginning in Plato's Timaeus|year=1999|first=John|last=Sallis|page=86|isbn=0-253-21308-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gS_9aQ5mYKgC&amp;pg=PA86 | publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The mythology of ancient Greece and Italy|first=Thomas|last=Keightley|year=1838|page=44|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=theogony+timaeus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Platonism===
In [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]]'s [[Neo-Pythagorean]] and Middle Platonist [[cosmogony]], the Demiurge is second God as the ''[[nous]]'' or thought of intelligibles and sensibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|last=Kahn|first=Charles|publisher=Hacket Publishing|year=|isbn=978-0-872205758|location=Indianapolis|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoplatonism===
[[Plotinus]] and the later Platonists worked to clarify the Demiurge. To Plotinus, the second [[emanation]] represents an uncreated second cause (see [[Pythagoras]]' [[Dyad (symbol)|Dyad]]). Plotinus sought to reconcile Aristotle's ''[[energeia]]'' with Plato's Demiurge,&lt;ref name="Karamanolis2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karamanolis|first=George|year= 2006|title=Plato and Aristotle in Agreement?: Platonists on Aristotle from Antiochus to Porphyry|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-926456-2|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as Demiurge and mind (''nous''), is a critical component in the [[ontological]] construct of human consciousness used to explain and clarify [[substance theory]] within [[Platonic realism]] (also called [[idealism]]). In order to reconcile Aristotelian with Platonian philosophy,&lt;ref name="Karamanolis2006" /&gt; Plotinus metaphorically identified the demiurge (or ''nous'') within the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon of the Greek Gods]] as [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;The ordering principle is twofold; there is a principle known as the Demiurge, and there is the Soul of the All; the appellation "Zeus" is sometimes applied to the Demiurge and sometimes to the principle conducting the universe.{{cn|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Henology====
The first and highest aspect of God is described by Plato as the One (Τὸ Ἕν, "To Hen"), the source, or the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dionysius the Areopagite and the Neoplatonist Tradition: Despoiling the Hellenes|last=Wear|first=Sarah|last2=Dillon|first2=John|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2013|isbn=9780754603856|location=Burlington, VT|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the God above the Demiurge, and manifests through the actions of the Demiurge. The Monad [[emanation|emanated]] the demiurge or ''[[Nous]]'' (consciousness) from its "indeterminate" vitality due to the monad being so abundant that it overflowed back onto itself, causing self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|year=1992|editor1-first=Richard T.|editor1-last=Wallis|editor2-first=Jay|editor2-last=Bregman|others=[[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads#PPA55,M1 |isbn=978-0-7914-1337-1 |publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This self-reflection of the indeterminate vitality was referred to by Plotinus as the "Demiurge" or creator. The second principle is organization in its reflection of the [[Sentience|nonsentient]] force or ''[[Potentiality and actuality|dynamis]]'', also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is ''energeia'' emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called ''nous'', Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. [[Plotinus]] also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in ''[[The Enneads]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Matter is therefore a non-existent"; Plotinus, ''Ennead'' 2, Tractate 4 Section 16.&lt;/ref&gt; which more correctly is to express the concept of [[idealism]] or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the "mind" or ''nous'' (c.f. [[pantheism]]).

Plotinus' form of [[Platonic idealism]] is to treat the Demiurge, ''nous'' as the contemplative faculty (''ergon'') within man which orders the force (''dynamis'') into conscious reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this Neoplatonist philosopher: "With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught (Enneads, iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time, with the explanation: 'For there is for this universe no other place than the soul or mind' (''neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima''), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (''oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere'')." (Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy", §&amp;nbsp;7) Similarly, Professor Ludwig Noiré wrote: "For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus (Enneads, iii, 7, 10), where he says, 'The only space or place of the world is the soul', and 'Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul'." [5] It is worth noting, however, that like Plato but unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers, Plotinus does not worry about whether or how we can get beyond our ideas in order to know external objects.&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he claimed to reveal Plato's true meaning: a doctrine he learned from Platonic tradition that did not appear outside the academy or in Plato's text. This tradition of creator God as ''nous'' (the manifestation of consciousness), can be validated in the works of pre-Plotinus philosophers such as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], as well as a connection between Hebrew and Platonic cosmology (see also [[Philo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Numenius of Apamea]] was reported to have asked, "What else is Plato than Moses speaking Greek?" Fr. 8 Des Places.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Demiurge of Neoplatonism is the ''Nous'' (mind of God), and is one of the three ordering principles:
* ''[[Arche]]'' (Gr. "beginning") – the source of all things,
* ''[[Logos]]'' (Gr. "reason/cause") – the underlying order that is hidden beneath appearances,
* ''[[:wikt:harmonia|Harmonia]]'' (Gr. "harmony") – numerical [[ratios]] in [[mathematics]].

Before Numenius of Apamea and Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]'', no Platonic works ontologically clarified the Demiurge from the [[allegory]] in Plato's ''Timaeus''. The idea of Demiurge was, however, addressed before Plotinus in the works of Christian writer [[Justin Martyr]] who built his understanding of the Demiurge on the works of Numenius.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

====Iamblichus====
{{See also|Panentheism}}
Later, the Neoplatonist [[Iamblichus of Chalcis|Iamblichus]] changed the role of the "One", effectively altering the role of the Demiurge as second cause or dyad, which was one of the reasons that Iamblichus and his teacher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] came into conflict.

The figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable “One,” or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of ''[[henosis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html Theurgy, Iamblichus and henosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109100359/http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html |date=2010-01-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Iamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (''nous''), while among "the many" that follow it there is a second, super-existent "One" that is the producer of intellect or soul (''psyche'').

The "One" is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a [[wikt:triad#Noun|triad]] is formed of the [[perception|intelligible]] ''nous'', the [[noesis|intellective]] ''nous'', and the ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Actus et potentia|''actus'' and ''potentia'']] (actuality and potentiality) of the [[unmoved mover]] and Plato's Demiurge.

Then within this intellectual triad Iamblichus assigns the third rank to the Demiurge, identifying it with the perfect or Divine ''nous'' with the intellectual triad being promoted to a ''hebdomad'' (pure intellect).

In the theoretic of Plotinus, ''nous'' produces nature through intellectual mediation, thus the intellectualizing gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.

[[Gnosticism]] presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God and the demiurgic "creator" of the material. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Supreme Being]]: his act of creation occurs in an unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine ''in'' materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to){{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the [[problem of evil]].

===Mythos===
One Gnostic [[mythos]] describes the declination of aspects of the divine into human form. [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] (Greek: Σοφία, lit. "wisdom"), the Demiurge's mother a partial aspect of the divine ''[[Pleroma]]'' or "Fullness," desired to create something apart from the [[Absolute (philosophy)|divine totality]], without the receipt of divine assent. In this act of separate creation, she gave birth to the monstrous Demiurge and, being ashamed of her deed, wrapped him in a cloud and created a throne for him within it. The Demiurge, isolated, did not behold his mother, nor anyone else, and concluded that only he existed, ignorant of the superior levels of reality.

The Demiurge, having received a portion of power from his mother, sets about a work of creation in unconscious imitation of the superior [[Pleroma|Pleromatic]] realm: He frames the [[seven heavens]], as well as all material and animal things, according to forms furnished by his mother; working however blindly, and ignorant even of the existence of the mother who is the source of all his energy. He is blind to all that is spiritual, but he is king over the other two provinces. The word ''dēmiourgos'' properly describes his relation to the material; he is the ''father'' of that which is animal like himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Sophia's power becomes enclosed within the material forms of humanity, themselves entrapped within the material universe: the goal of Gnostic movements was typically the awakening of this spark, which permitted a return by the subject to the superior, non-material realities which were its primal source.

===Angels===
[[Psalm 82]] begins ({{bibleref2|Psa|82:1|NET|verse 1}}), "God stands in the assembly of [[El (deity)|El]] (the [[Septuagint]] here says the assembly of gods), in the midst of the gods he renders judgment", indicating a plurality of gods, although it does not indicate that these gods were co-actors in creation. [[Philo]] had inferred from the expression "Let us make man" of the [[Book of Genesis]] that God had used other beings as assistants in the creation of man, and he explains in this way why man is capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the origin of the latter to God, of the former to His helpers in the work of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|It is on this account that Moses says, at the creation of man alone that God said, 'Let us make man,' which expression shows an assumption of other beings to himself as assistants, in order that God, the governor of all things, might have all the blameless intentions and actions of man, when he does right attributed to him; and that his other assistants might bear the imputation of his contrary actions.|{{cite web |title=Philo: On the Creation, XXIV |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book1.html |website=www.earlyjewishwritings.com}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of creation to angels, some of them using the same passage in Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. c. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; So [[Irenaeus]] tells&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of [[Simon Magus]],&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]],&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, i. 24, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of Saturninus, in which the number of these angels is reckoned as seven, and&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; of the system of [[Carpocrates]]. In the report of the system of [[Basilides]],&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 24, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; we are told that our world was made by the angels who occupy the lowest heaven; but special mention is made of their chief, who is said to have been the [[God in Judaism|God of the Jews]], to have led that people out of the land of [[Egypt]], and to have given them their law. The prophecies are ascribed not to the chief but to the other world-making angels.

The Latin translation, confirmed by [[Hippolytus of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]''. vii. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; makes [[Irenaeus]] state that according to [[Cerinthus]] (who shows [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] influence), creation was made by a power quite separate from the Supreme God and ignorant of Him. [[Theodoret]],&lt;ref&gt;Theodoret, ''Haer. Fab''. ii. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; who here copies Irenaeus, turns this into the plural number "powers," and so [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt; represents Cerinthus as agreeing with Carpocrates in the doctrine that the world was made by angels.

===Yaldabaoth===
[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures'' may be a depiction of the Demiurge.]]

In the [[Ophites|Ophite]] and [[Sethians|Sethian]] systems, which have many affinities with the teachings of Valentinus, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]], whose names are given, but still more prominent is their chief, "Yaldabaoth" (also known as "Yaltabaoth" or "Ialdabaoth").

In the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;AD 120–180, the demiurge arrogantly declares that he has made the world by himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now the [[archon]] ["ruler"] who is weak has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas ["fool"], and the third is [[Samael]]. And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said, 'I am God and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.&lt;ref&gt;"Apocryphon of John," translation by Frederik Wisse in ''The Nag Hammadi Library''. Accessed online at [http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn.html gnosis.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of man and gives him a soul, Yaldabaoth is filled with envy; he tries to limit man's knowledge by forbidding him the fruit of knowledge in paradise. At the consummation of all things, all light will return to the [[Pleroma]]. But Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths.&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Demiurge|inline=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaldabaoth is frequently called "the Lion-faced", ''leontoeides'', and is said to have the body of a serpent. The demiurge is also&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 32, p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt; described as having a fiery nature, applying the words of Moses to him: "the Lord our God is a burning and consuming fire". Hippolytus claims that Simon used a similar description.&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', Yaldabaoth has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of pitch, and with other punishments (pp.&amp;nbsp;257, 382). He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half darkness.

Under the name of ''Nebro'' (rebel), Yaldabaoth is called an angel in the [[apocryphal]] ''[[Gospel of Judas]]''. He is first mentioned in "The Cosmos, Chaos, and the Underworld" as one of the twelve angels to come "into being [to] rule over chaos and the [underworld]". He comes from heaven, and it is said his "face flashed with fire and [his] appearance was defiled with blood". Nebro creates six angels in addition to the angel [[Saklas]] to be his assistants. These six, in turn, create another twelve angels "with each one receiving a portion in the heavens".

====Names====
[[File:Leontocephaline-Ostia.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|right|Drawing of the ''leontocephaline'' found at the [[Mithraeum]] of C. Valerius Heracles and sons, dedicated 190 AD at [[Ostia Antica]], Italy (CIMRM 312).]]

The most probable derivation of the name "Yaldabaoth" was that given by [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]]. Giesler believed the name was derived from the Aramaic ''yaldā bahuth'', {{lang|arc|ילדאבהות}}, meaning "Son of Chaos". However, [[Gilles Quispel]] notes:
{{quote|[[Gershom Scholem]], the third genius in this field, more specifically the genius of precision, has taught us that some of us were wrong when they believed that Jaldabaoth means "son of chaos", because the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''bahutha'' in the sense of chaos only existed in the imagination of the author of a well-known dictionary. This is a pity because this name would suit the demiurge risen from chaos to a nicety. And perhaps the author of the ''[[On the Origin of the World|Untitled Document]]'' did not know Aramaic and also supposed as we did once, that ''baoth'' had something to do with ''[[Tohu wa-bohu|tohuwabohu]]'', one of the few Hebrew words that everybody knows. ... It would seem then that the Orphic view of the demiurge was integrated into Jewish Gnosticism even before the redaction of the myth contained in the original ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''. ... [[Phanes]] is represented with the mask of a ''lion's'' head on his breast, while from his sides the heads of a ram and a buck are budding forth: his body is encircled by a snake. This type was accepted by the [[Mithraism|Mithras mysteries]], to indicate [[Aion (deity)|Aion]], the new year, and Mithras, whose numerical value is 365. Sometimes he is also identified with Jao Adonai, the creator of the Hebrews. His hieratic attitude indicates Egyptian origin. The same is true of [[Mithraism#Lion-headed figure|the monstrous figure with the head of a lion]], which symbolises Time, [[Chronos]], in Mithraism; Alexandrian origin of this type is probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quispel|first=Gilles|authorlink=Gilles Quispel|page=64|title=Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica: Collected Essays of Gilles Quispel|editor1-first= Johannes|editor1-last=Van Oort|isbn=978-90-04-13945-9|year=2008|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"[[Samael]]" literally means "Blind God" or "God of the Blind" in Hebrew ({{hebrew|סמאל}}). This being is considered not only blind, or ignorant of its own origins but may, in addition, be evil; its name is also found in [[Judaism]] as the [[Death (personification)#Death (angels) in religion|Angel of Death]] and in Christian [[demon]]ology. This link to Judeo-Christian tradition leads to a further comparison with [[Satan]]. Another alternative title for the demiurge is "Saklas", Aramaic for "fool".

The angelic name "[[Ariel (angel)|Ariel]]" (meaning "the lion of God" in Hebrew)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition|first=Gershom|last=Scholem|publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America|year=1965|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been used to refer to the Demiurge and is called his "perfect" name;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert McLachlan Wilson|title=Nag Hammadi and gnosis: Papers read at the First International Congress of Coptology|year=1976|publisher=BRILL|pages=21–23|quote=''Therefore his esoteric name is Jaldabaoth, whereas the perfect call him Ariel, because he has the appearance of a lion.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some Gnostic lore, Ariel has been called an ancient or original name for Ialdabaoth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustav Davidson|title=A dictionary of angels: including the fallen angels |year=1994 |publisher=Scrollhouse |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name has also been inscribed on amulets as "Ariel Ialdabaoth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David M Gwynn|title=Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity |year=2010 |publisher=BRILL |page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Campbell Bonner |title=An Amulet of the Ophite Gnostics |year=1949 |publisher=The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Hesperia Supplements, Vol. 8|pages=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the figure of the archon inscribed with "Aariel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gilles Quispel |author2=R. van den Broek |author-link2=Roel van den Broek |author3=Maarten Jozef Vermaseren |title=Studies in gnosticism and hellenistic religions|year=1981|publisher=BRILL|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcion===
According to [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]], the title God was given to the Demiurge, who was to be sharply distinguished from the higher Good God. The former was ''díkaios,'' severely just, the latter ''agathós,'' or loving-kind; the former was the "god of this world" ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:4}}), the God of the [[Old Testament]], the latter the true God of the [[New Testament]]. Christ, though in reality the Son of the Good God, pretended to be the Messiah of the Demiurge, the better to spread the truth concerning His heavenly Father. The true believer in Christ entered into God's kingdom, the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

===Valentinus===
It is in the [[Valentinianism|system of Valentinus]] that the name ''Dēmiourgos'' is used, which occurs nowhere in Irenaeus except in connection with the Valentinian system; we may reasonably conclude that it was Valentinus who adopted from Platonism the use of this word. When it is employed by other Gnostics either it is not used in a technical sense, or its use has been borrowed from Valentinus. But it is only the name that can be said to be specially Valentinian; the personage intended by it corresponds more or less closely with the Yaldabaoth of the Ophites, the [[Abraxas|great Archon]] of Basilides, the Elohim of Justinus, etc.

The Valentinian theory elaborates that from Achamoth (''he kátō sophía'' or lower wisdom) three kinds of substance take their origin, the spiritual (''pneumatikoí''), the animal (''psychikoí'') and the material (''hylikoí''). The Demiurge belongs to the second kind, as he was the offspring of a union of Achamoth with matter.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of ''Sophía'' the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propatôr, or Supreme God.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

In creating this world out of Chaos the Demiurge was unconsciously influenced for good; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united with Jesus the Saviour, Who redeemed men. These are either ''hylikoí'' or ''pneumatikoí''.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

The first, or material men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or animal men, together with the Demiurge, will enter a middle state, neither Pleroma nor ''hyle''; the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body (''hyle'') and soul (''psyché'').&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103106.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this most common form of Gnosticism the Demiurge had an inferior though not intrinsically evil function in the universe as the head of the animal, or psychic world.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

===The devil===
Opinions on [[the devil]], and his relationship to the Demiurge, varied. The Ophites held that he and his demons constantly oppose and thwart the human race, as it was on their account the devil was cast down into this world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103130.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 30, 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one variant of the Valentinian system, the Demiurge is also the maker, out of the appropriate substance, of an order of ''spiritual'' beings, the devil, the prince of this world, and his angels. But the devil, as being a ''spirit'' of wickedness, is able to recognise the higher spiritual world, of which his maker the Demiurge, who is only animal, has no real knowledge. The devil resides in this lower world, of which he is the prince, the Demiurge in the heavens; his mother Sophia in the middle region, above the heavens and below the Pleroma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valentinian [[Heracleon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnosis.org/library/fragh.htm Heracleon, Frag. 20.]&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted the devil as the ''principle'' of evil, that of ''hyle'' (matter). As he writes in his commentary on {{bibleverse||John|4:21}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mountain represents the Devil, or his world, since the Devil was one part of the whole of matter, but the world is the total mountain of evil, a deserted dwelling place of beasts, to which all who lived before the law and all Gentiles render worship. But Jerusalem represents the creation or the Creator whom the Jews worship. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. You then who are spiritual should worship neither the creation nor the Craftsman, but the Father of Truth. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This vilification of the creator was held to be inimical to Christianity by the early fathers of the church. In refuting the beliefs of the gnostics, [[Irenaeus]] stated that "Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and himself executing judgment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103325.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', iii. 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathars===
[[Catharism]] apparently inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world from Gnosticism. Quispel writes,

{{quote|There is a direct link between ancient Gnosticism and Catharism. The Cathars held that the creator of the world, Satanael, had usurped the name of God, but that he had subsequently been unmasked and told that he was not really God.&lt;ref&gt;Quispel, Gilles and Van Oort, Johannes (2008), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Neoplatonism and Gnosticism==
{{Wikisource|1=Enneads/Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those that Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil|2=Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those that Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil}}
{{Main|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}
Gnosticism attributed falsehood or evil to the concept of the Demiurge or creator, though in some Gnostic traditions the creator is from a fallen, ignorant, or lesser—rather than evil—perspective, such as that of [[Valentinius]].

===Plotinus===
The Neoplatonic philosopher [[Plotinus]] addressed within his works Gnosticism's conception of the Demiurge, which he saw as un-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and blasphemous to the Demiurge or creator of Plato. Plotinus is noted as the founder of [[Neoplatonism]] (along with his teacher [[Ammonius Saccas]]).&lt;ref&gt;John D. Turner. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140816004048/http://www.unl.edu/classics/faculty/turner/triadaft.htm Neoplatonism].&lt;/ref&gt; In the ninth [[tractate]] of the second of his ''Enneads'', Plotinus criticizes his opponents for their appropriation of ideas from Plato:

{{quote|From Plato come their punishments, their rivers of the underworld and the changing from body to body; as for the plurality they assert in the Intellectual Realm—the Authentic Existent, the Intellectual-Principle, ''the Second Creator and the Soul''—all this is taken over from the Timaeus.|Ennead 2.9.vi; emphasis added from [[A.H. Armstrong]]'s introduction to Ennead 2.9}}

Of note here is the remark concerning the second [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] or Creator and third hypostasis or [[Anima mundi|World Soul]]. Plotinus criticizes his opponents for "all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own" which, he declares, "have been picked up outside of the truth";&lt;ref name="sacred-texts"&gt;"For, in sum, a part of their doctrine comes from Plato; all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own have been picked up outside of the truth." Plotinus "Against the Gnostics", [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/enn161.htm ''Ennead'' II, 9, 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; they attempt to conceal rather than admit their indebtedness to ancient philosophy, which they have corrupted by their extraneous and misguided embellishments. Thus their understanding of the Demiurge is similarly flawed in comparison to Plato’s original intentions.

Whereas Plato's Demiurge is good wishing good on his creation, Gnosticism contends that the Demiurge is not only the originator of evil but is evil as well. Hence the title of Plotinus' refutation: "Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Kosmos and the Kosmos Itself to be Evil" (generally quoted as "Against the Gnostics"). Plotinus argues of the disconnect or great barrier that is created between the ''nous'' or mind's [[noumenon]] (see [[Heraclitus]]) and the material world ([[phenomenon]]) by believing the material world is evil.

The majority of scholars tend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plotinus: Enneads II|edition=Loeb Classical Library|author=Plotinus, Arthur Hilary Armstrong (trans.)|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1966|quote=From this point to the end of ch. 12 Plotinus is attacking a Gnostic myth known to us best at present in the form it took in the system of Valentinus. The Mother, Sophia-Achamoth, produced as a result of the complicated sequence of events which followed the fall of the higher Sophia, and her offspring the Demiurge, the inferier and ignorant maker of the material universe, are Valentinian figures; cp. Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.4 and 5. Valentinius had been in Rome, and there is nothing improbable in the presence of Valentinians there in the time of Plotinus. But the evidence in the ''Life'' ch. 16 suggests that the Gnostics in Plotinus's circle belonged rather to the older group called Sethians or [[Archontics]], related to the [[Ophites]] or [[Barbelo]]gnostics: they probably called themselves simply 'Gnostics.' Gnostic sects borrowed freely from each other, and it is likely that Valentinius took some of his ideas about Sophia from older Gnostic sources, and that his ideas in turn influenced other Gnostics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to understand Plotinus' opponents as being a Gnostic sect—certainly (specifically [[Sethianism|Sethian]]), several such groups were present in [[Alexandria]] and elsewhere about the [[Mediterranean]] during Plotinus' lifetime. Plotinus specifically points to the Gnostic doctrine of Sophia and her emission of the Demiurge.

Though the former understanding certainly enjoys the greatest popularity, the identification of Plotinus' opponents as Gnostic is not without some contention. Christos Evangeliou has contended&lt;ref&gt;Evangeliou, "Plotinus's Anti-Gnostic Polemic and Porphyry's Against the Christians", in Wallis &amp; Bregman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Plotinus%27s+Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+and+Porphyry%27s+Against+the+Christians%22+Christos+Evangeliou&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSBVKFe8VD&amp;sig=3MNVVSq8bDZs4koa-yMP6PaNT-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jR4hTIK_AsP48AbV_shl&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Plotinus%27s%20Anti-Gnostic%20Polemic%20and%20Porphyry%27s%20Against%20the%20Christians%22%20Christos%20Evangeliou&amp;f=false p. 111.]&lt;/ref&gt; that Plotinus’ opponents might be better described as simply "Christian Gnostics", arguing that several of Plotinus’ criticisms are as applicable to orthodox Christian doctrine as well. Also, considering the evidence from the time, Evangeliou thought the definition of the term "Gnostics" was unclear. Of note here is that while Plotinus' student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] names [[Christianity]] specifically in Porphyry's own works, and Plotinus is to have been a known associate of the Christian [[Origen]], none of Plotinus' works mention Christ or Christianity—whereas Plotinus specifically addresses his target in the ''Enneads'' as the Gnostics.

[[A.H. Armstrong]] identified the so-called "Gnostics" that Plotinus was attacking as Jewish and Pagan, in his introduction to the tract in his translation of the ''Enneads''. Armstrong alluding to Gnosticism being a Hellenic philosophical heresy of sorts, which later engaged Christianity and Neoplatonism.&lt;ref&gt;From "Introduction to Against the Gnostics", Plotinus' ''Enneads'' as translated by A.H. Armstrong, pp. 220–22: "The treatise as it stands in the Enneads is a most powerful protest on behalf of Hellenic philosophy against the un-Hellenic heresy (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch. 10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch. 16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sources de Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, pp. 220–22: "Short statement of the doctrine of the three hypostasis, the One, Intellect and Soul; there cannot be more or fewer than these three. Criticism of the attempts to multiply the hypostasis, and especially of the idea of two intellects, one which thinks and that other which thinks that it thinks. (ch. 1). The true doctrine of Soul (ch. 2). The law of necessary procession and the eternity of the universe (ch.3). Attack on the Gnostic doctrine of the making of the universe by a fallen soul, and on their despising of the universe and the heavenly bodies (chs. 4–5). The senseless jargon of the Gnostics, their plagiarism from and perversion of Plato, and their insolent arrogance (ch. 6). The true doctrine about Universal Soul and the goodness of the universe which it forms and rules (chs. 7–8). Refutation of objections from the inequalities and injustices of human life (ch. 9). Ridiculous arrogance of the Gnostics who refuse to acknowledge the hierarchy of created gods and spirits and say that they alone are sons of God and superior to the heavens (ch. 9). The absurdities of the Gnostic doctrine of the fall of "Wisdom" (Sophia) and of the generation and activities of the Demiurge, maker of the visible universe (chs. 10–12). False and melodramatic Gnostic teaching about the cosmic spheres and their influence (ch. 13). The blasphemous falsity of the Gnostic claim to control the higher powers by magic and the absurdity of their claim to cure diseases by casting out demons (ch. 14). The false other-worldliness of the Gnostics leads to immorality (ch. 15). The true Platonic other-worldliness, which love and venerates the material universe in all its goodness and beauty as the most perfect possible image of the intelligible, contracted at length with the false, Gnostic, other-worldliness which hates and despises the material universe and its beauties (chs. 16–18)."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. Turner]], professor of religious studies at the University of Nebraska, and famed translator and editor of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], stated&lt;ref&gt;Turner, "Gnosticism and Platonism", in Wallis &amp; Bregman.&lt;/ref&gt; that the text Plotinus and his students read was Sethian Gnosticism, which predates Christianity. It appears that Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[dystheism]] or [[misotheism]] for the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.

[[Emil Cioran]] also wrote his ''Le mauvais démiurge'' ("The Evil Demiurge"), published in 1969, influenced by Gnosticism and [[Schopenhauer]]ian interpretation of Platonic ontology, as well as that of Plotinus.

[[File:Pink lily flower.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] symbolizes non-attachment in some religions in Asia owing to its ability to soar over the muddy waters and produce an immaculate flower.]]

'''Detachment''', also expressed as '''non-attachment''', is a state in which a person overcomes his or her attachment to desire for things, people or concepts of the world and thus attains a heightened [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. It is considered a [[wisdom|wise]] [[virtue]] and is promoted in various Eastern religions, such as [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].

==Importance of the term==
Detachment as release from desire and consequently from suffering is an important principle, or even ideal, in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Stoicism]], and [[Taoism]].

In Buddhist and Hindu religious texts the opposite concept is expressed as ''[[upādāna]]'', translated as "attachment". Attachment, that is the inability to practice or embrace detachment, is viewed as the main obstacle towards a serene and fulfilled life. Many other spiritual traditions identify the lack of detachment with the continuous worries and restlessness produced by desire and personal ambitions.

==Baha'i Faith==
"Thou hast inquired about detachment. It is well known to thee that by detachment is intended the detachment of the soul from all else but God. That is, it consisteth in soaring up to an eternal station, wherein nothing that can be seen between heaven and earth deterreth the seeker from the Absolute Truth. In other words, he is not veiled from divine love or from busying himself with the mention of God by the love of any other thing or by his immersion therein."

The second definition is in the Words of Wisdom: "The essence of detachment is for man to turn his face towards the courts of the Lord, to enter His Presence, behold His Countenance, and stand as witness before Him." (Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p.&amp;nbsp;155)

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Nekkhamma}}
Regarding the concept of detachment, or non-attachment, [[Buddhist]] texts in [[Pali]] mention ''nekkhamma'', a word generally translated as "renunciation". This word also conveys more specifically the meaning of "giving up the world and leading a holy life" or "freedom from lust, craving and desires."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707141638/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:692.pali entry for "Nekkhamma"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings of [[Milarepa]], are canonical [[Mahayana]] Buddhist texts that emphasize the temporary nature of the physical body and the need for non-attachment.

Detachment is a central concept in [[Zen]] Buddhist philosophy. One of the most important technical Chinese terms for detachment is ''"wú niàn"'' (無念), which literally means "no thought." This does not signify the literal absence of thought, but rather the state of being "unstained" (''bù rán'' 不染) by thought. Therefore, "detachment" is being detached from one's thoughts. It is to separate oneself from one's own thoughts and opinions in detail as to not be harmed mentally and emotionally by them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Platform_Sutra.pdf ''The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch'' translated by Philip B. Yampolsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[Eastern Christian monasticism]] cultivated practices of detached [[Watchfulness (Christian)|watchfulness]] which were designed to calm the passions and lead to an ongoing state of calm detachment known as [[apatheia]].

In Western Christianity, [[Ignatian spirituality]] encourages detachment, sometimes referred to as ''indifference'', in order to maximize a person's ''availability'' to God and to their neighbors.

==Hinduism==
The Hindu view of detachment comes from the understanding of the nature of existence and the true ultimate state sought is that of being in the moment. In other words, while one is responsible and active, one does not worry about the past or future. The detachment is towards the result of one's actions rather than towards everything in life. This concept is cited extensively within [[Puranic]] and [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature, for example:
{{Quote|One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action, as the lotus is untouched by water. |[[Bhagavad Gita]] 5.10:}}

[[Vairagya]] is a Hindu term which is often translated as detachment.

==Jainism==
Detachment is one of the supreme ideals of [[Jainism]], together with [[non-violence]]. Non-possession/Non-attachment is one of the [[Mahavrata]]s, the five great vows [[Jain muni|Jain monk]]s observe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/5vows.txt  Five Great Vows]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism==
The [[Tao Te Ching]] expressed the concept (in chapter 44) as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fame or Self: Which matters more?
Self or Wealth: Which is more precious?
Gain or Loss: Which is more painful?
He who is attached to things will suffer much.
He who saves will suffer heavy loss.
A contented man is rarely disappointed.
He who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble.
He will stay forever safe.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11930">'''Dickinson Sargeant Miller''' (October 7, 1868 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1963) worked with many world-renowned philosophers, including [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[John Dewey]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Loyd Easton, ''Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare", Reidel, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Miller received the A.B. degree in 1889 under George Fullerton at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He studied psychology under [[G. Stanley Hall]] at [[Clark University]] for a year, and then went to [[Harvard]] where he was a graduate student under [[William James]], G. H. Palmer, [[Josiah Royce]], and Santayana. He received the A.M. from Harvard in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Loyd Easton, ''Dickinson Miller: Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare", p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

He then spent a year in Germany studying at Berlin and Halle under [[Max Dessoir]], [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], and [[Friedrich Paulsen]], earning his Ph.D. with a dissertation on ''Das Wesen der Erkenntnis und des Irrthums'', which was published as "The Meaning of Truth and Error" in ''The Philosophical Review'' in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

This article led James to abandon Royce's solution of the knowledge problem in terms of an absolute mind. James recommended Miller to a post at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1893, where he was a close friend of [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Miller became a strong critic of James's famous arguments in ''The Will to Believe'' that the beneficial effects of a belief somehow increased its "truth."  His critical article was "The Will to Believe and the Duty to Doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Barton Perry, ''The Thought and Character of William James'', vol. 2, p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller left Bryn Mawr that year to become an instructor of philosophy at Harvard, where he had a strong and productive collaboration with James.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; James referred to Miller as "my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/hobart/ "R. E. Hobart" on Information Philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Miller left Harvard to be a lecturer in philosophy at Columbia and professor in 1911. There he worked with [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] and John Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller retired from academic work after two years at Smith College (1926-26) and went into a "European retirement." &lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Rome at first and then alternated between Florence and Vienna, where he made contact with the "Vienna Circle" of philosophers, including [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], and others.

Miller challenged a basic principle of the Circle that "no sentence can be admitted to philosophical thought as having a meaning unless it is verifiable in experience." Such a principle, he argued "cuts the ground from under its own feet" because a sentence has to already have meaning before you can apply the test.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vienna he met with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] who was then loosely associated with the Vienna Circle.

==Free will as involving determination==
In 1934, as Miller left to return for America, he published a landmark article in ''Mind'' under the pseudonym [[R. E. Hobart]],.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Hobart, Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It" ''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

He analyzed the relationship between "could" and "can" in the sense of choosing to do otherwise in the same circumstances and he claimed that the controversy of free will ''versus'' determinism was a waste of energy over a false antithesis. At least some determinism is not a problem for free will but a feature.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was titled "Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It," but it is widely misquoted as "Involving [[Determinism]]." His biographer, Loyd Easton, correctly describes it as "an acute example of 'soft determinism' or 'reconciliationism'."&lt;ref&gt;Easton, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of "determinism" ''versus'' free will that [[William James]] was concerned about was the strict causal determines that is better called [[predeterminism]] where every event is determined in a causal chain back to the beginning of time, and there is "but one possible future," as James put it.&lt;ref&gt;James, William. 1884. The Dilemma of Determinism, Unitarian Review, vol.XXII, p.193. Reprinted in The Will to Believe, Dover Publications, 1956, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

Far from "reconciling" free will with this kind of determinism, as [[David Hume]] said that he had done in his "reconciling project,",&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding'', VIII, 1, §72&lt;/ref&gt; James proposed the first two-stage model of free will that denies [[predeterminism]] and accepts absolute [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]] as necessary for the generation of [[Alternative Possibilities|alternative possibilities]], which are the source of "ambiguous futures" selected by the determination, but not predetermination, of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Doyle, "Jamesian Free Will: The Two-Stage Model of William James," ''William James Studies'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller/Hobart dissents from James's new idea about free will, constructing a distinctive  reconciling compatibilism that dispenses with any requirement for chance in the analysis of what persons' abilities to perform alternate acts.  Rather than analyzing causality as Hume did, Hobart focuses on moral evaluation of acts and character.

==The ''Mind'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://philpapers.org/archive/HOBFWA.pdf|title = Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It|date = 24 March 2015|accessdate = 24 March 2015 |website = Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It|publisher = |last = Hobart|first = R.E.|type = PDF|orig-year = 1934|publication-date = January 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Writing about six years after the discovery of [[quantum indeterminacy]], Hobart explicitly does not endorse strict logical or physical [[determinism]], and he explicitly does endorse the existence of [[Alternative Possibilities|alternative possibilities]], i.e., that we can do otherwise in the same circumstances.  Hobart does not, however, attribute those possibilities to absolute chance.

He says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I am not maintaining that determinism is true; only that it is true in so far as we have free will.  ... it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance. All that is here said is that such absence of determination, if and so far as it exists, is no gain to freedom, but sheer loss of it&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    "We say," I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose ". Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We can contrast Hobart with William James's claim that there are ambiguous futures. The  second paragraph is not inconsistent with the two-stage model of free will - first "free" courses of action present themselves, then an adequately determined "will" chooses between them, in a temporal sequence.  However, the first paragraph denies that any randomness in the decision process, including the presentation of options, adds to freedom.

Hobart refers to [[G. E. Moore]]'s idea that one could have done otherwise - "if" one had chosen otherwise. But Hobart views the "if" as redundant, and therefore licenses the claim that we could have done otherwise, full stop.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Thus it is true, after the act of will, that I could have willed otherwise. It is most natural to add, "if I had wanted to"; but the addition is not required. The point is the meaning of "could". I could have willed whichever way I pleased. I had the power to will otherwise, there was nothing to prevent my doing so, and I should have done so if I had wanted.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobart finds fault with the indeterminist's position, but he gives the typical overstatement by a determinist critic, that any chance will be the direct cause of our actions, which of course would clearly be a loss of freedom and responsibility

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Indeterminism maintains that we need not be impelled to action by our wishes, that our active will need not be determined by them. Motives "incline without necessitating". We choose amongst the ideas of action before us, but need not choose solely according to the attraction of desire, in however wide a sense that word is used. Our inmost self may rise up in its autonomy and moral dignity, independently of motives, and register its sovereign decree.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Now, in so far as this "interposition of the self" is undetermined, the act is not its act, it does not issue from any concrete continuing self; it is born at the moment, of nothing, hence it expresses no quality; it bursts into being from no source. (p.6)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    In proportion as an act of volition starts of itself without cause it is exactly, so far as the freedom of the individual is concerned, as if it had been thrown into his mind from without — "suggested" to him — by a freakish demon. It is exactly like it in this respect, that in neither case does the volition arise from what the man is, cares for or feels allegiance to; it does not come out of him. In proportion as it is undetermined, it is just as if his legs should suddenly spring up and carry him off where he did not prefer to go. Far from constituting freedom, that would mean, in the exact measure in which it took place, the loss of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Possibly Hobart has William James in mind as "the indeterminist." However, the only inderminist philosopher named in the article is Eddington. James would not have denied that our will is an act of determination, consistent with, and in some sense "caused by" our character and values, our habits, and our current feelings and desires. He simply wanted chance to provide alternative possibilities for actions and a break in the causal chain of [[strict determinism (philosophy)|strict determinism]].

Hobart sees no need for such chance, and no addition to freedom to be had by it. The freedom we take ourselves to have is fully consistent with thorough-going determinism regarding human action.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    In daily life we are all determinists, just as we are all libertarians. We are constantly attributing behaviour to the character, the temperament, the peculiarities of the person and expecting him to behave in certain fashions. The very words of our daily converse, as we have so amply observed, are full of determinism. And we see nothing inconsistent in being aware at the same time that he is free in choosing his course, as we know ourselves to be.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7580">A '''disjunctive sequence''' is an infinite [[Sequence#Infinite sequences in theoretical computer science|sequence]] (over a finite [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of [[character (computing)|characters]]) in which every [[String (computer science)#Formal theory|finite string]] appears as a [[substring]]. For instance, the binary [[Champernowne constant|Champernowne sequence]]

:&lt;math&gt;0\ 1\ 00\ 01\ 10\ 11\ 000\ 001 \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

formed by concatenating all binary strings in [[shortlex order]], clearly contains all the binary strings and so is disjunctive. (The spaces above are not significant and are present solely to make clear the boundaries between strings).  The [[complexity function]] of a disjunctive sequence ''S'' over an alphabet of size ''k'' is ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Bug91&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Any [[normal number|normal sequence]] (a sequence in which each string of equal length appears with equal frequency) is disjunctive, but the [[Conversion (logic)|converse]] is not true. For example, letting 0''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' denote the string of length ''n'' consisting of all 0s, consider the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;0\ 0^1\ 1\ 0^2\ 00\ 0^4\ 01\ 0^8\ 10\ 0^{16}\ 11\ 0^{32}\ 000\ 0^{64}\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

obtained by splicing exponentially long strings of 0s into the [[shortlex order]]ing of all binary strings. Most of this sequence consists of long runs of 0s, and so it is not normal, but it is still disjunctive.

A disjunctive sequence is [[recurrent word|recurrent]] but never uniformly recurrent/almost periodic.

:If ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., is a strictly increasing infinite sequence of positive integers such that [[Limit of a sequence|&lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;''n'' → ∞&lt;/sub&gt; (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; / ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1,
:then for any positive integer ''m'' and any integer [[Radix|base]] ''b'' ≥ 2, there is an ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; whose expression in base ''b'' starts with the expression of ''m'' in base ''b''. 
:(Consequently, the infinite sequence obtained by concatenating the base-''b'' expressions for ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., is disjunctive over the alphabet {0, 1, ..., ''b''-1}.)

Two simple cases illustrate this result:
* ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''k'' is a fixed positive integer. (In this case, &lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;sub&gt;''n'' → ∞&lt;/sub&gt; (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; / ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = &lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;sub&gt;''n'' → ∞&lt;/sub&gt; ( (''n''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; / ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ) = &lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;sub&gt;''n'' → ∞&lt;/sub&gt; (1 + 1/''n'')&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.)

:are disjunctive on {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
* ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[prime number]]. (In this case, &lt;tt&gt;lim&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;sub&gt;''n'' → ∞&lt;/sub&gt; (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; / ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 is a consequence of [[Prime number theorem#Approximations for the nth prime number|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ~ ''n'' ln ''n'']].)
: E.g., the sequences

:: 10111011111011110110001 ... (using base two),

are disjunctive on the respective digit sets.

Another result&lt;ref&gt;http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa81/aa8143.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a variety of disjunctive sequences is as follows:
:If ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;[[floor]]&lt;/tt&gt;(''f''(''n'')), where ''f'' is any non-constant [[polynomial]] with [[Real number|real]] coefficients such that ''f''(''x'') &gt; 0 for all ''x'' &gt; 0, 
:then the concatenation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;... (with the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; expressed in base ''b'') is a [[Normal number#Definitions|normal]] sequence in base ''b'', and is therefore disjunctive on {0, 1, ..., ''b''-1}.

E.g., using base-ten expressions, the sequences
:: 818429218031851879211521610... (with ''f''(''x'') = 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - 5''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 11''x'' )
:: 591215182124273034... (with ''f''(''x'') = [[pi|π]]''x'' + [[Euler's number|e]])
are disjunctive on {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

==Rich numbers==
A '''rich number''' or '''disjunctive number''' is a [[real number]] whose expansion with respect to some base ''b'' is a disjunctive sequence over the alphabet {0,...,''b''−1}.  Every [[normal number]] in base ''b'' is disjunctive but not conversely.  The real number ''x'' is rich in base ''b'' if and only if the set { ''x b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod 1} is [[Dense set|dense]] in the [[unit interval]].&lt;ref name=Bug92&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Lexicon}}&lt;!--[[Lexicon (mathematics)]] redirects here--&gt; A number that is disjunctive to every base is called ''absolutely disjunctive'' or is said to be a ''lexicon''. Every [[String (computer science)|string]] in every alphabet occurs within a lexicon.  A set is called "[[comeager]]" or "residual" if it contains the intersection of a countable family of open dense sets. The set of absolutely disjunctive reals is residual.&lt;ref name=CZ1999&gt;Calude &amp; Zamfirescu (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conjectured that every real irrational algebraic number is absolutely disjunctive.&lt;ref name=AB414&gt;Adamczewski &amp; Bugeaud (2010) p.414&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">'''Forecast by analogy''' is a [[forecasting]] method that assumes that two different kinds of [[phenomena]] share the same [[behavioral modeling|model of behaviour]]. For example, one way to predict the sales of a new product is to choose an existing product which "looks like" the new product in terms of the expected [[demand (economics)|demand pattern]] for sales of the product.

"Used with care, an [[analogy]] is a form of scientific model that can be used to analyze and explain the behavior of other phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Ready: How to Master Business Forecasting |isbn=978-0-470-74705-6 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some experts, research has shown that the careful application of analogies improves the accuracy of the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/INTFOR3581%20-%20Publication%2015.pdf | title = Structured analogies for forecasting | author = Kesten C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8656">In [[philosophy]], the phrase '''further facts'''  refers to facts that do not [[logical consequence|follow logically]] from the physical facts of the world.&lt;ref name="Parfit"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfit|first=Derek|title=Reasons and Persons|pages=309-310|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198249085|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reasons-and-persons-9780198249085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chalmers|first=David|title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory|pages=84-87|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195117899|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/the-conscious-mind-9780195117899}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reductionism|Reductionists]] who argue that at bottom there is nothing more than the physical facts thus argue against the existence of further facts. The concept of further facts plays a key role in some of the major works in [[analytic philosophy]] of the late 20th century, including in [[Derek Parfit]]'s ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'', and [[David Chalmers]]'s ''[[The Conscious Mind]]''.

One context in which the existence of further facts is debated is that of [[personal identity]] across time: in what sense is Alice today really the ''same'' person as Alice yesterday, given that across the two days the state of her brain is different and the atoms that constitute her are different?  One may believe that at bottom, there is nothing more than the atoms and their arrangement at different points in time; while we may for practical purposes come up with some notion of sameness of a person, this notion does not reflect anything deeper about [[reality]].  Under this view there would be no further facts.  Alternatively, one may believe that there is a deeper sense in which Alice yesterday and Alice today really are the same person.  For example, if one believes in [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian souls]], one may believe that Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person if and only if they correspond to the same soul.  Or one may not believe in Cartesian souls, but yet believe that whether Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person is a question about something other than facts about which atoms constitute them and how they are arranged. These would both be further-fact views.

[[File:Derek_Parfit_at_Harvard-April_21,_2015-Effective_Altruism_(cropped).jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Derek Parfit]]]]
The debate about further facts about personal identity over time is most closely associated with Derek Parfit.  In his ''Reasons and Persons'', he describes the non-reductionist's view that "personal identity is a deep further fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity".&lt;ref name="Parfit" /&gt;  Parfit takes a reductionist stance and argues against this further-fact view.  As a result it is not clear whether a person has any reason to be worried about her future [[self]] in a special way that does not also apply to worrying about others, with Parfit arguing that it is plausible that "only the deep further fact gives me a reason to be specially concerned about my future" (his so-called "Extreme Claim").&lt;ref name="Parfit" /&gt; [[Sydney Shoemaker]] objects that it is not clear how a further fact would give a reason for such special concerns, either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shoemaker|first=Sydney|title=Critical notice of ''Reasons and Persons''|journal=Mind|date=1985|volume=94|pages=443–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Langsam has attempted to give a positive account of how a further fact would give such a reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langsam|first=Harold|title=Pain, Personal Identity, and the Deep Further Fact|journal=Erkenntnis|date=2001|volume=54|issue=2|pages=247–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David_Chalmers_TASC2008.JPG|left|100px|thumb|[[David Chalmers]]]]
David Chalmers lists a number of other types of candidates for further facts.&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;  One is facts about [[consciousness|conscious experience]].  For example, it is difficult to see how it follows from the physical facts [[qualia|what it is like]] to experience seeing red; indeed, [[inverted spectrum]] scenarios, where we imagine that experiences of colors are swapped without anything else changing, might suggest that things could have been different without the physical facts changing.  Another candidate for a further fact is the fact that there is any conscious experience at all, rather than everyone being a [[philosophical zombie]]. Christopher Hill and Brian Mclaughlin have argued against the idea that facts about consciousness are further facts, disputing the [[logical possibility]] of a world physically identical to ours in which the facts about consciousness are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Christopher|last2=Mclaughlin|first2=Brian|title=Review: There are Fewer Things in Reality Than are Dreamt of in Chalmers's Philosophy|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=1999|volume=59|issue=2|pages=445–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers also considers facts about [[indexicality]].  He cites the fact that "''I'' am David Chalmers", noting that its significance seems to go beyond the [[Tautology_(logic)|tautology]] that David Chalmers is David Chalmers. (See also Caspar Hare's [[egocentric presentism]] and Benj Hellie's [[vertiginous question]].&lt;ref name="JPhil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hare|first=Caspar|title=Self-Bias, Time-Bias, and the Metaphysics of Self and Time|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=July 2007|volume=104|issue=7|pages=350–373|url=http://web.mit.edu/~casparh/www/Papers/CJHareSelfBias2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hare|first=Caspar|title=On Myself, and Other, Less Important Subjects|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691135311|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8921.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hellie|first=Benj|title=Against egalitarianism|journal=Analysis|year=2013|volume=73|issue=2|pages=304–320|doi=10.1093/analys/ans101}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, in the [[philosophy of space and time|philosophy of time]], what date and time it is ''now'' might be considered a candidate for a further fact, in the sense that a being that knows everything about the full four-dimensional block of [[spacetime]] would still not know what time it is ''now''. (See also [[B-theory of time|the A-theory and the B-theory of time]].)

A final type of fact that Chalmers considers is that of ''negative'' facts.  For example, consider the following statement: there do not exist nonphysical [[angel|angels]].  If in fact true, it does not seem that this logically follows from any of the physical facts by themselves; but, he argues, it would follow if one added a "That is all" statement at the end of the list of all the physical facts.

Vincent Conitzer has used the following [[simulation hypothesis|computer simulation scenarios]] to illuminate further facts about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), indexicality, and personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it.  The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the [[physics]] of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her experience by themselves.  But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation that she is watching.  Could she not still reach the same conclusion?  And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

Gender binary is one general type of a [[gender systems|gender system]]. Sometimes in this binary model, "sex", "gender" and "sexuality" are assumed by default to align. For example, when a male is born, gender binarism assumes the male will be masculine in appearance, character traits, and behavior, including having a [[heterosexual]] attraction to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keating |first1=Anne |title=glbtq &gt;&gt; literature &gt;&gt; Gender |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gender.html |website=www.glbtq.com |publisher=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403155153/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/gender.html |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''gender binary'' describes the system in which a society splits its members into one of two sets of [[gender role]]s, [[gender identity|gender identities]] and attributes based on the shape of genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64453299|title=Gendered bodies : feminist perspectives|last=Judith.|first=Lorber,|date=2007|publisher=Roxbury Pub.

Islam, for example, teaches that mothers are the primary care givers to their children and Catholics only allow [[cisgender]] men to serve as priests.

Worldwide, there are many individuals and even several subcultures that can be considered exceptions to the gender binary or specific [[transgender]] identities. In addition to individuals whose bodies are naturally [[intersex]], there are also specific social roles that involve aspects of both or neither of the binary genders. These include the [[Two-Spirit]]ed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] of [[India]]. In the contemporary [[Western world|West]], [[genderqueer]] people break the gender binary by refusing terms like "male" and "female". [[Transgender]] people have a unique place in relation to the gender binary. In some cases, their gender expression aligns with their sex. Attempting to conform to societal expectations for their gender, transsexual individuals may opt for surgery, hormones, or both, which can be difficult if the individual does not "pass" as [[cisgender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to Thomas Keith in ''Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture'', the longstanding cultural assumption that male–female dualities are "natural and immutable" partly explains the persistence of systems of [[patriarchy]] and [[male privilege]] in modern society.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keith |first1=Thomas |title=Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture: An Intersectional Approach to the Complexities and Challenges of Male Identity |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-31-759534-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_niDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;dq=binary+%22patriarchy+and+male+privilege%22 |page=2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Some feminist scholars have contested the existence of a clear gender binary. [[Judith Lorber]] explains the problem of failing to question dividing people into these two groups “even though they often find more significant within-group differences than between-group differences.”&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith. "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology." In ''The Gendered Society Reader,'' edited by Michael S. Kimmel, Amy Aronson, and Amy Kaler, 11-18. Toronto, ON: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber argues that this corroborates the fact that the gender binary is arbitrary and leads to false expectations of both men and women. Instead, there is growing support for the possibility of utilizing additional categories that compare people without "prior assumptions about who is like whom".&lt;ref name="lorber"/&gt; By allowing for a more fluid approach to gender, people will be able to better identify themselves however they choose and scholarly research will find different similarities and differences.{{Ambiguous|date=March 2017}}

==Rejection==
[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] suggests a classification of 23 sexes and a move away from the socially constructed gender binary classification of male and female. In her paper "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough", she discusses the existence of intersex people, individuals possessing a combination of male and female sexual characteristics, who are seen as deviations from the norm and who frequently undergo coercive surgery at a very young age in order to maintain the two-gender system. The existence of these individuals challenges the standards of gender binaries and put into question society's role in constructing gender.&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book | author = Morgan Holmes | title = Intersex: A Perilous Difference

The '''grotesque body''' is a concept, or [[literary trope]], put forward by Russian [[literary critic]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his study of [[François Rabelais]]' work. The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [[anatomy]]. In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perforations: Grotesque Corpus |url=http://www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf3/grotesque_corpus.html |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by means of this information that Bakhtin pinpoints two important [[subtext]]s: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]), and the second is ''grotesque realism'' (grotesque body). Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina and Michael Holquist 297-299, ''Mikhail Bakhtin''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carnival ==
[[File:GreatSouthCarnivalMaskers.jpg|thumb|321x321px|Grotesque masks are shown here, worn by many at a carnival.]]
The [[Carnival]] is known as the feast of fools. In today's world, this is better known as [[Mardi Gras]]. Mardi Gras is a religious celebration where people consume copious amounts of food and wine and have a large party to celebrate. The grotesqueness in the carnival is seen as the abundance and large amount of food consumed by the body. There is much emphasis put on the mouth  (where the body can be entered). Eating, drinking, burping from excess, etc. is all done through the mouth. Rabelais uses the Carnival to refer to politics and critique the world based on human anatomy.

In the Italian celebration of Carnival, masks play a major role as many people wear them during the celebration. Many of these masks can be seen as an exaggeration of the grotesque as they feature enlarged facial elements such as an enlarged nose (which is a part of the grotesque body). The Italian celebration of carnival is similar to that of Mardi Gras where food and alcohol are consumed in excess.

Both renditions of Carnival are celebrated immediately before the Christian season of [[Lent]] which is about a 40-day season for people of Christian (primarily Catholic) faith to cleanse themselves and become pure before [[Easter]] Sunday.

== Grotesque realism ==

Exaggeration, hyperbole, and expressiveness are all key elements of the grotesque style. Certain aspects of the body are referenced when talking about the grotesque. These things include elements of the body that either protrude from the body or a part of the body that can be entered. This is because the body in many cases is seen as pure where as the outside world is not. Therefore, parts of the body that allow the outside world in or allow elements inside the body out, are seen and used as an exaggeration of the grotesque. In the article, "Absurdity and Hidden Truth: Cunning Intelligence and Grotesque Body Images as Manifestations of the Trickster", Koepping refers back to Bakhtin's statement, "The themes of cursing and of laughter are almost exclusively a subject of the grotesqueness of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 1062254|title = History of Religions, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Feb., 1985), pp. 191-214|date = Feb 1985|publisher = University of Chicago Press|last = Koepping|first = Klaus-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Small grotesque scoffing.JPG|thumb|255x255px|The grotesque is used here through the use of the mouth in the architecture of a building.]]
Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] explained: "[[satire]] exhibits the grotesque body, which is dominated by the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]] (eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sex) to celebrate the victory of life: the social and the [[Corporeality|corporeal]] are joyfully joint in something indivisible, universal and beneficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Se Dio avesse voluto che credessimo in lui, sarebbe esistito (in Italian) |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/276|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin explained how the grotesque body is a celebration of the cycle of life: the grotesque body is a comic figure of profound ambivalence: its positive meaning is linked to birth and renewal and its negative meaning is linked to death and decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazen Brides Grotesque Daughters Treacherous Mothers by Felicity Collins (Bakhtin, 308-317) |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/women_funny_oz/ |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042917/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/23/women_funny_oz.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rabelais' epoch (1500–1800) "it was appropriate to ridicule the [[king]] and [[clergy]], to use dung and [[urine]] to [[wikt:degradation|degrade]]; this was not to just [[Insult|mock]], it was to unleash what Bakhtin saw as the people’s power, to renew and regenerate the entire [[social system]]. It was the power of the people’s festive-carnival, a way to turn the official spectacle inside-out and upside down, just for a while; long enough to make an impression on the participating official stratum. With the advent of modernity (science, technology, [[industrial revolution]]), the mechanistic overtook the organic, and the officialdom no longer came to join in festive-carnival. The bodily lower stratum of humor dualized from the upper stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boje | first = David M. |date=March 2004 | title = Grotesque Method | journal = Proceedings of First International Co-sponsored Conference, Research methods Division, Academy of Management: Crossing Frontiers in Quantitative and Qualitative Research methods. | volume = 2 | pages = 1085–1114 | url = http://peaceaware.com/McD/papers/Lyon%20proceedings%20Boje%202994%20Grotesque%20Method%20.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early uses of grotesque ==
Before people began to develop literature or art, leaders would sit in their halls surrounded by their warriors amusing themselves by mocking their opponents and enemies. The warriors would laugh at any weakness or defect, either physical or mental, giving nicknames which exaggerated these traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art|last = Wright|first = Thomas|publisher = Virtue Brothers &amp; CO.|year = 1865|isbn = |location = London|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon warriors sought to give a more permanent form to their ridicule, which led to rude depictions on bare rocks, or any other surface that was convenient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Medieval Grotesque Carnival, emphasis is put on the nether regions of the body as the center and creation of meaning. The spirit rather than coming from above comes from the belly, buttocks, and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lübker, Henrik. "The Method of In-between in the Grotesque and the Works of Leif Lage." Continent. N.p., Mar. 2012. Web. 22 Oct. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hempel's dilemma''' is a question first asked (at least on record) by the philosopher [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].&lt;ref name=Hempel&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has relevance to [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] and [[physicalism]] in philosophy, and to [[philosophy of mind]].

==Overview==
[[Physicalism]], in at least one rough sense, is the claim that the entire world may be described and explained using the [[physical law|laws of nature]], in other words, that all phenomena are natural phenomena.  This leaves open the question of what is 'natural', but one common understanding of the claim is that everything in the world is ultimately explicable in the terms of physics. This is known as reductive physicalism. However, this type of physicalism in its turn leaves open the question of what we are to consider as the proper terms of physics.  There seem to be two options here, and these options form the horns of Hempel's dilemma, because neither seems satisfactory.

On the one hand, we may define the physical as whatever is currently explained by our best physical theories, e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]]. Though many would find this definition unsatisfactory, some would accept that we have at least a general understanding of the physical based on these theories, and can use them to assess what is physical and what is not. And therein lies the rub, as a worked-out explanation of mentality currently lies outside the scope of such theories.

On the other hand, if we say that some future, "ideal" physics is what is meant, then the claim is rather empty, for we have no idea of what this means. The "ideal" physics may even come to define what we think of as mental as part of the physical world.  In effect, physicalism by this second account becomes the circular claim that all phenomena are explicable in terms of physics because physics properly defined is whatever explains all phenomena.

[[Carlo Beenakker|Beenakker]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702072v1 Carlo Beenakker (2007), "Hempel's dilemma and the physics of computation"]&lt;/ref&gt; to resolve Hempel's dilemma with the definition: "The boundary between physics and metaphysics is the boundary between what can and what cannot be computed in the age of the universe".

Hempel's dilemma is relevant to philosophy of mind because explanations of issues such as [[consciousness]], [[knowledge representation|representation]], and [[intentionality]] are very hard to come by using current physics although many people in philosophy (and other fields such as [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]) hold to physicalism.

A narrative work beginning '''''in medias res''''' ({{IPA-la|ɪn mɛdiaːs reːs|classical}}&lt;!-- n assimilated to labial of next word --&gt;, lit. "into the middle of things"&lt;!--in+acc (preposition) "into", medias (adjective, acc plural, from medius) "middle", res (noun, acc plural, from res) "things"--&gt;) opens in the midst of the plot (cf. ''[[ab ovo]]'', ''[[ab initio]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284369/in-medias-res |title= In medias res |publisher= ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate= July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]] is bypassed and filled in gradually, either through dialogue, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] or description of past events. For example, ''[[Hamlet]]'' begins after the death of Hamlet's father. Characters make reference to King Hamlet's death without the plot's first establishment of said fact. Since the play focuses on Hamlet and the revenge itself more so than the motivation, Shakespeare utilizes ''in medias res'' to bypass superfluous exposition.

Works that employ ''in medias res'' often, though not always, will subsequently use flashback and [[nonlinear narrative]] for exposition of earlier events in order to fill in the [[backstory]]. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', we first learn about Odysseus's journey when he is held captive on Calypso's island. We then find out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseus's journey precedes that moment in the narrative. On the other hand, Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' has relatively few flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the [[Trojan War]].

== First use of the phrase ==
The Roman lyric poet and satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BC) first used the terms '''''ab ōvō''''' ("from the egg") and '''''in mediās rēs''''' ("into the middle of things") in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'' ("Poetic Arts", c. 13 BC), wherein lines 147&amp;ndash;149 describe the ideal [[epic poetry|epic poet]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horace |authorlink=Horace  |title=Ars poetica   |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/horace/arspoet.shtml  |language=Latin |quote=nec '''gemino''' bellum Troianum orditur '''ab ovo'''; / semper ad eventum festinat et '''in medias res''' / [...] auditorem rapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nor does he begin the [[Trojan War]] ''from the egg'',
but always he hurries to the action, and snatches the listener ''into the middle of things''. . . .|}}

The "egg" reference is to the [[mythology|mythological]] origin of the [[Trojan War]] in the birth of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Clytemnestra]] from the double egg laid by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] following her seduction by [[Zeus]] in the guise of a [[swan]].

== Literary history ==

Probably originated in [[oral tradition]], the narrative technique of beginning a story ''in medias res'' is a stylistic convention of [[epic poetry]], the exemplars in Western literature being the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (both 7th century BC), by [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Christopher John (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850''. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. p. 319. {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the technique features in the Indian ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' (c. 8th century BC – c. 4th century AD). 

The [[Classics|classical-era]] poet [[Virgil]] (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC) continued this literary narrative technique in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which is part of the Greek literary tradition of imitating [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; Later works featuring ''in medias res'' include the stories "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The Three Apples]]" from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (c. 9th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' (12th century), the Spanish ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' (c. 14th century), the Italian ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1320) by [[Dante Alighieri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Danteworlds: A Reader's Guide to the Divine Comedy|last=P. Raffa|first=Guy|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=978-0226702704|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Portuguese ''[[The Lusiads]]'' (1572) by [[Luís Vaz de Camões]], ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' (1581) by [[Torquato Tasso]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) by  [[John Milton]], and generally in [[Modernist literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Carol (1984). ''Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy: The Inferno''. Barron's Educational Series. p. 24. {{ISBN|0-7641-9107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern novelists known to extensively employ ''in medias res'' in conjunction with flashbacks include [[William Faulkner]] and [[Toni Morrison]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s [[The Tell-Tale Heart]] is written in medias res.

== Cinematic history ==
It is typical for [[film noir]] to begin ''in medias res''; for example, a private detective will enter the plot already in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Philosophy of Film Noir|first = Deborah|last=Knight|editor1-first = Mark T. |editor1-last = Conard |editor2-first = Robert |editor2-last = Porfirio |publisher = University Press of Kentucky |year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8131-9181-2 |page = 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947) opens with the murder of Joseph Samuels. As the police investigate the crime, the story behind the murder is told via flashbacks.&lt;ref name="MayerMcDonnell2007"&gt;

==Baseball career==
===Early life in professional baseball===
Roseboro was born in [[Ashland, Ohio]] and enrolled at [[Central State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet A Dodger |agency= |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |page=17 |date=1 March 1959 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19390301&amp;id=7pkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D2UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5997,102077&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent prior to the [[1952 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1952]] season and, began his [[professional baseball]] career with the [[Sheboygan Indians]] of the [[Wisconsin State League]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Roseboro minor league statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=rosebo001joh |title=John Roseboro minor league statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted a .365 [[batting average]] with Sheboygan in 1952 to finish second in the league batting championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/leader.cgi?type=bat&amp;id=8c53a924 |title=1952 Wisconsin State League Batting Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro missed the 1954 season due to military service but, after five years in the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]], he was promoted to the major leagues in June 1957 at the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Johnny_Roseboro |title=Johnny Roseboro |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campanella's heir apparent===
During his first season, Roseboro served as backup catcher for the Dodgers' perennial All-Star catcher, [[Roy Campanella]], and was being groomed to be Campanella's replacement. However, he was promoted to the starting catcher's position ahead of schedule when Campanella had a tragic car accident in January 1958 that ended his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scouts Rave Over New Campy In Praising John Roseboro |agency=ANP |work=Washington Afro-American |page=13 |date=5 February 1957 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&amp;dat=19570205&amp;id=EuElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o_QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5430,1091082&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Is Learning Fast As Replacement For Roy Campanella |agency= |work=The Day |page=16 |date=17 March 1959 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19590317&amp;id=9qs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EHMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=911,1829623&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first full season, with the team having moved to Los Angeles, Roseboro hit for a .271 batting average along with 14 [[home run]]s and 43 [[runs batted in]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He was also named as a reserve player for the [[National League]] in the [[1958 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1958 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS195807080.shtml |title=1958 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1959]], Roseboro led the league's catchers in [[putout]]s and in baserunners [[caught stealing]], helping the Dodgers win the [[List of National League pennant winners|National League Pennant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1959-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1959 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1959.shtml |title=1959 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers went on to win the [[1959 World Series]], defeating the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in six games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1959_WS.shtml |title=1959 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having a below par season in [[1960 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1960]], Roseboro rebounded in [[1961 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1961]] posting career highs with 18 home runs and 59 runs batted in.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He also led the National League catchers in putouts and [[double play]]s and finished second in [[fielding percentage]] and in [[Assist (baseball)|assists]] to earn his first Gold Glove Award as, the Dodgers finished the season in second place behind the [[1961 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1961-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1961 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#1961 |title=1961 National League Gold Glove Award winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1961.shtml |title=1961 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned his second All-Star team berth as a reserve player in the [[1961 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|1961 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS196107110.shtml |title=1961 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his third All-Star berth as a reserve in the [[1962 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|1962 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS196207100.shtml |title=1962 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers battled the [[1962 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in a tight pennant race during the [[1962 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1962]] season with the two teams ending the season tied for first place and met in the [[1962 National League tie-breaker series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1962.shtml |title=1962 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants won the three-game series to clinch the National League championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&amp;id=3617483|title=Tiebreaker Playoff Results|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roseboro helped guide the Dodgers' pitching staff to a league leading 2.85 [[earned run average]] in [[1963 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1963]] as the Dodgers clinched the National League Pennant by 6 games over the [[1963 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963.shtml |title=1963 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::7 |title=1963 National League Team Pitching Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro made his presence felt in the [[1963 World Series]] against the [[1963 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] when he hit a three-run home run off [[Whitey Ford]] to win the first game of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA196310020.shtml |title=1963 World Series Game 1 box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers went on to win the series by defeating the Yankees in four straight games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1963_WS.shtml |title=1963 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers dropped to seventh place in the [[1964 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1964]] season,  however Roseboro hit for a career high .287 batting average and led the league's catchers with a 60.4% caught stealing percentage.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1964-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1964 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marichal incident===
Roseboro was involved in a major altercation with [[Juan Marichal]] during a game between the Dodgers and [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[Candlestick Park]] on August 22, {{Baseball year|1965}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Jack |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1965/08/30/605969/the-battle-of-san-francisco |title=The Battle Of San Francisco |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 30, 1965 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants and the Dodgers had nurtured a heated [[Dodgers–Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with each other dating back to their days together in the New York City market.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball |agency=Associated Press |work=The Times-News |page=18 |date=22 August 1990 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19900822&amp;id=llYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6791,5769085&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Dodgers were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game leading the [[1965 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] by half a game and the Giants by one and a half games.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; The incident occurred in the aftermath of the [[Watts riots]] near Roseboro's Los Angeles home and while the [[Dominican Civil War]] raged in Marichal's home country, so emotions were raw.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=John |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/04/21/juan-marichal-johnny-roseboro-brawl-excerpt |title=Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=2014 |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maury Wills]] led off the game with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single off Marichal, and eventually scored a [[Run (baseball)|run]] when [[Ron Fairly]] hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196508220.shtml |title=August 22, 1965 Dodgers-Giants box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; When Wills came up to bat in the second [[Inning (baseball)|inning]], Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; [[Willie Mays]] then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; In the top of the third inning with two [[Out (baseball)|outs]], Marichal threw a [[fastball]] that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; Marichal's act angered the Dodgers sitting in the [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and home plate umpire [[Shag Crawford]] then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt;

Marichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to take further retaliation against him but instead, he was startled when Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the proximity of his throw, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal afterwards stated that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice over the head with his bat, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face that required 14 stitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |publisher=espn.go.com |accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president [[Warren Giles]] suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MLBN Remembers ("Incident at Candlestick") |publisher=[[MLB Network|MLBN-tv]] |date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1750|1965|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} and also forbade him from traveling to [[Dodger Stadium]] for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident, but eventually settled out of court for $7,500.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal having thrown at Wills.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, "standard operating procedure", as a form of retribution.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until [[spring training]] in April 3, {{Baseball year|1966}}. In his first at bat against Marichal after the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal |agency=Associated Press |work=The Day |page=25 |date=4 April 1966 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19660404&amp;id=yuwgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=873,438492&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco General Manager [[Chub Feeney]] approached Dodgers General Manager [[Buzzy Bavasi]] to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro, but Roseboro declined the offer.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"/&gt;

Dodger fans remained angry with Marichal for several years after the altercation, and reacted unfavorably when he was signed by the Dodgers in [[1975 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1975]].  By then, however, Roseboro had forgiven Marichal, and personally appealed to fans to do the same.&lt;ref name = "boiling"/&gt;

===Later career===
The Dodgers went on to win the [[1965 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1965]] National League Pennant by two games over the Giants. Even though the Giants won the two games against the Dodgers during which Marichal had been suspended, the outcome of the season may have been different without the Giants' pitcher's suspension, as he finished the season with a 22-13 [[Win–loss record (pitching)|win-loss]] record.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro once again guided the Dodgers' pitching staff to a league-leading 2.81 earned run average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1965.shtml |title=1965 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caught for two twenty game winners in 1965 with Koufax winning 26 games, while [[Don Drysdale]] won 23 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/LAD/1965.shtml |title=1965 Los Angeles Dodgers Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract]]'', baseball historian [[Bill James]] said the decision to give [[Joe Torre]]  a {{Baseball year|1965}} National League Gold Glove Award was absurd, stating that he was given the award because of his offensive statistics and that either Roseboro or [[Tom Haller]] was more deserving of the award.&lt;ref name="The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract"/&gt; In the [[1965 World Series]] against the [[1965 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], Roseboro contributed a two-run [[Single (baseball)|single]] to win Game 3 of the series as, the Dodgers went on to win the world championship in seven games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN196510090.shtml |title=1965 World Series Game 3 box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1965_WS.shtml |title=1965 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers' pitching staff continued to lead the league in earned run average in [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1966]] as they battled with the [[1966 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and the [[1966 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a tight pennant race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1966.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::7 |title=1966 National League Team Pitching Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers eventually prevailed to win the National League Pennant for a second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1966.shtml |title=1966 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro led the league with a career-high 903 putouts and finished second to Joe Torre in fielding percentage to win his second Gold Glove Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1964-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1966 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#1966 |title=1966 National League Gold Glove Award winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers would eventually lose the [[1966 World Series]], getting swept in four games by the [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1966_WS.shtml |title=1966 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers would fall to 8th place in the [[1967 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1967]] season and Roseboro would be traded to the [[Minnesota Twins]] after the season with [[Bob Miller (baseball, born 1939)|Bob Miller]] and [[Ron Perranoski]] for [[Mudcat Grant]] and [[Zoilo Versalles]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; While with the Twins, he would be named to his fourth and final All-Star team when he was named as a reserve for the [[American League]] team in the [[1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1969 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS196907230.shtml |title=1969 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Roseboro was released by the Twins.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] on December 31, 1969 but appeared in only 46 games for the last place Senators.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He played in his final major league game on August 11, [[1970 Washington Senators season|1970]] at the age of 37.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;

==Career statistics==
In an fourteen-year major league career, Roseboro played in 1,585 [[Games played|games]], accumulating 1,206 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 4,847 [[at bats]] for a .249 career batting average along with 104 home runs, 548 runs batted in and an [[on-base percentage]] of .326.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He had a .989 career fielding percentage as a catcher. Roseboro caught 112 [[shutouts in baseball|shutouts]] during his career, ranking him 19th all-time among major league catchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bb_catchers.tripod.com/catchers/tmonth1.htm |title=The Encyclopedia of Catchers - Trivia December 2010 - Career Shutouts Caught |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers |accessdate=29 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the catcher for two of Sandy Koufax's four [[no-hitter]]s and caught more than 100 games in 11 of his 14 major league seasons.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Dies"/&gt; Baseball historian Bill James ranked Roseboro 27th all-time among major league catchers.&lt;ref name="The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract"/&gt;

==Later life==
After completing his playing career with Washington, Roseboro coached for the Senators (1971) and [[California Angels]] (1972–74). Later, he served as a [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] batting instructor (1977) and catching instructor (1987) for the Dodgers. Roseboro and his wife, Barbara Fouch Roseboro, also owned a [[Beverly Hills]] [[public relations]] firm.

Roseboro appeared as a [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] officer in the 1966 ''[[Dragnet (series)#1966 television series|Dragnet]]'' TV movie. He also appeared as himself in the 1962 film ''[[Experiment in Terror]]'' along with [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Wally Moon]], and as himself in the 1963 ''[[Mister Ed]]'' episode "Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Roseboro|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741771/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|website=imdb|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chevrolet]] was one of the sponsors of the Dodgers' radio coverage in the mid-1960s. The song "See the USA in Your Chevrolet", made famous by [[Dinah Shore]] in the '50s, was sung in Chevrolet commercials by Roseboro and other Dodger players. Dodger announcer [[Jerry Doggett]] once joked that Roseboro was a singer "whose singing career was destined to go absolutely nowhere."

After several years of bitterness over their famous altercation, Roseboro and Marichal became friends in the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "boiling"&gt;{{cite news |title=Baseball Boiling Over: 25 Years After Juan Marichal Clubbed John Roseboro |agency=Associated Press |work=Gettysburg Times |page=B1 |date=21 August 1990 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19900821&amp;id=oVwlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1637,2098490&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro personally appealed to the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] not to hold the incident against Marichal after he was passed over for election to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in his first two years of eligibility.  Marichal was elected in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], and thanked Roseboro during his induction speech.&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were no hard feelings on my part," Roseboro said, "and I thought if that was made public, people would believe that this was really over with. So I saw him at a Dodger old-timers' game, and we posed for pictures together, and I actually visited him in the Dominican. The next year, he was in the Hall of Fame. Hey, over the years, you learn to forget things."&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;

Roseboro died of heart disease on August 16, 2002 in [[Los Angeles]] at age 69.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Dies"/&gt; Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral.  "Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life," he said, at the service. "I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-roseboro-marichal-plaschke-20150823-column.html|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|title=Fifty years after Giants' Juan Marichal hit Dodgers' John Roseboro with a bat, all is forgiven|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6739">{{Judicial interpretation}}
'''Judicial interpretation''' refers to different ways that the [[judiciary]] uses to [[statutory interpretation|interpret]] the [[law]], particularly [[constitution]]al documents and legislation. This is an important issue in some [[common law jurisdictions]] such as the [[Law of the United States|United States]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]] and [[Law of Canada|Canada]], because the [[Supreme court|supreme courts]] of those nations can overturn laws made by their legislatures via a process called [[judicial review]]. 

For example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has decided such topics as the legality of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as in the [[Dred Scott decision]], and [[desegregation]] as in the ''[[Brown v Board of Education]]'' decision, and [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] as in the ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' decision. As a result, how justices interpret the constitution, and the ways in which they approach this task has a political aspect. Terms describing types of judicial interpretation can be ambiguous; for example, the term ''judicial conservatism'' can vary in meaning depending on what is trying to be "conserved". One can look at judicial interpretation along a continuum from [[judicial restraint]] to [[judicial activism]], with different viewpoints along the continuum.

==Basis for judicial interpretation==

In the [[United States]], there are different ways to do judicial interpretation:

* ''Balancing'' happens when judges weigh one set of interests or rights against an opposing set, typically used to make rulings in [[First Amendment to the Constitution|First Amendment]] cases. For example, cases involving [[freedom of speech]] sometimes require justices to make a distinction between legally permissible speech and speech that can be restricted or banned for, say, reasons of safety, and the task then is for justices to balance these conflicting claims. The balancing approach was criticized by Supreme Court justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] who argued that the Constitution gives no guidance about how to weigh or measure divergent interests.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs&gt;{{cite book
 |author= John E. Finn
 |title= Civil Liberties and the Bill of Rights
 |publisher= The Teaching Company
 |chapter= Part I: Lecture 4: The Court and Constitutional Interpretation |pages=52, 53, 54
 |year= 2006
 |accessdate= 2013-01-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doctrinalism considers how various parts of the Constitution have been "shaped by the Court's own jurisprudence", according to Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* Functionalism.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* ''Founders' Intent'' involves judges trying to gauge the intentions of the authors of the Constitution. Problems can arise when judges try to determine which particular Founders or Framers to consult, as well as trying to determine what they meant based on often sparse and incomplete documentation.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* [[Originalism]] involves judges trying to apply the "original" meanings of different constitutional provisions.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt; To determine the original meaning, a constitutional provision is interpreted in its ''original'' context, i.e. the historical, literary, and political context of the framers. From that interpretation, the underlying principle is derived which is then applied to the contemporary situation. Former [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] justice [[Antonin Scalia]] believed that the text of the constitution should mean the same thing today as it did when it had been written. A report in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' suggested that originalism was the "view that the Constitution should be interpreted in accordance with its original meaning — that is, the meaning it had at the time of its enactment."&lt;ref name=twsWashPostJan2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/01/neil-gorsuch-antonin-scalia-and-originalism-explained/?wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;wpmm=1 |title=Neil Gorsuch, Antonin Scalia and originalism, explained |last=Blake |first=Aaron |date=February 1, 2017 |website= |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=February 1, 2017 |quote=...the view that law laid down by the framers in the Constitution remains binding until we legally change it, such as through the amendment process....}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Meaning" based on ''original'' principles.
* [[Prudentialism]] discourages judges from setting broad rules for possible future cases, and advises courts to play a limited role.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* ''Precedent'' is judges deciding a case by looking to the decision of a previous and similar case according to the legal principle of [[stare decisis]], by finding a rule or principle in an earlier case to guide their judgment in a current case.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt;
* [[Strict constructionism]] involves judges interpreting the text only as it was written; once a clear meaning has been established, there is no need for further analysis, based on this way, which advocates that judges should avoid drawing inferences from previous statutes or the constitution and instead focus on exactly what was written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/APGOV_Judiciary.htm "The Judiciary: The Power of the Federal Judiciary"], The Social Studies Help Center&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Justice [[Hugo Black]] argued that the First Amendment's wording in reference to certain civil rights that ''Congress shall make no law'' should mean exactly that: ''no'' law, ''no'' exceptions.
* [[Structuralism]] is a way judges use by searching for the meaning of a particular constitutional principle only by "reading it against the larger constitutional document or context," according to Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs/&gt; Judges try to understand how a particular ruling fits within the larger structure of the entire constitution.
* [[Textualism]]  primarily interprets the [[law]] based on the ordinary meaning of the legal text.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25069">This [[list of rampage killers]] lists mass murders where the perpetrator used only [[hand grenade]]s or comparable explosive devices, like [[pipe bomb]]s or [[dynamite]] sticks, for the attack. As it is sometimes difficult to distinguish cases of grenade attacks from acts of terrorism or gang-related attacks, incidents are only included where there is at least some indication that it was neither committed in the context of a political, ethnic, or religious conflict, nor part of an assault with more than one participating offender.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=[[Particle statistics|Particle Statistics]]}}
[[Image:Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution 1.png|thumb|300px|Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics can be used to derive the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] of particle speeds in an [[ideal gas]]. Shown: distribution of particle speed for 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen particles at  -100, 20 and 600&amp;nbsp;°C.]]
In [[statistical mechanics]], '''Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics''' describes the average distribution of non-interacting material particles over various energy states in [[thermal equilibrium]], and is applicable when the temperature is high enough or the particle density is low enough to render quantum effects negligible.

The expected [[number of particles]] with energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; for Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\langle N_i \rangle}{N} = \frac {g_i} {e^{(\varepsilon_i - \mu)/kT}} = \frac{1}{Z}\,g_i e^{-\varepsilon_i/kT},
&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''-th [[energy]] level,
*&lt;math&gt;\langle N_i \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the average number of particles in the set of states with energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of energy level ''i'', that is, the number of states with energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; which may nevertheless be distinguished from each other by some other means,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For example, two simple point particles may have the same energy, but different momentum vectors. They may be distinguished from each other on this basis, and the degeneracy will be the number of possible ways that they can be so distinguished.&lt;/ref&gt;
*μ is the [[chemical potential]],
*''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]],
*''T'' is absolute [[temperature]],
*''N'' is the total number of particles:
::&lt;math&gt;N = \sum_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;,
*''Z'' is the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]:
::&lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_i g_i e^{-\varepsilon_i/kT},&lt;/math&gt;
*''e''&lt;sup&gt;(...)&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[exponential function]].

Equivalently, the number of particles is sometimes expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\langle N_i \rangle}{N} = \frac {1} {e^{(\varepsilon_i - \mu)/kT}} = \frac{1}{Z}\,e^{-\varepsilon_i/kT},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the index ''i'' now specifies a particular state rather than the set of all states with energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_i e^{-\varepsilon_i/kT}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==

Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics may be used to derive the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] (for an ideal gas of classical particles in a three-dimensional box). However, they apply to other situations as well. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics can be used to extend that distribution to particles with a different [[energy–momentum relation]], such as relativistic particles ([[Maxwell–Jüttner distribution]]). In addition, hypothetical situations can be considered, such as particles in a box with different numbers of dimensions (four-dimensional, two-dimensional, etc.).

==Limits of applicability==

Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics are often described as the statistics of "distinguishable" classical particles. In other words, the configuration of particle ''A'' in state 1 and particle ''B'' in state 2 is different from the case in which particle ''B'' is in state 1 and particle ''A'' is in state 2. This assumption leads to the proper (Boltzmann) statistics of particles in the energy states, but yields non-physical results for the entropy, as embodied in the [[Gibbs paradox]].

At the same time, there are no real particles which have the characteristics required by Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. Indeed, the Gibbs paradox is resolved if we treat all particles of a certain type (e.g., electrons, protons, etc.) as indistinguishable, and this assumption can be justified in the context of quantum mechanics. Once this assumption is made, the particle statistics change.
Quantum particles are either bosons (following instead [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]) or fermions (subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], following instead [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]). Both of these quantum statistics approach the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics in the limit of high temperature and low particle density, without the need for any ad hoc assumptions. The Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics give the energy level occupation as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle N_i \rangle = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\varepsilon_i-\mu)/kT}\pm 1}.
&lt;/math&gt;
It can be seen that the condition under which the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics are valid is when
:&lt;math&gt;e^{(\varepsilon_{\rm min}-\mu)/kT} \gg 1, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm min}&lt;/math&gt; is the lowest (minimum) value of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics are particularly useful for studying [[gas]]es that are not very dense. Note, however, that all of these statistics assume that the particles are non-interacting and have static energy states.

== Derivations ==

Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics can be derived in various [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] thermodynamic ensembles:&lt;ref name="tolman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Tolman |first=R. C. | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year=1938 | title=The Principles of Statistical Mechanics | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | isbn = 9780486638966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[grand canonical ensemble]], exactly.
* The [[canonical ensemble]], but only in the thermodynamic limit.
* The [[microcanonical ensemble]], exactly
In each case it is necessary to assume that the particles are non-interacting, and that multiple particles can occupy the same state and do so independently.

=== Derivation from microcanonical ensemble ===
{{Technical|section|date=December 2013}}
Suppose we have a container with a huge number of very small particles all with identical physical characteristics (such as mass, charge, etc.). Let's refer to this as the ''system''. Assume that though the particles have identical properties, they are distinguishable. For example, we might identify each particle by continually observing their trajectories, or by placing a marking on each one, e.g., drawing a different number on each one as is done with [[lottery]] balls.

The particles are moving inside that container in all directions with great speed. Because the particles are speeding around, they possess some energy. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is a mathematical function that speaks about how many particles in the container have a certain energy. More precisely, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution gives the non-normalized probability that the state corresponding to a particular energy is occupied.

In general, there may be many particles with the same amount of energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Let the number of particles with the same energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_1&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt;, the number of particles possessing another energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_2&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth for all the possible energies {&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; | i=1,2,3,...}. To describe this situation, we say that &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''occupation number'' of the ''energy level'' &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt; If we know all the occupation numbers {&lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; | i=1,2,3,...}, then we know the total energy of the system. However, because we can distinguish between ''which'' particles are occupying each energy level, the set of occupation numbers {&lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; | i=1,2,3,...} does not completely describe the state of the system. To completely describe the state of the system, or the ''microstate'', we must specify exactly which particles are in each energy level. Thus when we count the number of possible states of the system, we must count each and every microstate, and not just the possible sets of occupation numbers.

To begin with, let's ignore the degeneracy problem: assume that there is only one way to put &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; particles into the energy level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;. What follows next is a bit of combinatorial thinking which has little to do in accurately describing the reservoir of particles.

The number of different ways of performing an ordered selection of one single object from ''N'' objects is obviously&amp;nbsp;''N''. The number of different ways of selecting two objects from ''N'' objects, in a particular order, is thus ''N''(''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) and that of selecting ''n'' objects in a particular order is seen to be ''N''!/(''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It is divided by the number of [[permutations]], ''n''!, if order does not matter. The [[binomial coefficient]], ''N''!/(''n''!(''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'')!), is, thus, the number of ways to pick ''n'' objects from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. If we now have a set of boxes labelled ''a, b, c, d, e, ..., k'', then the number of ways of selecting ''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' objects from a total of ''N'' objects and placing them in box ''a'', then selecting ''N&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' objects from the remaining ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' objects and placing them in box ''b'', then selecting ''N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' objects from the remaining ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''N&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' objects and placing them in box ''c'', and continuing until no object is left outside is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W &amp; = \frac{N!}{N_a!(N-N_a)!} \times \frac{(N-N_a)!}{N_b!(N-N_a-N_b)!} ~ \times \frac{(N-N_a-N_b)!}{N_c!(N-N_a-N_b-N_c)!} \times \ldots \times \frac{(N-\ldots-N_l)!}{N_k!(N-\ldots-N_l-N_k)!} = \\ \\
&amp; = \frac{N!}{N_a!N_b!N_c!\ldots N_k!(N-\ldots-N_l-N_k)!}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and because not even a single object is to be left outside the boxes, implies that the sum made of the terms ''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., N&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' must equal ''N'', thus the term ''(N - N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; - N&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; - N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - ... - N&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; - N&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;)!'' in the relation above evaluates to ''0!''. (0!=1) which makes possible to write down that relation as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W &amp; = N!\prod_{i=a,b,c,...}^k \frac{1}{N_i!}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.
This is just the [[multinomial coefficient]], the number of ways of arranging ''N'' items into ''k'' boxes, the ''i''-th box holding ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' items, ignoring the permutation of items in each box.

Now going back to the degeneracy problem which characterizes the reservoir of particles. If the ''i''-th box has a "degeneracy" of &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt;, that is, it has &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; "sub-boxes", such that any way of filling the ''i''-th box where the number in the sub-boxes is changed is a distinct way of filling the box, then the number of ways of filling the ''i''-th box must be increased by the number of ways of distributing the &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; objects in the &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; "sub-boxes". The number of ways of placing &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; distinguishable objects in &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; "sub-boxes" is &lt;math&gt;g_i^{N_i}&lt;/math&gt; (the first object can go into any of the &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; boxes, the second object can also go into any of the &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; boxes, and so on). Thus the number of ways &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; that a total of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles can be classified into energy levels according to their energies, while each level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; having &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; distinct states such that the ''i''-th level accommodates &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; particles is:

:&lt;math&gt;W=N!\prod \frac{g_i^{N_i}}{N_i!}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the form for ''W'' first derived by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]. Boltzmann's fundamental equation &lt;math&gt;S=k\,\ln W&lt;/math&gt; relates the thermodynamic [[entropy]] ''S'' to the number of microstates ''W'', where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. It was pointed out by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] however, that the above expression for ''W'' does not yield an extensive entropy, and is therefore faulty. This problem is known as the [[Gibbs paradox]]. The problem is that the particles considered by the above equation are not [[Identical particles|indistinguishable]]. In other words, for two particles (''A'' and ''B'') in two energy sublevels the population represented by [A,B] is considered distinct from the population [B,A] while for indistinguishable particles, they are not. If we carry out the argument for indistinguishable particles, we are led to the [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein]] expression for ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt;W=\prod_i \frac{(N_i+g_i-1)!}{N_i!(g_i-1)!}&lt;/math&gt;

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution follows from this Bose–Einstein distribution for temperatures well above absolute zero, implying that &lt;math&gt;g_i\gg 1&lt;/math&gt;. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution also requires low density, implying that &lt;math&gt;g_i\gg N_i&lt;/math&gt;. Under these conditions, we may use Stirling's approximation for the factorial:

:&lt;math&gt;
N! \approx N^N e^{-N},
&lt;/math&gt;

to write:

:&lt;math&gt;W\approx\prod_i \frac{(N_i+g_i)^{N_i+g_i}}{N_i^{N_i}g_i^{g_i}}\approx\prod_i \frac{g_i^{N_i}(1+N_i/g_i)^{g_i}}{N_i^{N_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that &lt;math&gt;(1+N_i/g_i)^{g_i}\approx e^{N_i}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;g_i\gg N_i&lt;/math&gt; we can again use Stirlings approximation to write:

:&lt;math&gt;W\approx\prod_i \frac{g_i^{N_i}}{N_i!}&lt;/math&gt;

This is essentially a division by ''N!'' of Boltzmann's original expression for ''W'', and this correction is referred to as '''{{visible anchor|correct Boltzmann counting}}'''.

We wish to find the &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; for which the function &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is maximized, while considering the constraint that there is a fixed number of particles &lt;math&gt;\left(N=\textstyle\sum N_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; and a fixed energy &lt;math&gt;\left(E=\textstyle\sum N_i \varepsilon_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; in the container. The maxima of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ln(W)&lt;/math&gt; are achieved by the same values of &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximize the latter function instead. We constrain our solution using [[Lagrange multipliers]] forming the function:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(N_1,N_2,\ldots,N_n)=\ln(W)+\alpha(N-\sum N_i)+\beta(E-\sum N_i \varepsilon_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\ln W=\ln\left[\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n}\frac{g_i^{N_i}}{N_i!}\right] \approx \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\left(N_i\ln g_i-N_i\ln N_i + N_i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally

:&lt;math&gt;
f(N_1,N_2,\ldots,N_n)=\alpha N +\beta E +
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\left(N_i\ln g_i-N_i\ln N_i + N_i-(\alpha+\beta\varepsilon_i) N_i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

In order to maximize the expression above we apply [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)]], according to which local extrema, if exist, must be at critical points (partial derivatives vanish):

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial N_i}=\ln g_i-\ln N_i -(\alpha+\beta\varepsilon_i) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

By solving the equations above (&lt;math&gt;i=1\ldots n&lt;/math&gt;) we arrive to an expression for &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
N_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{\alpha+\beta \varepsilon_i}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this expression for &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; into the equation for &lt;math&gt;\ln W&lt;/math&gt; and assuming that &lt;math&gt;N\gg 1&lt;/math&gt; yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln W = (\alpha+1) N+\beta E\,&lt;/math&gt;

or, rearranging:

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{\ln W}{\beta}-\frac{N}{\beta}-\frac{\alpha N}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Boltzmann realized that this is just an expression of the [[Thermodynamic_equations#Euler_integrals|Euler-integrated fundamental equation of thermodynamics]]. Identifying ''E'' as the internal energy, the Euler-integrated fundamental equation states that :

:&lt;math&gt;E=TS-PV+\mu N&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the [[temperature]], ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is [[volume]], and μ is the [[chemical potential]]. Boltzmann's famous equation &lt;math&gt;S=k\,\ln W&lt;/math&gt; is the realization that the entropy is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\ln W&lt;/math&gt; with the constant of proportionality being [[Boltzmann's constant]]. Using the ideal gas equation of state (''PV=NkT''), It follows immediately that &lt;math&gt;\beta=1/kT&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha=-\mu/kT&lt;/math&gt; so that the populations may now be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
N_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{(\varepsilon_i-\mu)/kT}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the above formula is sometimes written:

:&lt;math&gt;
N_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{\varepsilon_i/kT}/z} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z=\exp(\mu/kT)&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute [[activity (chemistry)|activity]].

Alternatively, we may use the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i N_i=N\,&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the population numbers as

:&lt;math&gt;
N_i = N\frac{g_i e^{-\varepsilon_i/kT}}{Z} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z'' is the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;
Z = \sum_i g_i e^{-\varepsilon_i/kT}
&lt;/math&gt;

In an approximation where ''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is considered to be a continuous variable, the [[Thomas-Fermi approximation]] yields a continuous degeneracy g proportional to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; so that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\sqrt{\varepsilon}\,e^{-\varepsilon/k T}}{\int_0^\infty\sqrt{\varepsilon}\,e^{-\varepsilon/k T}}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]] for the energy.

=== Derivation from canonical ensemble ===
{{Technical|section|date=December 2013}}
In the above discussion, the Boltzmann distribution function was obtained via directly analysing the multiplicities of a system. Alternatively, one can make use of the [[canonical ensemble]]. In a canonical ensemble, a system is in thermal contact with a reservoir.  While energy is free to flow between the system and the reservoir, the reservoir is thought to have infinitely large heat capacity as to maintain constant temperature, ''T'', for the combined system.

In the present context, our system is assumed to have the energy levels &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _i&lt;/math&gt; with degeneracies &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt;. As before, we would like to calculate the probability that our system has energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;.

If our system is in state &lt;math&gt;\; s_1&lt;/math&gt;, then there would be a corresponding number of microstates available to the reservoir. Call this number &lt;math&gt;\; \Omega _ R (s_1)&lt;/math&gt;. By assumption, the combined system (of the system we are interested in and the reservoir) is isolated, so all microstates are equally probable. Therefore, for instance, if &lt;math&gt; \; \Omega _ R (s_1) = 2 \; \Omega _ R (s_2) &lt;/math&gt;, we can conclude that our system is twice as likely to be in state &lt;math&gt;\; s_1&lt;/math&gt; than &lt;math&gt;\; s_2&lt;/math&gt;. In general, if &lt;math&gt;\; P(s_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that our system is in state &lt;math&gt;\; s_i&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} = \frac{\Omega _ R (s_1)}{\Omega _ R (s_2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the entropy of the reservoir &lt;math&gt;\; S_R = k \ln \Omega _R&lt;/math&gt;, the above becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} = \frac{ e^{S_R(s_1)/k} }{ e^{S_R(s_2)/k} } = e^{(S_R (s_1) - S_R (s_2))/k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Next we recall the thermodynamic identity (from the [[first law of thermodynamics]]):

:&lt;math&gt;d S_R = \frac{1}{T} (d U_R + P \, d V_R - \mu \, d N_R).&lt;/math&gt;

In a canonical ensemble, there is no exchange of particles, so the &lt;math&gt;d N_R&lt;/math&gt; term is zero. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;d V_R = 0.&lt;/math&gt;  This gives

:&lt;math&gt; S_R (s_1) - S_R (s_2) = \frac{1}{T} (U_R (s_1) - U_R (s_2)) = - \frac{1}{T} (E(s_1) - E(s_2)),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\; U_R (s_i) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\; E(s_i) &lt;/math&gt; denote the energies of the reservoir and the system at &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. For the second equality we have used the conservation of energy. Substituting into the first equation relating &lt;math&gt;P(s_1), \; P(s_2)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} =  \frac{ e^{ - E(s_1) / kT } }{ e^{ - E(s_2) / kT} },
&lt;/math&gt;

which implies, for any state ''s'' of the system

:&lt;math&gt;
P(s) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{- E(s) / kT},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z'' is an appropriately chosen "constant" to make total probability 1. (''Z'' is constant provided that the temperature ''T'' is invariant.)

:&lt;math&gt;\; Z = \sum _s e^{- E(s) / kT}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the index ''s'' runs through all microstates of the system. ''Z'' is sometimes called the Boltzmann '''sum over states''' (or "Zustandsumme" in the original German). If we index the summation via the energy eigenvalues instead of all possible states, degeneracy must be taken into account. The probability of our system having energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _i&lt;/math&gt; is simply the sum of the probabilities of all corresponding microstates:

:&lt;math&gt;P (\varepsilon _i) = \frac{1}{Z} g_i e^{- \varepsilon_i / kT}&lt;/math&gt;

where, with obvious modification,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sum _j g_j  e^{- \varepsilon _j / kT},&lt;/math&gt;

this is the same result as before.

Comments on this derivation:
*Notice that in this formulation, the initial assumption "... ''suppose the system has total ''N'' particles''..." is dispensed with. Indeed, the number of particles possessed by the system plays no role in arriving at the distribution. Rather, how many particles would occupy states with energy &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _i&lt;/math&gt; follows as an easy consequence.
*What has been presented above is essentially a derivation of the canonical partition function. As one can see by comparing the definitions, the Boltzmann sum over states is equal to the canonical partition function.
*Exactly the same approach can be used to derive [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein]] statistics. However, there one would replace the canonical ensemble with the [[grand canonical ensemble]], since there is exchange of particles between the system and the reservoir. Also, the system one considers in those cases is a single particle ''state'', not a particle. (In the above discussion, we could have assumed our system to be a single atom.)

'''Melioration theory''' is a theory in [[psychology]] used as an alternative to the [[matching law]]. Melioration theory is used as an explanation for why an organism makes choices based on the rewards or [[reinforcer]]s it receives. The principle of melioration states that animals will invest increasing amounts of time and/or effort into whichever alternative is better. To meliorate essentially means to "make better".&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, James E. Learning and Behavior (6th ed.) Upper Saddle River NJ: 2006 p. 332-335&lt;/ref&gt;

Melioration theory accounts for many of the choices that organisms make when presented with two variable interval schedules. Melioration is a form of matching where the subject is constantly shifting its behavior from the poorer reinforcement schedule to the richer reinforcement schedule, until it is spending most of its time at the richest variable interval schedule. By matching, the subject is equalizing the price of the reinforcer they are working for. This is also called [[hyperbolic discounting]]. In making a choice between options, living organisms need not maximize expected payoff as classical economic theory posits. Rather than being aggregated, the options compete against one another based on differences in their local reinforcement rate. The organism continuously shifts from one alternative to the other, if one is better than the other, until the other is better than the first one, regardless of the effect on overall [[rate of reinforcement]]. Melioration is capable of accounting for behavior on both concurrent ratio and concurrent interval schedules.

Melioration Equation
R1/B1 = R2/B2

If this ratio is not equal, the animal will shift its behavior to the alternative that currently has the higher response ratio. When the ratio is equal, the "cost" of each reinforcer is the same for both alternatives.

Melioration theory grew out of an impersonal anonymous interest in how the [[matching law]] comes to hold on. [[Richard Herrnstein|Richard J. Herrnstein]] (1961) reported that on concurrent VIVIVI [[reinforcement]] schedules, the proportion of responses to one alternative was approximately equal to the proportion of reinforcer received there. This finding is summarized in the matching law, which generated a great deal of both matching research and matching theorizing. Herrnstein (1970) suggested that matching may be a basic behavioral process, whereas Rachlin et al. (1976) suggested that matching comes about because it maximizes rate of matching reinforcement.

William Vaughan, Jr. (1976) suggested that the local rate of matching reinforcement on each reinforcement matching schedule is evaluated, and if those local rates differ, the distribution of time on a schedule is shifted from the poorer to the better schedule. On concurrent VIVIVI reinforcement schedules this process gives rise to matching, whereas on concurrent VRVRVR reinforcement schedules it gives rise to exclusive preferences for the better alternative and not the worse alternative. This rule was subsequently named Melioration ([[Richard Herrnstein|Herrnstein]] &amp; Vaughan, 1980). See also [[Richard Herrnstein|Herrnstein, 1982]], Vaughan, 1981; Vaughan &amp; Herrnstein, 1987)

The &lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{no selflink|neurobiological effects of physical exercise}}&lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt; are numerous and involve a wide range of interrelated effects on brain structure, brain function, and [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="Summary as of August 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Erickson KI, Hillman CH, Kramer AF|title=Physical activity, brain, and cognition|journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences|date=August 2015|volume=4|pages=27–32|doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.01.005 | quote = &lt;!--Research in children finds that higher fit and more active preadolescent children show greater hippocampal and basal ganglia volume, greater white matter integrity, elevated and more efficient patterns of brain activity, and superior cognitive performance and scholastic achievement. Higher fit and more physically active older adults show greater hippocampal, prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia volume, greater functional brain connectivity, greater white matter integrity, more efficient brain activity, and superior executive and memory function.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;''Cognitive performance'': Cross-sectional, observational, and randomized clinical trials of PA in late adulthood have demonstrated that engaging in PA may preserve and/or enhance cognitive function even in cognitively impaired individuals (e.g., [18]). Summaries of these studies can now be found in several meta-analyses, most of which confirm that PA positively influences cognitive function in late adulthood with small to moderate sized effects [19]. In a meta-analysis of 18 randomized PA trials, engaging in moderate intensity PA resulted in enhanced cognitive function across all cognitive domains examined, but with the largest effect sizes for indices of executive function [20]. Meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies have also confirmed that self-reported engagement in PA is associated with nearly a 40% reduced risk of experiencing cognitive decline over several years [21]. These, and other studies, make a convincing argument that both continuing to engage in, and starting to engage in, PA in late adulthood may have a profound effect on maintaining cognitive health, improving function, and reducing the risk of developing cognitive impairment.&lt;br /&gt;''Brain structure'': There have been now more than 30 published studies of PA or fitness on brain structure in older adults (&gt;60 years) with the majority showing positive associations (see [22]). Such effects are important since increasing age is associated with brain atrophy and loss of volume, which precedes and predicts conversion to dementia. Higher aerobic fitness levels have been associated with larger gray matter volumes in older adults in several areas including the frontal cortex [23,24], hippocampus [25,26], and caudate nucleus [27]. Longitudinal observational studies have also shown that greater amounts of PA are associated with larger gray matter volumes in these regions, and greater volume is, in turn, associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment [28]. These cross-sectional and observational results in older adults are further supported by clinical trials that have shown that six-months to one-year of regular PA is associated with an increase in both frontal cortex [29&lt;sup&gt;••&lt;/sup&gt;,30] and hippocampal volume&amp;nbsp;... These effects on gray matter volume are accompanied by differences found in white matter integrity. For example, several studies have reported that higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels and PA are associated with greater white matter integrity along several tracts linking frontal and subcortical areas [34–36] and that greater changes in fitness after an intervention was associated with an increase in white matter integrity [37]. In sum, there is now convincing evidence that PA and fitness influence brain structure, characterized by both gray matter volume and white matter integrity, in late adulthood.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise - neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paillard T, Rolland Y, de Souto Barreto P | title = Protective Effects of Physical Exercise in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease: A Narrative Review | journal = J Clin Neurol | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–219 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26174783 | pmc = 4507374 | doi = 10.3988/jcn.2015.11.3.212 | quote = Aerobic physical exercise (PE) activates the release of neurotrophic factors and promotes angiogenesis, thereby facilitating neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which in turn improve memory and cognitive functions.&amp;nbsp;...

Regular engagement in physical exercise enhances cognitive functioning, increases brain neurotrophic proteins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and prevents cognitive diseases [76–78]. Recent findings highlight a role for aerobic exercise in modulating chromatin remodelers [21, 79–82].&amp;nbsp;... These results were the first to demonstrate that acute and relatively short aerobic exercise modulates epigenetic modifications. The transient epigenetic modifications observed due to chronic running training have also been associated with improved learning and stress-coping strategies, epigenetic changes and increased c-Fos-positive neurons&amp;nbsp;... Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate the existence of epigenetic changes after acute and chronic exercise and show they are associated with improved cognitive function and elevated markers of neurotrophic factors and neuronal activity (BDNF and c-Fos).&amp;nbsp;... The aerobic exercise training-induced changes to miRNA profile in the brain seem to be intensity-dependent [164]. These few studies provide a basis for further exploration into potential miRNAs involved in brain and neuronal development and recovery via aerobic exercise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent [[aerobic exercise]] (e.g., 30&amp;nbsp;minutes every day) induces persistent improvements in certain [[cognitive function]]s, healthy alterations in [[gene expression]] in the brain, and beneficial forms of [[neuroplasticity]] and [[behavioral plasticity]]; some of these long-term effects include: increased [[adult neurogenesis|neuron growth]], increased neurological activity (e.g., {{nowrap|[[c-Fos]]}} and [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]] signaling), improved stress coping, enhanced [[cognitive control of behavior]], improved [[declarative memory|declarative]], [[spatial memory|spatial]], and [[working memory|working]] memory, and structural and functional improvements in brain structures and [[neural pathways|pathways]] associated with cognitive control and memory.&lt;ref name="Summary as of August 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise - neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary of effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epigenome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Comprehensive review"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Gomez-Pinilla F, Hillman C | title = The influence of exercise on cognitive abilities | journal = Compr.

Normal aging results in the loss of brain tissue (31), with markedly larger tissue loss evidenced in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (16, 58, 149). As such, cognitive functions subserved by these brain regions (such as those involved in cognitive control and memory) are expected to decay more dramatically than other aspects of cognition. Specifically, age-related decreases in gray matter volume have been associated with decrements in a variety of cognitive control processes.&amp;nbsp;... Decreases in gray matter volume may result from several factors including loss in the number of neurons, neuronal shrinkage, reduction in dendritic arborization, and alterations in glia (158). Further, decreases in white matter (brain tissue composed primarily of myelinated nerve fibers) volume, which represent changes in connectivity between neurons, also occur as a result of aging. Loss of white matter volume further relates to performance decrements on a host of cognitive tasks&amp;nbsp;... aerobic fitness relates to larger hippocampal volume (23) and better relational memory performance (24), during preadolescent childhood.&amp;nbsp;... Specifically, those assigned to the aerobic training group demonstrated increases in gray matter in the frontal lobes, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area, middle frontal gyrus, dorsolateral region of the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior temporal lobe (32). White matter volume changes were also evidenced for the aerobic fitness group with increases in white matter tracts within the anterior third of the corpus callosum (32).&amp;nbsp;...  In addition, aerobic fitness has been shown to promote better functioning of brain, especially in neural networks involved in cognitive control of inhibition and attention (33).&amp;nbsp;... In addition to BDNF, the actions of IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (54) are considered essential for the angiogenic and neurogenic effects of exercise in the brain.&amp;nbsp;...

In particular, several cross-sectional and intervention studies have shown a positive association between physical activity and cognition in older persons [86] and an inverse correlation with cognitive decline and dementia [87]. Older adults enrolled in a 6-month aerobic fitness intervention increased brain volume in both gray matter (anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal lobe) and white matter (anterior third of corpus callosum) [88]. In addition, Colcombe and colleagues showed that older adults with higher cardiovascular fitness levels are better at activating attentional resources, including decreased activation of the anterior cingulated cortex. One of the possible mechanisms by which physical activity may benefit cognition is that physical activity maintains brain plasticity, increases brain volume, stimulates neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, and increases neurotrophic factors in different areas of the brain, possibly providing reserve against later cognitive decline and dementia [89, 90].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of affective state, acute exercise decreases negative affect, increases positive affect, and decreases the psychological and physiological response to acute stress [28]. These effects have been reported to persist for up to 24 hours after exercise cessation [28, 29, 53]. In terms of cognitive functioning, acute exercise primarily enhances executive functions dependent on the prefrontal cortex including attention, working memory, problem solving, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, decision making, and inhibitory control [9]. These positive changes have been demonstrated to occur with very low to very high exercise intensities [9], with effects lasting for up to two hours after the end of the exercise bout (Fig. 1A) [27]. Moreover, many of these neuropsychological assessments measure several aspects of behavior including both accuracy of performance and speed of processing. McMorris and Hale performed a meta-analysis examining the effects of acute exercise on both accuracy and speed of processing, revealing that speed significantly improved post-exercise, with minimal or no effect on accuracy [17].

The acute and chronic effects of non-cardio exercise remain more questionable but seem predominantly positive too. Research provides evidence that physical exercise represents a promising alternative or additional treatment option for patients with ADHD. Acute and chronic beneficial effects of especially cardio exercise were reported with regard to several cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional functions.&lt;br /&gt;Cardio exercise: chronic effects&lt;br /&gt;Cardio exercise (e.g., running and jumping) has also been linked to longer lasting effects on cognition in children with ADHD, resulting in improved attention (including auditory sustained attention and selective attention/information processing), executive functioning (including set shifting, (accuracy of) response inhibition and planning), verbal working memory, and cognitive speed (Chang et al. 2014; Choi et al. 2014; Gapin and Etnier 2010; Kang et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2013; Verret et al. 2012; Ziereis and Jansen 2015). However, a lack of robustness of chronic effects on cognition after cardio exercise is shown by some studies not reporting affected functions [e.g., (working) memory], and by studies not confirming significant beneficial long-term effects in the areas of inhibition, processing speed, planning, memory span, and continuous motor timing (Gapin and Etnier 2010; Smith et al. 2013). The lack of agreement in findings might partly be explained by the small sample sizes examined in the latter two studies (n = 14 and n = 18, respectively, which is less than the requested n = 34 for a one-factorial within subject design) and their consequential low statistical power.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;It is assumed that physical exercise entails similar neurobiological effects as stimulants (e.g., increased availability of monoaminergic catecholamines in the brain, Fritz and O’Connor 2016; Wigal et al. 2013) and that these effects result in improved functioning in overlapping areas of cognition. A number of studies even showed (cognitive) gains of physical exercise on top of medication treatment (i.e., when children were on stimulant medication during the exercise bouts and tests; Choi et al. 2014; Gapin and Etnier 2010; Jensen and Kenny 2004; Kang et al. 2011; Maddigan et al. 2003; Mahon et al. 2008; McKune et al. 2003; Tantillo et al. 2002; Verret et al. 2012).--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADHD Exercise 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamp CF, Sperlich B, Holmberg HC | title = Exercise reduces the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and improves social behaviour, motor skills, strength and neuropsychological parameters | journal = Acta Paediatr. | volume = 103 | issue = 7 | pages = 709–14 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24612421 | doi = 10.1111/apa.12628 | quote = The present review summarises the impact of exercise interventions (1–10 weeks in duration with at least two sessions each week) on parameters related to ADHD in 7-to 13-year-old children.

One of the most significant effects of exercise on the brain is the increased synthesis and expression of [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]], a [[neuropeptide]] [[peptide hormone|hormone]], in the brain and periphery, resulting in increased signaling through its [[receptor tyrosine kinase]], [[tropomyosin receptor kinase B]] (TrkB).&lt;ref name="epigenome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trophic factor signaling"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phillips C, Baktir MA, Srivatsan M, Salehi A | title = Neuroprotective effects of physical activity on the brain: a closer look at trophic factor signaling | journal = Front Cell Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 170 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24999318 | pmc = 4064707 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00170 | quote = &lt;!--Moreover, recent evidence suggests that myokines released by exercising muscles affect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a finding that could lead to the identification of new and therapeutically important mediating factors.&amp;nbsp;...

Resistance exercise has also been shown to elevate serum BDNF levels in young individuals (Yarrow et al., 2010). Moreover, it has been shown that moderate levels of physical activity in people with AD significantly increased plasma levels of BDNF (Coelho et al., 2014).&amp;nbsp;... In humans, it has been shown that 4 h of rowing activity leads to increased levels of plasma BDNF from the internal jugular (an indicator of central release from the brain) and radial artery (an indicator of peripheral release; Rasmussen et al., 2009). Seifert et al. (2010) reported that basal release of BDNF increases following 3 months endurance training in young and healthy individuals, as measured from the jugular vein. These trends are augmented by rodent studies showing that endurance training leads to increased synthesis of BDNF in the hippocampal formation (Neeper et al., 1995, 1996).&amp;nbsp;... Both BDNF and IGF-1 play a significant role in cognition and motor function in humans.&amp;nbsp;... Multiple large-scale studies in humans have shown that serum levels of IGF-1 are correlated with fitness and as well as body mass indices (Poehlman and Copeland, 1990).

This may have links to various cognitive effects of GH and IGF-1. GH and IGF-1 affect the genesis of neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes. Specifically, IGF-1 increases progenitor cell proliferation and numbers of new neurons, oligodendrocytes, and blood vessels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In the adult cerebral cortex IGF-1 only affects oligodendrogenesis.&amp;nbsp;... Altogether, data suggest that both exogenous and endogenous GH and/or IGF-1 may be used as agents to enhance cell genesis and neurogenesis in the adult brain. &amp;nbsp;... GH and IGF-1 have been shown to affect a multitude of mechanisms, including neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, angiogenesis, glutamate receptor activation, cholinergic system, dopaminergic reward system, monoamine abundance, dendritic arborization, astrocyte communication via connexin 43, and opioid receptor abundance&amp;nbsp;... IGF-1 also reaches the brain via both the capillary bed BBB and via the blood-CSF barrier. It appears that IGF-1 uptake is mediated by a specific carrier both in the capillary bed BBB [40] and in the blood-CSF barrier [41, 42]. Moreover, IGF-1 transport across the BBB can be either increased, such as by exercise [43]&amp;nbsp;... Thus, although not fully characterized, there appear to be mechanisms for transport of both GH and IGF-1 across the BBB.&amp;nbsp;...  Interestingly, exercise is a factor known to enhance cell genesis in the brain, and it appears that IGF-1 is a key mediator of the effect of exercise in terms of cell genesis in the adult brain [52, 53].&amp;nbsp;... IGF-1 treatment enhances neurogenesis [52, 53, 55], oligodendrogenesis [56, 58] and angiogenesis [59].&amp;nbsp;... As physical exercise has positive effects in many diseases as well as in normal health, it is of interest that circulating IGF-1 as been shown to be one of the mediators of enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus.--&gt;| series = Endocrine Development | isbn = 978-3-8055-9302-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM IGF-1 VEGF"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 221, 412 | edition = 2nd | quote = &lt;!--BDNF, CNTF, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and VEGF have been proven to support motor neuron survival in vitro and in vivo.&amp;nbsp;...

VEGF and its receptors are expressed in neurons and glia, and this expression is highly up-regulated by hypoxia. The neurotrophic properties of VEGF were first identified when mutations in the VEGF promoter of mice resulted in ALS-like symptoms. Subsequently, VEGF was found to rescue hypoxia-induced motor neuron death both in vivo and in vitro. Recently, a polymorphism in the VEGF promoter sequence was identified in a subset of ALS patients. It is thought that low VEGF levels may underlie motor neuron degeneration in at least one group of patients, but measurement of VEGF in ALS patients has proven difficult. VEGF may also be important for response to stroke and other forms of neural injury.&amp;nbsp;...

Thus, serum IGF-I has been proven to be an important modulator of brain activity, including higher functions such as cognition. Many of these functions can be ascribed to its tissue-remodeling activity as IGF-I modulates adult neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Other activities are cytoprotective; indeed, IGF-I can be considered a key neuroprotective peptide. Still others pertain to the functional characteristics of brain cells, such as cell excitability. Through modulation of membrane channels and neurotransmission, IGF-I impinges directly on neuronal plasticity, the cellular substrate of cognition. However, to fully understand the role of IGF-I in the brain, we have to sum the actions of locally produced IGF-I to those of serum IGF-I&amp;nbsp;... An operational approach to overcome this limitation would be to consider IGF-I as a signal coupling environmental influences on body metabolism with brain function.

Decreased IGF-I and increased IGFBP-1 levels, observed by Rarick et al. (100) after mild aerobic training, might be an adaptive physiological response to prevent hypoglycemia following insulin-sensitizing training. In fact the decrease of circulating IGF-I during short-term training seems to be reflective of favorable neuromuscular anabolic adaptation and is a normal adaptive response to increased physical activity. The potential for exercise-induced increases in circulating IGF-I seems to require longer training duration (100).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten &amp; Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker &amp; Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo &amp; Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not.

In the short term, activation of the HPA axis in response to stress is adaptive. However, long-term stress promoting chronic exposure of tissues to high cortisol concentrations becomes maladaptive.&amp;nbsp;... Exercise, particularly sustained aerobic activity, is a potent stimulus of cortisol secretion. The circulating concentrations of cortisol are directly proportional to the intensity of exercise as measured by oxygen uptake. As is the case for the GH/IGF-1 and HPG axes, the HPA axis also receives many other inputs, including the light/dark cycle, feeding schedules, immune regulation, and many neurotransmitters that mediate the effects of exercise and physical and psychic stress [52].&amp;nbsp;... The HPA is activated by stress, whether physical (exercise) or psychological.&amp;nbsp;... Thus, a negative net energy balance leads to activation of the HPA axis and the circulating concomitants of the catabolic state in an attempt to keep core processes functional, realizing that the stress of exercise has no effect on cortisol and circulating metabolic substrates beyond the impact of the exercise energy expenditure on energy availability [60]. Thuma et al. [61] had already made the important observation that the reported differences in cortisol levels pre- and post-exercise depended on whether this difference was measured from a single pre-test level or from the physiologic circadian baseline as determined in an independent session in the resting state. By this analytical technique, these investigators showed that increasing energy expenditure led to significant cortisol release. This release was apparent if they subtracted the physiologic circadian baseline from the post-exercise value.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition" /&gt;  Short-term increases in cortisol levels are associated with adaptive cognitive improvements, such as enhanced inhibitory control;&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Exercise neuroendocrine effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition" /&gt; however, excessively high exposure or prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol causes impairments in cognitive control and has [[neurotoxic]] effects in the human brain.&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endocrine cognition"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner NC, Kamin H, Diaz V, Cohen RA, MacDonald K | title = Hormones as "difference makers" in cognitive and socioemotional aging processes | journal = Front Psychol | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1595 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25657633 | pmc = 4302708 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01595 | quote = &lt;!-- It is known that chronically elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol exert neurotoxic effects on the aging brain with negative impacts on cognition and socioemotional functioning.&amp;nbsp;... Cortisol is a steroid hormone released by the HPA axis in response to challenging situations. As the primary effector of the biological stress response in humans, it is implicated in a diverse array of physiologic, metabolic, immunologic, and psychological processes directed toward successful coping (Sapolsky et al., 2000; Kassel and Herrlich, 2007). Cortisol receptors are well-represented in limbic structures involved in affective response (i.e., hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala) and in regions central to executive function such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (Dedovic et al., 2009; Joëls and Baram, 2009). As a result, the effects of cortisol extend beyond the stress and threat response system to impact mood, attention, and memory (Lupien and McEwen, 1997; Sapolsky et al., 2000; de Kloet et al., 2005).&amp;nbsp;... In contrast, evidence indicated positive associations between cortisol levels that were acutely elevated by stress or hydrocortisone administration and inhibitory control (Schlosser et al., 2013) as well as spatial learning (Meyer et al., 2013). Regarding cortisol’s effect on memory, the evidence is currently mixed (Schwabe et al., 2012; van Ast et al., 2013).&amp;nbsp;... There also is evidence that effects of cortisol on cognition vary in a dose-dependent fashion. In particular, there is evidence of cognitive improvements under conditions of moderate, time-limited cortisol elevation but evidence of cognitive impairments when cortisol concentrations are persistent or excessively high (Lupien et al., 1999; Abercrombie et al., 2003; Hupbach and Fieman, 2012; Schilling et al., 2013; Moriarty et al., 2014).--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chronic psychological stress decreases {{abbr|BDNF|brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} expression which has detrimental effects on hippocampal volume and can lead to [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Fitness mechanism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Stress" /&gt;

For example, Rimelle et al. [123] documented significantly lower cortisol and heart rate responses to psychosocial stress (Trier social stress test) in trained men compared with untrained men. Moreover, significantly greater calmness and better mood, and a trend towards lower state anxiety, were noted in these trained men during the stress protocol.&amp;nbsp;... Whereas hippocampal and/or serum/plasma BDNF levels are downregulated by chronic psychosocial stress and inflammation [138,180,201], central and peripheral BDNF levels can be upregulated by acute exercise [33,198,202,203].&amp;nbsp;... Exercise-induced increases in brain monoamines (norepinephrine and serotonin) may also contribute to increased expression of hippocampal BDNF [194]. In addition, other growth factors—insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor—have been shown to play an important role in BDNF-induced effects on neuroplasticity [33,172,190,192], as well as exerting neuroprotective effects of their own [33,214,215], thereby contributing to the beneficial effects of exercise on brain health.

Animal studies found EX-induced changes in different neurotransmitters such as serotonin and endorphins [10,11], which relate to mood, and positive effects of EX on stress reactivity (e.g., the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis [12,13]). Finally, anxiolytic effects of EX mediated by atrial natriuretic peptide have been reported [14].

====β-Endorphin====

[[β-Endorphin]] (contracted from "&lt;u&gt;endo&lt;/u&gt;genous mo&lt;u&gt;rphin&lt;/u&gt;e") is an endogenous [[opioid]] [[neuropeptide]] that binds to [[μ-opioid receptor]]s, in turn producing [[euphoria]] and [[analgesia|pain relief]].&lt;ref name="Endorphin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dinas PC, Koutedakis Y, Flouris AD | title = Effects of exercise and physical activity on depression | journal = Ir J Med Sci | volume = 180 | issue = 2 | pages = 319–325 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21076975 | doi = 10.1007/s11845-010-0633-9 | quote = &lt;!--According to the 'endorphins hypothesis', exercise augments the secretion of endogenous opioid peptides in the brain, reducing pain and causing general euphoria.&amp;nbsp;...

The results showed that mood tends to be higher in a day an individual exercises as well as that daily activity and exercise overall are strongly linked with mood states.  In line with these findings, a recent study showed that exercise significantly improved mood states in non-exercises, recreational exercisers, as well as marathon runners.  More importantly, the effects of exercise on mood were twofold in recreational exercisers and marathon runners.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analytic]] review found that exercise significantly increases the secretion of {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} and that this secretion is correlated with improved mood states.&lt;ref name="Endorphin" /&gt; Moderate intensity exercise produces the greatest increase in {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} synthesis, while higher and lower intensity forms of exercise are associated with smaller increases in {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} synthesis.&lt;ref name="Endorphin" /&gt; A review on {{nowrap|β-endorphin}} and exercise noted that an individual's mood improves for the remainder of the day following physical exercise and that one's mood is positively correlated with overall daily physical activity level.&lt;ref name="Endorphin" /&gt;

====Anandamide====

[[Anandamide]] is an [[endocannabinoid|endogenous cannabinoid]] neurotransmitter that binds to [[cannabinoid receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tantimonaco M, Ceci R, Sabatini S, Catani MV, Rossi A, Gasperi V, Maccarrone M | title = Physical activity and the endocannabinoid system: an overview | journal = Cell.

Indeed, direct and indirect evidence suggests that the ECS might mediate some of the PA-triggered effects throughout the body.&amp;nbsp;... the evidence that PA induces some of the psychotropic effects elicited by the Cannabis sativa active ingredient Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, Fig. 1), like bliss, euphoria, and peacefulness, strengthened the hypothesis that endocannabinoids (eCBs) might mediate, at least in part, the central and peripheral effects of exercise [14].&amp;nbsp;... To our knowledge, the first experimental study aimed at investigating the influence of PA on ECS in humans was carried out in 2003 by Sparling and coworkers [63], who showed increased plasma AEA content after 45 min of moderate intensity exercise on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Since then, other human studies have shown increased blood concentrations of AEA&amp;nbsp;... A dependence of the increase of AEA concentration on exercise intensity has also been documented. Plasma levels of AEA significantly increased upon 30 min of moderate exercise (heart rate of 72 and 83 %), but not at lower and significantly higher exercise intensities, where the age-adjusted maximal heart rate was 44 and 92 %, respectively&amp;nbsp;... Several experimental data support the hypothesis that ECS might, at least in part, explain PA effects on brain functions, because: (1) CB1 is the most abundant GPCR in the brain participating in neuronal plasticity [18]; (2) eCBs are involved in several brain responses that greatly overlap with the positive effects of exercise; (3) eCBs are able to cross the blood–brain barrier [95]; and (4) exercise increases {{abbr|eCB|endocannabinoid}} plasma levels [64–67].--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that aerobic exercise causes an increase in plasma anandamide levels, where the magnitude of this increase is highest at moderate exercise intensity ( i.e., exercising at ~⁠70⁠–⁠80⁠% maximum heart rate).&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt; Increases in plasma anandamide levels are associated with [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive effects]] because anandamide is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and act within the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt; Thus, because anandamide is a euphoriant and aerobic exercise is associated with euphoric effects, it has been proposed that anandamide partly mediates the short-term mood-lifting effects of exercise (e.g., the euphoria of a runner's high) via exercise-induced increases in its synthesis.&lt;ref name="Primary-Runner's high definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids" /&gt;

A popular belief has been that endogenous endorphins mediate these beneficial effects. However, running exercise increases blood levels of both β-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid). Using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic, and behavioral studies in mice, we demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors mediate acute anxiolysis and analgesia after running. We show that anxiolysis depends on intact cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) receptors on forebrain GABAergic neurons and pain reduction on activation of peripheral CB1 and CB2 receptors. We thus demonstrate that the endocannabinoid system is crucial for two main aspects of a runner's high. Sedation, in contrast, was not influenced by cannabinoid or opioid receptor blockage, and euphoria cannot be studied in mouse models. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2016}}

Sibley and Etnier (2003) performed a meta-analysis that looked at the relationship between physical activity and cognitive performance in children.&lt;ref name=sibley/&gt; They reported a beneficial relationship in the categories of perceptual skills, intelligence quotient, achievement, verbal tests, mathematic tests, developmental level/academic readiness and other, with the exception of memory, that was found to be unrelated to physical activity.&lt;ref name=sibley&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Sibley BA, Etnier JL | year = 2003 | title = The Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition in Children: A Meta-Analysis | url = | journal = Pediatric Exercise Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 243–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation was strongest for the age ranges of 4–7 and 11–13 years.&lt;ref name=sibley /&gt; On the other hand, Chaddock and colleagues (2011) found results that contrasted Sibley and Etnier's meta-analysis.

When compared to psychological or pharmacological therapies, exercise appears to be no more effective, though this conclusion is based on a few small trials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three subsequent 2014 systematic reviews that included the Cochrane review in their analysis concluded with similar findings: one indicated that physical exercise is effective as an [[wikt:adjunct treatment|adjunct treatment]] (i.e., treatments that are used together) with antidepressant medication;&lt;ref name="Exercise MDD antidepressant" /&gt; the other two indicated that physical exercise has marked antidepressant effects and recommended the inclusion of physical activity as an adjunct treatment for mild–moderate depression and mental illness in general.&lt;ref name="Exercise depression intervention" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Physical activity intervention" /&gt; One systematic review noted that [[yoga]] may be effective in alleviating symptoms of [[prenatal depression]].&lt;ref name="Yoga depression SystRev"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gong H, Ni C, Shen X, Wu T, Jiang C | title = Yoga for prenatal depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 14 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25652267 | pmc = 4323231 | doi = 10.1186/s12888-015-0393-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review asserted that evidence from [[clinical trials]] supports the efficacy of physical exercise as a treatment for depression over a 2–4&amp;nbsp;month period.&lt;ref name="Comprehensive review" /&gt;

A 2015 review of clinical evidence which included a [[medical guideline]] for the treatment of depression with exercise noted that the available evidence on the effectiveness of exercise therapy for depression suffers from some limitations;&lt;ref name="PA-dep June 2015" /&gt; nonetheless, it stated that there is clear evidence of efficacy for reducing symptoms of depression.&lt;ref name="PA-dep June 2015" /&gt; The review also noted that patient characteristics, the type of depressive disorder, and the nature of the exercise program all affect the antidepressant properties of exercise therapy.&lt;ref name="PA-dep June 2015" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] from July 2016 concluded that physical exercise improves overall quality of life in individuals with depression relative to controls.&lt;ref name="Depression QoL meta-analysis" /&gt;

===Mild cognitive impairment===

The [[American Academy of Neurology]]'s January 2018 update of their [[clinical practice guideline]] for [[mild cognitive impairment]] states that clinicians should recommend regular exercise (two times per week) to individuals who have been diagnosed with this condition.&lt;ref name="December 2017 AAN Clinical Practice Guideline for MCI" /&gt; This guidance is based upon a moderate amount of high-quality evidence which supports the efficacy of regular physical exercise (twice weekly over a 6-month period) for improving cognitive symptoms in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name="December 2017 AAN Clinical Practice Guideline for MCI" /&gt;

===Neurodegenerative disorders===

====Alzheimer's disease====

[[Alzheimer's Disease]] is a cortical neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent form of [[dementia]], representing approximately 65% of all cases of dementia; it is characterized by impaired cognitive function, behavioral abnormalities, and a reduced capacity to perform [[Activities of daily living|basic activities of daily life]].&lt;ref name="Alz 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alz 2" /&gt; Two meta-analytic systematic reviews of [[randomized controlled trial]]s with durations of 3–12&amp;nbsp;months have examined the effects of physical exercise on the aforementioned characteristics of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Alz 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alz 2" /&gt; The reviews found beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive function, the rate of cognitive decline, and the ability to perform activities of daily living in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Alz 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alz 2" /&gt; One review suggested that, based upon transgenic mouse models, the cognitive effects of exercise on Alzheimer's disease may result from a reduction in the quantity of [[amyloid plaque]].&lt;ref name="Alz 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=adlard&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adlard PA, Perreau VM, Pop V, Cotman CW | title = Voluntary exercise decreases amyloid load in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease | journal = J.

'''Obeya''' or '''Oobeya''' (from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] 大部屋 "large room" or "war room") refers to a form of project management used in Asian companies (including [[Toyota]]) and is a component of [[lean manufacturing]] and in particular the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Fara|title=In a Word, Toyota Drives for Innovation|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/45195/word-toyota-drives-innovation|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Fast Company|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogies have been drawn between an obeya and the bridge of a ship, a war room and even a brain.&lt;ref&gt;Jusko, J., [http://www.industryweek.com/print/lean-six-sigma/obeya-brain-lean-enterprise Obeya: The Brain of the Lean Enterprise], ''Industry Week'', 30 September 2016, accessed 4 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

During the product and process development, all individuals involved in managerial planning meet in a "great room" to speed communication and decision-making. This is intended to reduce "departmental thinking" and improve on methods like email and social networking. The ''Obeya'' can be understood as a team spirit improvement tool at an administrative level.

Conceptually akin to traditional “war rooms,” an ''Obeya'' will contain visually engaging charts and graphs depicting such information as program timing, milestones and progress-to-date and countermeasures to existing technical or scheduling issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capsule summaries of Key Lean Concepts B|url=http://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/NewsArticleDocuments/Capsule%20summaries%20of%20Key%20Lean%20Concepts%20B.doc|publisher=lean.org|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Toyota]], vehicle development is possible in significantly less than 20 months; by comparison, the average for other car makers is 36 months.{{fact|date=August 2015}}

'''Organic farming''' is a phrase coined early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices to describe what other species use, and used, to farm without synthetic chemicals. Organic farming continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today. It relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as compost [[manure]], [[green manure]], and [[bone meal]] and places emphasis on techniques such as [[crop rotation]] and [[companion planting]]. [[Biological pest control]], mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. In general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2012/01/25/organic-101-allowed-and-prohibited-substances/|title=USDA Blog  » Organic 101: Allowed and Prohibited Substances|website=blogs.usda.gov|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, naturally occurring pesticides such as [[pyrethrin]] and [[rotenone]] are permitted, while synthetic [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticide]]s are generally prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed include, for example, [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]], elemental [[sulfur]] and [[Ivermectin]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s, [[nanomaterials]], human sewage [[sludge]], [[plant growth regulator]]s, [[hormone]]s, and [[antibiotic use in livestock]] husbandry are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19528/1/Paull2011NanoISOFAR.pdf "Nanomaterials in food and agriculture: The big issue of small matter for organic food and farming"], Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of ISOFAR (International Society of Organic Agriculture Research), 28 September – 1 October, Namyangju, Korea., 2:96-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=9874504b6f1025eb0e6b67cadf9d3b40&amp;rgn=div6&amp;view=text&amp;node=7:3.1.1.9.32.7&amp;idno=7|title=USDA List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances in Organic Agriculture|date=4 April 2016|website=USDA List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances in Organic Agriculture|publisher=USDA|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for advocation of organic farming include advantages in [[sustainability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arsenault|first1=Chris|title=Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn_9780930031756"&gt;{{Citation |last=Coleman |first=Eliot |year=1995 |title=The New Organic Grower: A Master's Manual of Tools and Techniques for the Home and Market Gardener |edition=2nd |pages=65, 108 |url= |isbn=978-0930031756 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[openness]], [[self-sufficiency]], [[autonomy]]/[[independence]],&lt;ref name="isbn_9780930031756"/&gt; [[health]], [[food security]], and [[food safety]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of organic farming}}

[[Traditional agriculture|Agriculture]] was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals. [[Artificial fertilizer]]s were first created during the mid-19th century.

In 1921, [[Sir Albert Howard|Albert Howard]] and his wife [[Gabrielle Howard]], accomplished [[botanist]]s, founded an Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India. Among other things, they brought improved implements and improved animal husbandry methods from their scientific training; then by incorporating aspects of the local traditional methods, developed protocols for the rotation of crops, erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of composts and manures.&lt;ref&gt;Yeshwant D. Wad, [http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howard_memorial.html The Work At Indore]&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by these experiences of traditional farming, when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930s&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Howard had died while the Howards were still in India.&lt;/ref&gt; he began to promulgate a system of natural agriculture.

In July 1939, [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]], the author of the standard work on biodynamic agriculture (''Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening''),&lt;ref name=Paull2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paull, John |year=2011 |title=Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924-1938|url=http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:304a24bf-3961-4798-b13c-9e0a1e2aa339|journal=Journal of Organic Systems |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=27–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to the UK at the invitation of [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne]] as a presenter at the [[Betteshanger]] Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19511/1/Paull2011BetteshangerJOS.pdf "The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming"], Journal of Organic Systems, 6(2):13-26.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer, [http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howard_memorial.html Sir Albert Howard's Deed for Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, ''Look to the Land'', in which he coined the term "organic farming." The Betteshanger conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt;

In 1940 Howard published his ''An Agricultural Testament''. In this book he adopted Northbourne's terminology of "organic farming."&lt;ref name=Paull&gt;Paull, John (2006) [http://orgprints.org/10138/1/10138.pdf The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture] Elementals ~ Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania 83:14–18&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's work spread widely, and he became known as the "father of organic farming" for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods.&lt;ref name=Stinner2007/&gt;{{rp|45}} In the United States [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]], who was keenly interested both in Howard's ideas and in biodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Heckman, [http://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/a-history-of-organic-farming-transitions-from-sir-albert-howards-war-in-the-soil-to-the-usda-national-organic-program/ A History of Organic Farming: Transitions from Sir Albert Howard’s War in the Soil to the USDA National Organic Program]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation, [[The Rodale Institute]], and the [[Rodale Press]] to teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public. These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture. Further work was done by [[Lady Eve Balfour]] (the [[Haughley Experiment]]) in the United Kingdom, and many others across the world.

Increasing environmental awareness in the general population in modern times has transformed the originally supply-driven organic movement to a demand-driven one. Premium prices and some government subsidies attracted farmers. In the developing world, many producers farm according to traditional methods that are comparable to organic farming, but not certified, and that may not include the latest scientific advancements in organic agriculture. In other cases, farmers in the developing world have converted to modern organic methods for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John [http://orgprints.org/10949/01/10949.pdf "China's Organic Revolution"], Journal of Organic Systems (2007) 2 (1): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Biodynamic agriculturists, who based their work on Steiner's spiritually-oriented [[anthroposophy]], used the term "organic" to indicate that a farm should be viewed as a living organism,&lt;ref name=Kirchmann/&gt;{{rp|17–19}}&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt; in the sense of the following quotation:
{{quote|1="An organic farm, properly speaking, is not one that uses certain methods and substances and avoids others; it is a farm whose structure is formed in imitation of the structure of a natural system that has the integrity, the independence and the benign dependence of an organism"
| 2=[[Wendell Berry]], "The Gift of Good Land"}}

The use of "organic" popularized by Howard and Rodale, on the other hand, refers more narrowly to the use of [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the [[humus]] content of soils, grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called "humus farming." Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nayler|first=Justin|title=Second Thoughts About Organic Agriculture|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/Second.Thoughts.pdf|publisher=Soil And Health Library|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diver|first=Steve|title=Controlled Microbial Composting and Humus Management: Luebke Compost|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/steved/Luebke/Luebke-compost2.html|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

[[File:Organic-vegetable-cultivation.jpeg|thumb|Organic cultivation of mixed vegetables in [[Capay, California]]]]
{{quote|"Organic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils, [[ecosystems]] and people. It relies on ecological processes, [[biodiversity]] and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved..."|[[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoam.org/en/organic-landmarks/definition-organic-agriculture |title=Definition of Organic Agriculture |accessdate=30 September 2008 |publisher=IFOAM}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Organic farming methods combine scientific knowledge of ecology and modern [[technology]] with [[Traditional agriculture|traditional farming]] practices based on naturally occurring biological processes. Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]&lt;ref&gt;FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s. [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically modified]] seeds and animals are excluded.

While organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and [[biological pest control]] instead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | work = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crop diversity ===

Organic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]]. The science of [[agroecology]] has revealed the benefits of [[polyculture]] (multiple crops in the same space), which is often employed in organic farming.&lt;ref&gt;Fargione J, and D Tilman. 2002. "[http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1868.pdf Competition and coexistence in terrestrial plants]". Pages 156-206 In U. Sommer and B Worm editors, ''Competition and Coexistence''. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Planting a variety of vegetable crops supports a wider range of beneficial insects, soil microorganisms, and other factors that add up to overall farm health. Crop diversity helps environments thrive and protects species from going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/blog/organicfarmingblog/crop-diversity-a-distinctive-characteristic-of-an-organic-farming-met Crop diversity: A Distinctive Characteristic of an Organic Farming Method] - Organic Farming; 15 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil managements ===

Organic farming relies heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter, using techniques like [[green manure]] and [[composting]], to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops. This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]], allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change.

Plants need [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]], as well as [[micronutrient]]s and [[symbiotic relationship]]s with [[fungi]] and other organisms to flourish, but getting enough nitrogen, and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the right time (when plants need it most), is a challenge for organic farmers.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239–247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] ("[[cover crop]]s") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the ''[[Fabaceae]]'' family), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility/&gt; Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008/&gt;{{Rp|43}}

Mixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock ("stockless") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility/&gt;

Biological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming. Varieties of bacteria and fungi break down chemicals, plant matter and animal waste into productive soil nutrients. In turn, they produce benefits of healthier yields and more productive soil for future crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=298–312|last=Ingram |first=M. |year=2007 |title=Biology and Beyond: The Science of ''Back to Nature'' Farming in the United States |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=97 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00537.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields with less or no manure display significantly lower yields, due to decreased soil microbe community. Increased manure improves biological activity, providing a healthier, more arable soil system and higher yields.&lt;ref name="Fließbach et al. 2006"/&gt;

=== Weed management ===

Organic [[weed]] management promotes weed suppression, rather than weed elimination, by enhancing crop competition and [[phytotoxic]] effects on weeds.&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"&gt;Kathleen Delate and Robert Hartzler. 2003. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1883.pdf Weed Management for Organic Farmers]. Iowa State University Extension Bulletin 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides.

Organic standards require [[Crop rotation|rotation]] of annual crops,&lt;ref&gt;Staff, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. [http://193.194.138.42/en/Sustainability-Claims-Portal/Discussion-Forum/Organic-Standards/ Organic Standards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606214740/http://193.194.138.42/en/Sustainability-Claims-Portal/Discussion-Forum/Organic-Standards/ |date=6 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different, intervening crop. Organic crop rotations frequently include weed-suppressive [[cover crop]]s and crops with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop.&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"/&gt; Research is ongoing to develop organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of common weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kremer | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Li | first2 = Jianmei | year = 2003 | title = Developing weed-suppressive soils through improved soil quality management | url = http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/11123/PDF | journal = Soil &amp; Tillage Research | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 193–202 | doi=10.1016/s0167-1987(03)00088-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of competitive crop varieties, high-density planting, tight row spacing, and late planting into warm soil to encourage rapid crop [[germination]].&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"/&gt;

Mechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as:&lt;ref name="extension.org"&gt;Mark Schonbeck, Virginia Association for Biological Farming.

* [[Tillage]] - Turning the soil between crops to incorporate crop residues and soil amendments; remove existing weed growth and prepare a seedbed for planting; turning soil after seeding to kill weeds, including [[cultivator|cultivation]] of row crops;

Some naturally sourced chemicals are allowed for herbicidal use. These include certain formulations of [[acetic acid]] (concentrated vinegar), [[corn gluten meal]], and [[essential oils]]. A few selective [[bioherbicide]]s based on fungal [[pathogen]]s have also been developed. At this time, however, organic herbicides and bioherbicides play a minor role in the organic weed control toolbox.&lt;ref name="extension.org"/&gt;

Weeds can be controlled by grazing. For example, geese have been used successfully to weed a range of organic crops including cotton, strawberries, tobacco, and corn,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Geiger and Harold Biellier. 1993.

{{See also|Biological pest control|Integrated Pest Management}}

Organisms aside from weeds that cause problems on organic farms include [[arthropod]]s (e.g., insects, [[mite]]s), [[nematode]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]. Organic practices include, but are not limited to:

* encouraging predatory beneficial insects to control pests by serving them nursery plants and/or an alternative habitat, usually in a form of a [[Windbreak|shelterbelt]], [[hedgerow]], or [[beetle bank]];
* encouraging beneficial microorganisms;
* [[crop rotation|rotating crops]] to different locations from year to year to interrupt pest reproduction cycles;
* planting [[companion planting|companion crops]] and [[List of pest-repelling plants|pest-repelling plants]] that discourage or divert pests;
* using row covers to protect crops during pest migration periods;
* using [[Ecologic pesticides and herbicides|biologic pesticides and herbicides]];
* using [[stale seed bed]]s to germinate and destroy weeds before planting;&lt;ref&gt;Presentation by Ilse A. Rasmussen, Dept. of Crop Protection, Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences. [http://orgprints.org/216/02/Elspeet2000_iar.PDF Sowing time, false seedbed, row distance and [[mechanical weed control]] in organic winter wheat]&lt;/ref&gt;
* using sanitation to remove pest habitat;
* using [[insect trap]]s to monitor and control insect populations; and
* using physical barriers, such as [[row cover]]s.

Examples of predatory beneficial insects include [[Orius (bug)|minute pirate bugs]], [[Geocoris|big-eyed bugs]], and to a lesser extent [[Coccinellidae|ladybugs]] (which tend to fly away), all of which eat a wide range of pests. [[Neuroptera|Lacewings]] are also effective, but tend to fly away. [[Praying mantis]] tend to move more slowly and eat less heavily. [[Parasitoid wasp]]s tend to be effective for their selected prey, but like all small insects can be less effective outdoors because the wind controls their movement. Predatory mites are effective for controlling other mites.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008/&gt;{{Rp|66–90}}

Naturally derived [[insecticide]]s allowed for use on organic farms use include ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (a bacterial toxin), [[pyrethrum]] (a chrysanthemum extract), [[spinosad]] (a bacterial metabolite), [[neem]] (a tree extract) and [[rotenone]] (a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; one survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use [[rotenone]] while 1.7% use [[pyrethrum]].&lt;ref name=Lotter2003&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lotter |first1= D. |year=2003 |url=http://donlotter.net/lotter_organicag.pdf| title= Organic Agriculture |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture | volume = 21 |issue=4 |format = PDF|doi=10.1300/J064v21n04_06|page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008&gt;Gillman J.

Naturally derived [[fungicide]]s allowed for use on organic farms include the bacteria ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and ''Bacillus pumilus''; and the fungus ''[[Trichoderma harzianum]]''.

=== Livestock ===

[[File:Organic cattle in Ohio, United States.jpg|thumb|right|For livestock, like these healthy cows, vaccines play an important part in animal health since antibiotic therapy is prohibited in organic farming]]
Raising livestock and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs, is another traditional farming activity that complements growing. Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic.

Organic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.&lt;ref&gt;FAO [http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/230124/CXg_032e.pdf Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing of Organically Produced Foods (Gl 32 – 1999, Rev. 1 – 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19ff}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateN&amp;navID=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&amp;rightNav1=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&amp;topNav=&amp;leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&amp;page=NOPOrganicStandards&amp;resultType=&amp;acct=nopgeninfo|title=Organic Standards - Agricultural Marketing Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labor, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.

=== Genetic modification ===
{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}

A key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.

Although opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=The EMBO Journal | volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256–258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does author and scientist [[Pamela Ronald]], who views this kind of [[biotechnology]] as being consistent with organic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2008 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Admachak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=0195301757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].

=== Tools ===

Organic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.

== Standards ==
{{Main|Organic certification}}
Standards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).&lt;ref&gt;USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM. (2005). [http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html The IFOAM Norms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210095156/http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html |date=10 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms.

Organic production materials used in and foods are tested independently by the Organic Materials Review Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omri.org/|title=Welcome to the Organic Materials Review Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composting ===
Using manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including pathogenic strains of E. coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food.&lt;ref name=newdaily&gt;[http://thenewdaily.com.au/life/eat-drink/2014/08/29/hidden-dangers-organic-food/ Organic food: the hidden dangers that might surprise you]&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this risk, [[USDA]] organic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperature [[Composting#Approaches|thermophilic composting]]. If raw animal manure is used, 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products that don't directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|title=National Organic Program Regulations|publisher=|access-date=27 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211185453/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|archive-date=11 December 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

The [[economics]] of organic farming, a subfield of [[agricultural economics]], encompasses the entire process and effects of organic farming in terms of human society, including [[social cost]]s, [[opportunity cost]]s, [[unintended consequence]]s, [[information asymmetries]], and [[economies of scale]]. Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.&lt;ref name=Misconcept/&gt;

Traditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.&lt;ref name=Halberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L. (2007).

=== Geographic producer distribution ===

The markets for organic products are strongest in North America and Europe, which as of 2001 are estimated to have $6 and $8 billion respectively of the $20 billion global market.&lt;ref name=Lotter2003/&gt;{{rp|6}} As of 2007 [[Australasia]] has 39% of the total organic farmland, including Australia's {{convert|11,80,000|ha}} but 97 percent of this land is sprawling [[rangeland]] ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:35]]). US sales are 20x as much.&lt;ref name=Lotter2003/&gt;{{rp|7}} Europe farms 23 percent of global organic farmland ({{convert|6,900,000|ha||abbr=on}}), followed by Latin America with 19 percent (5.8 million hectares - 14.3 million acres). Asia has 9.5 percent while North America has 7.2 percent. Africa has 3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Organic farming by country]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Australia,&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt; the countries with the most organic farmland are Argentina (3.1 million hectares - 7.7 million acres), China (2.3 million hectares - 5.7 million acres), and the United States (1.6 million hectares - 4 million acres). Much of Argentina's organic farmland is pasture, like that of Australia ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:42]]). Spain, Germany, Brazil (the world's largest agricultural exporter), Uruguay, and the England follow the United States in the amount of organic land ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:26]]).

In the European Union ([[EU25#2004 Enlargement|EU25]]) 3.9% of the total utilized agricultural area was used for organic production in 2005. The countries with the highest proportion of organic land were Austria (11%) and Italy (8.4%), followed by the Czech Republic and Greece (both 7.2%). The lowest figures were shown for Malta (0.2%), Poland (0.6%) and Ireland (0.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2013, the number of organic producers grew by almost 270,000, or more than 13%.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt; By 2014, there were a reported 2.3 million organic producers in the world.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt; Most of the total global increase took place in the Philippines, Peru, China, and Thailand.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt;  Overall, the majority of all organic producers are in India (650,000 in 2013), Uganda (190,552 in 2014), Mexico (169,703 in 2013) and the Philippines (165,974 in 2014).&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt;

=== Productivity ===

Studies comparing yields have had mixed results.&lt;ref name="Welsh, Rick 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Welsh, Rick | title=Economics of Organic Grain and Soybean Production in the Midwestern United States | journal=Henry A. Wallace Institute for Alternative Agriculture | year=1999 | volume= | pages= | url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/134120}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences among findings can often be attributed to variations between study designs including differences in the crops studied and the methodology by which results were gathered.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that productivity is typically lower for organic farming than conventional farming, but that the size of the difference depends on context and in some cases may be very small.&lt;ref name=Verena2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seufert | first1 = Verena | last2 = Ramankutty | first2 = Navin | last3 = Foley | first3 = Jonathan A. | year = 2012 | title = Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature11069.html | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7397| pages = 229–232 | doi=10.1038/nature11069| bibcode = 2012Natur.485..229S }}&lt;/ref&gt; While organic yields can be lower than conventional yields, another meta-analysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research in 2015, concluded that certain organic on-farm practices could help narrow this gap. Timely weed management and the application of manure in conjunction with legume forages/cover crops were shown to have positive results in increasing organic corn and soybean productivity.

Another meta-analysis published in the journal Agricultural Systems in 2011 analyzed 362 datasets and found that organic yields were on average 80% of conventional yields. The author's found that there are relative differences in this yield gap based on crop type with crops like soybeans and rice scoring higher than the 80% average and crops like wheat and potato scoring lower. Across global regions, Asia and Central Europe were found to have relatively higher yields and Northern Europe relatively lower than the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Pont|first=Tomek|last2=Rijk|first2=Bert|last3=van Ittersum|first3=Martin K.|date=19 December 2011|title=The crop yield gap between organic and conventional agriculture|url=|journal=Agricultural Systems|doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2011.12.004|pmid=|volume=108|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1742170507001640 |laysource=New Scientist |laydate=12 July 2007 |laysummary=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12245-organic-farming-could-feed-the-world.html |title=Organic agriculture and the global food supply |year=2007 |last1=Badgley |first1=Catherine |last2=Moghtader |first2=Jeremy |last3=Quintero |first3=Eileen |last4=Zakem |first4=Emily |last5=Chappell |first5=M.

The researchers also found that while in developed countries, organic systems on average produce 92% of the yield produced by conventional agriculture, organic systems produce 80% more than conventional farms in developing countries, because the materials needed for organic farming are more accessible than synthetic farming materials to farmers in some poor countries. This study's methodology and results were contested by D.J. Connor of The University of Melbourne, in a short communication published in Field Crops Research.&lt;ref name="Connor2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connor | first1 = D. J. | year = 2008 | title = Organic agriculture cannot feed the world | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Connor6/publication/228387654_Organic_agriculture_cannot_feed_the_world/links/0c9605322be1a6f027000000.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Field Crops Res. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 187–190 | doi=10.1016/j.fcr.2007.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connor writes that errors in Badgley et al. result in "major overestimation of the productivity of OA".

====Long term studies====
A study published in 2005 compared conventional cropping, organic animal-based cropping, and organic legume-based cropping on a test farm at the [[Rodale Institute]] over 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel DP et al. (2005) [http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf Environmental, Energetic, and Economic Comparisons of Organic and Conventional Farming Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601032933/http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf |date=1 June 2013 }} Bioscience 55(7): 573-582.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that "the crop yields for corn and soybeans were similar in the organic animal, organic legume, and conventional farming systems". It also found that "significantly less fossil energy was expended to produce corn in the Rodale Institute’s organic animal and organic legume systems than in the conventional production system. There was little difference in energy input between the different treatments for producing soybeans. In the organic systems, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides were generally not used". As of 2013 the Rodale study was ongoing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/farming-systems-trial/|title=Farming Systems Trial: Overview - Rodale Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a thirty-year anniversary report was published by Rodale in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rodaleinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FSTbookletFINAL.pdf |title=The Farming Systems Trial Rodale 30 year report|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long-term field study comparing organic/conventional agriculture carried out over 21 years in Switzerland concluded that "Crop yields of the organic systems averaged over 21 experimental years at 80% of the conventional ones. The fertilizer input, however, was 34 – 51% lower, indicating an efficient production. The organic farming systems used 20 – 56% less energy to produce a
crop unit and per land area this difference was 36 – 53%. In spite of the considerably lower pesticide input the quality of organic products was hardly discernible from conventional analytically and even came off better in food preference trials and picture creating methods"&lt;ref&gt;Fliessbach, et al. ([[Research Institute of Organic Agriculture]]), [http://www.soilace.com/pdf/pon2004/1.Fliessbach.pdf "D-O-K (Biodynamic-Bioorganic-Conventional): Results From 21 Year Old Field Experiment"].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Profitability ===

In the United States, organic farming has been shown to be 2.7 to 3.8 times more profitable for the farmer than conventional farming when prevailing price premiums are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyer|first=Jeff|date=2013|title=Perspective on Rodale Institute’s Farming Systems Trial|url=|journal=Crop Management|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, organic farming is between 22 and 35 percent more profitable for farmers than conventional methods, according to a 2015 meta-analysis of studies conducted across five continents.&lt;ref name="Crowder 7611–7616"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowder|first=David W.|last2=Reganold|first2=John P.|date=16 June 2015|title=Financial competitiveness of organic agriculture on a global scale|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7611|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=24|pages=7611–7616|doi=10.1073/pnas.1423674112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4475942|pmid=26034271|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.7611C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profitability of organic agriculture can be attributed to a number of factors. First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.

The price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Prices|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants. For many producers, direct sales at farmers' markets are most profitable because the farmer receives the entire markup, however this is also the most time and labor-intensive approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Organic Pricing and Costs of Production|last=Post|first=Emily|publisher=NCAT|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been signs of organic price premiums narrowing in recent years, which lowers the economic incentive for farmers to convert to or maintain organic production methods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McBride|first=William D.|last2=Greene|first2=Catherine R.|date=2013|title=Organic Data and Research from the ARMS Survey: Findings on Competitiveness of the Organic Soybean Sector|url=|journal=Crop Management|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that, based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States, a price premium of only 10% is required to achieve parity with conventional farming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A separate study found that on a global scale, price premiums of only 5-7% percent were needed to break even with conventional methods.&lt;ref name="Crowder 7611–7616"/&gt; Without the price premium, profitability for farmers is mixed.&lt;ref name="Lotter2003" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

For markets and supermarkets organic food is profitable as well, and is generally sold at significantly higher prices than non-organic food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/business/18organic.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Sticker Shock in the Organic Aisles |last=Martin|first=Andrew|author2=Kim Severson |date=18 April 2008|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy efficiency ===

In the most recent assessments of the energy efficiency of organic versus conventional agriculture, results have been mixed regarding which form is more carbon efficient. Organic farm systems have more often than not been found to be more energy efficient, however, this is not always the case. More than anything, results tend to depend upon crop type and farm size.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pimental | title=Energy efficiency of farming systems: Organic and conventional agriculture | journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment | year=1983 | volume=9 | pages=359–372 | doi=10.1016/0167-8809(83)90021-X | last2=Berardi | first2=Gigi | last3=Fast | first3=Sarah | issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive comparison of energy efficiency in grain production, produce yield, and animal husbandry concluded that organic farming had a higher yield per unit of energy over the vast majority of the crops and livestock systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dalgaard | title=A model for fossil energy use in Danish agriculture used to compare organic and conventional farming | journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | year=2001 | volume=87 | pages=51–65 | doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00297-8 | last2=Halberg | first2=Niels | last3=Porter | first3=John R.|display-authors=etal| url=http://orgprints.org/15521/1/15521.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two studies - both comparing organically- versus conventionally-farmed apples - declare contradicting results, one saying organic farming is more energy efficient, the other saying conventionally is more efficient.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reganold et al. 2001 926–930"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Reganold | title=Sustainability of three apple production systems | journal=Nature |date=April 2001 | volume=410 | pages=926–930 | doi=10.1038/35073574 | pmid=11309616 | last2=Glover | first2=JD | last3=Andrews | first3=PK | last4=Hinman | first4=HR | issue=6831|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been found that the labor input per unit of yield was higher for organic systems compared with conventional production.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"/&gt;

=== Sales and marketing ===

Most sales are concentrated in developed nations. In 2008, 69% of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products, down from 73% in 2005. One theory for this change was that consumers were substituting "local" produce for "organic" produce.&lt;ref&gt;CNN. [http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/23/news/companies/organics_backlash/index.htm?postversion=2008042308 Consumer surveys show slipping interest in organic products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartman-group.com/publications/reports/organic-marketplace/ The Hartman Group Organic Marketplace Reports].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributors ===

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] requires that distributors, manufacturers, and processors of organic products be certified by an accredited state or private agency.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/192533/vgs32901.pdf|title=Using Vertically Coordinated Relationships To Overcome Tight Supply in the Organic Market|last=Dimitri|first=Carolyn|last2=Oberholtzer|first2=Lydia|date=October 2008|website=|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518010404/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/192533/vgs32901.pdf|archive-date=18 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, there were 3,225 certified organic handlers, up from 2,790 in 2004.&lt;ref name="ers.usda.gov"&gt;Dimitri, Carolyn, and Lydia Oberholtzer. Marketing U.S. Organic Foods: Recent Trends From Farms to Consumers. Economic Information Bulletin No. 58. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.

Organic handlers are often small firms; 48% reported sales below $1 million annually, and 22% between $1 and $5 million per year.&lt;ref name="Oberholtzer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/us-organic-handlers-mostly-small,-focus-on-fruit-and-vegetables.aspx#.VxTnWRMrI6h|title=USDA Economic Research Service - U.S. Organic Handlers Mostly Small, Focus on Fruit and Vegetables|last=Oberholtzer|first=Carolyn Dimitri, Lydia|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426205152/http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/us-organic-handlers-mostly-small,-focus-on-fruit-and-vegetables.aspx#.VxTnWRMrI6h|archive-date=26 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller handlers are more likely to sell to independent natural grocery stores and natural product chains whereas large distributors more often market to natural product chains and conventional supermarkets, with a small group marketing to independent natural product stores.&lt;ref name="ers.usda.gov"/&gt; Some handlers work with conventional farmers to convert their land to organic with the knowledge that the farmer will have a secure sales outlet. This lowers the risk for the handler as well as the farmer. In 2004, 31% of handlers provided technical support on organic standards or production to their suppliers and 34% encouraged their suppliers to transition to organic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Smaller farms often join together in [[cooperative]]s to market their goods more effectively.

93% of organic sales are through conventional and natural food supermarkets and chains, while the remaining 7% of U.S. organic food sales occur through farmers' markets, [[foodservice]]s, and other marketing channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/organic-agriculture/organic-market-overview.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Market Overview|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Direct-to-consumer sales ====

In the 2012 Census, direct-to-consumer sales equaled $1.3 billion, up from $812 million in 2002, an increase of 60 percent. The number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer sales was 144,530 in 2012 in comparison to 116,733 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/2012-census-organic-local/|title=2012 Census Drilldown: Organic and Local Food {{!}} National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition|website=sustainableagriculture.net|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct-to-consumer sales include farmers' markets, [[Community-supported agriculture|community supported agriculture]] (CSA), on-farm stores, and roadside farm stands. Some organic farms also sell products direct to retailer, direct to restaurant and direct to institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/138324/err128_2_.pdf|title=Direct and Intermediated Marketing of Local Foods in the United States|last=Low|first=Sarah|date=November 2011|website=|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003010/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/138324/err128_2_.pdf|archive-date=18 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2008 Organic Production Survey, approximately 7% of organic farm sales were direct-to-consumers, 10% went direct to retailers, and approximately 83% went into wholesale markets. In comparison, only 0.4% of the value of convention agricultural commodities were direct-to-consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri, Carolyn, Lydia Oberholtzer, and Michelle Wittenberger. The Role of Contracts in the Organic Supply Chain: 2004 and 2007, EIB-69, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, December 2010. http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/134484/eib69.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518004146/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/134484/eib69.pdf |date=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not all products sold at farmer’s markets are certified organic, this direct-to-consumer avenue has become increasingly popular in local food distribution and has grown substantially since 1994. In 2014, there were 8,284 farmer’s markets in comparison to 3,706 in 2004 and 1,755 in 1994, most of which are found in populated areas such as the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=48561&amp;ref=collection&amp;embed=True|title=Number of U.S. farmers’ markets continues to rise|last=Vogel|first=Stephen|date=August 2014|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426162736/http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=48561&amp;ref=collection&amp;embed=True|archive-date=26 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor and employment ===

Organic production is more labor-intensive than conventional production.&lt;ref name=FAOFAQ&gt;Staff, FAO [http://www.fao.org/organicag/oa-faq/oa-faq5/en/ Organic Agriculture FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the one hand, this increased labor cost is one factor that makes organic food more expensive.&lt;ref name=FAOFAQ/&gt;  On the other hand, the increased need for labor may be seen as an "employment dividend" of organic farming, providing more jobs per unit area than conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;Green M and Maynard R. [http://orgprints.org/10178/1/The_employment_benefits_of_organic_farming.pdf The employment benefits of organic farming]  Aspects of Applied Biology 79, 2006; 51-55&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report suggests that "[a]n increase in investment in green agriculture is projected to lead to growth in employment of about 60 per cent compared with current levels" and that "green agriculture investments could create 47 million additional jobs compared with BAU2 over the next 40 years."&lt;ref&gt;Citation used: UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) also argues that "[b]y greening agriculture and food distribution, more calories per person per day, more jobs and business opportunities especially in rural areas, and market-access opportunities, especially for developing countries, will be available."

=== World's food security ===

In 2007 the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) said that organic agriculture often leads to higher prices and hence a better income for farmers, so it should be promoted. However, FAO stressed that by organic farming one could not feed the current mankind, even less the bigger future population. Both data and models showed then that organic farming was far from sufficient. Therefore, chemical fertilizers were needed to avoid hunger.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2007/1000726/index.html Organic agriculture can contribute to fighting hunger - But chemical fertilizers needed to feed the world], [[FAO]], 10 December 2007, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysis by many agribusiness executives, agricultural and ecological scientists, and international agriculture experts revealed the opinion that organic farming would not only increase the world's food supply, but might be the only way to eradicate hunger.&lt;ref name="Halweil"&gt;{{cite web|last=Halweil|first=Brian|title=Can Organic Farming Feed Us All?|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4060|publisher=World Watch Magazine|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAO stressed that fertilizers and other chemical inputs can much increase the production, particularly in Africa where fertilizers are currently used 90% less than in Asia.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; For example, in Malawi the yield has been boosted using seeds and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; FAO also calls for using [[biotechnology]], as it can help smallholder farmers to improve their income and food security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/202820/icode/ Overcoming smallholder challenges with biotechnology], FAO, 29 October 2013, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacity building in developing countries ===

Organic agriculture can contribute to ecological sustainability, especially in poorer countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ICapacity Building Study 3: Organic Agriculture and Food Security in East Africa | publisher = University of Essex | url = http://www.unep-unctad.org/cbtf/events/dsalaam2/Organic%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20Security%20in%20East%20Africa%20FINAL%20May07.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071201140714/http://www.unep-unctad.org/cbtf/events/dsalaam2/Organic%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20Security%20in%20East%20Africa%20FINAL%20May07.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-12-01 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of organic principles enables employment of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness.

Organic agriculture is knowledge intensive. Globally, capacity building efforts are underway, including localized training material, to limited effect. As of 2007, the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] hosted more than 170 free manuals and 75 training opportunities online.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 2008 the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) stated that "organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems, and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the long-term"&lt;ref name=UNEP2008&gt;UNEP-UNCTAD. (2008). Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa. United Nations.

==== Millennium Development Goals ====

The value of organic agriculture (OA) in the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG), particularly in poverty reduction efforts in the face of climate change, is shown by its contribution to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.&lt;ref name="E&amp;S"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture-and-post-2015-development-goals.]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Setboonsarng, S.

A related ADBI study also sheds on the costs of OA programs and set them in the context of the costs of attaining the MDGs. The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;World Bank. 2008.

== Disadvantages ==

Agriculture imposes negative externalities (uncompensated costs) upon society through public land and other public resource use, biodiversity loss, erosion, pesticides, nutrient runoff, subsidized water usage, subsidy payments and assorted other problems. Positive externalities include self-reliance, entrepreneurship, respect for nature, and air quality. Organic methods reduce some of these costs.&lt;ref name=Marshall1991&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Marshall | first = G. | year = 1991 | title= Organic Farming: Should Government Give it More Technical Support? |journal = Review of Marketing and Agricultural Economics | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–296 | url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/12390/1/59030283.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 uncompensated costs for 1996 reached 2,343 million British pounds or £208 per ha (£84.20/ac).&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Pretty| year = 2000| title = An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture| journal = Agricultural Systems| volume = 65| issue = 2| pages = 113–136| doi = 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7| url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/bs/staff/pretty/AgSyst%20pdf.pdf| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5p4udiKF2?url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/bs/staff/pretty/AgSyst%20pdf.pdf| archivedate = 18 April 2010| first1 = J| last2 = Brett| first2 = C.| last3 = Gee| first3 = D.| last4 = Hine| first4 = R.E.| last5 = Mason| first5 = C.F.| last6 = Morison| first6 = J.I.L.| last7 = Raven| first7 = H.| last8 = Rayment| first8 = M.D.| last9 = Van Der Bijl| first9 = G. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt;| display-authors = etal| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of practices in the US published in 2005 concluded that cropland costs the economy approximately 5 to 16 billion dollars ($30–96/ha – $12–39/ac), while livestock production costs 714 million dollars.&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Tegtmeier | first1 = E.M. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States | journal = The Earthscan Reader in Sustainable Agriculture | url = http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both studies recommended reducing externalities. The 2000 review included reported pesticide poisonings but did not include speculative chronic health effects of pesticides, and the 2004 review relied on a 1992 estimate of the total impact of pesticides.

It has been proposed that organic agriculture can reduce the level of some negative externalities from (conventional) agriculture. Whether the benefits are private or public depends upon the division of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= New Zealand's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry | title= A Review of the Environmental/Public Good Costs and Benefits of Organic Farming and an Assessment of How Far These Can be Incorporated into Marketable Benefits | work=  | url= http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/rural-nz/sustainable-resource-use/organic-production/organic-farming-in-nz/org10005.htm | accessdate= 20 April 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081015111550/http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/rural-nz/sustainable-resource-use/organic-production/organic-farming-in-nz/org10005.htm | archivedate= 15 October 2008 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surveys and studies have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming and have found that organic techniques, while not without harm, are less damaging than conventional ones because they reduce levels of biodiversity less than conventional systems do and use less energy and produce less waste when calculated per unit area.&lt;ref&gt;Stolze, M.; Piorr, A.; Häring, A.M. and Dabbert, S.

A 2003 to 2005 investigation by the [[Cranfield University]] for the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] in the UK found that it is difficult to compare the [[Global warming potential]], acidification and eutrophication emissions but "Organic production often results in increased burdens, from factors such as N leaching and N2O emissions", even though primary energy use was less for most organic products. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is always the largest global warming potential contributor except in tomatoes. However, "organic tomatoes always incur more burdens (except pesticide use)". Some emissions were lower "per area", but organic farming always required 65 to 200% more field area than non-organic farming. The numbers were highest for bread wheat (200+ % more) and potatoes (160% more).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organicagcentre.ca/ResearchDatabase/res_enviro_burdens.asp Determining the environmental burdens and resource use in the production of agricultural and horticultural commodities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329093718/http://www.organicagcentre.ca/ResearchDatabase/res_enviro_burdens.asp |date=29 March 2014 }}, Williams, A.G. et al., Cranfield University, U.K., August 2006.

Researchers at Oxford University analyzed 71 peer-reviewed studies and observed that organic products are sometimes worse for the environment.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;[http://people.forestry.oregonstate.edu/steve-strauss/sites/people.forestry.oregonstate.edu.steve-strauss/files/Organic%20farms%20not%20necessarily%20better%20for%20environment%20-%20University%20of%20Oxford_2012.pdf Organic farms not necessarily better for environment], University of Oxford, 4 Sep 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Organic milk, cereals, and pork generated higher [[greenhouse gas]] emissions per product than conventional ones but organic beef and olives had lower emissions in most studies.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Usually organic products required less energy, but more land.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Per unit of product, organic produce generates higher nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, [[eutrophication]], and acidification potential than conventionally grown produce.&lt;ref name=tuomisto&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1907461/Does_organic_farming_reduce_environmental_impacts_-_A_meta-analysis_of_European_research Does organic farming reduce environmental impacts? - A meta-analysis of European research], H.L.

Critics of organic farming methods believe that the increased land needed to farm organic food could potentially destroy the rainforests and wipe out many ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Goldberg, Bob | title= The Hypocrisy of Organic Farmers | work=AgBioWorld | url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/articles/biotech-art/hypocrisy.html | accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Leonard, Andrew | title= Save the rain forest -- boycott organic? | work=How The World Works | url=https://www.salon.com/2006/12/11/borlaug/ | accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrient leaching ===

According to a 2012 [[meta-analysis]] of 71 studies, nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication potential and acidification potential were higher for organic products,&lt;ref name=tuomisto/&gt; although in one study "nitrate leaching was 4.4–5.6 times higher in conventional plots than organic plots".&lt;ref name="PNAS 2006-3-21"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600359103|last1=Kramer|first1=SB|last2=Reganold|first2=JP|last3=Glover |first3=JD|last4=Bohannan|first4=BJ|last5=Mooney|first5=HA|title=Reduced nitrate leaching and enhanced dentrifier activity and efficiency in organically fertilized soils|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|pages=4522–7|issue=12|volume=103 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=21 March 2006|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/12/4522#B2|accessdate=30 September 2007|pmid=16537377|pmc=1450204 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103.4522K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess nutrients in lakes, rivers, and groundwater can cause [[algal blooms]], [[eutrophication]], and subsequent [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]]. In addition, [[nitrate]]s are harmful to aquatic organisms by themselves.&lt;ref name="Science 2001-04-13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Forecasting Agriculturally Driven Global Climate Change|journal=Science|date=21 March 2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/5515/281?ijkey=bbb4cf6e526430899ecae63af4bbd319d226922e&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|accessdate=30 September 2007|pmid=11303102|doi=10.1126/science.1057544|last1=Tilman|first1=D|last2=Fargione|first2=J|last3=Wolff|first3=B|last4=d'Antonio|first4=C|last5=Dobson|first5=A|last6=Howarth|first6=R|last7=Schindler|first7=D|last8=Schlesinger|first8=WH|last9=Simberloff|first9=D|volume=292|issue=5515|pages=281–4 |bibcode = 2001Sci...292..281T|last10=Swackhamer|first10=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land use ===

The Oxford meta-analysis of 71 studies found that organic farming requires 84% more land for an equivalent amount of harvest, mainly due to lack of nutrients but sometimes due to weeds, diseases or pests, lower yielding animals and land required for fertility building crops.&lt;ref name=tuomisto/&gt; While organic farming does not necessarily save land for wildlife habitats and forestry in all cases,&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; the most modern breakthroughs in organic are addressing these issues with success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodale Institute Farming Systems Trial|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/farming-systems-trial/farming-systems-trial-30-year-report/|publisher=Rodale Institute|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Pastures for Profit: A Guide to Rotational Grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3529.PDF|work=University of Wisconsin|publisher=Cooperative extension publishing|accessdate=24 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational Grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|work=University of Wisconsin|publisher=Cooperative extension publishing|accessdate=24 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pesticides ===

[[File:Organic Apples Pateros WA cropped.jpg|thumb|A sign outside of an organic [[apple]] orchard in [[Pateros, Washington]] reminding orchardists not to spray pesticides on these trees]]

In organic farming synthetic pesticides are generally prohibited. A chemical is said to be synthetic if it does not already exist in the natural world. But the organic label goes further and usually prohibit compounds that exist in nature if they are produced by [[chemical synthesis]]. So the prohibition is also about the method of production and not only the nature of the compound.

A non-exhaustive list of organic approved pesticides with their [[median lethal dose]]s:

* [[Copper(II) sulfate]] is used as a fungicide and is also used in conventional agriculture ([[Copper(II) sulfate|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 300 mg/kg]]). Conventional agriculture has the option to use the less toxic [[Mancozeb]] ([http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/haloxyfop-methylparathion/mancozeb-ext.html LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 4,500 to 11,200 mg/kg])
* [[Boric acid]] is used as stomach poison that target insects  (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 2660&amp;nbsp;mg/kg).
* [[Pyrethrin]] comes from chemicals extracted from flowers of the genus [[Pyrethrum]] ([http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/pyrethrins-ziram/pyrethrins-ext.html LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 370 mg/kg]). Its potent toxicity is used to control insects.
* [[Lime sulphur]] (aka calcium polysulfide) and sulfur are considered to be allowed, synthetic materials&lt;ref&gt;http://web.pppmb.cals.cornell.edu/resourceguide/pdf/resource-guide-for-organic-insect-and-disease-management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 820&amp;nbsp;mg/kg)
* [[Rotenone]] is a powerful insecticide that was used to control insects (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 132&amp;nbsp;mg/kg). Despite the high toxicity of Rotenone to aquatic life and some links to Parkinson disease the compound is still allowed in organic farming as it is a naturally occurring compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/rotenone-organic-zb0z1405zsto.aspx|title=Use and Status of Rotenone in Organic Growing - Organic Gardening |publisher=MOTHER EARTH NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bromomethane]] is a gas that is still used in the nurseries of Strawberry organic farming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/2011/09/25/organic-strawberries-are-not-g/|title=What makes an organically grown strawberry environmentally friendly? |publisher=Tomorrow's Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Azadirachtin]] is a wide spectrum very potent insecticide. Almost non toxic to mammals (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in rats is &gt; 3,540&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) but affects beneficial insects.

While there may be some differences in the amounts of nutrients and anti-nutrients when organically produced food and conventionally produced food are compared, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results, and there is insufficient evidence to make claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food.&lt;ref name=2014meta&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barański|first1=M|last2=Srednicka-Tober|first2=D|last3=Volakakis|first3=N|last4=Seal|first4=C|last5=Sanderson|first5=R|last6=Stewart|first6=GB|last7=Benbrook|first7=C|last8=Biavati|first8=B|last9=Markellou|first9=E|last10=Giotis|first10=C|last11=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first11=J|last12=Rembiałkowska|first12=E|last13=Skwarło-Sońta |first13=K|last14=Tahvonen |first14=R|last15=Janovská|first15=D |last16=Niggli|first16=U|last17=Nicot|first17=P |last18=Leifert|first18=C |title=Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses.|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|date=26 June 2014|pages=1–18|pmid=24968103 |doi=10.1017/S0007114514001366 |volume=112 |issue=5 |pmc=4141693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair1"&gt;Blair, Robert.

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main|Organic farming and biodiversity}}

The conservation of natural resources and biodiversity is a core principle of organic production. Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"&gt;"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation"(PDF).

Biodiversity from organic farming provides capital to humans. Species found in organic farms enhance sustainability by reducing human input (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00390.x |year=2006 |displayauthors=1 |last1=Perrings|first1=C |last2=Jackson|first2=L |last3=Bawa|first3=K |last4=Brussaard|first4=L |last5=Brush|first5=S |last6=Gavin|first6=T |last7=Papa|first7=R |last8=Pascual|first8=U |last9=De Ruiter|first9=P |title=Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes: Saving Natural Capital without Losing Interest |journal=Conservation Biology|pmid=16903084 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published a ''Federal Register'' notice on 15 January 2016, announcing the National Organic Program (NOP) final guidance on Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation for Certified Organic Operations. Given the broad scope of natural resources which includes soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildlife, the guidance provides examples of practices that support the underlying conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with USDA organic regulations § 205.200.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"/&gt; The final guidance provides organic certifiers and farms with examples of production practices that support conservation principles and comply with the USDA organic regulations, which require operations to maintain or improve natural resources.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"/&gt; The final guidance also clarifies the role of certified operations (to submit an OSP to a certifier), certifiers (ensure that the OSP describes or lists practices that explain the operator's monitoring plan and practices to support natural resources and biodiversity conservation), and inspectors (onsite inspection) in the implementation and verification of these production practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOP%205020%20Biodiversity%20Guidance%20Rev01%20%28Final%29.pdf|title=USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation|date=15 January 2016|website=Agricultural Marketing Service, National Organic Program|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of organisms benefit from organic farming, but it is unclear whether organic methods confer greater benefits than conventional integrated agri-environmental programs.&lt;ref name="Hole et al. 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Does organic farming benefit biodiversity? |journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–130 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2004.07.018 |last1=Hole |first1=D.G. |last2=Perkins |first2=A.J. |last3=Wilson |first3=J.D. |last4=Alexander |first4=I.H. |last5=Grice |first5=P.V. |last6=Evans |first6=A.D. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic farming is often presented as a more biodiversity-friendly practice, but the generality of the beneficial effects of organic farming is debated as the effects appear often species- and context-dependent, and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local- and landscape-scale management on farmland biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four key issues when comparing the impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional farming: (1) It remains unclear whether a holistic whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hole|first1=D.G.|last2=Perkins|first2=A.J.|last3=Wilson|first3=J.D.|last4=Alexander|first4=I.H.|last5=Grice|first5=P.V.|last6=Evans|first6=A.D.|title=Does organic farming benefit biodiversity?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=March 2005|volume=122|issue=1|pages=113–130|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.07.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to Labor Standards ===
Organic agriculture is often considered to be more socially just and economically sustainable for farmworkers than conventional agriculture. However, there is little social science research or consensus as to whether or not organic agriculture provides better working conditions than conventional agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shreck|first=Aimee|last2=Getz|first2=Christy|last3=Feenstra|first3=Gail|date=2006-11-21|title=Social sustainability, farm labor, and organic agriculture: Findings from an exploratory analysis|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|volume=23|issue=4|pages=439–449|doi=10.1007/s10460-006-9016-2|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many consumers equate organic and sustainable agriculture with small-scale, family-owned organizations it is widely interpreted that buying organic supports better conditions for farmworkers than buying with conventional producers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getz|first=Christy|last2=Brown|first2=Sandy|last3=Shreck|first3=Aimee|date=December 2008|title=Class Politics and Agricultural Exceptionalism in California's Organic Agriculture Movement|journal=Politics &amp; Society|volume=36|issue=4|pages=478–507|doi=10.1177/0032329208324709|issn=0032-3292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic agriculture is generally more labor-intensive due to its dependence on manual practices for fertilization and pest removal and relies heavily upon hired, non-family farmworkers rather than family members. Although illnesses from synthetic inputs pose less of a risk, hired workers still fall victim to debilitating musculoskeletal disorders associated with agricultural work. The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labor practices. Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project, Domestic Fair Trade Working Group, and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms, their standards cannot be widely enforced.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Sandy|last2=Getz|first2=Christy|date=May 2008|title=Privatizing farm worker justice: Regulating labor through voluntary certification and labeling|journal=Geoforum|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1184–1196|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.01.002|issn=0016-7185}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labor standards, there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements. Many actors of the organic industry believe that enforcing labor standards would be unnecessary&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, unacceptable&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, or unviable due to the constraints of the market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6393">'''Price's model''' (named after the physicist [[Derek J. de Solla Price]]) is a mathematical model for the growth of [[citation network]]s.
It was the first model which generalized the [[Simon model]]&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;Simon, H. A., ''On a class of skew distribution functions'', Biometrika '''42''', 425-440 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; to be used for networks, especially for growing networks. Price's model belongs to the broader class of network growing models (together with the highly influential [[Barabási–Albert model]]) whose primary target is to explain the origination of networks with strongly skewed degree distributions. The model picked up the ideas of the [[Simon model]] reflecting the concept of [[rich get richer]], also known as the [[Matthew effect]]. [[Price]] took the example of a network of citations between scientific papers and expressed its properties. His idea was that the way how an old vertex (existing paper) gets new edges (new citations) should be proportional to the number of existing edges (existing citations) the vertex already has. This was referred to as ''cumulative advantage'', now also known as [[preferential attachment]]. Price's work is also significant in providing the first known example of a [[scale-free network]] (although it was named later). His ideas were used to describe many real-world networks such as the [[World Wide Web|Web]].

== The model ==

===Basics===
Consider a directed graph with ''n'' nodes. Let &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; denote the fraction of nodes with degree ''k'' so that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}{p_k}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Each new node has a given out-degree (namely those papers it cites) and it is fixed in the long run. This does not mean that the out-degrees can not vary across nodes, simply we assume that the mean out-degree ''m'' is fixed over time. It is clear, that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}{kp_k}=m&lt;/math&gt;, consequently ''m'' is not restricted to integers. The most trivial form of preferential attachment means that a new node connects to an existing node proportionally to its in-degrees. In other words, a new paper cites an existing paper in proportional to its in-degrees. The caveat of such idea is that no new paper is cited when it is joined to the network so it is going to have zero probability of being cited in the future (which necessarily is not how it happens). To overcome this, [[Derek J. de Solla Price|Price]] proposed that an attachment should be proportional to some &lt;math&gt;k+k_0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; constant. In general &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; can be arbitrary, yet Price proposes a &lt;math&gt;k_0=1&lt;/math&gt;, in that way an initial citation is associated with the paper itself (so the proportionality factor is now ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 instead of ''k''). The probability of a new edge connecting to any node with a degree ''k'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(k+1)p_k}{\sum_k (k+1)p_k}=\frac{(k+1)p_k}{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Evolution of the network===
The next question is the net change in the number of nodes with degree ''k'' when we add new nodes to the network. Naturally, this number is decreasing, as some ''k''-degree nodes have new edges, hence becoming (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-degree nodes; but on the other hand this number is also increasing, as some (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-degree nodes might get new edges, becoming ''k'' degree nodes. To express this net change formally, let us denote the fraction of ''k''-degree nodes at a network of ''n'' vertices with &lt;math&gt;p_{k,n}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p_{k,n+1}-np_{k,n}=[kp_{k-1,n}-(k+1)p_{k,n}]\frac{m}{m+1}\text{ for }k\geq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p_{0,n+1}-np_{0,n}=1-p_{0,n}\frac{m}{m+1}\text{ for }k=0.&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain a stationary solution for &lt;math&gt;p_{k,n+1}=p_{k,n}=p_k&lt;/math&gt;, first let us express &lt;math&gt;p_{k}&lt;/math&gt;  using the well-known [[master equation]] method, as

: &lt;math&gt;p_k=\begin{cases}[kp_{k-1}-(k+1)p_k]\frac{m}{m+1} &amp; \text{for } k\geq 1 \\1-p_0\frac{m}{m+1} &amp; \text{for } k=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

After some manipulation, the expression above yields to

: &lt;math&gt;p_0=\frac{m+1}{2m+1}&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;p_k=\frac{k!}{(k+2+1/m)\cdots(3+1/m)}p_0=(1+1/m)\mathbf{B}(k+1,2+1/m),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; being the [[beta function|Beta-function]]. As a consequence, &lt;math&gt;p_k\sim k^{-(2+1/m)}&lt;/math&gt;. This is identical to saying that &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; follows a [[power law|power-law distribution]] with exponent &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+1/m&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, this places the exponent between 2 and 3, which is the case for many real world networks. [[Derek J. de Solla Price|Price]] tested his model by comparing to the citation network data and concluded that the resulting ''m'' is feasible to produce a sufficiently good [[power law|power-law distribution]].

===Generalization===

It is straightforward how to generalize the above results to the case when &lt;math&gt;k_0\neq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Basic calculations show that

: &lt;math&gt;p_k=\frac{m+k_0}{m(k_0+1)+k_0}\frac{\mathbf{B}(k+k_0,2+k_0/m)}{\mathbf{B}(k_0,2+k_0/m)},&lt;/math&gt;

which once more yields to a power law distribution of &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; with the same exponent &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+k_0/m&lt;/math&gt; for large ''k'' and fixed &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Fortunately, much work dedicated to preferential attachment and network growth has been enabled by recent technological progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22414">In [[metaphysics]], the '''problem of universals''' refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are.&lt;ref name="Moreland, Universals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moreland|first=J.P.|title=Universals|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773522697|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[property (philosophy)|Properties]] are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common. The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and [[relation (philosophy)|relations]], are referred to as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]. For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of ''being circular'' or ''exemplifying circularity'',&lt;ref&gt;Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; or two daughters that have in common ''being the female offsprings of Frank.'' There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in [[reality]] or merely in thought and speech.

==Positions&lt;!--'Extreme realism' and 'Strong realism' redirect here--&gt;==
There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking "beauty" as example, three positions are:
* [[Platonic realism]] (also called "'''extreme realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Herbert Hochberg, "Nominalism and Idealism," ''Axiomathes'', June 2013, '''23'''(2), pp. 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt;): beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.
* [[Aristotelian realism]] (also called "'''strong realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;): beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.
* [[Anti-realism]]: beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.

Extreme realism and strong realism are also known as [[exaggerated realism]] and [[moderate realism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism – ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable variant of anti-realism is [[nominalism]].&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;

===Realism&lt;!--Linked from 'Philosophical realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Metaphysical realism}}
The realist school claims that universals are real—they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are [[Platonic realism]] (''universalia ante res'') and [[Aristotelian realism]] (''universalia in rebus'').&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953), among others, sometimes uses such Latin terms.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

Realists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. For example, a common realist argument, supposedly found in Plato, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence "[[Djivan Gasparyan]] is a musician". The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Thus it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.&lt;ref&gt;(MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, §1b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominalism&lt;!--&lt;!--linked from 'Anti-realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Nominalism}}
Nominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; ''universalia post res''). The term "nominalism" comes from the Latin ''nomen'' ("name"), since the nominalist philosopher agrees that we predicate the same property of multiple entities but argues that the entities only share a name, not a real quality, in common. There are various forms of nominalism; four major varieties are [[predicate nominalism]], [[resemblance nominalism]], [[trope nominalism]], and [[conceptualism]].&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt; 

Nominalists often argue for their view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore—by [[Occam's razor]] or some sort of principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities.

Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Ockham]], [[Rudolf Carnap]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/resemblance-nominalism-a-solution-to-the-problem-of-universals/ "Review of Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, ''Resemblance Nominalism: A Solution to the Problem of Universals''" – ndpr.nd.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goodman/supplement.html "Nelson Goodman: The Calculus of Individuals in its different versions", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; [[H. H. Price]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; and [[D. C. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ Donald Cary Williams, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendental idealism===
{{main|Transcendental idealism}}
{{see also|German idealism}}

[[Transcendental idealist]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] posited that universals are not real, but are ideas in the mind of rational beings. Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.

Thus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of [[psychology]] and [[epistemology]]. Kant's position has been interpreted as a conceptualist one.&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient philosophy==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or [[substantial form|forms]]: one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have [[knowledge]] about the latter.  For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §1b.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [[Allegory of the cave|sunlight]], while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [[Allegory of the cave|shadows]]. This [[Platonic realism]], however, in denying that the [[theory of forms|eternal Forms]] are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.

One of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said "I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy|others=Translated by Guy Davenport|title=Herakleitos and Diogenes|publisher=Grey Fox Press|location=Bolinas|year=1979|pages=57|isbn=0-912516-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into "[[Four causes#Formal cause|formal causes]]", the blueprints or [[essence]]s of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized [[geometry]], Aristotle emphasized [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of [[natural kind]]s.

Consider for example a particular [[oak]] tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical [[Empiricism|empiricist]] and a founder of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Aristotle was a new, [[Moderate realism|moderate]] sort of realist about universals.

==Medieval philosophy==

===Boethius===
The problem was introduced to the medieval world by [[Boethius]], by his translation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]. It begins:

"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_02_translation.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories of Aristotle (1853) vol. 2. pp.609-633.|first=|last=Porphyry|date=|website=www.tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duns Scotus===
[[Duns Scotus]] argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for [[Scotist realism]], a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard.

===Ockham===
[[William of Ockham]] argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words/names that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ockham/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Spade|first=Paul Vincent|last2=Panaccio|first2=Claude|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval realism===
{{main|Medieval realism}}
Realism was argued for by both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct;&lt;ref&gt;On Being and Essence, Ch I.&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard he is close to the teaching of Aristotle. [[Scotist realism]] argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a [[Formal distinction]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these opinions were denied by Scotus' pupil William of Ockham.

===Medieval nominalism===
{{main|Medieval nominalism}}
In [[medieval philosophy]], the French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism.

==Modern and contemporary philosophy==

===Mill===
{{also|Psychologism}}
The 19th-century British philosophy [[John Stuart Mill]] discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Mill wrote, "The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object".

However, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:

{{Quotation |But, though meaning them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined. While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently intense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other attributes and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept.|as quoted in William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

In other words, we may be "temporarily unconscious" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.

===Peirce===
The 19th-century American logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], known as the father of [[pragmatism]], developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that "Berkeley's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1871), Review: Fraser's Edition of the ''Works of George Berkeley'' in ''North American Review'' 113(October):449-72, reprinted in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 8, paragraphs 7-38 and in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 462-486. ''Peirce Edition Project'' [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_48/v2_48.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of "the possibility of forming the simplest general conception". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works ''in practice'' the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. "If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?" Peirce also held as a matter of [[ontology]] that what he called "thirdness", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.

===James===
[[William James]] learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance. (Which was not to Peirce's taste - he came to complain that James had "kidnapped" the term and eventually to call himself a "pragmaticist" instead.) Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:

{{Quotation | From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising. Why, from Plato and Aristotle, philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular and in adoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things and that the things of worth are all concretes and singulars. The only value of universal characters is that they help us, by reasoning, to know new [[truth]]s about individual things.|William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

There are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars:  the moral/political answer, the mathematical/scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.

===Weaver===
The moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher [[Richard M. Weaver]] in ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of "the fateful doctrine of nominalism" was "the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence".&lt;ref name="Hoeveler1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. David Hoeveler|title=Watch on the right: conservative intellectuals in the Reagan era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JocfGWYGciMC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=15 February 1991|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-12810-4|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotchie1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Scotchie|title=The vision of Richard Weaver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHUZ7Mjv4WMC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-212-3|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cocchiarella===
[[Nino Cocchiarella]] put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads ("Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication", ''[[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]]'', vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.

===Armstrong===
The Australian philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' (1978) and ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to "natural classes" (a view he ascribes to [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist "trope" accounts (which he describes in the ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' volumes as "particularism"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.

===Penrose===
[[Roger Penrose]] contends that the [[philosophy of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]] can't be understood absent the Platonic view that "mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198519737|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychedelic agents in creative problem-solving experiment''' was a study designed to evaluate whether the use of a [[psychedelic substance]] with supportive setting can lead to improvement of performance in solving professional problems. The altered performance was measured by subjective reports, questionnaires, the obtained solutions for the professional problems and psychometric data using the Purdue Creativity, the Miller Object Visualization, and the Witkins Embedded Figures tests.&lt;ref name="Harman 1966"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment was a pilot that was to be followed by control studies as part of exploratory studies on uses for psychedelic drugs, that were interrupted early in 1966 when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] declared a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on research with human subjects, as a strategy in combating illicit use.&lt;ref name="heretic"/&gt;

== Procedure ==
Some weeks before the actual experiment, a preliminary experiment was conducted. It consisted of two sessions with four participants in each. The groups worked on two problems chosen by the research personnel. The first group consisted of four people with professional experience in electrical engineering, engineering design, engineering management and psychology. They were given 50 micrograms of [[LSD]]. The second group consisted of four research engineers, three with a background in electronics and one in mechanics. They were given 100 milligrams of [[mescaline]]. Both groups were productive in ideation but, according to Fadiman, the fact that the participants didn't have actual personal stake in the outcome of the session negatively affected the actualization of the ideas. This is why the actual study focused on personal professional problems that the participants were highly motivated to tackle.&lt;ref name="fadiman1"/&gt;

The experiment was carried out in 1966 in a facility of International Foundation for Advanced Study, [[Menlo Park, California]], by a team including [[Willis Harman]], [[Robert H. McKim]], [[Robert E. Mogar]], [[James Fadiman]] and [[Myron Stolaroff]]. The participants of the study consisted of 27 male subjects engaged in a variety of professions: sixteen engineers, one engineer-physicist, two mathematicians, two architects, one psychologist, one furniture designer, one commercial artist, one sales manager, and one personnel manager. Nineteen of the subjects had had no previous experience with psychedelics. Each participant was required to bring a professional problem they had been working on for at least 3 months, and to have a desire to solve it.

Commonly observed characteristics of the psychedelic experience seemed to operate both for and against the hypothesis that the drug session could be used for performance enhancement. The research was therefore planned so as to attempt to provide a setting that would maximize improved functioning, while minimizing effects that might hinder effective functioning.&lt;ref name="fadiman2"/&gt; Each group of four subjects met for an evening session several days before the experiment. They received instructions and introduced themselves and their unsolved problems to the group. Approximately one hour of pencil-and-paper tests were also administered. At the beginning of the day of the experiment session, subjects were given 200 milligrams of mescaline sulphate (a moderately light dose compared to the doses used in experiments to induce [[mystical experience]]s). After some hours of relaxation, subjects were given tests similar to the ones on the introduction day. After the tests, subjects had four hours to work on their chosen problems. After the working phase, the group would discuss their experiences and review the solutions they had come up with. After this, the participants were driven home. Within a week after the session, each participant wrote a subjective account of his experience. Six weeks further, subjects again filled in questionnaires, this time concentrating on the effects on post-session creative ability and the validity and reception of the solutions conceived during the session. This data was in addition to the psychometric data comparing results of the two testing periods.

== Results ==
Solutions obtained in the experiment include:&lt;ref name="fadiman1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fadiman5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harman1"/&gt;
* a new approach to the design of a vibratory [[microtome]]
* a commercial building design, accepted by the client
* space probe experiments devised to measure solar properties
* design of a linear electron accelerator beam-steering device
* engineering improvement to a [[magnetic tape recorder]]
* a chair design, modeled and accepted by the manufacturer
* a letterhead design, approved by the customer
* a mathematical theorem regarding [[NOR gate]] circuits
* completion of a furniture-line design
* a new conceptual model of a [[photon]], which was found useful
* design of a private dwelling, approved by the client
* insights regarding how to use [[interferometry]] in medical diagnosis application sensing heat distribution in the human body

The participants also reported following experiences of enhanced functioning: low inhibition and anxiety, capacity to restructure problem in larger context, enhanced fluency and flexibility of ideation, heightened capacity for visual imagery and fantasy, increased ability to concentrate, heightened empathy with external processes and objects, heightened empathy with people, subconscious data more accessible, association of dissimilar ideas, heightened motivation to obtain closure, visualizing the completed solution.

== Criticism ==
According to a recent unpublished review by Matthew J. Baggott, PhD, the experimenters co-administered methamphetamine as an "energizer" along with the mescaline. This went mysteriously unreported in Fadiman's published work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he preliminary report of the study indicates that participants received methamphetamine and chlordiazepoxide along with the mescaline: 'In the individual sessions the drug regime consists of psychic energizers and a psychedelic drug (200 mg. of mescaline sulphate in these experiments), usually with additional energizer at mid-day' (Fadiman et al. 1965, p 4). The nature of these energizers is clarified later in the report where methedrine (methamphetamine) and librium (chlordiazepoxide) are explicitly mentioned (ibid, p B-1). Because the co-administration of other drugs was not described in the peer-reviewed publication by Harman et al. in Psychological Reports, very few subsequent commentators have noted this confound (Krippner (1968) notes the use of 'energizers' without comment)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baggott|first=Matthew|date=June 2015|title=Psychedelics and Creativity: a Review of the Quantitative Literature|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/1202.pdf|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.8&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the overview of the experiment, Harman and Fadiman mention that experiments on specific performance enhancement through directed use of psychedelics have gone on in various countries of the world, on both sides of the Iron Curtain.&lt;ref name="harman-fadiman"/&gt;

In the book ''LSD — The Problem-Solving Psychedelic'', Stafford and Golightly write about a man engaged in naval research, working with a team under his direction on the design of an anti-submarine detection device for over five years without success. He contacted a small research foundation studying the use of LSD. After a few sessions of learning to control the fluidity of the LSD state (how to stop it, how to start it, how to turn it around) he directed his attention to the design problem. Within ten minutes he had the solution he had been searching for. Since then, the device has been patented by the U.S., and Navy and Naval personnel working in this area have been trained in its use.&lt;ref name="stafford-golightly"/&gt;

In 1999 [[Jeremy Narby]], an anthropologist specialized in amazonian shamanism, acted as a translator for three molecular biologists who travelled to the Peruvian Amazon to see whether they could obtain bio-molecular information in the visions they had in sessions orchestrated by an indigenous shaman. Narby recounts this preliminary experiment and the exchange of methods of gaining knowledge between the biologists and indigenous people in his article ''Shamans and scientists''.&lt;ref name="Narby"/&gt;

In 1991, [[Denise Caruso]], writing a computer column for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' went to [[SIGGRAPH]], the largest gathering of computer graphic professionals in the world. She conducted a survey; by the time she got back to San Francisco, she had talked to 180 professionals in the computer graphic field who had admitted taking psychedelics, and that psychedelics are important to their work; according to mathematician [[Ralph Abraham (mathematician)|Ralph Abraham]].&lt;ref name="SFE1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham"/&gt;

James Fadiman is currently conducting a study on [[Psychedelic microdosing|psychedelic micro-dosing]] for improving normal functioning.&lt;ref name="micro"/&gt; Micro-dosing (or sub-perceptual dosing) means taking sub-threshold dose, which for LSD is 10-20 micrograms. The purpose of micro-dosing is not intoxication but enhancement of normal functionality (see [[nootropic]]). In this study the volunteers self-administer the drug approximately every third day. They then self-report perceived effects on their daily duties and relationships. Volunteers participating in the study include a wide variety of scientific and artistic professionals and students. So far the reports suggest that, in general, the subjects experience normal functioning but with increased focus, creativity and emotional clarity and slightly enhanced physical performance. [[Albert Hofmann]] was also aware of micro-dosing and has called it the most under-researched area of psychedelics.&lt;ref name="fadiman4"/&gt;

Since the 1930s, [[ibogaine]] was sold in France in 8&amp;nbsp;mg tablets  in the form of ''Lambarène'', an extract of the ''Tabernanthe manii'' plant. 8&amp;nbsp;mg of ibogaine could be considered a microdose since doses in ibogatherapy and -rituals vary in the range of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg to 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg adding usually up to 1000&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name="ibotherapy"/&gt; ''Lambarène'' was advertised as a mental and physical stimulant and was "...indicated in cases of depression, asthenia, in convalescence, infectious disease, [and] greater than normal physical or mental efforts by healthy individuals". The drug enjoyed some popularity among post World War II athletes, but was eventually removed from the market, when the sale of ibogaine-containing products was prohibited in 1966.&lt;ref name="Freedlander"/&gt; In the end of 1960's The [[International Olympic Committee]] banned ibogaine as a potential doping agent.&lt;ref name="ICEERS2012"/&gt; Other psychedelics have also been reported to have been used in similar way as doping.&lt;ref name="Oroc"/&gt;

In 1948, Swiss pharmacologist Peter N. Witt started his research on the [[Effect of psychoactive drugs on animals|effect of drugs on spiders]]. Witt tested spiders with a range of psychoactive drugs, including amphetamine, mescaline, strychnine, LSD, and caffeine. All the drugs tested reduced web regularity except for small doses (0.1–0.3&amp;nbsp;µg) of LSD, which increased web regularity.&lt;ref name=witt/&gt;

{{Descartes}}
'''''Res extensa''''' is one of the three [[Substance theory|substances]] described by [[René Descartes]] in his [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] ontology&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principia Philosophiae]]'', 2.001.&lt;/ref&gt; (often referred to as "radical [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]]"), alongside ''[[Mental substance|res cogitans]]'' and [[God]]. Translated from [[Latin]], "''res extensa''" means "extended thing". Descartes often translated it as "corporeal substance". In Descartes' substance–attribute–mode ontology, extension is the primary attribute of corporeal substance.

Descartes describes a piece of wax in the Second [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditation]] (see [[Wax argument]]).  A solid piece of wax has certain sensory qualities. However, when the wax is melted, it loses every single apparent quality it had in its solid form. Still, Descartes recognizes in the melted substance the idea of wax.

'''Response bias''' is a general term for a wide range of tendencies for participants to respond inaccurately or falsely to questions. These biases are prevalent in research involving participant [[self-report study|self-report]], such as [[structured interview]]s or [[statistical survey|surveys]].&lt;ref name="Furnham"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(86)90014-0|title=Response bias, social desirability and dissimulation|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385–400|year=1986|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Response biases can have a large impact on the validity of [[questionnaire]]s or surveys.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420150303|title=Methods of coping with social desirability bias: A review|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=263–280|year=1985|last1=Nederhof|first1=Anton J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Response bias can be induced or caused by numerous factors, all relating to the idea that human subjects do not respond passively to [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]], but rather actively integrate multiple sources of information to generate a response in a given situation.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0043424|title=On the social psychology of the psychological experiment: With particular reference to demand characteristics and their implications|journal=American Psychologist|volume=17|issue=11|pages=776–783|year=1962|last1=Orne|first1=Martin T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, almost any aspect of an experimental condition may potentially bias a respondent. Examples include the phrasing of questions in surveys, the demeanor of the researcher, the way the experiment is conducted, or the desires of the participant to be a good experimental subject and to provide socially desirable responses may affect the response in some way.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalton|first1=Graham|last2=Schuman|first2=Howard|title=The Effect of the Question on Survey Responses: A Review|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series A (General)|date=1982|volume=145|issue=1|pages=42–73|doi=10.2307/2981421|jstor=2981421}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these "artifacts" of survey and self-report research may have the potential to damage the [[construct validity|validity]] of a measure or study.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Compounding this issue is that surveys affected by response bias still often have high [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]], which can lure researchers into a false sense of security about the conclusions they draw.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2777936|pmid=889001|year=1977|author1=Gove|first1=W. R.|title=Response bias in surveys of mental health: An empirical investigation|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1289–1317|last2=Geerken|first2=M. R.|doi=10.1086/226466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of response bias, it is possible that some study results are due to a systematic response bias rather than the [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] effect, which can have a profound effect on [[Psychology|psychological]] and other types of research using questionnaires or surveys.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; It is therefore important for researchers to be aware of response bias and the effect it can have on their research so that they can attempt to prevent it from impacting their findings in a negative manner.

==History of research==
Awareness of response bias has been present in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] literature for some time because self-reporting features significantly in those fields of research. However, researchers were initially unwilling to admit the degree to which they impact, and potentially invalidate research utilizing these types of measures.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; Some researchers believed that the biases present in a group of subjects cancel out when the group is large enough.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, H; 1954. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lj0OAQAAIAAJ ''Interviewing in Social Research.''] Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean that the impact of response bias is random noise, which washes out if enough participants are included in the study.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; However, at the time this argument was proposed, effective methodological tools that could test it were not available.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; Once newer methodologies were developed, researchers began to investigate the impact of response bias.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; From this renewed research, two opposing sides arose.

The first group supports Hyman's belief that although response bias exists, it often has minimal effect on participant response, and no large steps need to be taken to mitigate it.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clancy|first1=Kevin|last2=Gove|first2=Walter|title=Sex Differences in Mental Illness: An Analysis of Response Bias in Self-Reports|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1974|volume=80|issue=1|pages=205–216|jstor=2776967|doi=10.1086/225767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976"&gt;Campbell, A. Converse, P. Rodgers; 1976. [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_QWAwAAQBAJ ''The Quality of American Life: Perceptions, Evaluations and Satisfaction.''] New York: Russell Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers hold that although there is significant literature identifying response bias as influencing the responses of study participants, these studies do not in fact provide [[empirical evidence]] that this is the case.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; They subscribe to the idea that the effects of this bias wash out with large enough samples, and that it is not a systematic problem in [[mental health]] research.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt; These studies also call into question earlier research that investigated response bias on the basis of their [[List of psychological research methods|research methodologies]]. For example, they mention that many of the studies had very small [[Sample (statistics)|sample sizes]], or that in studies looking at [[Social desirability bias|social desirability]], a subtype of response bias, the researchers had no way to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the desirability of the statements used in the study.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; Additionally, some have argued that what researchers may believe to be artifacts of response bias, such as differences in responding between men and women, may in fact be actual differences between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt; Several other studies also found evidence that response bias is not as big of a problem as it may seem. The first found that when comparing the responses of participants, with and without controls for response bias, their answers to the surveys were not [[Statistical significance|different]].&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt; Two other studies found that although the bias may be present, the effects are extremely small, having little to no impact towards dramatically changing or altering the responses of participants.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gove 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0037-7856(76)90118-9|title=Response bias in community surveys of mental health: Systematic bias or random noise?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=10|issue=9–10|pages=497–502|year=1976|last1=Gove|first1=Walter R.|last2=McCorkel|first2=James|last3=Fain|first3=Terry|last4=Hughes|first4=Michael D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group argues against Hyman's point, saying that response bias has a significant effect, and that researchers need to take steps to reduce response bias in order to conduct sound research.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; They argue that the impact of response bias is a [[systematic error]] inherent to this type of research and that it needs to be addressed in order for studies to be able to produce accurate results. In psychology, there are many studies exploring the impact of response bias in many different settings and with many different [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]]. For example, some studies have found effects of response bias in the reporting of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] in elderly patients.&lt;ref name="Knauper 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-3956(94)90026-4|pmid=7932277|title=Diagnosing major depression in the elderly: Evidence for response bias in standardized diagnostic interviews?|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=28|issue=2|pages=147–164|year=1994|last1=Knäuper|first1=Bärbel|last2=Wittchen|first2=Hans-Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that there are serious issues when responses to a given survey or questionnaire have responses that may seem desirable or undesirable to report, and that a person's responses to certain questions can be biased by their culture.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0022022104264122|title=Standardization to Account for Cross-Cultural Response Bias: A Classification of Score Adjustment Procedures and Review of Research in JCCP|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=263–282 |year=2004|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is support for the idea that simply being part of an experiment can have dramatic effects on how participants act, thus biasing anything that they may do in a research or experimental setting when it comes to self-reporting.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; One of the most influential studies was one which found that social desirability bias, a type of response bias, can account for as much as 10–70% of the [[variance]] in participant response.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Essentially, because of several findings that illustrate the dramatic effects response bias has on the outcomes of self-report research, this side supports the idea that steps need to be taken to mitigate the effects of response bias to maintain the accuracy of research.

While both sides have support in the literature, there appears to be greater empirical support for the significance of response bias.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jclp.21946|pmid=23349082|title=The Influence of Demand Characteristics and Social Desirability on Clients' Ratings of the Therapeutic Alliance|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=69|issue=7|pages=696–709|year=2013|last1=Reese|first1=Robert J.|last2=Gillaspy|first2=J. Arthur|last3=Owen|first3=Jesse J.|last4=Flora|first4=Kevin L.|last5=Cunningham|first5=Linda C.|last6=Archie|first6=Danielle|last7=Marsden|first7=Troymichael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronbach"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0054677|title=Studies of acquiescence as a factor in the true-false test|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=33|issue=6|pages=401–415|year=1942|last1=Cronbach|first1=L. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add strength to the claims of those who argue the importance of response bias, many of the studies that reject the significance of response bias report multiple methodological issues in their studies. For example, they have extremely small samples that are not representative of the population as a whole, they only considered a small subset of potential variables that could be affected by response bias, and their measurements were conducted over the phone with poorly worded statements.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt;

==Types==

===Acquiescence bias===
{{Main|Acquiescence bias}}

Acquiescence bias, which is also referred to as "yea-saying", is a category of response bias in which respondents to a [[Sample survey|survey]] have a tendency to agree with all the questions in a [[Psychological testing|measure]].&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0049124192021001003|title=Correcting for Acquiescent Response Bias in the Absence of a Balanced Scale: An Application to Class Consciousness|journal=Sociological Methods &amp; Research|volume=21|pages=52–88|year=1992|last1=Watson|first1=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychlopedia"&gt;[http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=154 Moss, Simon. (2008).  Acquiescence bias]&lt;/ref&gt; This bias in responding may represent a form of dishonest reporting because the participant automatically endorses any statements, even if the result is contradictory responses.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2180|title=Acquiescent Responding in Self-Reports: Cognitive Style or Social Concern?|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=31|issue=2|pages=293–301|year=1997|last1=Knowles|first1=Eric S.|last2=Nathan|first2=Kobi T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2008.01.010|title=Are acquiescent and extreme response styles related to low intelligence and education?|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=44|issue=7|pages=1539–1550|year=2008|last1=Meisenberg|first1=Gerhard|last2=Williams|first2=Amandy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[Research participant|participant]] could be asked whether they endorse the following statement, "I prefer to spend time with others" but then later on in the survey also endorses "I prefer to spend time alone," which are contradictory statements. This is a distinct problem for self-report research because it does not allow a researcher to understand or gather accurate data from any type of question that asks for a participant to endorse or reject statements.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"/&gt; Researchers have approached this issue by thinking about the bias in two different ways. The first deals with the idea that participants are trying to be agreeable, in order to avoid the disapproval of the researcher.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"/&gt; A second cause for this type of bias was proposed by [[Lee Cronbach]], when he argued that it is likely due to a problem in the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] of the participant, instead of the motivation to please the researcher.&lt;ref name="Cronbach"/&gt; He argues that it may be due to biases in memory where an individual recalls information that supports endorsement of the statement, and ignores contradicting information.&lt;ref name="Cronbach"/&gt;

Researchers have several methods to try and reduce this form of bias. Primarily, they attempt to make balanced response sets in a given measure, meaning that there are a balanced number of positively and negatively worded questions.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879|pmid=14516251|title=Common method biases in behavioral research: A critical review of the literature and recommended remedies|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=88|issue=5|pages=879–903|year=2003|last1=Podsakoff|first1=Philip M.|last2=MacKenzie|first2=Scott B.|last3=Lee|first3=Jeong-Yeon|last4=Podsakoff|first4=Nathan P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if a researcher was hoping to examine a certain trait with a given questionnaire, half of the questions would have a "yes" response to identify the trait, and the other half would have a "no" response to identify the trait.&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"/&gt;

Nay-saying is the opposite form of this bias. It occurs when a participant always chooses to deny or not endorse any statements in a survey or measure. This has a similar effect of invalidating any kinds of endorsements that participants may make over the course of the experiment.

===Demand characteristics===
{{Main|Demand characteristics}}

Demand characteristics refer to a type of response bias where participants alter their response or behavior simply because they are part of an experiment.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; This arises because participants are actively engaged in the experiment, and may try and figure out the purpose, or adopt certain [[Human behavior|behaviors]] they believe belong in an experimental setting. [[Martin Orne]] was one of the first to identify this type of bias, and has developed several theories to address their cause.&lt;ref&gt;Orne, Martin T. Demand Characteristics and the concept of Quasi-Controls. in [https://books.google.com/books?id=CBAYztKB-D0C&amp;pg=PA110 Artifacts in Behavioral Research: Robert Rosenthal and Ralph L. Rosnow's Classic Books, beginning with page 110]&lt;/ref&gt; His research points to the idea that participants enter a certain type of social interaction when engaging in an experiment, and this special social interaction drives participants to [[Consciousness|consciously]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] alter their behaviors&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; There are several ways that this bias can influence participants and their responses in an experimental setting. One of the most common relates to the motivations of the participant. Many people choose to volunteer to be in studies because they believe that experiments are important. This drives participants to be "good subjects" and fulfill their role in the experiment properly, because they believe that their proper participation is vital to the success of the study.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3200/GENP.135.2.151-166|pmid=18507315|title=The Good-Subject Effect: Investigating Participant Demand Characteristics|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|volume=135|issue=2|pages=151–165|year=2008|last1=Nichols|first1=Austin Lee|last2=Maner|first2=Jon K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in an attempt to productively participate, the subject may try to gain knowledge of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment and alter their behavior in an attempt to support that [[hypothesis]]. Orne conceptualized this change by saying that the experiment may appear to a participant as a problem, and it is his or her job to find the solution to that problem, which would be behaving in a way that would lend support to the experimenter's hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; Alternatively, a participant may try to discover the hypothesis simply to provide faulty information and wreck the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt; Both of these results are harmful because they prevent the experimenters from gathering accurate data and making sound conclusions.

Outside of participant motivation, there are other factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study. Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself. For example, participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Nonverbal communication|mannerisms]] of the experimenter, such as the way they greet the participant, or the way they interact with the participant during the course of the experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook 1970" /&gt; Also, prior experiences of being in an experiment, or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook 1970" /&gt; Outside of an experiment, these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their [[Mental health professional|therapist]].&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt; Many of the ways therapists go about collecting client feedback involve self-reporting measures, which can be highly influenced by response bias.&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt; Participants may be biased if they fill out these measure in front of their therapist, or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working.&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt; In this case, the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients, and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need.&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt;  All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses of participants, driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset, which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;

While demand characteristics cannot be completely removed from an experiment, there are steps that researchers can take to minimize the impact they may have on the results.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; One way to mitigate response bias is to use deception to prevent the participant from discovering the true hypothesis of the experiment&lt;ref name="Cook 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0028849|title=Demand characteristics and three conceptions of the frequently deceived subject|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=185–194|year=1970|last1=Cook|first1=Thomas D.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Debriefing|debrief]] the participants.&lt;ref name="Cook 1970"/&gt; For example, research has demonstrated that repeated deception and debriefing is useful in preventing participants from becoming familiar with the experiment, and that participants do not significantly alter their behaviors after being deceived and debriefed multiple times.&lt;ref name="Cook 1970"/&gt; Another way that researchers attempt to reduce demand characteristics is by being as [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutral]] as possible, or training those conducting the experiment to be as neutral as possible.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt; For example, studies show that extensive one-on-one contact between the experimenter and the participant makes it more difficult to be neutral, and go on to suggest that this type of interaction should be limited when designing an experiment.&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt; Another way to prevent demand characteristics is to use [[Blind experiment|blinded]] experiments with [[placebo]]s or [[Treatment and control groups|control groups]].&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"/&gt; This prevents the experimenter from biasing the participant, because the researcher does not know in which way the participant should respond. Although not perfect, these methods can significantly reduce the effect of demand characteristics on a study, thus making the conclusions drawn from the experiment more likely to accurately reflect what they were intended to measure.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt;

===Extreme responding===

Extreme responding is a form of response bias that drives respondents to only select the most extreme options or answers available.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; For example, in a survey utilizing a [[Likert scale]] with potential responses ranging from one to five, the respondent may only give answers as ones or fives. Another example is if the participant only answered questionnaires with "strongly agree" or "strongly disagree" in a survey with that type of response style. There are several reasons for why this bias may take hold in a group of participants. One example ties the development of this type of bias in respondents to their cultural identity.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; This explanation states that people from certain cultures are more likely to respond in an extreme manner as compared to others. For example, research has found that those from the Middle East and Latin America are more prone to be affected by extremity response, whereas those from East Asia and Western Europe are less likely to be affected.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; A second explanation for this type of response bias relates to the education level of the participants.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; Research has indicated that those with lower intelligence, measured by an analysis of [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] and school achievement, are more likely to be affected by extremity response.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt;  Another way that this bias can be introduced is through the wording of questions in a survey or questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; Certain topics or the wording of a question may drive participants to respond in an extreme manner, especially if it relates to the motivations or beliefs of the participant.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;

The opposite of this bias occurs when participants only select intermediate or mild responses as answers.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; 

=== Question order bias ===
Question order bias, or "order effects bias", is a type of response bias where a respondent may react differently to questions based on the order in which questions appear in a survey or interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blankenship, A. . Journal Of Marketing, 6(4), 66-75.|first=Albert|date=April 1942|title=PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES IN MEASURING CONSUMER PREFERENCE|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume= 6| issue = 4, p66-75|pages=9|via=Business Source Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Question order bias is different from "response order bias" that addresses specifically the order of the set of responses within a survey question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ISRAEL and TAYLOR|first=GLENN D. and C.L.|date=1990|title=Can Response Order Bias Evaluations?|url=|journal=Evaluation and Program Planning|volume=v13 n4 p365-71|pages=7|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways that questionnaire items that appear earlier in a survey can affect responses to later questions. One way is when a question creates a "norm of reciprocity or fairness" as identified in the 1950 work of Herbert Hyman and Paul Sheatsley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyman and Sheatsley|first=Herbert Hiram and P. B.|date=1950|title=Current status of American Public Opnion|url=|journal=National Council for the Social Studies Yearbook|volume= 1950, p11-34|pages=24|via=Education Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research they asked two questions. One was asked on whether the United States should allow reporters from communist countries to come to the U.S. and send back news as they saw it; and another question was asked on whether a communist country like Russia should let American newspaper reporters come in and send back news as they saw it to America. In the study, the percentage of “yes” responses to the question allowing communist reporters increased by 37 percentage points depending on the order. Similarly results for the American reporters item increased by 24 percentage points. When either of the items was asked second, the context for the item was changed as a result of the answer to the first, and the responses to the second were more in line with what would be considered fair, based on the previous response.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods|last=Lavrakas|first=Paul J.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|year=2008|isbn=9781412918084|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=664–665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to alter the response towards questions based on order depends on the framing of the question. If a respondent is first asked about their general interest in a subject their response interest may be higher than if they are first posed technical or knowledge based questions about a subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Part-whole contrast effect is yet another ordering effect. When general and specific questions are asked in different orders, results for the specific item are generally unaffected, whereas those for the general item can change significantly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Question order biases occur primarily in survey or questionnaire settings. Some strategies to limit the effects of question order bias include randomization, grouping questions by topic to unfold in a logical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/questionnaire-design/|title=Questionnaire design|date=2015-01-29|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social desirability bias===
{{Main|Social desirability bias}}

Social desirability bias is a type of response bias that influences a participant to deny undesirable traits, and ascribe to themselves traits that are socially desirable.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; In essence, it is a bias that drives an individual to answer in a way that makes them look more favorable to the experimenter.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; This bias can take many forms. Some individuals may over-report good behavior, while others may under-report bad, or undesirable behavior.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; A critical aspect of how this bias can come to affect the responses of participants relates to the norms of the society in which the research is taking place.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; For example, social desirability bias could play a large role if conducting research about an individual's tendency to use drugs. Those in a community where drug use is seen as acceptable or popular may exaggerate their own drug use, whereas those from a community where drug use is looked down upon may choose to under-report their own use. This type of bias is much more prevalent in questions that draw on a subject's opinion, like when asking a participant to evaluate or rate something, because there generally is not one correct answer, and the respondent has multiple ways they could answer the question.&lt;ref name="Kalton"/&gt; Overall, this bias can be very problematic for self-report researchers, especially if the topic they are looking at is controversial.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; The distortions created by respondents answering in a socially desirable manner can have profound effects on the validity of self-report research.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Without being able to control for or deal with this bias, researchers are unable to determine if the effects they are measuring are due to individual differences, or from a desire to [[Conformity|conform to the societal norms]] present in the population they are studying. Therefore, researchers strive to employ strategies aimed at mitigating social desirability bias so that they can draw valid conclusions from their research.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;

Several strategies exist to limit the effect of social desirability bias. In 1985, Anton Nederhof compiled a list of techniques and methodological strategies for researchers to use to mitigate the effects of social desirability bias in their studies.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Most of these strategies involve deceiving the subject, or are related to the way questions in surveys and questionnaires are presented to those in a study. A condensed list of seven of the strategies are listed below:
*'''Ballot-box method''': This method allows a subject to anonymously self-complete a questionnaire and submit it to a locked "ballot box", thereby concealing their responses from an interviewer and affording the participant an additional layer of assured concealment from perceived social repercussion&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bova, C., Aswani, S., Farthing, M., Potts, W.|first=|date=2018|title=Limitations of the Random Response Technique and a Call to Implement the Ballot Box Method for Estimating Angler Compliance Using Surveys|url=|journal=Fisheries Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''Forced-choice items''': This technique hopes to generate questions that are equal in desirability to prevent a socially desirable response in one direction or another.&lt;ref name="Nederhof" /&gt;
*'''Neutral questions''': The goal of this strategy is to use questions that are rated as neutral by a wide range of participants so that socially desirable responding does not apply.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Randomized response technique''': This technique allows participants to answer a question that is randomly selected from a set of questions. The researcher in this technique does not know which question the subject responds to, so subjects are more likely to answer truthfully. Researchers can then use statistics to interpret the anonymous data.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Self-administered questionnaires''': This strategy involves isolating the participant before they begin answering the survey or questionnaire to hopefully remove any social cues the researcher may present to the participant.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Bogus-pipeline''': This technique involves a form of deception, where researchers convince a subject through a series of rigged demonstrations that a machine can accurately determine if a participant is being truthful when responding to certain questions. After the participant completes the survey or questionnaire, they are debriefed. This is a rare technique, and does not see much use because of the cost, time commitment and because it is a one-use only technique for each participant.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Selection interviewers''': This strategy allows participants to select the person or persons who will be conducting the interview or presiding over the experiment. This, in the hope that with a higher degree of rapport, subjects will be more likely to answer honestly.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Proxy subjects''': Instead of asking a person directly, this strategy questions someone who is close to or knows the target individual well. This technique is generally limited to questions about behavior, and is not adequate for asking about attitudes or beliefs.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;

The degree of effectiveness for each of these techniques or strategies differs depending on the situation and the question asked.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; In order to be the most successful in reducing social desirability bias in a wide range of situations, it has been suggested that researchers utilize a combination of these techniques to have the best chance at mitigating the effects of social desirability bias.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Validations are not made on a "more is better" assumption (higher stated prevalence of the behavior of interest) when selecting the best method for reducing SDB as this is a "weak validation" that does not always guarantee the best results. Instead, ground "truthed" comparisons of observed data to stated data should reveal the most accurate method&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

==Related terminology==

*[[Non-response bias]] is not the opposite of response bias and is not a type of cognitive bias: it occurs in a [[statistical survey]] if those who respond to the survey differ in the outcome variable.
*[[Response rate (survey)|Response rate]] is not a cognitive bias, but rather refers to a ratio of those who complete the survey and those who do not.

==Highly vulnerable areas==

Some areas or topics that are highly vulnerable to the various types of response bias include:
*alcoholism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1987.48.410|pmid=3312821|title=Verbal report methods in clinical research on alcoholism: Response bias and its minimization|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=48|issue=5|pages=410–424|year=1987|last1=Babor|first1=T F|last2=Stephens|first2=R S|last3=Marlatt|first3=G A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1993.54.334|pmid=8487543|title=Validity and reliability of self-reported drinking behavior: Dealing with the problem of response bias|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=54|issue=3|pages=334–344|year=1993|last1=Embree|first1=B G|last2=Whitehead|first2=P C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roll-Off.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A roll-off being placed by a roll-off truck.]]

In North America, a '''roll-off''' is a usually open top [[dumpster]] characterized by a rectangular footprint, utilizing wheels to facilitate rolling the dumpster in place.  The container is designed to be transported by special roll-off trucks. Roll-offs are commonly used to contain loads of [[construction and demolition waste]] or other [[waste types]]. While most roll-off containers have a swinging door on the end for easier disposal of waste, some roll-off containers are not open top and are used with commercial or industrial [[trash compactor]]s.

Construction debris may originate from a [[building]] site where something is being built, [[renovation|renovated]], or [[demolition|demolished]]. Roll-off dumpsters are also used for various jobs that need much material to be taken away. The material in the roll-off may be taken to a [[landfill]], [[recycling|recycled]] or disposed/recovered of in some other [[List of solid waste treatment technologies|way]].

== Size ==
Roll-off containers have a rectangular footprint typically determined by the size of typical trucks.  Roll-off container sizes are determined by the amount of debris they can hold, measured in cubic yards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nislybrothers.com/roll-off-dumpster-rental-tips/|title=Roll-Off Dumpster Rental Tips: Choosing Your Dumpster Size and More|website=nislybrothers.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Typical container sizes in the United States are 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 cubic yards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bgm.stanford.edu/pssi_roll-off_boxes | title=Roll-Off Box Sizes | publisher=Stanford Buildings &amp; Grounds Maintenance | accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2-40 cubic meters in other nations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.truckworld.com.au/Blogs/Waste-Truck-Collection-Systems | title=Waste Truck Collection Systems | publisher=TruckWorld.com.au | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the roll-offs may be rented by volume, there may be weight limitations.  Weight limits may be necessary to ensure compliance with road-use and safety laws and regulations.

Most roll-off providers will have a weight limit for each container size.  Containers loaded with more weight than allowed typically result in an overage charge.  The maximum weight is specified at the beginning of the job.  In cases where the material to be disposed of is especially dense, such as concrete, a container with lower sidewalls is used, to help reduce the risk of exceeding the weight limit.

== Operation ==
After the container is picked up, it is taken to a disposal facility where it is weighed before (gross) and after (tare) dumping. The difference is the net weight, and is used to calculate charges to the customer. In order to save time, some facilities pre-record weights of trucks and containers. This allows the tare weight to be looked up and eliminates the need for a second weighing.

Roll-offs are placed by roll-off [[truck]]s.  As the roll-off truck raises its hydraulically operated bed, the roll-off container rolls off the bed. A cable is used to slowly lower the container. After the waste container is loaded, the roll-off truck pulls the filled container onto the roll-off truck by using a cable and winch system. If the roll-off truck is not a winch system, then it is most likely a hook-lift system. A hook-lift system works by the truck extending a 90 degree arm with a hook on the end which hooks under a bar and gently lifts the dumpster onto the truck. Most hook-lift systems are on smaller roll-off trucks as they are usually used for 20 yard containers and under. These smaller systems are usually the preferred option on smaller scale construction jobs such as roof replacement, kitchen remodels, and garage clean-outs. Smaller single-axle trucks are generally viewed as safer operations as they are much lighter and more easily transported in residential areas.  When being carried, the roll-off must be covered.

== Disadvantages ==
One problem often encountered with roll-off containers is the liability of scratching or damaging the surface they are placed on. Most roll-off containers have metal rollers for wheels, which can at times scratch or be abrasive to a concrete or asphalt surface. It is recommended to place a protective board such as [[plywood]] under the container to avoid a situation where the placement surface can be damaged. Most roll-off companies do not offer plywood, but will place the container on the wood if supplied.  The roll-off must be placed on a hard surface other than dirt.  Gravel, asphalt, and concrete are all acceptable.  If the container is placed on dirt, the wheels may sink after a rainfall event and the truck could get stuck.

There are many items that are not accepted by roll-off rental companies.  These items include but are not limited to chemicals, including paint and petroleum products, tires, and electronics.  The prohibition of items is often to comply with laws and regulations concerning disposal of hazardous materials. Roll-off drivers may refuse to pickup loads containing prohibited materials. If the load is picked up, the roll-off rental company may charge the customer additional for cleaning the load and proper handling of the contaminating material.

== Legal issues ==
Some [[Municipality|municipalities]] require that a [[License|permit]] be obtained in order to have a roll-off dumpster delivered.  If the container is being set on [[private property]], most cities will not require a permit.  Some municipalities require the permit to be obtained by the customer, while others require the permit to be obtained by the roll-off provider. However, many cities do not require permits to have a dumpster delivered.

There are usually prohibited items that are commonly not allowed for disposal, such as hazardous materials, tires, freon appliances, televisions, paint, asbestos, batteries, oils, fuels, and tar-treated railroad ties because of reulations affecting final waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dec.vermont.gov/waste-management/solid/materials-mgmt/trash/|publisher=State of Vermont|date=2018|access-date=15 November 2018|title=Items banned from disposal in the State of Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1262">A '''''roman à tiroirs''''' (French for "novel with/made of drawers") is a French term for a novel in which the principal or main [[narrative]] (or "[[frame story]]") is interrupted by secondary narratives (involving secondary characters and/or told by other narrators), which may in turn themselves be interrupted by further narratives/narrators.  As such, it is a form of the "[[story within a story]]" [[literary device]] in which the fiction is nested in two or more layers and where the resolution of the main narrative is delayed because of the inserted secondary tales/stories.  In French, the embedded narratives are referred to as ''récits enchâssés'' or ''récits emboités''.

The expression "à tiroirs" as applied to a work of literature dates from 1752, and appears to have been used originally in reference to theater and plays (a "pièce à tiroirs" or "comédie à tiroirs").&lt;ref&gt;''"Romans à tiroirs" d'hier et d'aujourd'hui: Parodie et experimentation romanesque."''

'''Samuel George Morton''' (January 26, 1799 – May 15, 1851) was an American physician and [[natural scientist]]. Morton, who was reared a Quaker but became Episcopalian in midlife, was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, attended [[Westtown School]], and graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penn.museum/sites/morton/life.php&lt;/ref&gt; After earning an advanced degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland, he began practice in Philadelphia in 1824.

Morton was a prolific writer of books on various subjects from 1823 to 1851. He wrote ''Geological Observations'' in 1828, and both ''Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the Cretaceous Group of the United States'' and ''Illustrations of Pulmonary Consumption'' in 1834. His first medical essay, on the user of cornine in intermittent fever, in 1825 was published in the ''[[Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introductory lectures and addresses on medical subjects : delivered chiefly before the medical classes of the University of Pennsylvania / by George B.

=="American School" ethnography==
Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of "American School" [[ethnography]], a school of thought in [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of [[species]] rather than [[Variety (biology)|variety]] and is seen by some as the origin of [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fredrickson |first=George M. |title=The Black Image in the White Mind: The Debate on African-American Character and Destiny, 1817–1914 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Torchbooks |year=1972 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton argued against the single creation story of the Bible ([[monogenism]]) and instead supported a theory of multiple racial creations ([[polygenism]]). Morton claimed the Bible supported polygenism, and within working in a biblical framework his theory held that each race had been created separately and each was given specific, irrevocable characteristics.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"&gt;David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity, 2001, pp. 38 – 41&lt;/ref&gt;

After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the Bible indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]], only a thousand years ago before this, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"/&gt;

Morton claimed that he could define the intellectual ability of a race by the [[Human skull|skull]] capacity. A large volume meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. He was reputed to hold the largest collection of skulls, on which he based his research. He claimed that each race had a separate origin, and that a descending order of intelligence could be discerned that placed [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] at the pinnacle and [[Negroes]] at the lowest point, with various other race groups in between.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt; Morton had many skulls from ancient Egypt, and concluded that the [[ancient Egyptians]] were not [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], but were Caucasian. His results were published in three volumes between 1839 and 1849: the ''Crania Americana'', ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca''.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt; Morton's skull collection was held at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia until 1966, when it was transferred to the Penn Museum, where it is presently curated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penn.museum/sites/morton/collection.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's theories were very popular in his day, and he was a highly respected physician and scientist. The anthropologist [[Aleš Hrdlička]] called Morton "the father of American physical anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;Clark Spencer Larsen, A Companion to Biological Anthropology, 2010, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Crispin Bates has noted that Morton's "systematic justification" for the separation of races, along with the work of [[Louis Agassiz]], was also used by those who favoured slavery in the United States, with the ''[[Charleston Medical Journal]]'' noting at his death that "We of the South should consider him as our benefactor for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race."&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concept of Race in South Asia |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |year=1995 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Robb |first=Crispin |last=Bates |chapter=Race, Caste and Tribe in Central India: the early origins of Indian anthropometry |isbn=978-0-19-563767-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNkQgAACAAJ |page=225 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craniology===
[[File:Morton-Frontispiece-Types-of-Mankind.jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving of Morton from the frontispiece to ''Types of Mankind'' by Nott and Gliddon]]
Morton claimed in his ''Crania Americana'' that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches (1,426 cc), Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches (1,344 cc) and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches (1,278 cc).&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38"/&gt; Morton believed that the skulls of each race were so different that a wise creator from the beginning had created each race and positioned them in separate homelands to dwell in.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, 2005, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton believed that cranial capacity determined intellectual ability, and he used his craniometric evidence in conjunction with his analysis of anthropological literature then available to argue in favor of a racial hierarchy which put Caucasians on the top rung and Africans on the bottom. His skull measurements (by volume) then came to serve as "evidence" for racial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://canada.metropolis.net/EVENTS/ethnocultural/publications/historical.pdf | title=The Historical Construction of Racial Identity and Implications for Reconciliation | year=2001 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 | author=Backhouse, Constance | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131195914/http://canada.metropolis.net/EVENTS/ethnocultural/publications/historical.pdf | archivedate=January 31, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the Caucasian as "distinguished by the facility with which it attains the highest intellectual endowments"; Native Americans were described as "averse to cultivation, and slow in acquiring knowledge; restless, revengeful, and fond of war, and wholly destitute of maritime adventure" and the Africans he described as "joyous, flexible, and indolent; while the many nations which compose this race present a singular diversity of intellectual character, of which the far extreme is the lowest grade of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Menand, L. (2001). Morton, Agassiz, and the origins of scientific racism in the United States. Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, 110-113.  Even in his time, some physicians opposed the idea that there were differences in average cranial size across races.  The German physician [[Friedrich Tiedemann]], for instance, argued vigorously that previous scholars who found differences in cranial size across races were wrong in their measurements (or in some cases had too small a sample to draw inferences). Tiedemann advanced this in 1838 in his paper [http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/126/497.full.pdf On the Brain of the Negro Compared with that of the European and the Ourang-Outang.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton's followers, particularly [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]] in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and backed up his findings which supported the notion of [[polygenism]] – the premise that the different races were separately created by God. The publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 changed the nature of the scholarly debate.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p225 /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Allegations of bias in data collection===
In a 1978 paper&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1978). [http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB4234/readings/Morton-Skulls-Gould.pdf "Morton's Ranking of Races by Cranial Capacity."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618000422/http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/MCDB4234/readings/Morton-Skulls-Gould.pdf |date=2011-06-18 }} ''Science'' 200 (May 5): 503–509.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), [[Stephen Jay Gould]] asserted that Morton had, perhaps because of an unconscious bias, selectively reported data, manipulated sample compositions, made analytical errors, and mismeasured skulls in order to support his prejudicial views on [[Race and intelligence|intelligence differences]] between different populations. Gould's book became widely read and Morton came to be considered one of the main cases of the effects of unconscious bias in data collection, and as one of the main figures in the early history of scientific racism.

Subsequently, two separate studies of Morton's data and methods, one conducted in 1988 and the other in 2011, argued that Gould had overstated or misrepresented the case, and that Morton's measurement's were essentially correct.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Nicholas (2011). [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/science/14skull.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science "Scientists Measure the Accuracy of a Racism Claim."] ''The New York Times'' (June 14): D4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter study, entitled "The Mismeasure of Science: Stephen Jay Gould versus Samuel George Morton on Skulls and Bias"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, J., D. DeGusta, M. Meyer, J. Monge, A. Mann, and R. Holloway (2011). [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001071 "The Mismeasure of Science."] ''Public Library of Science Biology'' 9 (6): e1001071.&lt;/ref&gt; and authored by six [[anthropology|anthropologists]], it was concluded that the bias came from Gould, who failed to examine and remeasure the crania in order to determine Morton's level of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Morton collection of skulls at center of controversy. June 16, 2011.  http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-06-samuel-morton-skulls-center-controversy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this study was reviewed in an editorial in ''Nature'', which recommended a degree of caution, stating "the critique leaves the majority of Gould's work unscathed," and noted that "because they couldn't measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately."&lt;ref name="Nature2011"&gt;Editorial (2011). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7352/full/474419a.html "Mismeasure for mismeasure."] ''Nature'' 474 (23 June): 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal stated that Gould's opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton's data, but also noted that "Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias" and did not accept Gould's theory "that the scientific method is inevitably tainted by bias."&lt;ref name="Nature2011"/&gt;

A 2014 review of the paper by University of Pennsylvania philosophy professor Michael Weisberg, tended to support Gould's original accusations, concluding that "there is prima facie evidence of a racial bias in Morton's measurements". Weisberg concludes that although Gould did commit mistakes in his own treatment, Morton's work "remains a cautionary example of racial bias in the science of human differences".&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, M. (2014), Remeasuring man. Evolution &amp; Development, 16: 166–178. doi: 10.1111/ede.12077&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biases in Data Interpretation===

Research by Paul Wolff Mitchell in 2018 argues that Morton was nevertheless guilty of bias, though not in data collection. Mitchell argues that Morton's interpretation of his data was erroneous; he investigated averages and ignored variations in skull size so large that there was significant overlap. A contemporary of Morton, Friedrich Tiedemann, had collected similar skull data and drawn conclusions opposite to Morton's on the basis of this overlap.   &lt;ref&gt; Ars Technica [https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/theres-new-evidence-confirming-bias-of-the-father-of-scientific-racism/ "There’s new evidence confirming bias of the “father of scientific racism”]&lt;\ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9632">'''Stock-Flow Consistent''' (SFC) models are a family of macroeconomic models based on a rigorous accounting framework, which guarantees a correct and comprehensive integration of all the flows and the stocks of an economy. These models were first developed in the mid-20th century but have recently become popular, particularly within the [[post-Keynesian]] school of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Caverzasi, E., &amp; Godin, A. (2014). Post-Keynesian stock-flow-consistent modelling: a survey. Cambridge Journal of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The accounting framework behind stock flow consistent macroeconomic modelling can be traced back to [[Morris Copeland]]'s development of [[flow of funds]] analysis back in 1949.&lt;ref name="CavGod" /&gt; Copeland wanted to understand where the money to finance increases in [[Gross National Product]] came from, and what happened to unspent money if GNP declined.&lt;ref name="CavGod"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caverzasi|first1=Eugenio|last2=Godin|first2=Antoine|title=Stock Flow Consistent Modeling Through the Ages|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_745.pdf|publisher=Levy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a set of tables to show the relationship between flows of income and expenditure and changes to the stocks of outstanding debt and financial assets held in the US economy.

[[James Tobin]] and his collaborators used features of stock flow consistent modelling including the social accounting matrix and discrete time to develop a macroeconomic model that integrated financial and non-financial variables.&lt;ref name="CavGod"/&gt; He outlined the following distinguishing features of his approach in his Nobel lecture &lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1981/tobin-lecture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Modelling changes between discrete short-run time periods rather than a long run equilibrium
# Tracking changes in stocks of assets held by different groups
# Multiple assets with different rates of return, 
# Modelling of monetary policy operations
# Subjecting the demand functions to "adding up constraints"

The current SFC models mainly emerged from the separate economic tradition of the [[Post Keynesians]], [[Wynne Godley]] being the most famous contributor in this regard.&lt;ref name="CavGod" /&gt; Godley argued in favour of wider adoption of stock flow consistent methods, expressing the view that they would improve the transparency and logical coherence  of most macro models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes on the Stock Flow Consistent Approach to Macroeconomic Modeling|url=http://www.ipc-undp.org/publications/srp/Notes%20on%20the%20Stock-Flow%20Consistent%20Approach%20to%20Macroeconomic%20Modeling.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2014|author=C.H. Dos Santos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current researchers in the SFC approach to macroeconomic modelling are based in [[University of Limerick]], [[Levy Economics Institute]] and [[University of Oxford]].

==Structure of the Models==
SFC models usually consist of two main components: an accounting part and a set of equations describing the laws of motion of the system. The consistency of the accounting is ensured by the use of three matrices: i) the aggregate balance sheets, with all the initial stocks, ii) the transaction flow, recording all the transactions taking places in the economy (e.g. consumption, interests payments); iii) the stock revaluation matrix, showing the changes in the stocks resulting from the transactions (the transaction flow and the stock revaluation matrix are often merged in the full integration matrix). 
The matrices are built respecting intuitive principles. Someone’s asset is someone else’s liability and someone’s inflow is someone else’s outflows. Furthermore, each sector and the economy as a whole must respect their budget constraint. No fund can come from (or end up) nowhere.

The second component of SFC models, the behavioural equations, include the main theoretical assumption of the model. Most of the papers in the existing literature are based on post-Keynesian theory. However, the behavioural equations are not restricted to a single school of thought.{{refn|group=nb|" “According to Gennaro Zezza the accounting consistency should be a requirement for all macro model. Models with post-Keynesian behavioural assumption should therefore be a sub class of macro model labelled stock-flow-consistent post-Keynesian models” &lt;ref&gt;Dos Santos, Claudio H. (2002). “Cambridge and Yale on Stock-Flow Consistent  Macroeconomic Modeling.” Department of Economics, New School University, New York&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
The comprehensive accounting framework has several advantages. Tracking all the monetary flows taking place in an economy and the way they accumulate, allows for a consistent integration of the real and the financial side of the economy (for a detailed discussion see Godley and Lavoie, 2007). Furthermore, as balance sheets are updated in any period, SFC models can be used to identify unsustainable processes, for example a prolonged deficit of a sector will result in an unsustainable stock of debt. These models were used by Wynne Godley in forecasting, showing promising results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/sa/sevenproc.pdf| author= Godley, W.|title=Seven Unsustainable Processes|publisher=Special Report|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover from a modelling perspective, the consistent accounting framework prevents the modellers from leaving "black holes" i.e., unexplained parts of the model.

The SFC are usually aggregated macroeconomic models and as such they incur all the disadvantages typical of this approach. For example, they explain little of what happens at microeconomic level. Furthermore, they often rely heavily on parameter values used by the modellers. A possible way to overcome these drawbacks is to combine these models with an [[agent-based model]] (ABM). A recent 'benchmark' model was developed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caiani|first=Alessandro|last2=Godin|first2=Antoine|last3=Caverzasi|first3=Eugenio|last4=Gallegati|first4=Mauro|last5=Kinsella|first5=Stephen|last6=Stiglitz|first6=Joseph E.|date=2016-06-06|title=Agent Based-Stock Flow Consistent Macroeconomics: Towards a Benchmark Model|ssrn=2664125|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Alessandro Caiani and colleagues.

==Example of SFC model==

===Flow of funds between sectors in a closed economy===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Households !! Firms !! Government !! Rest of the World !! '''∑'''
|-
| Consumption || -C || +C ||  ||  || '''0'''
|-
| Govt. Expenditures ||  || +G || -G ||  || '''0'''
|-
| '''[OUTPUT]''' ||  || '''[Y]''' ||  ||  || 
|-
| Wages || +W || -W ||  ||  || '''0'''
|-
| Taxes || -T ||  || +T ||  || '''0'''

| Changes in Money || -ΔH&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; ||  || +ΔH&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ||  || '''0'''
|-
| '''∑''' || '''0''' || '''0''' || '''0''' ||  || 
|}

The above table shows the [[flow of funds]] between different sectors for a closed economy with no explicit financial sector. The minus (-) sign in the table represents that the sector has paid out while the plus (+) sign indicates the receipts of that sector, e.g, -C for the household sector shows that the household has paid for their consumption whereas the counter party of this transaction is the firm which receives +C. This implies that the firms have received the payments from the households. Similarly, all the respective flows in the economy are reported in the flow of funds. More advanced SFC models consist of a financial sector including banks and is further extended to an [[open economy]] by introducing the Rest of World sector.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Introducing the financial sector enables in tracing the flow of loans between the sectors, which in turn helps in determining the level of debt every sector holds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} These models become more complicated as new sectors and [[assets]] are added to the system.

===The model structure===

Once the accounting framework is fulfilled then the structure of the model, based on [[stylized facts]], is defined. The set of equations in the model defines relationship between different [[variable (mathematics)|variables]], not determined by the accounting framework. The model structure basically helps in understanding how the flows are connected from a behavioral perspective or in simple words how the behavior of a sector affects the flow of funds in the system, e.g., the factors that affect the consumption (C) of the household is not clear from the flow of funds but can be explained by the model. The model structure with a set of equations for a simple [[closed economy]] is given by:

''Y = C + G''

''T = θY''

''YD = Y - T''

''C = α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; Y + α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;''

''ΔH&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = G - T''

''ΔH&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; = YD - C''

''H = ΔH + H&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;''

Y (Income), C (Consumption), G (Government Expenditures), T (Taxes), YD (Disposable Income), ΔH (Changes in stock of money) and θ is the tax rate on the income of household sector.
α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the household consumption out of disposable income.
α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the household consumption out of previous wealth.

The SFC models are solved in different ways depending on the aspect of research but in general initial values are assigned to the stocks and then the model is calibrated or estimated.

[[File:Capital temptation MNMA Cl18999.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Capital (architecture)|Capital]] representing scenes from the [[Book of Genesis]]: temptation of [[Adam and Eve]], [[Musée de Cluny]].]]
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Temptation (1880).png|thumb|right|220px|''Temptation'', by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]].]]

'''Temptation''' is a desire to engage in short-term urges for enjoyment, that threatens long-term goals.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Webb, J.R. (Sep 2014). Incorporating Spirituality into Psychology of temptation: Conceptualization, measurement, and clinical implications. Spirituality in Clinical Practice. 1.3. PP: 231-241&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the context of some [[religion]]s, temptation is the inclination to [[sin]]. Temptation also describes the coaxing or inducing a person into committing such an act, by [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] or otherwise of [[curiosity]], [[desire]] or [[fear]] of loss.

In the context of [[self-control]] and [[ego depletion]], temptation is described as an immediate, pleasurable urge and/or impulse that disrupts an individuals ability to wait for the long-term goals, in which that individual hopes to attain.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

More informally, temptation may be used to mean "the state of being attracted and enticed" without anything to do with moral, ethical, or ideological valuation; for example, one may say that a piece of food looks "tempting" even though eating it would result in no negative consequences.

Research suggests that there are paradoxical effects associated with temptation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Implicit in all the forms in which temptation can present itself there is a set of options that may facilitate high moral standards in decision-making. 
* Weak or subtle temptations, in comparison to strong or obvious temptations, can lead to a greater loss of self-control.
* supported research states that "available temptations are less valuable and less tempting".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Temptations can have effects on long-term goal attainment, it has been found that individuals who experienced temptation and the effects of it found there were benefits to their experiences.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Religious usage==
A research article was written by Vanchai Ariyabuddhiphongs, a professor at [[Bangkok University]], about the motivational and persuasive negative effects of such temptations such as money, that can push one to disregard religious beliefs whether it be [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] etc..  He says that when given an opportunity at a large amount of money we have a greater chance of harming, stealing, partaking in sexual misconduct, or abusing substances. This idea of money as a negative persuasion tactic in regards to the religions mentioned above, is psychologically proven to affect our cognitive ability to make decisions.  Vanchai's article talked solely on Buddhist practices but it is believed that it could be broadened to all beliefs.  Our religious beliefs may define who we are as  spiritual people, but this article described how an outside source can push those thoughts away and look to benefit us in a way that may include disregarding religion .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariyabuddhiphongs|first1=Vanchai|title=Money Consciousness and the Tendency to Violate the Five Precepts Among Thai Buddhists|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=2007|volume=17|issue=1|pages=37–45|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=db478a7e-04f2-46d8-ab35-1f3bd0e8c46a%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=48&amp;hid=117|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-religious usage==
Temptation is usually used in a loose sense to describe actions which indicate a lack of [[self control]]. Temptation is something that allures, excites, and seduces someone. Successful endeavors of goal-driven activity is threatened by the tempting nature of immediate pleasure &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Infatuation]] can also lead to temptation as someone might do something for ''love'' in spite of one's better [[judgement]].
 
In [[advertising]], temptation is a theme common to many of the [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] [[advertising#Techniques|techniques]] used to make products more attractive.

== Measuring temptation ==

Temptation is measured through indirect and implicit methods.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
Temptation could be measured using experimental [[Social construct|constructs]] of undesirable situations or through a 'self-report' outcome measure of problem behaviors, which leads to the full extent and process of the underlying conflict and the implications that are oftentimes overlooked.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Research has found that components of an assessment that would allow for an individual to precisely understand the influence of self-control and other potential or protective variables on the process, experience, and resolution of temptation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Expressions of temptation ==

Generally individuals experience temptations in both positive and negative terms. For example, there is an individual who may experience temptation in the form of fearing the potential negative implications and consequences that can arise, whether it is in the context of standards or accountability related to the self, society, and/or the [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], including [[Damnation|condemnation]] from one's conception of [[deity]], higher power, or sense of responsibility to the universe or nature.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Another example, an individual may view their experience of temptation as an opportunity for growth, it could be [[intrapersonal]] growth, [[interpersonal]] growth, and/or transcendent growth, which includes recognizing constructive and/or collaborative interactions with the transcendent.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In regards to Spiritual struggle, research argues that the struggle can be looked upon as a gift, as an opportunity for growth, and as a means to improve one's life.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Positive or negative religious coping and constructive or destructive emotions, "the valenced expression of temptation may lead to the salutary versus [[deleterious]] effects of temptation".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== The effects of temptation ==

There are valenced effects on a variety of outcomes from temptation. Such as the health and well-being of an individual. There is also the relief of stress that an individual may be experiencing.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, undesirable, "illicit, and/or transcendent conflicts underlying the successful or failed resolution of the experience of temptation will likely have facilitative or debilitative effects on [[myriad]] aspects of physical health, mental health, and well-being".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
An individuals experience with temptation may influence a person's future experiences, predict future possibilities, and outcomes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

When an individual is attempting to address or resolve a complex experience of temptation, including transcendent levels and potential negative and positive expressions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, "mindfulness, humility, prayer, [[meditation]], [[reframing]], resoluteness, determination,other spiritual and/or positive psychological variables may be facilitators or, or perhaps alternatives to, self-control as the primary arbiter of temptation".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Resisting temptation ==

[[Self-control]] is commonly used by an individual to resist temptation. [[B. F. Skinner]] stated 9 methods for achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Self-control#Skinner's|survey of techniques]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Self-control is considered by some to be a limited resource, which is depleted by use.&lt;ref&gt;Vohs KD, Baumeister RF, Schmeichel BJ, Twenge JM, Nelson NM, Tice DM; Baumeister; Schmeichel; Twenge; Nelson; Tice (May 2008). "Making choices impairs subsequent self-control: a limited-resource account of decision making, f-regulation, and active initiative" (PDF). J Pers Soc Psychol 94 (5): 883–98. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.94.5.883. {{PMID|18444745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some believe that self-control can be replenished and thus that the immediate effects of an individual's depleted self-control can be overcome, and that an individual must be able to identify the presence of a temptation (i.e., short-term desire) before self-control can affect an outcome.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4027">'''The man and the lion (disputing)''' is one of [[Aesop’s Fables]] and is numbered 284 in the [[Perry Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/284.htm  Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative title is '''The lion and the statue'''. The story’s moral is that the source of evidence should be examined before it is accepted.

==The fable==
A man and a lion dispute which of them is the superior. The man points to a statue of a lion being subdued by a man as his evidence. In the Greek version, the lion retorts that if lions could sculpt, they would show themselves as the victors, drawing the moral that honesty outweighs boasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/oxford/186.htm [[Aphthonius of Antioch|Aphthonius]], fable 34]&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions, the lion asks who made the statue and refuses to take it as evidence on learning that it was a man. In the late Latin version of [[Ademar of Chabannes]] the lion takes the man to an [[amphitheatre]] to demonstrate what happens in reality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/oxford/187.htm  Fable 52]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[William Caxton]] has the lion pounce on the man to make its point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/caxton/415.htm Fables 4.15]&lt;/ref&gt;  But Jefferys Taylor argues facetiously, at the end of his ''Aesop in Rhyme'' (1828), that it is the fact that lions cannot sculpt which is the true proof of their inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/aesopinrhymewith00tayliala#page/34 Fable XXIV]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages#High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] some accounts substituted a painting for a statue, and it was following these that [[La Fontaine's Fables|Jean de La Fontaine]] created his ''Le lion abattu par l'homme'' (The lion subdued by the man, III.10).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ruedesfables.net/le-lion-abattu-par-lhomme French text]&lt;/ref&gt; There a passing lion retorts to those admiring a hunting scene that if lions could paint the picture would be different. Later illustrators wove whimsical variations on this. [[Gustave Doré]] pictured the admirers of a statue in an art gallery in full flight before a bystanding lion. [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|Grandville]] pictured the lion with artists' implements engaged on his version of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/bmnstanislas/15421747208 Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Rabier]]'s comic publication paired a group of admiring connoisseurs with a pendant of a lion creating his own painting in the desert.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables de La Fontaine, illustrées par Benjamin Rabier'' (Paris 1906), [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65668792/f70.image p.62]&lt;/ref&gt;

In commenting on the story, [[Roger L'Estrange]] pointed out that “’Tis against the rules of common justice for men to be judges in their own case”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OE5AAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=statue&amp;f=false ''Fables of Aesop'' 240]&lt;/ref&gt; A later [[Feminism|feminist]] critique makes the same point,&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Ann Reid, ''Ovidian Bibliofictions and the Tudor Book: Metamorphosing Classical Heroines'', Routledge 2016, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=khM3DAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=leoun&amp;f=false ch.2]&lt;/ref&gt; citing [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]’s Wyf of Bath, who in defence of her sex  demanded “Who peyntede the leoun, tel me who?” and continued the fable’s moral in much the same terms as the lion there.&lt;ref&gt;G.

'''Theodor Fischer''' (1878–1957) was a Swiss [[art dealer]] and auctioneer in [[Lucerne]] who after the First World War built a highly successful firm of auctioneers that dominated the Swiss art market. In 1939 he was the auctioneer at the infamous Grand Hotel auction of "[[degenerate art]]" removed from German museums by the [[Nazis]]. During the Second World War he played a key part in the trading of art looted by the Germans from occupied countries.

==Early life==
Fischer was born in 1878. In his early career he was associated with the firm of [[Paul Cassirer]] of Berlin, with whom a joint auction was held in 1931 after Cassirer's death. He became a director of the Bosshard Gallery in Lucerne.&lt;ref name=fisch/&gt;

==Between the World Wars==
Fischer founded [[Galerie Fischer]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=fisch&gt;[http://www.fischerauktionen.ch/ueber/geschichte.aspx?l=en Portrait.] Fischer. Retrieved 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He later established a branch of the gallery in Berlin. He built up a large business in Lucerne between the wars and sold a number of important collections. He established his own premises there in 1939 at 17 [[Haldenstrasse]]. Before then  auctions were conducted at the [[Zunfthaus zur Meisen|Zur Meisen Guild House]] in Zurich and the [[Grand Hotel National]], Haldenstrasse, in Lucerne.&lt;ref name=fisch/&gt;

==1939 Grand Hotel auction==
In 1937 the Nazi party assembled, from art that they had removed from German museums, the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], an exhibition of mostly modern art that toured Germany until early 1939. The exhibition was intended to show the deterioration in art brought about by Jewish and [[Bolshevik]] influences. The creation of the exhibition was followed up by a far larger exercise to collect "degenerate art" from throughout Germany. On the instructions of [[Joseph Goebbels]], German Reich Minister of Propaganda, attempts were made to sell some of the more valuable "degenerate" works abroad to raise foreign currency to help the war effort. Dealers were appointed in Germany for this purpose and Theodore Fischer was instructed to hold an auction of "degenerate art" in Switzerland. This took place on 30 June 1939 at the Grand Hotel National.&lt;ref name=Lost&gt;Harclerode, Peter, &amp; Brendan Pittaway. (1999) ''The Lost Masters: The Looting of Europe's Treasurehouses''.

Retrieved 26 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 126 pictures offered were [[Franz Marc]]'s ''Three Red Horses'', [[Paul Gauguin]]'s ''Landscape of Tahiti with Three Female Tigers'', [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''The Harlequins'' and a self-portrait by [[Paul Modersohn]]. In addition, there were four more paintings by Marc, fifteen by [[Lovis Corinth]], nine by [[Carl Hofer]], nine by [[Oskar Kokoschka]], seven by Emil Nolde, five by [[Ernst Barlach]], two by [[Paul Klee]], and three each by [[Max Beckmann]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Kirchner]], [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]].&lt;ref name=Lost/&gt; Despite the contempt of the Nazis for the "degenerate art" on offer, the auction was described by the Fischer gallery in more flattering terms as a sale of ''Gemalde und Plastiken Moderner Meister aus Deutschen Museen'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/QH3E7U275681 "Research Resources: 'Entartete Kunst' Inventory at the V&amp;A Goes Online 31 January 2014"] lootedart.com. Retrieved 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Paintings and Sculptures of Modern Masters from German Museums'').

The sale was widely publicised and previews were held at Zurich and Lucerne but it did not have the atmosphere of a normal fine art auction. Some people were in the audience only out of curiosity and a number of bidders, who might have been expected to attend, were absent because they were worried the proceeds would be used to prop-up the Nazi regime. Others were bargain-hunters or bought because they feared what would happen to the pictures if they went unsold. [[Marianne Breslauer|Marianne Feilchenfeldt]] and her husband were shocked to discover that one of the canvases for sale was ''Cathedral of Bordeaux'' (1924/25) by [[Oskar Kokoschka]], a painting that they had donated to the [[Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin but which had been deaccessioned in 1937.&lt;ref name=Europa&gt;[[Lynn H.

Fischer's auctioneering was reported by ''Beaux Arts'' of France to be efficient but the journal couldn't help noting his disdainful attitude to the lots. Of ''Man with a Pipe''&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise known as ''The Smoker''. 1917. Lot 111, unsold. Now lost.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Max Pechstein]] they reported that, "he said with a little sneer, "This must be a portrait of the artist" ... when he withdrew other lots, which he had started at rather a high minimum, he took wicked pleasure in observing loudly, "Nobody wants that sort of thing," or "This lady doesn't please the public" ... and he smiled when he said the word "withdrawn".&lt;ref&gt;"La Vente des oeuvres d'art dégénérés à Lucerne", ''Beaux Arts'', 7 July 1939. Translated by Lynn H. Nicholas. Nicholas, 1995, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The prices realised in the sale were below expectations and 28 lots went unsold.&lt;ref name=Europa/&gt;

==Second World War==
Many of the established art markets in Europe were closed or restricted during the Second World War, making neutral Switzerland with its borders with Germany, Italy, Austria and France, an attractive alternative to Paris or London as a place to buy or sell art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commartrecovery.org/cases/switzerland Switzerland Neutral Haven And A Willing Wartime Art Market.] Commission for Art Recovery, 2010. Retrieved 13 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110901072348/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/Switzerland9.htm Switzerland and the Looted Art Trade Linked to World War II.] Georg Kreis, [[University of Basel]], Switzerland. 11 December 1999. Retrieved 26 January 2015 from Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

People were dislocated by the war and some had capital trapped abroad, leading to an urgent need to raise funds. The wife of Jewish collector [[Gisèle Freund|Julius Freund]], for instance, who had been forced to flee Germany, sold part of his collection through Galerie Fischer as she urgently needed to raise funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/NIF7RH961951 'Nazi-Era Art Claims in the United States:10 years after the Washington Conference'.] lootedart.com. Retrieved 26 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi regime in Germany sold looted art in order to raise foreign currency and collectors and dealers sought to profit from sales forced by wartime exigencies.

Fischer, who already dominated the Swiss market, was able to exploit these conditions to the full, to the extent that in 1946, the USS Office of Strategic Services Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) described him as "the focal point in all looted art transactions in Switzerland, and recipient of the greatest number of looted paintings located to date".&lt;ref name=loot&gt;"Fischer, Theodor."

[[File:Wilhelm Trübner Karl Haberstock.jpg|thumbnail|''Karl Haberstock'' by [[Wilhelm Trübner]], 1914. Haberstock was Adolf Hitler's art agent and a client of Fischer.]]

===Methods===
Fischer used an agent in [[Darmstadt]] named [[Carl Bümming]] to negotiate with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s art agent [[Karl Haberstock]], who like Fischer had worked for Cassirer. In Switzerland, Fischer used the services of Swiss-resident German dealer [[Hans Wendland]] to import large quantities of looted art into the country for onward sale. In November 1942, Wendland received a whole railway wagon full of art from Paris. In 1943 he received a large quantity of art from Italy. According to [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]], Wendland acted on behalf of Fischer in negotiating with [[Hermann Göring]]'s art agent [[Walter Hofer]], and Wendland and Fischer were partners in most of the transactions. The two had known each other since at least 1931&lt;ref&gt;Some sources say they met in 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; when Fischer had bailed Wendland out of some financial difficulties. According to Cooper, the value of trade between Fischer and Hofer for the two years to December 1942 was Swiss Francs 1,133,930. Trade between Hofer and Wendland between 1940 and January 1944 was French Francs 7,420,000 and Swiss Francs 258,000.&lt;ref name=Harc130&gt;Harclerode, pp. 130&amp;ndash;132.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer also had close connections with the Zurich galleries Galerie Schmidlin and Galerie Neupert, both of which dealt in looted art.&lt;ref name=Harc130/&gt; The ALIU and [[Bergier commission]] Reports also point to the importance of German refugee art dealers such as [[Fritz Nathan]] who acted as an intermediary between Fischer, Hofer and [[Emil Georg Bührle]].&lt;ref name="loot" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Switzerland, National Socialism and the Second World War Final Report|last=Independent Commission of Experts Switzerland – Second World War Jean-François Bergier, Chairman|first=|publisher=Pendo Verlag GmbH, Zürich|year=2002|isbn=3-85842-603-2|location=https://www.uek.ch/en/schlussbericht/synthesis/ueke.pdf|pages=350–1,360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deals with Hermann Göring===
Fischer made several deals with Hermann Göring through his agent Walter Hofer. Göring particularly prized German [[Old Master|old master]] works and in February 1941, Hofer selected seven such from Galerie Fischer which were shipped to Göring's palace at [[Karinhall]]. They included four paintings by the German master [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a triptych by a Frankfurt master and a statue of a ''Female Saint Holding a Ring'' (c. 1500) of the Nuremberg school. The Cranach paintings were ''Madonna and Child in a Landscape'', ''Crucifixion with a Knight as Donor'', ''St. Anne and the Virgin'', and ''Portrait of a Bearded Kurfurst''.&lt;ref name=Harc128/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alford2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Kenneth D.

Göring originally agreed to pay in Swiss francs but as foreign currency was difficult to obtain, even for him, it was later agreed that Fischer would receive 25 [[French Impressionism|French Impressionist]] paintings instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4S18272 ALIU Detailed Interrogation Report: Hans WENDLAND, 18 September 1946.] lootedart.com. Retrieved 26 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Charles Cottet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. All had previously been in the [[Moïse Lévy de Benzion]] and [[Alphonse Kann]] collections,&lt;ref name=Harc128&gt;Harclerode, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; apart from ''Flowers in a Vase'' (also known as ''Glass with Wild Flowers'') (1890) by van Gogh, which had been part of the [[Alfred Lindon]] collection.&lt;ref name=Harc128&gt;Harclerode, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yeide447&gt;[[Nancy Yeide|Yeide, Nancy H.]] (2009) ''Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection.'' Dallas: Laurel Publishing, pp. 447 &amp; 458 D36. {{ISBN|0977434915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another looted work handled by Fischer was Degas' ''Madame Camus at the Piano'' (1869). This had been in the Kann collection but seized by the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] (ERR) in 1941. From there it passed into the Göring collection who exchanged it with [[Gustav Rochlitz]] for older works. From Rochlitz it went to Wendland and from there to Fischer who sold it in 1942 to industrialist [[Emil Georg Bührle|Emil Bührle]]. It was recovered by Kann's heirs in 1948, only to be sold back to Bührle in 1951.&lt;ref name=Yeide458&gt;Yeide, p. 458, D31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South American connections===
Among Fischer's other connections was the Catalan politician, [[Francoist]] sympathizer and art collector [[Francesc Cambó]], who dealt almost solely with Fischer. He moved to Buenos Aires shortly after the start of the Second World War. Fischer was also connected with the Austrian dealer [[Thaddeus Grauer]] who moved to Brazil in 1941 via Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C13443670 FO 837/1154/5.] The National Archives. Retrieved 29 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, more than 24 paintings looted from European Jews were discovered in a São Paulo art gallery. They were traced to Grauer and before that Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;Harclerode, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4783877 News Reports: 'Brazil uncovers Nazi war loot'] lootedart.com.

Retrieved 29 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war==
After the end of the Second World War, the descendants and original owners of looted art began to try to recover their property in a process that is still continuing.

Around September 1945, [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], whose collection had been plundered by the Nazis, travelled to Switzerland in search of the paintings looted from him. Finding several in the collection of Emil Bührle, he demanded their return. Bührle refused but said he would return them to Theodor Fischer, from whom he had acquired them, as long as he received a full refund from Fischer. Fischer acknowledged that he had acquired them from Hofer and knew them to be looted but claimed that he had been unable to return them.&lt;ref name=Harc136&gt;Harclerode, pp. 136&amp;ndash;137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss government was forced to return some looted works of art to their original owners, despite the [[Swiss Syndicate of Art Dealers]] instructing its members not to provide any information on the topic. In the 1950s, Theodor Fischer sued the Swiss government for compensation of over one million Swiss Francs in respect of these restitutions but was awarded only 200,000 francs in settlement.&lt;ref name="Bischol"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bischof, Günter |author2=Anton Pelinka|author3=Ferdinand Karlhofer.

==Death==
Fischer died in 1957. His business was taken over by his sons, Arthur (1905–1981) and Paul (1911–1976).&lt;ref name=fisch/&gt;

The '''Three Ages of Buddhism''', also known as the Three Ages of the Dharma, ({{zh|s=三时|t=三時|p=Sān Shí}}) are three divisions of time following Buddha's passing in [[East Asian Buddhism]]. '''Mappō''' or '''Mofa''' ({{zh|s=末法|t=末法||p=Mò Fǎ}}, Japanese: ''Mappō''), which is also translated as the ''Age of Dharma Decline'', is the "degenerate" Third Age of Buddhism, also known as The Latter Day of the Law.

==Three Ages of Buddhism==
The '''Three Ages of Buddhism''' are three divisions of time following Buddha's passing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tzu | first = Chuang | title = Fa Xiang: A Buddhist Practitioner's Encyclopedia | publisher = Buddha's Light Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-932293-55-5 | pages=4, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michele (1988).

# Former Day of the Law — also known as the Age of the Right Dharma ({{zh|s=正法|t=正法|p=Zhèng Fǎ}}; Jp: shōbō), the first thousand years (or 500 years) during which the Buddha's disciples are able to uphold the Buddha's teachings; 
# Middle Day of the Law — also known as the Age of Semblance Dharma ({{zh|s=像法|t=像法|p=Xiàng Fǎ}}; Jp: zōhō), the second thousand years (or 500 years), which only resembles the right Dharma; 
# Latter Day of the Law — also known as the Degenerate Age ({{zh|s=末法|t=末法|p=Mò Fǎ}}; mòfǎ; Jp: mappō), which is to last for 10,000 years during which the Dharma declines.

The three periods are significant to [[Mahayana]] adherents, particularly those who hold the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' in high regard, namely the [[Tiantai]] and [[Tendai]] and [[Nichiren Buddhism]], who believe that different Buddhist teachings are valid (i.e., able to lead practitioners to enlightenment) in each period due to the different capacity to accept a teaching (機根 Cn: jīgēn; Jp: kikon) of the people born in each respective period.

Further, in the ''[[Mahasamnipata Sutra|Mahāsaṃnipāta Sutra]]'', the three periods are further divided into five five-hundred year periods (五五百歳 Cn: wǔ wǔ bǎi sùi; Jp: go no gohyaku sai), the fifth and last of which was prophesied to be when the Buddhism of Sakyamuni would lose all power of salvation and a new Buddha would appear to save the people. This time period would be characterized by unrest, strife, famine, and natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michele (1988).

==Latter Day of the Law==

===Degeneration===
Traditionally, this age is supposed to begin 2000 years after [[Gautama Buddha]]'s passing and last for "10,000 years". The first two ages are the ''Age of Right Dharma'' (正法 Cn: zhèngfǎ; Jp: shōbō), followed by the ''Age of Semblance Dharma'' ({{cjkv|c=像法|p=xiàngfǎ}}, Japanese: ''zōbō'').{{harv|Hattori|2000|pp=15, 16}} During this degenerate third age, it is believed that people will be unable to attain enlightenment through the word of Sakyamuni Buddha, and society will become morally corrupt. In Buddhist thought, during the Age of Dharma Decline the teachings of the Buddha will still be correct, but people will no longer be capable of following them.

===Maitreya===
Buddhist temporal cosmology assumes a cyclical pattern of ages, and even when the current Buddha's teachings fall into disregard, a new Buddha will at some point (usually considered to be millions of years in the future) be born to ensure the continuity of Buddhism. In the ''Lotus Sutra'', [[Visistacaritra]] is entrusted to spread Buddhist law in this age and save mankind and the earth. He and countless other Bodhisattvas, specifically called Bodhisattvas of the Earth (of which he is the leader), vow to be reborn in a latter day to re-create Buddhist law, thus turning the degenerate age into a flourishing paradise. Shakyamuni entrusts them instead of his more commonly known major disciples with this task since the Bodhisattvas of the Earth have had a karmic connection with Shakyamuni since the beginning of time, meaning that they are aware of the Superior Practice which is the essence of Buddhism or the Dharma in its original, pure form. [[Ksitigarbha]] is also known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds, in the era between the death of Gautama and the rise of [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cttbusa.org/ess/earthstore_contents.htm The Earth Store (Treasury) Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|info="Is this sentence about something that happens in 3rd age?

[[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] taught that its teaching would be popular when "iron birds are upon the sky" before its decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zhibeifw.com/book1/yeshe/amidewa.doc 上师阿弥陀佛修法极乐捷径讲记]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.com.tw/zfrop/tibet/ggab-35a.htm 晉美講記(上)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wretch.cc/blog/benleehk168/258364 蓮師預言警世函 ( 附註解 ) 貝諾法王鑑定....]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Kalachakra|Kalacakra tantra]]'' contains a prophecy of a holy war in which a Buddhist king will win.

[[Theravada]] Buddhists taught that Buddhism would decline in five thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dicks |first1=Andrew |date=May 2015 |title=Enlightening the Bats: Sound and Place Making in Burmese Buddhist Practice |pages=25-26 and 32-33 |quote=pp 25-26:Many of the Burmese Buddhists I spoke with referenced a five thousand year period of decline noting that the current sāsana of the Buddha Sakyamuni who lived in India during the 5th century BCE, is already half way towards its complete disintegration. As time passes after the death of a Buddha, the sāsana becomes increasingly opaque until it finally disappears. There may be a period with no Buddha, and then a future Buddha descends from the celestial abodes, is born, and restores the sāsana on earth once again. Burmese Buddhist historian, Alicia Turner, has identified multiple chronologies for the decline of the sāsana that range from one hundred to five thousand years (2014). In the time of decay, also known as the Kaliyuga, all traces of the Tipitaka and their supporting practices eventually vanish destabilizing the sāsana and triggering its dissolution. pp 32-33:The Angata vamsa (dating to roughly 13th century) specifically depicts five stages in the decline of the sāsana. The first stage articulates the loss of the ability for monks to reach the four stages of enlightenment: sotapanna (stream-enterer), sakadagami (once-returner), anagami (non-returner), and arahant (fully awakened). The second stage relates the loss of patipatti (practice). In this stage, monks lose the ability to meditate and maintain their precepts. The loss of pariyatti (textual study) is the third stage and depicts the disappearance of the Tipitaka. The fourth stage illustrates the loss of maintaining even appearances of piousness i.e. respectful speech, attire, work, and morals. In this stage, monks no longer behave as monks. They are illustrated as married and working people. The final stage illustrates the disappearance of the Buddha’s relics as they are returned to the location of the Buddha’s enlightenment and engulfed in flames (ibid.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By contrast, refer to Bhikku Bodhi : {{cite book |translator-last=Bhikkhu Bodhi |date=2012 |title=The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha - A Translation of the Anguttara Nikaya |pages=1805 |quote=cf Note 1747- And this expression 'a thousand years' is said with reference to arahants who have attained the analytic knowledges.  Following this, for another thousand years, there appear dry-insight arahants; for another thousand years, non-returners; for another thousand years, once-returners; for another thousand years, stream-enterers.  Thus the good Dhamma of penetration will last five thousand years.  The Dhamma of learning will also last this long.  For without learning, there is no penetration, and as long as there is learning, there is penetration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some monks such as [[Dōgen]] and [[Hsu Yun]] had alternative views regarding dharma decline. Dōgen believed that there is no Mò Fǎ while Hsu Yun thought Mò Fǎ is not inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china2551.org/Article/fjll/l19/200807/7129.html 佛教末法观的现代意义]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cttbusa.org/dharmatalks/properdharma.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Chinese folk religion]]s taught that the three ages were the teaching period of [[Dīpankara Buddha]], Gautama Buddha, and the current era of Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ftb.cnfxj.org/Html/lscg/2007-5/15/153146493.html |title=清代教门惑众手法 |access-date=2010-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725183218/http://ftb.cnfxj.org/Html/lscg/2007-5/15/153146493.html |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://zhengqi.org.cn/lilunyanjiu/guoneixiejiao/20070402/1492.html |title=清代“邪教”与清朝政府- 正气网 清代“邪教”与清朝政府 |access-date=2010-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013224549/http://www.zhengqi.org.cn/lilunyanjiu/guoneixiejiao/20070402/1492.html |archive-date=2008-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hi.baidu.com/hflsjzj/blog/item/bdaf61ec89c1b8db2f2e21b6.html 了道金船 三佛通书]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''transcendence''' conveys the basic ground concept from the word's literal meaning (from [[Latin]]), of climbing or going beyond, albeit with varying connotations in its different historical and cultural stages. It includes [[philosophies]], systems, and approaches that describe the fundamental structures of being, not as an [[ontology]] (theory of being), but as the framework of emergence and validation of [[knowledge]] of being. "Transcendental" is a word derived from the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]], designating the extra-categorical attributes of beings.&lt;ref name="transcendental"&gt;Caygill, Howard. ''A Kant Dictionary''. (Blackwell Philosopher Dictionaries), Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2000, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;Turner, W. (1912). Transcendentalism. In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15017a.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Religious definition==
{{See also|Transcendence (religion)}}
In [[religion]], transcendence refers to the aspect of a god's nature and power which is wholly independent of the material universe, beyond all physical laws. This is contrasted with [[immanence]], where a god is said to be fully present in the physical world and thus accessible to creatures in various ways. In [[religious experience]] transcendence is a state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and by some definitions has also become independent of it. This is typically manifested in [[prayer]], [[séance]], [[meditation]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s and [[paranormal]] "visions".

It is affirmed in various religious traditions' concept of the [[divinity|divine]], which contrasts with the notion of a [[god]] (or, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]) that exists exclusively in the physical order (immanentism), or indistinguishable from it ([[pantheism]]). Transcendence can be attributed to the divine not only in its being, but also in its knowledge. Thus, a god may transcend both the universe and knowledge (is beyond the grasp of the human mind).

Although transcendence is defined as the opposite of immanence, the two are not necessarily [[mutually exclusive]]. Some [[theology|theologians]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] of various religious traditions affirm that a god is both within and beyond the universe ([[panentheism]]); in it, but not of it; simultaneously pervading it and surpassing it.

==Modern philosophy==
{{Further|Transcendental idealism|Transcendental arguments}}

In [[modern philosophy]], [[Immanuel Kant]] introduced a new term — ''transcendental'', thus instituting a new, third meaning. In his [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]], this concept is concerned with the [[condition of possibility]] of knowledge itself. He also opposed the term ''transcendental'' to the term ''transcendent'', the latter meaning "that which goes beyond" (transcends) any possible knowledge of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' or ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume 2, Chapter 10, § 141, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] presented the difference between transcendent and immanent in the form of a dialogue. The dialogists were Thrasymachos, a student of [[German idealism|German Idealism]], and Philalethes, a [[Transcendental idealism|Kantian Transcendental Idealist]]. "Thrasymachos: …I know these expressions from my professor, but only as predicates of a loving God with whom his philosophy was exclusively concerned, as is only right and proper. Namely, if God is situated within the world, he is immanent; if he resides somewhere outside, he is transcendent. … Philalethes: Transcendent knowledge is that which, going beyond all possibility of experience, strives to determine the nature of things as they are in themselves; immanent knowledge, on the other hand, is that which keeps within the bounds of the possibility of experience, but thus can speak only of phenomena." In Schopenhauer’s German: "Thrasymachos: …Mir sind diese Ausdrücke zwar auch bekannt, von meinem Professor her, aber nur als Prädikate des lieben Gottes, mit welchem seine Philosophie, wie sich das eben auch geziemt, es ausschließlich zu tun hatte. Steckt nämlich der in der Welt drinne, so ist er immanent: sitzt er aber irgendwo draußen, so ist er transzendent….Philalethes: Transzendente Erkenntnis ist die, welche, über alle Möglichkeit der Erfahrung hinausgehend, das Wesen der Dinge, wie sie an sich selbst sind, zu bestimmen anstrebt; immanente Erkenntnis hingegen die, welche sich innerhalb der Schranken der Möglichkeit der Erfahrung hält, daher aber auch nur von Erscheinungen reden kann."&lt;/ref&gt; For him ''transcendental'' meant knowledge about our cognitive faculty with regard to how objects are possible ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. "I call all knowledge ''transcendental'' if it is occupied, not with objects, but with the way that we can possibly know objects even before we experience them."&lt;ref&gt;"I call all cognition transcendental that is occupied not so much with objects but rather with our mode of cognition of objects insofar as this is to be possible ''a priori''. A '''system''' of such concepts would be called '''transcendental philosophy'''." Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Edited and translated by [[Paul Guyer]] and Allen Wood, Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 149 (B25)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[metaphysics]], as a fundamental and universal theory, turns out to be an [[epistemology]]. Transcendental philosophy, consequently, is not considered a traditional ontological form of metaphysics.

Kant also equated ''transcendental'' with that which is "...in respect of the subject's faculty of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt; Something is transcendental if it plays a role in the way in which the mind "constitutes" objects and makes it possible for us to experience them as objects in the first place. Ordinary knowledge is knowledge of objects; transcendental knowledge is knowledge of how it is possible for us to experience those objects as objects. This is based on Kant's acceptance of [[David Hume]]'s argument that certain general features of objects (e.g. persistence, causal relationships) cannot be derived from the sense impressions we have of them. Kant argues that the mind must contribute those features and make it possible for us to experience objects as objects. In the central part of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', the "Transcendental Deduction of the Categories", Kant argues for a deep interconnection between the ability to have self-consciousness and the ability to experience a world of objects. Through a process of synthesis, the mind generates both the structure of objects and its own unity.

A metaphilosophical question discussed by many Kantian scholars is how transcendental reflection is itself possible. Stephen Palmquist interprets Kant's appeal to [[faith]] as his most effective solution to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "Faith as Kant's Key to the Justification of Transcendental Reflection", The Heythrop Journal 25:4 (October 1984), pp.442-455. A revised version of this paper appeared as Chapter V in Palmquist's book, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 Kant's System of Perspectives] (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kant, the "transcendent", as opposed to the "transcendental", is that which lies beyond what our faculty of knowledge can legitimately know. [[Hegel]]'s counter-argument to Kant was that to know a boundary is also to be aware of what it bounds and as such what lies beyond it &amp;ndash; in other words, to have already transcended it.

==Contemporary philosophy==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the "transcendent" is that which transcends our own consciousness: that which is objective rather than only a phenomenon of consciousness. [[Noema]] is employed in phenomenology to refer to the terminus of an intention as given for [[consciousness]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] also speaks of transcendence in his works. In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre uses transcendence to describe the relation of the self to the object oriented world, as well as our concrete relations with others. For Sartre, the [[Pour soi|for-itself]] is sometimes called a transcendence. Additionally if the other is viewed strictly as an object, much like any other object, then the other is, for the for-itself, a transcendence-transcended. When the for-itself grasps the other in the others world, and grasps the subjectivity that the other has, it is referred to as transcending-transcendence. Thus, Sartre defines relations with others in terms of transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. Being and Nothingness. Trans. Hazel E. Barnes. New York: Washington Square Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary transcendental philosophy is developed by German philosopher [[Harald Holz]] with a holistic approach. Holz liberated transcendental philosophy from the convergence of [[neo-Kantianism]], he critically discussed transcendental pragmatism and the relation between transcendental philosophy, [[neo-empiricism]] and the so-called [[postmodernism]].

==Colloquial usage==
In everyday language, "transcendence" means "going beyond", and "self-transcendence" means going beyond a prior form or state of oneself. [[Mystical]] experience is thought of as a particularly advanced state of self-transcendence, in which the sense of a separate self is abandoned. "[[Self-transcendence]]" is believed to be psychometrically measurable, and (at least partially) inherited, and has been incorporated as a personality dimension in the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]].&lt;ref name=Cloninger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloninger|first=C.R.|title=A psychobiological model of temperament and character|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=December 1993|volume=50|issue=12|pages=975–90|pmid=8250684|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820240059008|last2=Svrakic|first2=DM|last3=Przybeck|first3=TR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of this is described in the book "The God Gene" by [[Dean Hamer]], although this has been criticized by commentators such as [[Carl Zimmer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">A '''variational principle''' is a scientific principle used within the [[calculus of variations]], which develops general methods for finding functions which extremize the value of quantities that depend upon those functions. For example, to answer this question: "What is the [[Catenary|shape of a chain]] suspended at both ends?" we can use the variational principle that the shape must minimize the gravitational potential energy.

==Overview==
Any physical law which can be expressed as a variational principle describes a [[self-adjoint operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Lanczos |author-link=Cornelius Lanczos |orig-year=1st published 1970, [[University of Toronto Press]] |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |publisher=Dover |date=1974 |ISBN=0-8020-1743-6 |edition=4th, paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expressions are also called [[Hermitian]]. Such an expression describes an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a Hermitian transformation.

==History==
{{main|History of variational principles in physics}}
[[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] attempted to identify such invariants under a group of transformations. In what is referred to in physics as [[Noether's theorem]], the [[Poincaré group]] of transformations (what is now called a [[gauge group]]) for [[general relativity]] defines symmetries under a group of transformations which depend on a variational principle, or [[Action (physics)|action principle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2890">In the legal system of England and Wales, the '''victim surcharge''' is a penalty applied to people convicted of offences, in addition to a  [[conditional discharge]], a fine, or a community or custodial sentence, in order to provide compensation for the victims of crime.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/types-of-sentence/other-orders-made-on-sentencing/what-is-the-victim-surcharge/|title=What is the victim surcharge?|publisher=[[Sentencing Council]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28696150|title=Criminals jailed by magistrates to pay victim surcharge|date=8 August 2014|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surcharge is not paid directly to the criminal's victim, but is pooled and distributed through the [[Victim and Witness General Fund]]. The amount to be paid is specified by law, and courts have no discretion to reduce the amount, nor to waive the surcharge, even for defendants of limited means.&lt;ref name="Rozenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/victim-surcharge-unintended-consequences/71546.fullarticle|title=Victim surcharge: unintended consequences|last=Rozenberg|first=Joshua|work=Law Society Gazette|publisher=[[Law Society]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law journalist [[Joshua Rozenberg]] has reported cases where a surcharge levied against a young person became the responsibility of their parents - even when a parent was the victim of the crime in question.&lt;ref name="Rozenberg" /&gt;

The surcharge was first introduced in 2007.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-6431401"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6431401.stm|title='Victim surcharge' on court fines|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 September 2014, the discretion of [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' courts]] to apply additional custody days in lieu of the surcharge was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;

== Amounts ==
For offences committed after 8 April 2016, the amount of the surcharge, depending on the penalty awarded, is:&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt;

; Conditional discharge : £20
; Fine : 10% of the fine value (£30 minimum, £170 maximum)
; Community sentence : £85
; Custodial sentence of 6 months and below : £115
; Custodial sentence, 6 months to 2 years : £140
; Custodial sentence over 2 years : £170 (only in Crown Court)
; Suspended sentence, 6 months and below : £115
; Suspended sentence, over 6 months : £140 

Other figures apply for [[legal person]]s who are not individuals; and offenders aged under 18.

Official figures show that £51m was raised, between 2010 and 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC-28696150" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Violence''' is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or [[Power (social and political)|power]], threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation," although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of "the use of power" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;Krug et al., [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, [[World Health Organization]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm ([[suicide]]), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence ([[war]]) and legal intervention.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt; In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death.&lt;ref&gt;awake Aug 8/05 pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; Corlin, past president of the [[American Medical Association]] said: "The United States leads the world—in the rate at which its children die from firearms." He concluded: "Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country."&lt;ref&gt;Awake Jul 8/2003 pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009053208/http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ |date=2015-10-09 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
In 2013, assault by [[firearm]] was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Violence in many forms is preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors such as [[concentrated poverty]], income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be effective in preventing violence.&lt;ref&gt;WHO / Liverpool JMU Centre for Public Health, [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ "Violence Prevention: The evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Types ==
[[File:Typology of violence.jpg|thumb|Typology of violence&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;]]
Violence can be divided into three broad categories:&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;
* self-directed violence
* interpersonal violence
* collective violence

Violent acts can be:
* physical
* sexual
* physiological
* emotional

This initial categorization differentiates between violence a person inflicts upon himself or herself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations. These three broad categories are each divided further to reflect more specific types of violence.

Violence is primarily classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915221238/http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-directed violence ===
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and [[Self-harm|self-abuse]]. The former includes [[suicidal thoughts]], [[attempted suicide]]s – also called ''[[para suicide]]'' or ''deliberate self-injury'' in some countries – and completed suicides. Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as [[self-mutilation]].

=== Collective violence ===
{{Citation style|date=February 2017}}
[[File:The Bochnia massacre German-occupied Poland 1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[Massacre]] of [[Poles|Polish]] civilians during [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], 1939]]

Collective violence is subdivided into [[structural violence]] and [[economic violence]]. Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups. Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain – such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J137v04n02_03|title=Poverty as a Form of Violence|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=45–59|year=2001|last1=Allen|first1=Josephine A. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology, while imperfect and far from being universally accepted, does provide a useful framework for understanding the complex patterns of violence taking place around the world, as well as violence in the everyday lives of individuals, families and communities. It also overcomes many of the limitations of other typologies by capturing the nature of violent acts, the relevance of the setting, the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, and – in the case of collective violence – possible motivations for the violence. However, in both research and practice, the dividing lines between the different types of violence are not always so clear.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. State violence also involves upholding, forms of violence of a structural nature, such as poverty, through dismantling welfare, creating strict policies such as 'welfare to work', in order to cause further stimulation and disadvantage&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Poverty as a form of violence may involve oppressive policies that specifically target minority or low socio-economic groups. The 'war on drugs', for example, rather than increasing the health and well-being of at risk demographics, most often results in violence committed against these vulnerable demographics through incarceration, stigmatization and police brutality&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02249526|title=Political ideologies and drug policy|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|volume=1|pages=94–105|year=1993|last1=Scheerer|first1=Sebastian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warfare ===

{{Main|War}}

[[File:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|A United States [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car in Paris during World War II]]
War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government. It is the most extreme form of collective violence.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 64, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as [[war of aggression]] to conquer territory or loot resources, in national [[self-defence]] or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to [[secession|secede]] from it. We know also ideological, religious and revolutionary wars.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 84, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lethality of modern warfare has grown. [[World War I casualties]] were over 40 million and [[World War II casualties]] were over 70 million.

=== Non-physical ===
Violence includes those acts that result from a power relationship, including threats and [[intimidation]], [[neglect]] or acts of omission. Such non-physical violence has a broad range of outcomes – including psychological harm, deprivation and maldevelopment. Violence may not necessarily result in injury or death, but nonetheless poses a substantial burden on individuals, families, communities and health care systems worldwide. Many forms of violence can result in physical, psychological and social problems that do not necessarily lead to injury, disability or death. These consequences can be immediate, as well as latent, and can last for years after the initial abuse. Defining outcomes solely in terms of injury or death thus limits the understanding of the full impact of violence.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

=== Interpersonal violence ===

Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: Family and [[intimate partner violence]] – that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home. Community violence – violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home. The former group includes forms of violence such as [[child abuse]], intimate partner violence and [[elderly abuse|abuse of the elderly]]. The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, [[rape]] or [[sexual assault]] by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes.  When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of violent fathers, posttraumatically stressed mothers, and symptomatic children in a preschool-age inner-city pediatrics clinic sample | url = | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 26 | issue = 18| pages = 3699–3719 | doi=10.1177/0886260511403747 | pmid=22170456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Child maltreatment ====
{{Main|Child abuse}}
Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], [[neglect]], [[negligence]] and commercial or other [[child exploitation]], which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2006). [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html "Preventing child maltreatment: a guide to taking action and generating evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719072520/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html |date=2012-07-19 }} Geneva: WHO and International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences, which is, however, complex and difficult to study.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children.  In CH Zeanah (Ed.).  Handbook of Infant Mental Health—3rd Edition.  New York: Guilford Press, Inc.  pp. 197-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment. Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoltenborgh M. |author2=Van IJzendoorn M.H. |author3=Euser E.M. |author4=Bakermans-Kranenburg M.J. | year = 2011 | title = A global perspective on child abuse: Meta-analysis of prevalence around the world | url = | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi = 10.1177/1077559511403920 |pmid=21511741 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1029.9752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.g. school, job, and relationship difficulties). These can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert R. |author2=Spatz Widom C. |author3=Browne K. |author4=Fergusson D. |author5=Webb E. |author6=Janson J. | year = 2009 | title = Burden and consequences of child maltreatment in high-income countries | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9657| pages = 68–81 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61706-7 | pmid=19056114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.html|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach.

==== Youth violence ====
[[File:Kids off the Block Rocks in grass IMG 4815.JPG|thumb|The [[Kids off the Block]] memorial featuring hundreds of simple stone blocks, one for each child killed by violence in [[Roseland, Chicago]] ]]

Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years. Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from [[bullying]] and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23"&gt;Mercy, J.A., Butchart, A., Farrington, D., Cerda, M. (2002). Youth violence. In Etienne Krug, L.L. Dahlberg, J.A. Mercy, A.B. Zwi &amp; R. Lozano (Eds.), [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ World Report on Violence and Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }} pp 23–56. Geneva, Switzerland: [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year ("Global Burden of Disease", World Health Organization, 2008). For each young person killed, 20-40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23" /&gt; Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society.

Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization and Liverpool John Moores University.[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf "Violence prevention: the evidence: overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193235/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva, WHO, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results.&lt;ref name="Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.01216 | volume=12 | title=Children and youth in neighborhood contexts | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=27–31 | year=2003 | author=Leventhal Tama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, urban renewal projects such as [[business improvement district]]s have shown a reduction in youth violence.&lt;ref name="Rand report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020054800/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e.g. physical attacks, bullying, rape) and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies.  According to researchers in 2018, "More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence." The violence "can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life." &lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018"&gt;{{cite magazine | department=The Conversation US |author=Darby Saxbe | title=Living with Neighborhood Violence May Shape Teens' Brains | magazine=Scientific American | date=June 15, 2018 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/living-with-neighborhood-violence-may-shape-teens-rsquo-brains/ | access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It seems that youth violence is on the rise due to the growing number of legal and illegal guns on the streets especially in low income neighborhoods. Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it. Our knowledge about the impact of trauma on the brain, mind and body is growing every day as more research studies have been conducted and results are published. "Youth violence is a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults. Some forms of youth violence, such as bullying, slapping, or hitting, can cause severe emotional harm, nonfatal physical injuries, and long-lasting problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consequences Youth Violence |url=https://vetoviolence.cdc.gov/consequences-youth-violence |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost to individuals, their families, and society in general is huge and rising. These people often have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits the cost of which quickly adds up. Since the victims of youth on youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them (including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills). Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain. "Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=09/08/2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=11/24/18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). "Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems. They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder".&lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018" /&gt; Youth who do not get help and get it under control may have more issues down the line.

It is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short and long term negative effects (e.g., poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety). By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they’ve experienced negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated. As an initial step, the kids need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently. Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced. “Neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this initial awareness step is not sufficiently completed the youth may then knowingly or unknowingly resort to bullying as a way to release their own anger, compulsive behaviors (eating, drinking, drugs), anger management problems; and avoidance of social interactions. These types of behaviors may put them at an even greater risk for future violence in their lives. 
 
Some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and  other actions that enable these kids to release their pent up emotions. Using these techniques will teach body awareness, reduce anxiety and nervousness, and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time these types of activities will help these younger victims of violence to have greater control over their feelings and behaviors and avoid unhealthy ways of coping. Another way to help trauma victims of youth violence is through the arts. This can be accomplished by giving them the opportunity to engage in drawing, painting, music, and singing which will give them an outlet to express themselves and their emotions in a positive way.

It’s been discovered that having youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=Setember 08, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences. Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort. Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance. In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, schools should offer mentoring programs where the kids can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them. Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session. It doesn’t have to be a formal organization just a place where the kids can have positive role models in their lives and engage in stress relieving activities (sports, yoga, and arts). Many kids have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence. This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WCL: Stop the Violence Resources for Illinois |url=https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |website=ABC 7 Windy City Live |publisher=ABC 7 Windy City Live |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence. For example, Derek grew up amongst the violence in Chicago in the 1980's and was even a former gang leader. It took him thirty years in a gang and time in jail to realize he was on the wrong path. He created a boxing program called "Boxing Out Negativity" which provides youth in high crime areas a safe place to get out their anger and energy. It helps them in a positive way and keeps them off the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmich |first1=Mary |title=In a tough Chicago neighborhood, comfort and safety in boxing |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/schmich/ct-chicago-violence-lawndale-boxing-mary-schmich-0918-20160916-column.html |accessdate=11/20/18 |publisher=Chicago Tribume |date=09/16/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of programs to help victims of youth violence there is a greater opportunity for these youth to turn their lives around.

==== Intimate partner violence ====
{{Main|Domestic violence|Intimate partner violence}}
Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour in an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings. A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005). [http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224124426/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ |date=2011-02-24 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70%  (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner.

Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs. These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]], sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stith SM | year = 2004 | title = Intimate partner physical abuse perpetration and victimization risk factors: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 65–98 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2003.09.001|display-authors=etal| hdl = 2097/14851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction. Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and [[antisocial personality disorder]].

A recent theory named "The [[Criminal Spin]]" suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bensimon M. |author2=Ronel N. | year = 2012 | title = The flywheel effect of intimate partner violence: A victim-perpetrator interactive spin | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 423–429 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.

The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee V.A. | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the long-term effects of the Safe Dates program and a booster in preventing and reducing adolescent dating violence victimization and perpetration | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 4| pages = 619–624 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.619|display-authors=etal| pmc = 1448308 | pmid=15054015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies – those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kim J | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the incremental effects of combining economic and health interventions: the IMAGE study in South Africa | url = | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 87 | issue = 11| pages = 824–832 | doi=10.2471/blt.08.056580|display-authors=etal| pmc = 2770274 | pmid=20072767}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;WHO(2010).[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf "Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: Taking action and generating evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112035242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf |date=2011-11-12 }} World Health Organization: Geneva&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual violence ====
{{Main|Sexual violence}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.&lt;ref&gt;Krug et al.,[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, World Health Organization, 2002, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.3–11.5% of women reported experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005).[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193441/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence. If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, S.E. et al. (2011). Adverse childhood experiences and smoking status in five states. Preventive Medicine: 43, 3, 188-193.&lt;/ref&gt; drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life. It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.

Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for [[domestic violence]]. Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective. School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

==== Elder maltreatment ====
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person.

Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.

Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.g. stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups. Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ploeg Jenny |author2=Fear Jana |author3=Hutchison Brian |author4=MacMillan Harriet |author5=Bolan Gale | year = 2009 | title = A Systematic Review of Interventions for Elder Abuse | url = | journal = Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 187–210 | doi=10.1080/08946560902997181|pmid=19827325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pillemer K et al.

=== Targeted violence ===

Several rare but painful episodes of [[assassination]], attempted assassination and [[school shooting]]s at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks. These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called "targeted violence," described the "path to violence" of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators. A major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just "come out of the blue".&lt;ref&gt;Fein, R.A., Vossekuil, B. &amp; Holden, G.

=== Everyday violence ===
As an anthropological concept, "everyday violence" may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gammeltoft|first=Tine M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Silence as a Response to Everyday Violence: Understanding Domination and Distress Through the Lens of Fantasy|journal=Ethos|volume=44|issue=4|pages=427–447|doi=10.1111/etho.12140|issn=1548-1352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|title=everyday violence {{!}} The Ethnography of Political Violence|website=ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213200042/https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|archivedate=2018-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|title=Philippe Bourgois - The Power of Violence in War and Peace|website=istmo.denison.edu|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423065302/http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|archivedate=2016-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==
Violence cannot be attributed to a single factor. Its causes are complex and occur at different levels. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or [[social ecological model]] is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:

The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), [[Genetics of aggression|genetics]], [[brain lesion theory|brain lesions]], [[personality disorders]], [[substance abuse]], and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = C. J. | title = Psychophysiological correlates of aggression and violence: An integrative review | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 363 | issue = 1503 | pages = 2543–2555 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434285 | pmc = 2606710 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCrory | first1 = E. | last2 = De Brito | first2 = S. A. | last3 = Viding | first3 = E. | title = The link between child abuse and psychopathology: A review of neurobiological and genetic research | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = 151–156 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22532655 | pmc =  3343716| doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends. In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person’s risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In [[elder abuse]], important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.

The third level explores the community context—i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.

Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, income inequality, the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.

=== Child-rearing ===

Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of [[corporal punishment]] of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies. For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html "Corporal Punishment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031091526/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html |date=2010-10-31 }} (2008). ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[domestic corporal punishment]] has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page= |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Straus Murray A | year = 2000 | title = Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society" (PDF) | url = http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Virginia Journal of Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume =  | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110040441/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | archivedate = 2011-11-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===

The causes of violent behaviour in humans are often a topic of research in [[psychology]]. [[Neuroscientist|Neurobiologist]] Jan Volavka emphasizes that, for those purposes, "violent behavior is defined as intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127111237/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/307.pdf The Neurobiology of Violence, An Update], Journal of Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 11:3, Summer 1999. As Mexican Biologist and Scientologist Adri Rodriguez says, Violence is a recurring motif in today's society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans. Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Whipps,[http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html Peace or War? How early humans behaved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715062002/http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html |date=2007-07-15 }}, LiveScience.Com, March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as "violent". For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as "violent", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowan | first = John | year = 1978 | title = The Structured Crowd | publisher = Davis-Poynter. | title-link = The Structured Crowd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "violent male ape" image is often brought up in discussions of human violence. Dale Peterson and [[Richard Wrangham]]in "Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence" write that violence is inherent in humans, though not inevitable.
However, William L. Ury, editor of a book called "Must We Fight? From the Battlefield to the Schoolyard—A New Perspective on Violent Conflict and Its Prevention" criticizes the "killer ape" myth in his book which brings together discussions from two Harvard Law School symposiums. The conclusion is that "we also have lots of natural mechanisms for cooperation, to keep conflict in check, to channel aggression, and to overcome conflict. These are just as natural to us as the aggressive tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Fazzi, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3923/is_200205/ai_n9060833Debunking the "killer ape" myth]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},

The psychiatrist [[James Gilligan]] argues that most violent behavior represents an effort to eliminate feelings of [[shame]] and [[humiliation]], which he calls "the death of self".&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Preventing Violence |date=2001 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-50-077056-6 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Preventing_Violence.html?id=7_06CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15 |chapter=Shame and the Death of Self}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Shame, Guilt, and Violence |journal=Social Research |date=2003 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=1149–1180 |jstor=40971965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of violence often is a source of [[pride]] and a defence of honor, especially among males who believe violence defines manhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm Emotional Competency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323204810/http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm |date=2007-03-23 }}; Michael Obsatz,[http://www.angeresources.com/shamebased.html From Shame-Based Masculinity to Holistic Manhood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201053950/http://angeresources.com/shamebased.html |date=2007-12-01 }}, Robin Morgan, The Demon Lover On the Sexuality of Terrorism, W.W. Norton, 1989, Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article entitled "The History of Violence" in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Steven Pinker]] posits that, on average, the amount and cruelty of violence to humans and animals has decreased over the last few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf The History of Violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127111245/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, The New Republic, March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of [[Norbert Elias]], who attributes the decline to a "civilizing process", in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or "figurations", and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CaWFQgAACAAJ | last = Elias | first = N. | year = 1994 | title = The Civilizing Process | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 978-0-631-19222-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past. They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at [[homicide]] rates of death due to [[warfare]], but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gorelik, G., Shackelford, T.K., Weekes-Shackelford, V.A., 2012.

(Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Perspectives on Violence, Homicide, and War. Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 506–524&lt;/ref&gt;  However, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, D., Turner, H., Ormrod, R., &amp; Hamby, S.

In his article [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"], Robert D. Kaplan introduces the notion of liberating violence. According to Kaplan, we will observe more violent [[civil war]]s in the future, which will be fought due to economic inequalities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407054749/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ |date=2017-04-07 }}, Robert D.

The concept of violence normalization, is known as socially sanctioned or [[structural violence]], and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior.

[[Evolutionary psychology]] offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as [[sexual jealousy in humans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo | year = 1982 | title = Male Sexual Jealousy | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(82)90027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; child abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo I | year = 1981 | title = Child Maltreatment from a Sociobiological Perspective | url = | journal = New Directions for Child Development | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 93–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Margo, and Martin Daly. Homicide. Hawthorne: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most [[mammal]] species and use violence in specific situations. He writes that "Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children."&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goetz | first1 = A. T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20100422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz writes that most [[homicide]]s seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death. He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status. If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual. At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.&lt;ref name=EP /&gt;

=== Media ===
{{further|Media violence research}}
Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson Craig A. |author2=Berkowitz Leonard |author3=Donnerstein Edward |author4=Huesmann L.

Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olds DL, Sadler L, Kitzman H | year = 2007| title = Programs for parents of infants and toddlers: recent evidence from randomized trials | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 48| issue = 3–4| pages = 355–391 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01702.x | pmid=17355402}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Triple P (Parenting Program)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prinz | year = 2009 | title = Population-based prevention of child maltreatment: the US Triple P system population trial | journal = Prevention Science | volume =  10| issue = 1| pages =  1–12| doi = 10.1007/s11121-009-0123-3 | pmid = 19160053 |display-authors=etal| pmc =4258219}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Caldera D, etal | year = 2007 | title = Impact of a statewide home visiting program on parenting and on child health and development | url = | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 829–852 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.02.008| pmid = 17822765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Caldera | year = 1997 | title = Long-term effects of home visitation on maternal life course and child abuse and neglect: 15 year follow-up of a randomized trial | doi = 10.1001/jama.1997.03550080047038 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 278 | issue = 8| pages = 637–643 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life skills in youth ====
Evidence shows that the [[life skills]] acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects. Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life.

==== Gender equality ====
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent [[violence against women]] by promoting [[gender equality]]. For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pronyk PM, etal | year = 2006| title = Effect of a structural intervention for the prevention of intimate-partner violence and HIV in rural South Africa: a cluster randomised trial | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 368| issue = 9551| pages = 1973–83 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69744-4 | pmid=17141704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kim JC, Watts CH, Hargreaves JR, etal | year = 2007| title = Understanding the impact of a microfinance-based intervention on women's empowerment and the reduction of intimate partner violence in South Africa | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97| issue = 10| pages = 1794–1802 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.095521 | pmid=17761566 | pmc=1994170}}&lt;/ref&gt; School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Foshee VA, etal | year = 1998| title = An evaluation of safe dates an adolescent dating violence prevention programme | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 1998 | issue = 88| pages = 45–50 | doi=10.2105/ajph.88.1.45| pmc = 1508378 | pmid=9584032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee| year = 2005 | title = Safe Dates" using random coefficient regression modelling | url = | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 245–257 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wolfe D, etal | year = 2009 | title = Dating violence prevention with at risk youth: a controlled outcome evaluation | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 279–291 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.71.2.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.

==== Cultural norms ====
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence. Interventions that challenge cultural and [[social norms]] supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak. The effectiveness of interventions addressing [[dating violence]] and [[sexual abuse]] among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fabiano P | year = 2003 | title = Engaging men as social justice allies in ending violence against women: evidence for a social norms approach | url = | journal = Journal of American College Health | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 105–112 | doi=10.1080/07448480309595732| pmid = 14992295 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. The "A Man" campaign: marketing social norms to men to prevent sexual assault. The report on social norms. Working paper number 5. July 2002. Little Falls, NJ, PaperClip Communications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Support programmes ====
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next. Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olive P | year = 2007 | title = Care for emergency department patients who have experienced domestic violence: a review of the evidence base | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Nursing | volume = 16 | issue = 9| pages = 1736–1748 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.01746.x| pmid = 17727592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; psychosocial interventions – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy – to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roberts GL | year = 1997 | title = Impact of an education program about domestic violence on nurses and doctors in an Australian emergency department | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 220–226 | doi=10.1016/s0099-1767(97)90011-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Holt VL, etal | year = 2003| title = Do protection orders affect the likelihood of future partner violence and injury? | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 2003 | issue = 24| pages = 16–21 | doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(02)00576-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=McFarlane J, etal | year = 2004| title = Protection orders and intimate partner violence: an 18-month study of 150 Black, Hispanic, and White women | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 2004 | issue = 94| pages = 613–618 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.613| pmc = 1448307 | pmid=15054014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.

=== Collective violence ===
Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;  However, policies that facilitate [[poverty reduction|reductions in poverty]], that make [[decision-making]] more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended. When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal justice ===
One of the main functions of [[law]] is to regulate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = David Joseph E | year = 2006 | title = The One who is More Violent Prevails – Law and Violence from a Talmudic Legal Perspective | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence | volume = 19 | issue = 2| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Max Weber]] stated that the state claims the [[monopoly of the legitimate use of force]] practised within the confines of a specific territory. [[Law]] enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society. Governments regulate the use of violence through [[legal system]]s governing individuals and political authorities, including the [[police]] and [[military]]. Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]], to maintain the status quo and enforce laws.

However, German political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] noted: "Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate ... Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future. No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arendt | first = Hannah | title = On Violence | publisher = Harvest Book | page = 52 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power. Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H. (1972) On Violence in Crises in the Republic, Florida, Harcourt, Brace and Company, pp 134-155.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century in acts of [[democide]] governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through [[police brutality]], [[execution]], [[massacre]], slave [[labour camps]], and sometimes through intentional [[List of famines#20th century|famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|title=20th Century Democide|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301064559/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|archivedate=2006-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|title=Atlas – Wars and Democide of the Twentieth Century|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110130810/http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|archivedate=2007-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in [[self-defense]] are usually classified as [[crimes]], although not all crimes are [[violent crime]]s. [[Property damage|Damage to property]] is classified as violent crime in some jurisdictions but not in all.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) classifies violence resulting in [[homicide]] into [[murder|criminal homicide]] and [[justifiable homicide]] (e.g. self-defense).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook|year=2004|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503055659/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that "justice is done". The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to "do justice", i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;M. Moore "Public Health and Criminal Justice Approaches to Prevention."1992. In Vol. 16 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, edited by M. Tonry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes – through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 82–94 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and [[problem-oriented policing]] aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it – and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton W (with Knobler P). Turnaround: how America's top cop reversed the crime epidemic. New York: Random House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile justice systems – an important component of criminal justice systems – are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the "Blueprints for violence prevention" programme at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence [http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints "Blueprints for violence prevention/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103080341/http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/ |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public health ===
The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely "criminal" or "medical" problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the [[Social ecological model]].

From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
* Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.
* Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.
* Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.

A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible "symptoms". This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.

The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.
# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.
# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.
# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.

In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon JE, "The epidemiology of accidents," ''American Journal of Public Health'', 1949; 504–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to "extending life" or to a "complete state of well-being". He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abad Gomez H | year = 1962 | title = Violence requires epidemiological studies | url = | journal = Tribuna Medica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dahlberg L. |author2=Mercy J. | year = 2009 | title = History of violence as a public health issue | url = | journal = AMA Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 167–172 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.2.mhst1-0902|pmid=23190546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.

The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf "WHA49.25 Prevention of violence: a public health priority"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared violence "a leading worldwide public health problem" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82–88 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places – which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries – than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse – which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.

=== Human rights ===
[[File:Abdulredha Buhmaid on floor.jpeg|thumb|[[Bahrain]]'s pro-democracy protesters killed by military, February 2011]]
The [[human rights]] approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, [[autonomy]] and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to [[privacy]]; and the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]. These human rights are enshrined in [[international human rights law|international and regional treaties]] and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

=== Geographical context ===
Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, "appears whenever power is in jeopardy" and "in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles".&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009"&gt;Hyndman, J. (2009) Violence in Gregory, D., Johnston, R., Pratt, G., Watts, M. and Whatmore, S. eds. Dictionary of Human Geography, Wiley-Blackwell, NJ: 798-799.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories – direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that "geography came late to theorizing violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, S. (2001) Social Geography, in Smelser, N. and Baltes, P. eds. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Oxford, Elsevier, 14293-14299.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.

Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection ''Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence'', which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek and Pred, Alan'', 2006 Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When "modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law",&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s concepts of [[state of exception]] and ''[[homo sacer]]'' are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this "in limbo" reality is designed to be in place "until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998"&gt;Agamben, G. (1998) ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; For Agamben, the physical space of the camp "is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by "juridical procedures and deployments of power"&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; that "no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime";&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; in other words, people become only ''homo sacer''. [[Guantanamo Bay]] could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.

In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]] resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002"&gt;Ringer, G. (2002) "Killing Fields", in Christensen, K. and Levinson, D. eds. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York: 368-370.&lt;/ref&gt; About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at [[Choeung Ek]], which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the [[Killing Fields]].&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made ''homo sacer'' in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's "ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; he "dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area".&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When "symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; cultural violence (defined as when "any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt;) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.

Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, [[Adriana Cavarero]] notes that, "as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009"&gt;Cavarero, A. (2009) ''Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence'', Columbia University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as "horrorism"; that is, "as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009" /&gt; With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}

[[File:No Violence Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign that calls to stop violence]]
As of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=SY|last11=Alvarado|first11=M|last12=Anderson|first12=HR|last13=Anderson|first13=LM|last14=Andrews|first14=KG|last15=Atkinson|first15=C|last16=Baddour|first16=LM|last17=Barker-Collo|first17=S|last18=Bartels|first18=DH|last19=Bell|first19=ML|last20=Benjamin|first20=EJ|last21=Bennett|first21=D|last22=Bhalla|first22=K|last23=Bikbov|first23=B|last24=Bin Abdulhak|first24=A|last25=Birbeck|first25=G|last26=Blyth|first26=F|last27=Bolliger|first27=I|last28=Boufous|first28=S|last29=Bucello|first29=C|last30=Burch|first30=M|last2=Naghavi|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide]] accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt; Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt;

By way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease, Disease and injury regional estimates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries. In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention. Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.

=== Self-directed violence ===
In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf "World Health Statistics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030212923/http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf |date=2011-10-30 }} World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Interpersonal violence ===
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region. In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries. Homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex. Gender differences are least marked for children. For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg ML, Butchart A, Mercy J, Narasimhan V, Waters H, Marshall MS. Interpersonal violence. In Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR, Alleyne G, Claeson M, Evans DB, Prabhat J, Mills A, Musgrove P (eds.) Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd Edition. Washington, D.C.: Oxford University Press and The World Bank, 2006: 755-770.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html "Child maltreatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229124411/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html |date=2011-12-29 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A WHO multi-country study found that between 15–71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html "Violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228151643/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html |date=2011-12-28 }}, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective violence ===
Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict. For example, between 1976 and 2008, [[African American]]s were victims of 329,825 homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide trends in the United States |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |url=http://www1.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010151657/http://www.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide Victims by Race and Sex |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323173400/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high. In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people. This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Krause, Robert Muggah, and Achim Wennmann, "Global Burden of Armed Violence," Geneva Declaration Secretariat, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry]] writes that scholars are divided on the origins of this greater degree of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: {{quote|There are basically two schools of thought on this issue. One holds that warfare... goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage. The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans. Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|page=168|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eJoAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22one+of+the+critical+issues%22|isbn=978-0-19-985900-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jared Diamond]] in his books ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'' and ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'' posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states. For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.

In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial perspective]]. The trend, starting in [[archaeology]] and spreading to [[anthropology]] reached its height in the late half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Keely1&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. War before Civilization. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some newer research in archaeology and [[bioarchaeology]] may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]]|date=4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} According to the book "The Bioarchaeology of Violence" violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P.

Lawrence H. Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in ''[[War Before Civilization]]'' that 87% of [[tribal societies]] were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously. He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize [[endemic warfare]], produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. "Primitive Warfare" of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/Keeley/War-Before-Civilization.html Review of book "War Before Civilization" by Lawrence H.

Fry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence. Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, "by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states" and that "many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|pages=171–3|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' ===
[[Steven Pinker]]'s 2011 book, ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'', roused both acclaim and controversy by asserting that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia.

Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times. A few centuries ago, for example, [[genocide]] was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it. According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Steven Pinker]] |title=The Better Angels of Our Nature |isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pinker's analyses have met with much criticism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |title=Book Review |author=R Epstein |publisher=Scientific American |date=October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914140139/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |archivedate=2016-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |title=Against Pinker's Violence |first=Ben |last=Laws |journal=[[Ctheory]] |date=21 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052358/http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Herman Edward S. | author2 = Peterson David | year =  | title = Steven Pinker on the alleged decline of violence | url = http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | journal = International Socialist Review | volume = 86 | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319022936/http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | archivedate = 2015-03-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |title=The Big Kill – By John Arquilla |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107171044/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Pinker himself, on his FAQ page, states that he does not include catastrophic ecological violence (including violence against wild or domesticated non-human animals or plants, or against ecosystems) or the violence of economic inequality and of coercive working conditions in his definition; he controversially regards these forms of violence as "metaphorical". Some critics have therefore argued that Pinker suffers from "a reductive vision of what it means to be violent."&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;

== Society and culture ==

Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences. Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170920185014/https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm |date=2017-09-20 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eye for an eye|Violence may beget violence]]. The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.

=== Economic effects ===
In countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded. Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.

Additionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy. Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions.

In 2016, the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], released the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace] report, which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be $13.6 trillion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913201606/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[purchasing power parity]] terms.

Throughout history, most religions and individuals like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely [[nonviolent]] means. Gandhi himself once wrote: "A society organized and run on the basis of complete non-violence would be the purest [[anarchy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bharatan Kumarappa, Editor, "For Pacifists," by M.K. Gandhi, Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad, India, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern political ideologies which espouse similar views include pacifist varieties of [[Voluntaryism|voluntarism]], [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[anarchism]] and [[libertarianism]].

Terence Fretheim writing about the Old Testament:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many people, ... only physical violence truly qualifies as violence. But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others.  In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the
blood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).&lt;ref name=Fretheim&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Word &amp; World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119093532/http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7087">'''Victor Grippo''' (10 May 1936 – February 2002) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] painter, engraver and sculptor, considered the father of [[conceptual art]] in Argentina. He was born in [[Junín, Buenos Aires|Junín]], [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], the elder of two sons of an [[Italy|Italian]] [[immigration in Argentina|immigrant]] father and an Argentine mother of [[Albania|Albanese]] origin. 

== Life and Work ==
Grippo was raised in his birthtown, and in his youth he moved to the capital of the province, [[La Plata]], and then to the city of [[Buenos Aires]]. He studied [[Chemistry]] and [[Pharmacy]] in the [[Universidad Nacional de La Plata|University of La Plata]],&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Latin American and Caribbean Art|author=Jane Turner, ed.|first=|publisher=Macmillan Reference Limited|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=305–306|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended seminars by [[Héctor Cartier]] at the Fine Arts School. He had been interested in art from an early age. He started off as a painter and engraver in the 1950s, and in the 1960s he began experimenting with sculpture, and produced animated pieces (with engines and lighting).

In 1966 he held his first solo exhibition at the Lirolay gallery in Buenos Aires, presenting oils linked to geometric abstraction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malba.org|title=Victor Grippo|last=|first=|date=|website=MALBA|archive-url=http://www.malba.org.ar/web/descargas/grippo.pdf|archive-date=12 Jun 2009|dead-url=|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work he has sought a convergence between science and [[art]]. His work, one of whose main motives is the idea of transformation, has always revolved around daily life, the world of work, food and energy. From the beginning he used materials and unconventional means in his objects, sculptures and installations, to reflect on the social and spiritual conditions of the workers, of the artists. It belonged to the group of the thirteen, integrated by Jacques Bedel, Luis Fernando Benedit, Gregorio Dujovny, among others. Finally, this group becomes the CAYC Group. 

Between the years of 1968 and 1970 his works led to a luminous kinetic, machines were wrapped in fabrics, subjected to the surface passage of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sierra|first=Miguel Angel|date=2018|title=Anales de Química. La revista de la Real Sociedad Española de Química.|url=http://analesdequimica.es/index.php/AnalesQuimica|journal=Anales de Química|volume=114|pages=19-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Grippo researches the energy generation processes through very simple technical resources. One of the raw materials used in his work has been the [[potato]] (which he uses as a metaphor)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elogio de la Low- Tech. Historia y estética de las artes electrónicas en América Latina|last=Rodrigo|first=Alonso|publisher=Luna Editores|year=2015|isbn=978- 987- 45732- 1- 6|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|pages=57-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; food that was born in America, but after the conquest spread throughout Europe. 

Grippo, based on its cultural symbolism, used the energy contained in potatoes, forming [[Electric battery|electric batteries]] and connecting them with cables to operate different devices, from a radio to a [[multimeter]] that measured the energy generated. That kind of works became a classic of the artist who was developing in different facilities around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Using electrodes and measuring systems, the artist shows the latent power in plant life.

He creates facilities that are at the same time spaces of liberated energy, behind these works is also found a meaning referring to alchemy and to the efforts to transfigure the material world.

One of his most well-known works is Analogía I (1970), presented in the collective exhibition ''Art Systems I'', at the Museum of Modern Art, and which has been presented later in different versions in different parts of the world.

In 2002 [[Konex Foundation]] from Argentina granted him the Diamond [[Konex Award]], one of the most prestigious awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in the Visual Arts of his country in the last decade.

He made invaluable calculations for quantum physics, relating the atoms and the theories of the absorbent nebula in a totally renewing way with conceptual art, thus achieving a kind of tactile hologram.

The works of this artist no longer speak of the power that technology has to transform the lives of people, but rather of its articulation as an instrument of thought.

Grippo died in Buenos Aires in February 2002.

'''Waunetta McClellan Dominic''' (23 July 1921 – 21 December 1981) was an [[Odawa]] rights activist who spent her career advocating for the United States government to adhere to its treaty obligations to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s. She was one of the founders of the [[Northern Michigan Ottawa Association]] and her influence was widely recognized, especially after winning a 1971 claim against the government for compensation under 19th century treaties. She was also a proponent of Native American fishing rights being protected. In 1979, she was named by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' as "Michiganian of the Year" and in 1996, she was posthumously inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Waunetta G. McClellan was born on 23 July 1921 in [[Petoskey, Michigan]]{{sfn|Michigan Legislature|1982|p=20}} to Elizabeth "Lizzie" (née Taylor) and Levi P. McClellan.{{sfn|Michigan Legislature|1982|p=20}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1920|p=1B}}{{sfn|Michigan Marriage Records|1915|p=367}} Her great-grandfather was a leader of the [[Grand River Band of Ottawas]].{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1969|p=1}}  She initially attended school in Petoskey and completed her studies at the [[Haskell Indian Nations University|Haskell Indian Institute]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. Marrying Robert Dominic in 1940, the couple made their home in [[Detroit]] and [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], before returning to Petoskey in 1944.{{sfn|Michigan Legislature|1982|p=20}}

==Career==
The [[Indian termination policy]] established by the federal government in the 1940s created the [[Indian Claims Commission]] in 1946, as a means of compensating tribes for previous land takings, undervaluations of compensation, and abridgement of rights.{{sfn|Sutton|2014|pp=303–304}} The problem for the Odawa was that the [[Treaty of Detroit (1855)|1855 Treaty of Detroit]] had been interpreted as severing the tribal governments of each of the bands.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=13–14}} To be eligible for filing a claim, they first had to confirm that the bands had "continued to be distinct, self-governing nations".{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=14}} In 1946, the Dominics called for a meeting of local tribes at the local Petoskey grocery store. Only 20 members showed up, making them realize the need to organize. Traveling throughout the state to document descendants of Odawa listed on the Durant Roll (1907–1910), they identified 3,000 American Indians who might be eligible to pursue claims against the U. S. government.{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1969|pp=1, 16}}    
In 1948, Dominic, her father, and her husband founded the [[Northern Michigan Ottawa Association]] (NMOA), with Robert serving as president of the organization and Waunetta serving as secretary.{{sfn|''The Traverse City Record-Eagle''|1968|p=13}} The organization contained eleven bands of northern [[Odawa]] who had been signatories to the [[Treaty of Washington (1836)|1836 Treaty of Washington]] and the subsequently signed 1855 Treaty of Detroit.{{sfn|Cleland|1992|p=271}}{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=14, 18–19}} The following year, they filed a claim under the Claims Commission.{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1969|pp=1, 16}}

Because most of the tribes their organization represented were not reservation tribes, Dominic was concerned about their lack of access to health care. She fought for the right for NMOA members to be treated at the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]'s Kinchloe Indian Clinic. Recognizing how few Michigan Indians had received higher education, she discovered federal programs that could be utilized and worked to assist Indian students in obtaining grants and scholarships.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=127}} Dominic also was a driving force in the Michigan State tuition waiver program for Native American Students.{{sfn|Dominic|2014|p=30}} 

{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#F2BDCD|align=right|quote="You can call us unrecognized, but don't call us unorganized, and furthermore, I don't care if you recognize me or not," said Dominic, "Recognize my Rights".|source=—Waunetta Dominic, 1972 speech to the U. S. Congress{{sfn|Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|1996}}{{sfn|VanDeCar|2013|p=3}}}}

In 1959, the government conceded that the bands of Chippewa and Odawa who had signed the treaties had ceded nearly 13,000,000 acres of land and were entitled to a reassessment of whether they were paid a fair value. Because the [[Keweenaw Bay Indian Community]], [[Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa|L’Anse Lac Vieux Desert Band of Chippewa]], and the [[Ontonagon Band| Ontonagon Band of Chippewa]] had reorganized under the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]], their members were removed as claimants in the suit, which then went to arbitration over the amount of settlement.{{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1959|p=29}} Dominic traversed the state examining land records in each county in the state to analyze the variance in payment made to American Indians and the price white settlers sold their lands for historically. She discovered that when the treaties were written in the nineteenth century, Native Americans were paid half of one cent to seventeen cents per acre, when white transactions in the same period were negotiated between ninety-two and ninety-seven cents per acre.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=125}} 

Finally winning a $12.1 million settlement in 1971, which was reduced to $10.3 million because of funds previously paid,{{sfn|''The Holland Evening Sentinel''|1972|p=28}}{{sfn|''The Traverse City Record-Eagle''|1972|p=1}} the Dominic's battle continued.{{sfn|Cleland|1992|p=271}}{{sfn|Dammann|1997}} Having won the judgement, the problem became how it was to be distributed. The Claims Commission recognized the NMOA and allowed it to pursue the case, but the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] refused to allow the association to reorganize under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]], claiming that as an association rather than a tribal government, each band would need to seek individual recognition.{{sfn|Fletcher|2012|p=165}}{{sfn|Pflüg|1998|p=116}} The initial bill proposed to direct the distribution was rejected by Dominic, as it did not include either non-reservation tribes people{{sfn|''The Evening News''|1973|p=1}} (at that point the only reservation tribes were the three which had been eliminated from the suit and the [[Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians|Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians]], which had been reorganized in 1972){{sfn|''The News-Palladium''|1959|p=29}}{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=18}} nor the [[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum requirements]] the tribe members wanted.{{sfn|''The Escanaba Daily Press''|1971|p=14}}{{sfn|''The Ludington Daily News''|1971|p=2}} 

Dominic was the spokesperson for the (NMOA) on fishing rights, often acting as an intermediary between Native and white fisherman.{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}} In the 1975 a lawsuit, ''United States v. Michigan'', was filed concerning those fishing rights and she testified to tribal procedures for issuing licenses and penalties for infractions.{{sfn|Fletcher|2012|p=202}} The 1979 ruling allowed tribes to continue with gill net fishing, though controversy would continue until 1985 over fishing rights.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=128}} In 1976, upon her husband's death, Dominic became president of the NMOA and led the organization until her death.{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}} Throughout the 1970s, she traveled giving assistance to Odawa with their genealogical records to allow them to participate in the claim distribution and fought to secure that $1.8 million of those funds were set aside for tribes which did not gain federal recognition.{{sfn|Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|1996}}{{sfn|''The Ironwood Daily Globe''|1977|p=2}} She was noted as one of the most influential Native Americans in the state, having led the NMOA to become the largest American Indian organization in the state. In 1979, she was honored by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' as "Michiganian of the Year".{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}}

==Death and legacy==
Dominic died on 21 December 1981 in Petoskey at Northern Michigan Hospital.{{sfn|''UPI''|1981}} She was posthumously inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1996.{{sfn|Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|1996}} Eventually all the bands of the NOMA would gain recognition, though three of the bands, the [[Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians]], the [[Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan]] and ironically, her own band, the [[Grand River Band of Ottawas]] are only recognized at the state level.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=14, 18–19}}{{sfn|Michigan Department of Human Services|2014|p=67}} In 1998, the federal government finally agreed to distribute the funds awarded to the Odawa. Having been held in trust since 1971, the final amount of the award was close to $74 million.{{sfn|Dammann|1997}} In 2014, Dominic was again recognized by the Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame, during an exhibit hosted to celebrate six women involved in the struggle for Civil Rights.{{sfn|Dominic|2014|p=1}}
