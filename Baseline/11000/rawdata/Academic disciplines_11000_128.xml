      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30909">'''Aviation archaeology''' is a recognized sub-discipline within archaeology and underwater archaeology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, M., 2004. Historic aircraft wrecks as archaeological sites. Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology, 28: 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an activity practiced by both enthusiasts and academics in pursuit of finding, documenting, recovering, and preserving sites important in [[aviation history]]. For the most part, these sites are aircraft wrecks and crash sites, but also include structures and facilities related to aviation. It is also known in some circles and depending on the perspective of those involved as '''aircraft archaeology''' or  '''aerospace archaeology''' and has also been described variously as '''crash hunting''', '''underwater aircraft recovery''', '''wreck chasing''', or '''wreckology''' .

== History of Aviation Archaeology and Current Issues ==
[[File:DakotaPlaneCrash-TailSection.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force [[DC-3 Dakota]] crashed on 19 January 1946.]]
The activity dates to post-[[World War II]] [[Europe]] when, after the conflict, numerous aircraft wrecks studded the countryside. Many times, memorials to those involved in the crashes were put together by individuals, families, landholders, or communities.

[[File:B17turbocharger.jpg|right|thumb|B-17 turbocharger, crash debris]]
Crash sites vary in size and content; some may have fuselages, engines, and thousands of parts and debris.  Other sites, like in civilian/commercial crashes, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) will have almost all of the aircraft and debris removed; which makes aviation archaeology more challenging. Remains of military aircraft crash sites may also be removed by various aircraft restoration groups, particularly if the aircraft was found largely intact. In general, most recent-day (since the 1980s) aircraft crashes are removed entirely, due to environmental regulations, leaving very little to indicate the existence of a wreck.

For example, military crashes in Arizona originate from numerous air bases, past and present. Because of the warm and sunny weather, much of the U.S. Army Air Forces flight training was located in the state, both during and after WWII. Numerous air bases dotted the states - creating conditions for numerous training accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircraftarchaeology.com/crash_history_in_arizona.htm Arizona Crash History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106164708/http://www.aircraftarchaeology.com/crash_history_in_arizona.htm |date=January 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Old abandoned US Army Air Corp auxiliary fields and those converted to city municipal airports provide archaeological sites to be researched and investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CO/Airfields_CO_E.htm|title=Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields: Colorado: Northeastern Denver area|author=|date=|website=www.airfields-freeman.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRX7rQdV?url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CO/Airfields_CO_E.htm|archivedate=23 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AircraftDebrisCloseup.jpg|right|thumb|Measure, photograph and log aircraft debris.]]

Keeping a record of a crash site, such as photographs, maps, journals, logs, and all terrain and weather recordings are essential, i.e. the [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]], [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] crash site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloradowreckchasing.tripod.com/GlenwoodB17/GlenB17.html|title=Glenwood B-17|author=|date=|website=coloradowreckchasing.tripod.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191020/http://coloradowreckchasing.tripod.com/GlenwoodB17/GlenB17.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Tells Peak, California|Tells Peak, CA]], B-17 crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Sierras_B-17C_crash_site.htm|title=Crash Site of the B-17C near Tells Peak, CA|author=|date=|website=www.check-six.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927215515/http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Sierras_B-17C_crash_site.htm|archivedate=27 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AircraftPartNumber.jpg|right|thumb|B-17 crash debris.]]
The internet is an ideal media for sharing, recording, educating, and promoting aviation archaeology as a hobby, as well as research projects for local and state aviation historical groups. For identifying aircraft type and manufacturer by part numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/partmanu.htm|title=Aviation Archaeology - Part Number Prefix By Manufacturer|author=|date=|website=www.aviationarchaeology.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015042601/http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/partmanu.htm|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manufacturing inspection stamps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/astamps.htm|title=Aviation Archaeology - Aircraft Inspection Stamps|author=|date=|website=www.aviationarchaeology.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315160856/http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/astamps.htm|archivedate=15 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be analysed.  From detailed [[GPS]] data &amp; maps, to researching accident reports information, numerous resources help create a complete picture of the historic event.  Accident reports, such as the official US Air Force Accident Report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texaswreckchasing.com/Reports/Military/B-36/Sterling%20City/Sterling%20City%20B-36.pdf Sterling City, TX, B-36 Accident Report]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226023144/http://www.texaswreckchasing.com/Reports/Military/B-36/Sterling%20City/Sterling%20City%20B-36.pdf |date=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Form 14 becomes the foundation of archaeology research.  From there, newspaper articles, county clerk records, sheriff &amp; coroner reports, and library records all aid an aviation archaeologist in their research.

== Protection Laws and Regulations ==

=== United States ===
Legal protection of aircraft wreck sites is highly variable. In terms of protection by aircraft ownership, the [[U.S. Navy]] retains indefinite ownership of all [[List of United States naval aircraft|Naval aircraft]], including terrestrial or submerged wreck sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq28-1.htm|title=Historic Preservation Policy Regarding US Navy Sunken Military Craft|author=|date=|website=navy.mil|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407211612/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq28-1.htm|archivedate=7 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Air Force]] has no policies regarding disturbance of vintage aircraft wreck sites, unless human remains or weaponry remain unrecovered at the site.
For [[vintage aircraft]], including vintage [[military aircraft]], that are usually considered abandoned when wrecked, the wreck site and all associated contents are subject to the protection laws of the land upon which it rests. The language of [[cultural heritage]] protection laws are not aviation specific, so all protection laws pertaining to aviation sites are based on interpretation. Most federal and state laws are, however, explicit in describing cultural resources as either ‘objects, sites, or otherwise, of historic value’&lt;ref&gt;National Historic Preservation Act 1966 Public Law 102-575 16 U.S.C. 470w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Historic Landmarks Program 36CFR65 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘military or social history’&lt;ref&gt;California public resources code Section 5020-5029.5&lt;/ref&gt; and deem the time limit as over fifty years old.
If an aircraft wreck is over fifty years old, which includes all aviation wreck sites from WWII, and crashed on what is currently [[federal lands]], the sites are automatically protected under National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/toolboxes/documents/geocaching/36cfr2.1.pdf|title=National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1|author=|date=|website=wilderness.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000100/http://www.wilderness.net/toolboxes/documents/geocaching/36cfr2.1.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; against disturbance of any kind without a permit. Aviation sites, for example, a vintage [[hangar]] on an airport or a wreck site on the path of a proposed highway, are also immediately subject to Section 106 review if they are to be disturbed by a project that either requires a federal permit or uses federal funds. In most cases, the [[State Historic Preservation Officer]] will determine whether or not an aviation site is eligible for the register.

The National Register deems aviation wreck sites as “any aircraft that has been crashed, ditched, damaged, stranded, or abandoned”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/aviation/|title=Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Historic Aviation Properties, National Register of Historic Places Bulletin|first=Jeff|last=Joeckel|date=29 November 2001|website=nps.gov|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010183839/https://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/aviation/|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It designates the protection terms for aviation history sites as well, including abandoned [[airfields]] or facilities sites, testing or experimental sites, land or water [[air terminal]]s, or [[airway beacon]]s and navigational aids.

State lands protection laws vary widely across the nation but the language describing a historical resource is the same as federal laws. Therefore, aviation properties and aircraft wrecks on [[State land]]s can be protected under various environmental, public resource, and historical property laws as outlined per state for the protection of archaeological and historic resources.
Any [[archaeological survey]], [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], or activity that disturbs wither wreck or aviation property remains can, in some cases, be permitted on federal and state lands under a permitting process through the regulating entity.
If an aircraft wreck, or the remains of any aviation property, is located on private land it is not automatically protected by any federal, state, or local law and any survey or excavation work must be permitted by the land owner.

Under the 'Sunken Military Craft Act’ (SMCA) of 2004, it is illegal to disturb, remove, or injure the wreck sites or associated contents of [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval]] or any submerged [[military aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-12a.htm History.Navy.mil: ''The Sunken Military Craft Act'' (US)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407211727/http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-12a.htm |date=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The act identifies military craft as including any sunken military aircraft or military spacecraft that was owned or operated by a government when it sank, and includes the associated contents. Because of the U.S. Navy’s retaining of ownership of all military craft, the act applies to any U.S. Navy aircraft, even if in international or other country’s territorial waters. The act also applies to any foreign military craft in U.S. territorial waters. Persons wishing to conduct archaeological or research exploration of any submerged military aircraft can apply to the [[Naval History and Heritage Command]]’s [[Underwater Archaeology Branch]] for a permit. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard has similar policies and permitting requirements to the Navy.
The SMCA includes penalties associated with any unauthorized disturbances of sunken military craft as a fine and a liability for the reasonable costs incurred in recovery of archaeological or cultural information, storage, restoration, care, maintenance, and conservation.

As a part of federal air regulations, NTSB Part 830, protects any aircraft whose accident cause is under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntsb.gov/aviation/report.htm NTSB Part 830:  ''U.S. Accident Preservation and Reporting Regulations'' (US)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527084527/http://ntsb.gov/aviation/report.htm |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/E9-30398.pdf US Federal Registry: ''49 CFR Part 830'']&lt;/ref&gt; NTSB officials will routinely seize portions of wrecked aircraft for further analysis. Most of the time, after their study is complete, the sequestered debris is returned to the owners' representation - most often the aircraft's insurance company.  However, examples like the reconstructed wreckage of [[TWA Flight 800]] are held in perpetuity by the NTSB to education the public and future investigators on the NTSB's role in transportation safety.
 
=== United Kingdom ===
The laws in the UK cover the remains of all aircraft which have crashed during military service (land or sea) are protected by the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]]. This Act defines an offence of tampering with, damage to, moving, or unearthing the aircraft remains. Exceptions apply to those holding licences, which can be issued by the Secretary of State, authorising specific procedures to be performed.

For the wreck-chasing hobbyist there is a self-regulating body, the [[British Aviation Archaeological Council]] (BAAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk/index.htm|title=British Aviation Archaeological Council|author=|date=|website=www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124183035/http://www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk/index.htm|archivedate=24 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines ethical standards of behaviour, coordinates activities and provides a forum for discussion for its member groups. Not all active groups in the UK are members of this organisation.

== Types of Aviation Archaeology Sites ==

=== Terrestrial Sites ===
Aviation history sites on land that can be subject to archaeological survey or excavation can include airports (which can contain hangars, terminal, other facilities, etc.), crash sites, monuments, or even properties associated with important persons or events in aviation history.
Some examples of potential and current archaeological sites:

==== Aircraft Crash Sites ====
The Loon Lake B-23 Dragon crash site in Payette National Forest, Idaho is a remarkably intact example of an aircraft wreck. The crew survived and was rescued, and some avionics removed from the site, and it currently is the subject of a teaching aviation archaeology field school in various years.

==== Abandoned airfields ====
[[File:ArlingtonAuxiliaryAirfieldColoNWview.jpg|thumb|left|Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield: high view from the SW corner of the triangular runway&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoaviationarchaeology.com/Expeditions/LaJuntaAAFSatelliteFieldSurveyProject.aspx ''Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield Aerial View] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181041/http://www.coloradoaviationarchaeology.com/Expeditions/LaJuntaAAFSatelliteFieldSurveyProject.aspx |date=2011-10-06 }}, see image no. 11&lt;/ref&gt; looking WNW, [[Arlington, Colorado|Arlington, CO]], 2006]]
[[File:ArlingtionAuxiliaryAirfieldColoRunway.jpg|thumb|right|Arlington Airfield: E/W runway looking west, notice the large sections of asphalt and the vegetation changes along and on the runway, 2006]]
Abandoned airfields can yield much information of historic information about aviation and related industries.  From civilian airfields to military airfields, aviation archaeologists can find, uncover, and recover a variety of artifacts, just to name a few: aircraft parts with serial numbers, equipment parts, asphalt or runway material, variety of contamination, structures and foundations, businesses and economics, to community and cultural changes. With the closure of a military airbase, the street system and runways become local expansion of city streets and business; one example is the community conversion of [[Lowry Air Force Base]] to a local residential, commercial, and educational environment. Other bases, like the [[Arlington, Colorado#Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield|Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield]] reverted to farming and ranching.

In 1990, 1994, and 1998, archaeologists investigated, using airborne remote sensing studies and limited excavation, a vintage hangar of the [[Huffman Prairie Flying Field]] Site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The investigations were “designed to provide information needed for site management by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the [[Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park]] of the National Park Service. The geophysical and [[remote sensing]] investigations revealed magnetic, electromagnetic, and ground penetrating radar anomalies and infrared thermal images associated with the hangar structure. The archaeological excavations located an in situ wood post, posthole features, and artifacts which represent archaeological remains of the actual hangar”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA352192 "Archaeological, Geophysical, and Remote Sensing Investigations of the 1910 Wright Brothers' Hangar, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113090618/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA352192 |date=2016-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Huffman Prairie Flying Field]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Another example is [[Hamilton Army Airfield]] in [[Novato, California]]. It was in use from 1929 until 1976. It was eventually turned over to the city of Novato for development of housing. The runway is also part of tidal wetland restoration effort currently underway by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], [[California Coastal Conservancy]], and the [[San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission]].

==== Abandoned missile silos and sites ====
[[California]] has [[missile]] launch sites abandoned by the [[US Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ed-thelen.org/loc-c.html|title=Missile Sites|author=|date=|website=ed-thelen.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817065752/http://ed-thelen.org/loc-c.html|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeological research includes these sites throughout the United States.  Exploring and hiking around abandoned [[Missile silo|silos]] and sites may constitute trespassing as well as being dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siloworld.net/|title=SiloWorld|first=|last=SiloMan|date=|website=www.siloworld.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006212828/http://www.siloworld.net/|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Permission from current [[land owner]]s or caretakers is imperative.  Research and formal site investigations adds to the historical record of the [[Cold War]]. One such site is the [[Minuteman Missile National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/mimi/index.htm|title=Minuteman Missile National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|author=|date=|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413042718/https://www.nps.gov/mimi/index.htm|archivedate=13 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] is a decommissioned [[Cold War]] era [[Nike Missile]] base, [[Nike Missile Site SF-88]]. In 1954, it was armed with [[Nike Ajax]] missiles. In 1958, it was converted to [[Nike Hercules]] nuclear missiles. After it was shut down in 1974, it was turned over to the [[National Park Service]], and it open for to the public regularly. [http://www.nps.gov/goga/nike-missile-site.htm]

=== Underwater crash sites ===
A [[1948 Lake Mead Boeing B-29 crash|B-29 "Superfortress" Serial No. 45-21847]] ditched in Lake Mead in 1949. This particular aircraft is listed in the National Register under Criterion C as an example of a significant type of aircraft construction and under Criterion D for it potential to yield important information.

The remains of the [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)#Wreck site exploration|USS Macon Airship]] and its associated [[F9C Sparrowhawk]]s are located at around 1500 feet in the [[Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]]. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) has run survey expeditions to the site, creating photomosaics to track deterioration. The wreck site is listed on the National Register.

== Underwater surveying and recovery ==
Underwater search and recovery is a complex aspect of aviation archaeology. Dive and recovery team have to do extensive research and planning before any recovery is performed. The aircraft site may be left as a memorial and not recovered. Once an aircraft has been located, an underwater survey is conducted before recovery operations begin. Many tasks are established and the research is a long process that requires the detailed review numerous and various sources of information. The complexities include a great deal of preparation, extensive training,  precise planning, and very technical equipment and coordination. Conservation has often proved very difficult&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association ''Dive Recovery Team''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908012658/http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |date=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Australian focus has been on underwater aviation archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-web/content/broken-wings-introduction Western Australian Museum ''Broken Wings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319211857/http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-web/content/broken-wings-introduction |date=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; partly as a result of the interest of the relatively large number of maritime archaeologists and shipwreck conservators in the field. This has resulted in numerous studies and reports, including some cross-fertilization or ideas, theory and techniques with practitioners in other parts of the world, with a strong emphasis on the involvement of conservators.&lt;ref&gt;http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/fallenangels/fallenangels.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704074734/http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/fallenangels/fallenangels.html |date=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Underwater aviation archaeology commenced in Australia at the wrecks of the Dornier, Catalina, and Sunderland Flying Boats destroyed by Japanese fighters at Broome in WWII. These lie, both in the intertidal zone,  and in deeper water.&lt;ref&gt;http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/treasures/broome/broome.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704074614/http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/treasures/broome/broome.html |date=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study continued in Darwin in the Northern Territory with research and fieldwork at its series of submerged PBY Catalina wrecks,&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Silvano (2001). Wings Beneath the Sea: the aviation archaeology of Catalina Flying Boats in Darwin Harbour, Northern Territory. Unpublished Master of Arts thesis, Northern Territory University (now Charles Darwin University), Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the study has spread to other regions in Australia, partly as a result of the Interest of Flinders University and its postgraduate student body.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ford, J., 2006. WW Aviation Archaeology in Victoria Australia. Department of Maritime Archaeology. Flinders University. Adelaide.&lt;/ref&gt;  While military aircraft remain the property of their respective governments unless delegated to a third party, submerged aircraft wrecks (such as the wrecks at Broome in Western Australia), have proven to be quite difficult to protect from unauthorized recoveries and looting. Those in Broome are now protected under the provisions of the 1990 Heritage of Western Australia Act.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, M., Green, J., Jung, S. and Souter, C., 2002. The Broome Flying Boats: Papers relating to the nomination of a suite of flying boat wrecks at Broome to the Register of Heritage Places under the Heritage Of Western Australia Act 1990. Report – Department of Maritime Archaeology Western Australian Maritime Museum, No. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a profession ==
In America, aviation archaeologists, crosstrained in other areas of study, are found in the employ of [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] (JPAC), traveling to former war zones throughout the world, to search for the remains of American servicemen and women that have been lost.  Many of these losses involve aircraft mishaps in remote and difficult to reach areas. A group of volunteers, under the banner of "[[BentProp Project|The BentProp Project]]", have pursued American military wreck sites and remains without disturbing them; their findings are forwarded to JPAC. In Australia and in some other parts of the world, where there are human remains involved,  a tendency has been for the armed forces to secure the services of forensic anthropologists and crash investigators.

Professional aviation archaeologists may also be involved in the recovery of near-complete examples of wrecked or abandoned aircraft for profit.  The clients of these professionals range from private individuals and aviation museums, to government agencies. Often these aircraft are in remote areas, which aids wreckage preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hoffman, Carl|year=2001|title=Hunting Warbirds - The Obsessive Quest for the Lost Aircraft of World War II|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-43617-2|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''[[Glacier Girl]]'', a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] that was successfully recovered from below the [[Greenland]] ice cap, and restored to [[airworthy]] condition, and ''[[Kee Bird]]'', a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] also abandoned on the Greenland ice cap, but severely damaged by recovery efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1661">'''Bacterivores''' are free-living, generally [[heterotrophic]] organisms, exclusively [[microscopic]], which obtain energy and nutrients primarily or entirely from the consumption of [[bacteria]]. Many species of [[amoeba]] are bacterivores, as well as other types of [[protozoans]]. Commonly, all species of bacteria will be prey, but spores of some species, such as ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', will never be prey, because of their cellular attributes.

==In Microbiology==
Bacterivores can sometimes be a problem in [[microbiology]] studies. For instance, when scientists seek to assess microorganisms in samples from the environment (such as freshwater), the samples will often be contaminated with bacterivores, which will interfere with the growing of bacteria for study. By adding [[cycloheximide]], the bacterivores will be inhibited and the bacteria will grow normally. For bacteria adsorbed into sediment, 2g of cycloheximide per 100g of sediment needs to be added. For experiments with spores (for example spores of ''[[Clostridium perfringens|C. perfringens]]''), it is not necessary to add cycloheximide to the samples.

==Examples==
* ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''
*''Ceriodaphnia quadrangula''
*''Diaphanosoma brachyura''
*''[[Vorticella]]''
*''[[Paramecium]]''
* Many species of [[Protozoan|Protozoa]]

'''Base-richness''' in [[ecology]] is the level in water or [[soil]] of [[Base (chemistry)|chemical base]]s, such as [[calcium]] or [[magnesium]] [[ion]]s.  Many [[organism]]s are restricted to base-rich environments.  Chemical bases are [[alkali]]s, and so '''base-rich''' environments are [[pH|neutral]] or alkaline.  Because '''base-poor''' environments have few bases, they are dominated by environmental [[acid]]s (usually [[organic acid]]s) and so are [[pH|acidic]].  However, the relationship between base-richness and acidity is not a rigid one &amp;ndash; changes in the levels of acids (such as [[Carbonic acid|dissolved carbon dioxide]]) may significantly change acidity without affecting base-richness.  

Base-rich terrestrial environments are characteristic of areas where the underlying rocks are [[limestone]].  [[Seawater]] is also base-rich, so maritime and [[Ocean|marine]] environments are themselves base-rich.

Base-poor environments are characteristic of areas where the underlying rocks are [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], or where the water is derived directly from rainfall ([[ombrotrophic]]).

==Examples of base-rich environments==
* [[Calcareous grassland]]
* [[Fen]]
* [[Limestone pavement]]
* [[Maquis shrubland]]
* [[Taxus|Yew]] woodland

==Examples of base-poor environments==
* [[Bog]]
* [[Heath (habitat)]]
* [[Poor fen]]
* [[Moorland]]
* [[Pine]] woodland
* [[Tundra]]

The '''Centre for Development and the Environment''' ({{lang-no|Senter for utvikling og miljø}}, SUM) is a research institute which is part of the [[University of Oslo]]. Its focus areas are [[international development]] and [[environmental studies]].

==History==
The Centre for Development and the Environment was established in 1990, following the work with the report ''[[Our Common Future]]'' (the Brundtland Report), presented by the [[Brundtland Commission]] chaired by Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], and the increased focus on the environment and sustainable development.

In 2000, the Program for Research and Documentation for a Sustainable Society (ProSus), formerly called the Project for an Alternative Future (established 1984), was merged into the Centre for Development and the Environment. ProSus was established on the initiative of 17 organisations and was funded by parliament over the Norwegian state budget; it was part of the [[Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities]] from the early 1990s and became part of the University of Oslo in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2000/09/prosus-vaktbikkje-for-miljoeet.html ProSus - vaktbikkje for miljøet], ''Uniforum'', 22 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ProSus was discontinued as a separate programme in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Nyheter/Nye+vilkar+for+ProSus+fra+2006/1236685409823 Nye vilkår for ProSus fra 2006], [[Research Council of Norway]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The centre is placed directly under the University Board of the University of Oslo. Its Board comprises representatives from the relevant faculties of the university, that is the faculties of Social Sciences, Arts, Natural Sciences, and Law. In addition, the Board has two members not connected to the university. The current director is [[Kristi Anne Stølen]].

It is funded by the University as well as organizations such as the [[Research Council of Norway]], NUFU (the Norwegian Universities' Committee for Development Research and Education), the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of the Environment|Ministry of the Environment]], [[NORAD]] and the [[World Bank]].

More than 50 people are affiliated with the Centre for Development and the Environment. The centre hosts the [[Arne Næss]] Programme on Global Justice and the Environment, which includes the Arne Næss Chair, which is awarded each year to "one or several scholars of international standing who have made a significant contribution to the study of global justice and the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sum.uio.no/english/research/projects/arne-ness-chair/ Arne Næss Programme on Global Justice and the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Loaded centrifugal governor (New Catechism of the Steam Engine, 1904).jpg|thumb|The [[centrifugal governor]] is an early [[proportional control]] mechanism.]]
A '''control system''' manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using [[control loop]]s. It can range from a single home heating controller using a [[thermostat]] controlling a domestic boiler to large [[Industrial control system]]s which are used for controlling [[Process (engineering)|processes]] or machines.

For continuously modulated control, a [[feedback controller]] is used to automatically control a process or operation.   The control system compares the value or status of the [[process variable]] (PV) being controlled with the desired value or [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] (SP), and applies the difference as a control signal to bring the process variable output of the plant to the same value as the setpoint.

For [[Sequential logic|sequential]] and [[combinational logic]], software logic, such as in a [[programmable logic controller]], is used.

==Open-loop and closed-loop control==
There are two common classes of control action: open loop and closed loop. In an open-loop control system, the control action from the controller is independent of the process variable. An example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer. The control action is the switching on or off of the boiler. The process variable is the building temperature.This controller operates the heating system for a constant time regardless of the temperature of the building.

In a closed-loop control system, the control action from the controller is dependent on the desired and actual process variable. In the case of the boiler analogy, this would utilise a thermostat to monitor the building temperature, and feed back a signal to ensure the controller output maintains the building temperature close to that set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to control a process variable at the same value as the setpoint. For this reason, closed-loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.&lt;ref&gt;"Feedback and control systems" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feedback control systems==
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
[[File:Ideal feedback model.svg|thumb|right | A basic feedback loop]]

In the case of linear [[feedback]] systems, a [[control loop]] including [[sensor]]s, control algorithms, and actuators is arranged in an attempt to regulate a variable at a [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] (SP).  An everyday example is the [[cruise control]] on a road vehicle; where external influences such as gradients would cause speed changes, and the driver has the ability to alter the desired set speed. The [[PID algorithm]] in the controller restores the actual speed to the desired speed in the optimum way, with minimal delay or overshoot, by controlling the power output of the vehicle's engine.

Control systems that include some sensing of the results they are trying to achieve are making use of feedback and can adapt to varying circumstances to some extent. [[Open-loop controller|Open-loop control systems]] do not make use of feedback, and run only in pre-arranged ways.

==Logic control==
Logic control systems for industrial and commercial machinery were historically implemented by interconnected electrical [[relay]]s and [[cam timer]]s using [[ladder logic]]. Today, most such systems are constructed with [[microcontroller]]s or more specialized [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). The notation of ladder logic is still in use as a programming method for PLCs.&lt;ref name="Kuphaldt LADDER LOGIC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuphaldt|first=Tony R.|title=Chapter 6  LADDER LOGIC|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Digital/DIGI_6.html|work=Lessons In Electric Circuits -- Volume IV|accessdate=22 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912090415/http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/Digital/DIGI_6.html|archivedate=12 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logic controllers may respond to switches and sensors, and can cause the machinery to start and stop various operations through the use of [[actuator]]s.  Logic controllers are used to sequence mechanical operations in many applications. Examples include elevators, washing machines and other systems with interrelated operations. An automatic sequential control system may trigger a series of mechanical actuators in the correct sequence to perform a task. For example, various electric and pneumatic transducers may fold and glue a cardboard box, fill it with product and then seal it in an automatic packaging machine.

PLC software can be written in many different ways – ladder diagrams, SFC ([[sequential function chart]]s) or [[Instruction list|statement lists]].&lt;ref name="Ian Brady PLCs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Ian|title=Programmable logic controllers - benefits and applications|url=http://www.optimacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PLC-report.pdf|work=PLCs|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202000040/http://www.optimacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PLC-report.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

==On–off control==
{{main|Bang–bang control}}
A [[thermostat]] can be described as a bang-bang  controller. When the temperature, PV, goes below a SP, the heater is switched on. Another example could be a pressure switch on an air compressor. When the pressure, PV, drops below the setpoint, SP, the pump is powered. Refrigerators and vacuum pumps contain similar mechanisms.

Simple on–off control systems like these are cheap and effective.

==Linear control==
Linear control systems use [[Linear system|linear]] negative [[feedback]] to produce a control signal to maintain the controlled process variable (PV) at the desired setpoint (SP).

===Proportional control===
{{main|Proportional control}}
[[File:Second order transfer function.svg|thumb|right|300px|Step responses for a second order system defined by the [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;H(s)=\frac{\omega^2_n}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_ns+\omega^2_n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the damping ratio and &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[undamped]] natural frequency.]]

Proportional control  is a type of linear [[feedback]] control system in which a correction is applied to the controlled variable which is proportional to the difference between the desired value (setpoint – SP) and the measured value (process value – PV).  Two classic mechanical examples are the toilet bowl [[Ballcock|float proportioning valve]] and the [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]].

The proportional control system is more complex than an [[on–off control]] system like a bi-metallic domestic [[thermostat]], but simpler than a [[PID controller|proportional-integral-derivative]] (PID) control system used in something like an automobile [[cruise control]]. On–off control will work quite well eventually, over a long time compared to the overall system response time, but is not effective for rapid and timely corrections and responses. Proportional control overcomes this by modulating the output to the controlling device, such as a [[control valve]] at a level which avoids instability, but applies correction as fast as practicable by applying the optimum quantity of proportional correction.

A drawback of proportional control is that it cannot eliminate the residual SP–PV error, as it requires an error to generate a proportional output. To overcome this the [[PI controller]] was devised, which uses a proportional term (P) to remove the gross error, and an integral term (I) to eliminate the residual offset error by integrating the error over time to produce an "I" component within the controller output.

In some systems there are practical limits to the range of the manipulated variable (MV). For example, a heater can be off or fully on, or a valve can be closed or fully open. Adjustments to the gain simultaneously alter the range of error values over which the MV is between these limits. The width of this range, in units of the error variable and therefore of the PV, is called the ''proportional band'' (PB) which is the inverse of the proportional gain. While the gain is useful in mathematical treatments, the proportional band is often referred to in practical situations.

====Furnace example====
When controlling the temperature of an [[industry|industrial]] [[furnace]], it is usually better to control the opening of the fuel [[valve]] ''in proportion to'' the current needs of the furnace.  This helps avoid thermal shocks and applies heat more effectively.

At low gains, only a small corrective action is applied when errors are detected. The system may be safe and stable, but may be sluggish in response to changing conditions. Errors will remain uncorrected for relatively long periods of time and the system is [[overdamped]]. If the proportional gain is increased, such systems become more responsive and errors are dealt with more quickly. There is an optimal value for the gain setting when the overall system is said to be [[critically damped]]. Increases in loop gain beyond this point lead to oscillations in the PV and such a system is [[underdamped]].

=====Underdamped=====
In the furnace example, suppose the temperature is increasing towards a setpoint at which, say, 50% of the available power will be required for steady-state. At low temperatures, 100% of available power is applied. When the process value (PV) is within, say 10° of the SP the heat input begins to be reduced by the proportional controller. This implies a 20° proportional band (PB) from full to no power input, evenly spread around the setpoint value. At the setpoint the controller will be applying 50% power as required, but stray stored heat within the heater sub-system and in the walls of the furnace will keep the measured temperature rising beyond what is required. At 10° above SP, we reach the top of the proportional band (PB) and no power is applied, but the temperature may continue to rise even further before beginning to fall back. Eventually as the PV falls back into the PB, heat is applied again, but now the heater and the furnace walls are too cool and the temperature falls too low before its fall is arrested, so that the oscillations continue.

The temperature oscillations that an underdamped furnace control system produces are unacceptable for many reasons, including the waste of fuel and time (each oscillation cycle may take many minutes), as well as the likelihood of seriously overheating both the furnace and its contents.

=====Overdamped=====
Suppose that the gain of the control system is reduced drastically and it is restarted. As the temperature approaches, say 30° below SP (A 60° proportional band (PB) this time), the heat input begins to be reduced, the rate of heating of the furnace has time to slow and, as the heat is still further reduced, it eventually is brought up to setpoint, just as 50% power input is reached and the furnace is operating as required. There was some wasted time while the furnace crept to its final temperature using only 52% then 51% of available power, but at least no harm was done. By carefully increasing the gain (i.e. reducing the width of the PB) this overdamped and sluggish behavior can be improved until the system is critically damped for this SP temperature. Doing this is known as 'tuning' the control system. A well-tuned proportional furnace temperature control system will usually be more effective than on-off control, but will still respond more slowly than the furnace could under skillful manual control.

===PID control===
[[File:PID en updated feedback.svg|right|thumb|300px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller]]
[[File:PID Compensation Animated.gif|right|thumb|300px|Effects of varying PID parameters (K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;,K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) on the step response of a system.]]
{{main|PID controller}}
Apart from sluggish performance to avoid oscillations, another problem with proportional-only control is that power application is always in direct proportion to the error. In the example above we assumed that the set temperature could be maintained with 50% power. What happens if the furnace is required in a different application where a higher set temperature will require 80% power to maintain it? If the gain was finally set to a 50° PB, then 80% power will not be applied unless the furnace is 15° below setpoint, so for this other application the operators will have to remember always to set the setpoint temperature 15° higher than actually needed. This 15° figure is not completely constant either: it will depend on the surrounding ambient temperature, as well as other factors that affect heat loss from or absorption within the furnace.

To resolve these two problems, many feedback control schemes include mathematical extensions to improve performance. The most common extensions lead to proportional-integral-derivative control, or [[PID controller|PID control]].

====Derivative action====
The [[derivative]] part is concerned with the rate-of-change of the error with time: If the measured variable approaches the setpoint rapidly, then the actuator is backed off early to allow it to coast to the required level; conversely if the measured value begins to move rapidly away from the setpoint, extra effort is applied—in proportion to that rapidity—to try to maintain it.

Derivative action makes a control system behave much more intelligently. On control systems like the tuning of the temperature of a furnace, or perhaps the motion-control of a heavy item like a gun or camera on a moving vehicle, the derivative action of a well-tuned PID controller can allow it to reach and maintain a setpoint better than most skilled human operators could.

If derivative action is over-applied, it can lead to oscillations too. An example would be a PV that increased rapidly towards SP, then halted early and seemed to "shy away" from the setpoint before rising towards it again.

====Integral action====

[[File:Change with Ki.png|thumb|right|300px|Change of response of second order system to a step input for varying Ki values.]]

The integral term magnifies the effect of long-term steady-state errors, applying ever-increasing effort until they reduce to zero.  In the example of the furnace above working at various temperatures, if the heat being applied does not bring the furnace up to setpoint, for whatever reason, [[integral]] action increasingly ''moves'' the proportional band relative to the setpoint until the PV error is reduced to zero and the setpoint is achieved.

====Ramp up % per minute====

Some controllers include the option to limit the "ramp up % per minute". This option can be very helpful in stabilizing small boilers (3 MBTUH), especially during the summer, during light loads.
A utility boiler "unit may be required to change load at a rate of as much as 5% per minute (IEA Coal Online - 2, 2007)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seeei.org.il/prdFiles/2702_desc3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805131600/http://www.seeei.org.il/prdFiles/2702_desc3.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-05 |df= }} ABB: Power Generation Energy Efficient Design of Auxiliary Systems in Fossil-Fuel Power Plants, Page 262, Section: Load Following
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===
It is possible to [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] the PV or error signal. Doing so can reduce the response of the system to undesirable frequencies, to help reduce instability or oscillations. Some feedback systems will oscillate at just one frequency. By filtering out that frequency, more "stiff" feedback can be applied, making the system more responsive without shaking itself apart.

Feedback systems can be combined. In [[PID controller#Cascade control|cascade control]], one control loop applies control algorithms to a measured variable against a setpoint, but then provides a varying setpoint to another control loop rather than affecting process variables directly. If a system has several different measured variables to be controlled, separate control systems will be present for each of them.

[[Control engineering]] in many applications produces control systems that are more complex than PID control. Examples of such fields include [[fly-by-wire]] aircraft control systems, chemical plants, and oil refineries. [[Model predictive control]] systems are designed using specialized computer-aided-design software and empirical mathematical models of the system to be controlled.

Hybrid systems of PID and logic control are widely used. The output from a linear controller may be interlocked by logic for instance.

==Fuzzy logic==
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
[[Fuzzy logic]] is an attempt to apply the easy design of logic controllers to the control of complex continuously varying systems. Basically, a measurement in a fuzzy logic system can be partly true, that is if yes is 1 and no is 0, a fuzzy measurement can be between 0 and 1.

The rules of the system are written in natural language and translated into fuzzy logic. For example, the design for a furnace would start with: "If the temperature is too high, reduce the fuel to the furnace. If the temperature is too low, increase the fuel to the furnace."

Measurements from the real world (such as the temperature of a furnace) are converted to values between 0 and 1 by seeing where they fall on a triangle. Usually, the tip of the triangle is the maximum possible value which translates to 1.&lt;!--  Explain please, presumably two input sensors are required to form a triangle, one just lies on a straight line and more will fill n-dimensional space. --&gt;

Fuzzy logic, then, modifies [[Boolean logic]] to be arithmetical. Usually the "not" operation is "output = 1 - input," the "and" operation is "output = input.1 multiplied by input.2," and "or" is "output = 1 - ((1 - input.1) multiplied by (1 - input.2))". This reduces to [[Boolean arithmetic]] if values are restricted to 0 and 1, instead of allowed to range in the [[unit interval]] [0,1].

The last step is to "defuzzify" an output.  Basically, the fuzzy calculations make a value between zero and one.  That number is used to select a value on a line whose slope and height converts the fuzzy value to a real-world output number.  The number then controls real machinery.

If the triangles are defined correctly and rules are right the result can be a good control system.

When a robust fuzzy design is reduced into a single, quick calculation, it begins to resemble a conventional feedback loop solution and it might appear that the fuzzy design was unnecessary. However, the fuzzy logic paradigm may provide scalability for large control systems where conventional methods become unwieldy or costly to derive.

[[Fuzzy electronics]] is an electronic technology that uses fuzzy logic instead of the two-value logic more commonly used in [[digital electronics]].

==Physical implementation==
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|thumb|A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
[[File:Hydraulic press control panel.jpg|thumb|right|A control panel of a hydraulic heat press machine with dedicated software for that function]]
The range of implementation is from [[compact controller]]s often with dedicated software for a particular machine or device, to [[distributed control system]]s for industrial process control.

Logic systems and feedback controllers are usually implemented with [[programmable logic controller]]s.

[[File:Formation of coral.jpg|thumb|upright|Formation of fringing reefs (top), barrier reefs (middle) and atolls (bottom).&lt;ref name=noaa /&gt;]]
One of the marine ecosystems found in the [[Virgin Islands]] are the [[coral reef]]s. These coral reefs can be located between the islands of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], and [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]]. These coral reefs have an area of 297.9 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along with other marine habitats that are in between.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;Catanzaro, Don, Rick Nemeth, Caroline Rogers, Zandy Hillis-Starr, and Marcia Taylor, [https://www.coris.noaa.gov/portals/pdfs/status_coralreef_usvi.pdf "The Status of the Coral Reefs of The U.S. Virgin Islands"]&lt;/ref&gt; The way these coral reefs grow are by coral larvae swimming freely and attaching themselves to hard surfaces around the islands and start to develop a skeleton on the outside of their skin to protect themselves from predators but also allow a new place for other coral larvae to attach to and grow on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coral.org/coral-reefs-101/coral-reef-ecology/how-coral-reefs-grow/ "How Coral Reefs Grow"] Coral Reef Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; These corals can form into three different structures; [[fringing reef]]s, which are reefs that are close to the shore, barrier reefs, which are reefs that are alongside the shore and is separated by deep water, and an [[atoll reef]] which is a coral reef that circles a [[lagoon]] or body of water.&lt;ref name=noaa&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/corals/coral04_reefs.html "Corals"] NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Corals.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution == 
As stated, the coral reefs such as fringing reefs, [[Deep-water coral|deep reef]]s, patch reefs and [[spur and groove formation]] are distributed over three islands in the Virgin Islands which are St. Croix ([[Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve]], [[Buck Island Reef National Monument]]), St. Thomas, and St. John ([[Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument]]). The coral reefs found offshore of St. Thomas and St. John  are distributed patchily around the islands. Additionally, a developed barrier reef system surrounds St. Croix along its eastern and southern shores.[[File:Corals 4.jpg|thumb|Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas.]]

== Ecology ==
The coral reefs as well as hard-bottom habitat accounts for 297.9 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt; The coral reefs are home to diverse species. There are over 40 species of [[scleractinian corals]] and three species of [[Millepora]].&lt;ref name="fourth"&gt;Caldow, Chris, Barry Devine, Peter Edmunds et al. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227125836_Ecology_of_Coral_Reefs_in_the_US_Virgin_Islands "Ecology of Coral Reefs in the US Virgin Islands"] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Live scleractinian species are found throughout the Virgin Islands, but mainly around [[Buck Island Reef National Monument|Buck Island]], St. Croix and St. John.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt; More specifically based on a survey from 2001-2006, listed are a total of 215 fishes from St. John and 202 from St. Croix.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; Four species of [[sea turtle]]s are found within the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The coral reefs are impacted by freshwater environments from the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco River]] in the form of anticyclonic rings which are rich in nutrients.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Hazards ==
This marine environment has been degraded in a variety of ways. One of the ways in which the corals have been affected is by the dust from Africa.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; This dust might be affected the corals by causing degradation.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; Apart from the dust, the corals also experience a few diseases. There is [[black band disease|black-band disease]] which infects major coral reefs such as [[Montastraea annularis]].&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The most severe diseases are the [[white band disease|white-band]] and [[white plague (coral disease)|white plague]] disease.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The branching acroporid have been influenced the most.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Corals 5.jpg|thumb|Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas]]
Other than the few diseases listed, other ways in which the corals have been affected are by natural disasters such as hurricanes, human influence such as fishing and pollution, and global warming.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Coral reefs are also being degraded by many other factors:&lt;br /&gt;
* Natural Disasters: coral reefs experience natural disturbance events that can affect and dramatically altered the reef ecosystem. Disasters include hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. 
* Tourism: The [[United States Virgin Islands]] are a popular tourist destination with over two million cruise ship passenger arrivals per year. Tourism generates vast amounts of income for USVI, however, tourism pressures can cause physical damage to the coral reefs. For example, recreation activities (scuba diving and snorkeling), disposal of untreated sewage and poorly placed boat anchors by cruise ships.
* Coastal development: tourism leads to construction projects such as building of hotels and restaurants, coral reefs habitats are destroyed or disturbed by dredging activities and nutrients and sediment run-off.
* Pollution: Pollution from human activities is damaging reefs. Humans dispose unwanted items on beaches, in the sea or near water pathways.
* Overfishing and destructive fishing methods: the coral reefs have been heavily fished due to increasing demand for food. Overfishing of important reef species negatively impact the coral reefs’ biodiversity and ecological. Additionally, some destructive means of fishing are used on coral reefs including [[Blast fishing|dynamite]] and [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]]. These practices often kill fishes and destroy fragile coral reefs. Degrading the coral reef habitat on which the fishes rely on will in turn reduce the productivity of the area.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8737">'''Cross-fostering''' is a technique used in [[animal husbandry]], [[animal science]], [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[nature versus nurture]] studies, and [[conservation (genetics)|conservation]], whereby [[offspring]] are removed from their biological [[parent]]s at birth and raised by surrogates. This can also occasionally occur in nature.

==Animal husbandry==
Cross-fostering young animals is usually done to equalize litter size. Individual animals born in large litters are faced with much more competition for resources, such as breast milk, food and space, than individuals born in smaller litters. Herd managers will typically move some individuals from a large litter to a smaller litter where they will be raised by a non-biological parent. This is typically done in [[pig farming]] because litters with up to 15 piglets are common. A sow with a large litter may have difficulty producing enough milk for all piglets, or the sow may not have enough functional teats to feed all piglets simultaneously. When this occurs, smaller or weaker piglets are at risk of starving to death. Herd managers will often transfer some piglets from a large litter to another lactating sow which either has a smaller litter or has had her own biological piglets recently weaned. Herd managers will typically try to equalize litters by number and also weight of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cross+foster Cross Foster at Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; When done successfully, cross-fostering reduces piglet mortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vet.chula.ac.th/~tjvm/full_text/v32/v32_special_edition/F32S9.pdf The Impact of Cross-Fostering on Swine Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728112415/http://www.vet.chula.ac.th/~tjvm/full_text/v32/v32_special_edition/F32S9.pdf |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In research==
Cross-fostering can be used to study the impact of postnatal environment on genetic-linked diseases as well as on behavioural pattern. In behavioral studies, if cross-fostered offspring show a behavioral [[trait (biology)|trait]] similar to their biological parents and dissimilar from their foster parents, a behavior can be shown to have a genetic basis. Similarly if the offspring develops traits dissimilar to their biological parents and similar to their foster parents environmental factors are shown to be dominant. In many cases there is a blend of the two, which shows both [[genes]] and environment play a part.

In animal studies, genetically hypertensive offspring reared by normotensive dams have been shown to have lower blood pressure compared to the controls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This shows that hypertensive genotype could be modified by the changes of the postnatal environment. Besides this, [[hyperkinetic]] animals reared by a normal dam have been shown to have lower [[locomotor activity]] compared to its controls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In one experiment, [[siblicide]] was shown to be somehow related to parental care. When non-obligate siblicidal blue-footed boobies were swapped with obligate siblicidal masked booby chicks, it was found that the blue-footed chicks exhibited more siblicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loughweed|first=Lynn W.|title=Parent Blue-footed Boobies Suppress Siblicidal Behavior of Offspring|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=1999|volume=45|issue=1|pages=11–18|doi=10.1007/s002650050535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In selective livestock breeding cross-fostering can be used to combine desirable genetic qualities such as weight, fat distribution or appearance with environmentally influenced ones such as temperament.

In humans, studies of children in [[foster care]] have shown that [[alcoholism]] is both genetic and environmental: early onset alcoholism can be linked to biological parentage, whereas adult onset alcoholism is often influenced by the alcohol abuse by foster parents.

==In conservation==

Cross fostering has been used in [[conservation biology]] such as the rearing of [[black robin]] chicks by other species. In this instance the species was so close to [[extinction]], with literally a handful of surviving individuals and a single mother, there was little chance of raising many offspring. In this case a related species were used to raise the eggs, with their own eggs being replaced by conservation workers with those of the robin. In this case [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] is one of the concerns, as species raised in a different environment may not be able to recognize their own [[species]]. In a world first, the Adelaide Zoo successfully cross-fostered a baby tree kangaroo, whose mother was killed when it was five weeks old, with a surrogate rock-wallaby mother.  The Zoo has had a successful cross-fostering program between wallaby species, but this is the first time it was tried with a tree kangaroo and wallaby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2015/06/tree-kangaroo-cross-fostering/ VIDEO: Baby tree kangaroo fostered by rock wallaby], Australian Geographic, 19 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==In nature==
[[File:Galahs flying motion blur.jpg|right|thumb|The ranges of these galahs overlap with a related species, leading to natural cross fostering.]]
Cross fostering may occasionally occur in natural situations. In [[Australia]], the closely related species from the [[cockatoo]] family, ''[[Eolophus roseicapilla]]'' (the [[galah]]) and ''Cacatua leadbeateri'' (the [[pink cockatoo]]), have overlapping [[range (biology)|ranges]], and [[interspecific competition|compete]] for [[nest]]ing holes. However, two pairs of birds may share the same nest for a time, as they do not become aggressive until several eggs have been laid and [[Avian incubation|incubation]] begins. When they do, the pink cockatoos are always the victors, evicting the galahs in what is termed [[Competition (biology)#By mechanism|interference competition]]. They are not consciously aware that some of the eggs in the nest were laid by the other bird however, and thus raise offspring of both species. These natural [[experiment]]s have been used by Australian [[ornithologist]]s Graeme Chapman and Ian Rowley to investigate the relative importance of genes and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Rowley, I. &amp; G. Chapman (1986) Cross-fostering, imprinting , and learning in two sympatric species of cockatoos. ''[[Behaviour (journal)|Behaviour]]'' 96: 1-16&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they discovered that the galah chicks gave normal begging calls and [[alarm calls]], but their [[bird song|contact calls]] (used to maintain [[social behavior|social cohesion]]) were more like those of the pink cockatoos with which they lived.

Such natural instances of cross fostering can also lead to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between species that would not normally breed. A case of this is offered by the [[Galapagos finches]]. Two species of the genus ''[[Geospiza]]'', the [[medium ground-finch]] (''Geospiza fortis'') and the [[common cactus-finch]] (''Geospiza scandens'') occasionally hybridize. The birds' [[Bird vocalization|songs]] are a barrier to interbreeding, but sometimes young birds will not learn their own species song, e.g. if their father dies and they are nesting near another species. Another situation where birds can [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on the wrong song is when one species takes over the nest of another, but fails to remove all of its eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]], in

Reece]]  |year=2002 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location= San Francisco |isbn=978-0-8053-6624-2 |page=1247 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross fostered young can then hybridize with their foster parents' species, allowing [[gene flow]] between the two populations. Hybrids experience reduced [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], however, so the two species can remain separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mogbo |first1=T. C. |last2=Okeke |first2=T.

'''Deep hole drilling (DHD)''' is a [[residual stress]] measurement technique used to measure locked-in and applied [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] in engineering materials and components.&lt;ref&gt;H.Hitano et al. ''A study for high accuracy measurement of residual stress by deep hole drilling technique'' Journal of Physics: Conference Series 379, 2012 [http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/379/1/012049/pdf/1742-6596_379_1_012049.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; DHD is a semi-destructive mechanical [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] relaxation (MSR) technique, which seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of a drilled reference hole. The process is unique in its ability to measure residual stresses at a microscopic level with a penetration of over {{convert|750|mm|in}}, without total destruction of the original component. DHD is considered ''deep'' in comparison to other hole drilling techniques such as centre hole drilling.&lt;ref name="centrehole"&gt;VEQTER Ltd - Centre Hole Drilling [http://www.veqter.co.uk/residual-stress-measurement/centre-hole-drilling]. Retrieved on 25 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique overview ==
DHD involves drilling a hole through the thickness of the component, measuring the diameter of the hole, trepanning (cutting a circular slot around the hole) a core of material from around the hole and finally re-measuring the diameter of the hole.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Mahmoudi et al. ''A New Procedure to Measure Near Yield Residual Stresses Using the Deep Hole Drilling Technique'' Experimental Mechanics, 2009 [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11340-008-9164-y]&lt;/ref&gt; For engineering metals, the trepanning process is typically performed using [[Electrical discharge machining|electrical discharge machining (EDM)]] to minimise the introduction of further stresses during the cutting. The differences between the measured diameters before and after stress release enables the original residual stresses to be calculated using [[Continuum mechanics|elasticity theory]]. An animated YouTube video explaining the DHD technique can be viewed here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLAZBJK9ddU YouTube: Deep Hole Drilling Technique].

=== DHD procedure ===
[[File:Stages-of-DHD-Technique.png|thumb|450px|A diagram showing the stages of the Deep Hole Drilling (DHD) residual stress measurement technique. | The stages of Deep Hole Drilling (DHD) measurement process.]]

Firstly, reference bushes are attached to the front and back surfaces of the component at the measurement location, to minimise "bell-mouthing" and assist with aligning the data sets during analysis. A reference hole is then drilled through a component; in engineering metals, a [[Gun drill|gun-drill]] is typically used due to the smooth and straight hole profile they produce. After drilling, the diameter of the reference hole is measured at frequent intervals along the full length and circumference of the measurement and reference bushes with an air probe. This is a thin rod with pressurised air forced from the end via two small holes at a normal to the reference hole axis. As the air probe is moved through the hole, changes in hole diameter will result in changes in pressure, which are detected with a calibrated [[Linear variable differential transformer|transducer]] to convert the pressure change into a voltage.&lt;ref&gt;R.H.Leggatt et al. ''Development and Experimental Validation of the Deep Hole Method for Residual Stress Measurement'' The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design 1996 31: 177&lt;/ref&gt; A cylinder (i.e. a core) of material containing the reference hole along its axis is then cut (trepanned) from the component using electro-discharge machining (EDM), in order to relax the stresses acting on the reference hole. Finally, the diameter of the reference hole is re-measured through the entire thickness of the cylinder and reference bushes, with the diameter measurements taken at the same locations as those measured prior to the trepanning.

=== Incremental DHD technique (iDHD) ===
If high magnitude residual stresses (&gt;60% [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]]) are present in the component then the DHD technique can be modified to account for [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic behaviour]] during the stress relief process. The risk of plastic deformation during stress relaxation is a problem in hole drilling techniques due to the approximately x3 [[Stress concentration|stress concentrating]] factor of holes, effectively "amplifying" the stress relaxation and increasing the chance of yielding.&lt;ref&gt;S.P.Timoshenko ''Mechanics of Materials - Third S.I Edition''.Chapman &amp; Hall 1991, 120-123, {{ISBN|0412368803}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for iDHD, the procedure is changed to be performed ''incrementally'', with the core being cut (trepanned) in several steps of increasing depth and the diameter measurements being performed in between each step. The analysis then incorporates this sequence of incremental distortions for calculating the high magnitude residual stresses.

== Interpretation of the results ==
The DHD method seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of the reference hole.&lt;ref name="practicalRS"&gt;''Practical Residual Stress Measurement Methods''. Wiley 2013, 65-87, {{ISBN|9781118342374}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the original residual stresses acting on the reference hole and the measured changes in the hole diameter creates the basis of the analysis. The DHD technique uses an elastic analysis to convert the measured distortions of the reference hole into a residual stress profile.&lt;ref&gt;R.H.Leggatt et al. ''Development and Experimental Validation of the Deep Hole Method for Residual Stress Measurement''. Wiley 2013, 65-87, {{ISBN|9781118342374}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of the results is dependent on sources of error in the measurement, but is also dependent on the [[elastic modulus]] of the material.&lt;ref name="practicalRS"/&gt; A lower elastic modulus will result in larger distortions for a given stress release, meaning a higher measurement resolution and thus a greater achievable accuracy. The DHD technique has a nominal accuracy of ±10MPa for Aluminium, ±30MPa for Steel and ±15MPa for Titanium.&lt;ref&gt;VEQTER Ltd - Deep Hole Drilling [http://www.veqter.co.uk/residual-stress-measurement/deep-hole-drilling]. Retrieved on 13 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appraisal of the DHD technique ==
{{Unreferenced|section|section|date=January 2017}}
Advantages and disadvantages of DHD, relative to other residual stress measurement techniques, are listed below.

=== Advantages ===
* Residual stresses can be measured at depths up to {{convert|750|mm|in}}.
* Semi-destructive – enabling repeated residual stress measurements at many different stages in component life.
* The equipment required is portable enough for measurements to be performed on-site as well as in a laboratory.
* A through-thickness bi-axial residual stress distribution is measured (e.g. σxx, σyy and τxy), including stress gradients. σzz can be measured but with extra difficulty and reduced accuracy.
* High magnitude residual stresses can be measured with iDHD, i.e. plasticity can be accounted for.
* Applicable to both simple and complex component shapes.
* Applicable to a wide range of materials, both metallic and non-metallic.
* Indifferent to grain structure of component material.
* Counter rotational Drilling is best for accuracy
* The process is fast, relative to the quantity of information produced.
* Extracted cylinder of material provides stress-free sample for further material tests and validations

=== Disadvantages ===
* Semi-invasive – the resultant hole might need to be re-filled or a mock-up be provided.
* Not applicable through components of less than {{convert|6|mm|in}} thickness.

For example, a beam component was plastically [[Bending|bent]] to introduce a known residual stress profile.&lt;ref&gt;X.Ficquet et al. ''Measurement of Bending Residual Stress on a Hull Section of a Submarine''. OMAE 2012, OMAE2012-83378&lt;/ref&gt; These residual stresses were then measured using multiple residual stress measurement techniques including Neutron Diffraction,&lt;ref&gt;VEQTER Ltd - Neutron Diffraction [http://www.veqter.co.uk/residual-stress-measurement/neutron-diffraction].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">'''Diatonic set theory''' is a subdivision or application of [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] which applies the techniques and [[musical analysis|insights]] of [[discrete mathematics]] to properties of the [[diatonic collection]] such as [[maximal evenness]], [[Myhill's property]], [[well formed generated collection|well formedness]], the [[deep scale property]], [[cardinality equals variety]], and [[structure implies multiplicity]]. The name is something of a misnomer as the concepts involved usually apply much more generally, to any periodically repeating scale.

Music theorists working in diatonic set theory include [[Eytan Agmon]], [[Gerald J. Balzano]], [[Norman Carey]], [[David Clampitt]], [[John Clough (music theorist)|John Clough]], [[Jay Rahn]], and mathematician [[Jack Douthett]]. A number of key concepts were first formulated by [[David Rothenberg]], who published in the journal ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', and [[Erv Wilson]], working entirely outside of the academic world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4902">The '''Disability History Association''' (DHA) is an international [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that promotes the study of [[Disability|disabilities]]. This includes, but is not limited to, the history of individuals or groups with disabilities, perspectives on disability, representations/ constructions of disability, policy and practice history, teaching, theory, and disability and related social and [[civil rights movements]].

The DHA defines both history and disability widely. This organization is both inclusive and international, reflected in its diverse topics and approaches. Membership is open to scholars, institutions and organizations, and others working in all geographic regions and all time periods.

The DHA offers its members a community of active and interesting historians; access to its resources page, which includes a newsletter, conference information, sample syllabi, and helpful links; as well as an opportunity to help build an exciting field.

As an [[Learned society|academic organization]], the Disability History Association strives to attract more professional and public attention to the importance of disability as a category of analysis and the histories of people with disabilities in the past and present. As the DHA website says: “This organization is both inclusive and international, reflected in our diverse topics and approaches. Membership is open to scholars, institutions and organizations, and others working in all geographic regions and all time periods.”&lt;ref&gt;“About our website,” URL: http://dev.celestesharpe.com/?page_id=2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Disability History Association is an affiliated member of the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) and the [[Organization of American Historians]] (OAH) to promote inclusivity of disability in the profession and discipline.

==History of the Disability History Association==

The origin of the Disability History Association came from informal conversations by a group of pioneering disability scholars at the Summer Institute on Disability Studies in the Humanities at [[San Francisco State University]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Kudlick, Catherine, “Disability History Association”, in Burch, Susan. Encyclopedia of American Disability History. Facts on File Library of American History. New York: Facts On File, 2009: 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, they created H-Disability, a discussion group in the prominent online scholarly platform [[H-Net]].&lt;ref&gt;The earliest discussion we can trace in the H-Disability is a book review posted in March, 2001, which is called “Saunders on The Workhouse” (Citation: Kathy Saunders. Review of, The Workhouse. H-Disability, H-Net Reviews. March, 2001. URL: http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=15084).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the organization held its first board meeting, and then the community was incorporated into the Disability History Association in 2007. In 2008, the Disability History Association, British Disability History Group, and the San Francisco State University cosponsored an international academic conference for disability history.

'''Disciplining gendered bodies''' is the practice of conforming one's body to society's standards and expectations.

There are various visible ways in which people and cultures consciously and unconsciously maintain binary [[heteronormative]] norms, which involve choices of female or male gender actions and performances.  Common body practices, or gestures, are combined with gender expectations that make it hard to recognize these practices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication|last=Palczewski|first=Catherine|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=United States|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three examples of heteronormative disciplines are gendered [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]], embodied space, and body movement.

==Gendered attractiveness==

Gendered attractiveness is the physical appearance of a male or female that is considered ideal, beautiful, attractive and having [[sex appeal]] of oneself or others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Males, for example, should be large in stature, muscular, full head of hair, straight white teeth, healthy and alluring to look at.  They spend many hours trying to perfect their bodies with [[physical exercise]]. They also make changes to their appearance with hair removal, hair plugs, teeth veneers and body tanning.   Males want to be seen as strong, dominant and masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Realities, Women's Choices|last=Hunter College|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-984360-2|location=New York, NY|pages=148–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females, on the other hand, should be slender, tall, have long blonde hair, perfect skin and [[Barbie]] doll-like features. Females want to be characterized as petite, skinny and fit. Females are concerned about how they look, what they wear and they desire to be attractive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices, Feminist Visions|last=Shaw|first=Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|location=New York, NY|pages=181–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus go to great lengths to make sure that they feel and look attractive and polished. Females make permanent changes to their bodies as they have [[cosmetic surgery]] on all areas of their bodies such as, nose, face, lips, chin, teeth, breast, buttock, feet and many other parts of the body.  Females also make temporary changes such as cut and color hair, tanning for darker skin color, hair removal from body, paint finger and toe nails. In addition, females use clothes, shoes and accessories such as scarfs, jewelry, purses and eyeglasses to help make them feel and look attractive.

==Embodied space==

Embodied space is the way males and females familiarize with their bodies in their surroundings and often compare to each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The area of personal and interpersonal space tends to be diverse and has various levels for different genders and how it is used to disciple one’s self and others. Males and females also experience their bodies in different ways such as females are more guarded in the way they experience their bodies than males who are less guarded. The size of personal space also had to do with gender. Females compared to males take up less space and males tend to spread out. An example would be when a female sits in a chair they normally sit straight up with legs crossed and when male sits in the chair they sprawl out and legs are spread.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Body movement==

Body movement is how one moves their bodies or how someone's attitude or manners help to express how one carries themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each gender has specific flow or body movements that are normal for them.  Females experience their bodies in more guarded way, how to hamper their movement and do not bring their whole bodies into motion. Females are told how to sit, stand and walk properly. Females are more nonverbal and tend to use more facial expressions and more body movement than males. Males are taught to use and abuse their bodies and put their bodies into an aggressive motion. Males have more expansive movements and show higher levels of activity than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philip|first1=C|title=Study the Latest Research and Learn the Nuance of Body Language|url=http://bodylanguageproject.com/articles/mens-body-movement-more-extroverted-and-emotionally-stable-says-research/|website=Articles|accessdate=2016-05-15|date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domestic drama''' expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of [[middle-class|middle or lower classes]] in a certain society, generally referring to the post-[[Renaissance]] eras. According to the ''English Communications Syllabus'', domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its “characters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.” The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it “concerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.” 

==Roots==
Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as “of or relating to the household.” [[Drama]] receives the definition of “A prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,” and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of “a serious story relating to the household,” clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab

==Development and History==
Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{answers.com|drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the early ages of [[Greek drama]], there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). [[Medieval theatre]] tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of [[morality play]]s, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama.
[[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]] marks the arrival of [[pastoral drama]], drama referring to the relationships of the [[peasant|rustics]]. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the [[romantic relationship]]s of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the [[comedic]] aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional [[comedy|comedies]] and [[tragedy|tragedies]], enforcing the further development into domestic drama.

Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the [[upper class]]es. This era also consisted of the [[Restoration drama]] and placed an emphasis on the usage of [[poetry|poetic language]], “sensational incidents, and epic personages” within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around [[Fictional character|character]]s' relationships and their actions towards each other.

The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the “trend toward sentimental [[bourgeois]] realism.” These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class [[morality]]. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts.

[[Image:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.]]Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] into drama, thus resulting in more serious and [[philosophical]] drama. Characters and [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]: “selective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.” This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the “slice-of-life” shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was [[Henrik Ibsen]] of [[Norway]]. His frequent usage of realism within his shows “brought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and “surpassed other such works” of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works.

The twentieth century introduced [[symbol]]ism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such [[psychological device]]s as “minimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com
section 8 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the [[illusion]]s and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of a show.

Modern dramas usually revolve around [[psychological]], [[social]], and [[political]] affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as “distinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[feminism]], and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the “war-at-home” style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as [[experimental theater]] or [[symbolic theater]].

==Audience Appeal==
Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's “Brilliant Lies” uses “domestic unit battling” to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue.
Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest.
Suspense provides “dramatic irony” as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This “[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.”
As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas.

==Text==
The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic.
The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinary') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the “[[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]” of “traditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.” The subject of the domestic drama could also imply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show.
Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas.
The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the “realistic impression” of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an “intimate personal way of communicating.”

==Social expression==
Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have “good [socially] position” characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class.

In [[economics]], a '''durable good''' or a '''hard good''' is a [[Good (economics)|good]] that does not quickly wear out, or more specifically, one that yields [[utility]] over time rather than being completely [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]] in one use. Items like [[brick]]s could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out. Highly durable goods such as [[refrigerator]]s or [[car]]s usually continue to be useful for three or more years of use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Examples of consumer durable goods include [[automobiles]], [[books]], [[household goods]] ([[home appliance]]s, [[consumer electronics]], [[furniture]], [[tools]], etc.), [[sports equipment]], [[jewelry]], [[medical equipment]], [[firearms]], and [[toy]]s.

'''Nondurable goods''' or '''soft goods''' ([[consumables]]) are the opposite of durable goods. They may be defined either as goods that are immediately consumed in one use or ones that have a lifespan of less than three years.

Examples of nondurable goods include [[fast-moving consumer goods]] such as [[cosmetics]] and cleaning products, food, condiments, fuel, beer, cigarettes and tobacco, medication, office supplies, packaging and containers, paper and paper products, personal products, rubber, plastics, textiles, clothing, and footwear.

While durable goods can usually be rented as well as bought, nondurable goods generally are not rented. While buying durable goods comes under the category of investment demand of goods, buying non-durables comes under the category of consumption demand of goods.

== Durability ==
According to Cooper (1994, p5)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/24666/1/201125_7266%20Cooper%20Publisher.pdf|title=Beyond Recycling: The longer life option|last=Cooper|first=Tim|publisher=The New Economics Foundation|year=1994|oclc=48830517|location=Whitechapel Road, London|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "''[[durability]] is the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair''". Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application such as years of existence, hours of use and operational cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Stahel|first=Walter|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=|chapter=Durability, Function and Performance|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product life spans and sustainable consumption ===
The life span of household goods is significant for [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=The durability of consumer durables|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3280030103/full|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|volume= 3| issue = 1|pages=23–30|via=Willey|doi=10.1002/bse.3280030103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer product life spans could contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus, slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=2005|title=Slower Consumption Reflections on Product Life Spans and the "Throwaway Society"|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/1088198054084671/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume= 9| issue = 1–2|pages=51–67|via=Willey|doi=10.1162/1088198054084671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper (2005) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.

Durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods, that can be demanded by consumers, was not clear until an amendment of the law relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994[[Durability#cite note-5|[5]]].

'''East China University of Political Science and Law''' ('''ECUPL'''; {{zh|s=华东政法大学|p=Huádōng Zhèngfǎ Dàxué}}) is a [[public university]] in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China]], founded in 1952.

==History==
[[File:Thumb-2.jpeg|thumb|Library building at the [[Songjiang University Town|Songjiang Campus]] of ECUPL]]
The urban campus is located on the campus of the former [[St. John's University, Shanghai|St. John's University]]. The new campus that houses the undergraduate students is located in the [[Songjiang University Town]] adjacent to the six universities [[Shanghai International Studies University]]; [[Donghua University]]; [[Shanghai Institute of Foreign Trade]]; [[Shanghai University of Engineering Sciences]]; [[Shanghai Lixin University of Commerce]] and [[Shanghai Institute of Visual Art]].

ECUPL is one of the few higher education institutions in China specializing in legal education. In the field of legal education, ECUPL enjoys unparalleled influence and prestige in Shanghai and greater East China, which is China's most developed geographical division. ECUPL's alumni are found in virtually every legal profession and institution in East China, such as law firms, governmental agencies, courts, and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecupl.edu.cn/en/introdution/intro.htm Introduction to ECUPL]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1952, ECUPL is one of the first group of higher learning institutions of politics and law established by the People's Republic of China and it used to be one of the higher learning institutions of the Ministry of Justice of PRC. It is now a university jointly administered by the Ministry of Justice and local government, with the local government enjoying the priority of administration. Through the efforts of several generations, ECUPL has gradually developed into a multidisciplinary university of economics, management, finance, foreign languages, etc. with focus on law.

ECUPL now has campuses in two districts: Changning and Songjiang, covering an area of 1,064 mu (161.5 acres or 65.37 hectare) and a total building area of 240,000 square meters. At present, ECUPL has four LLD programs, i.e. legal historiography, criminal jurisprudence, economic jurisprudence, and international law, and nine LLM programs of law, i.e. theories of law, legal historiography, constitutional jurisprudence and administrative jurisprudence, criminal jurisprudence, civil and commercial jurisprudence, procedural law, economic jurisprudence，international jurisprudence, environment and resources protection jurisprudence and one LLM program of professional law and on-the-job students are accepted to pursue doctor and master's degrees. ECUPL has 22 majors for bachelors, i.e. law, economics reconnaissance study, finance, administration, English, Japanese, international business and trade, sociology, public security labour and social security, frontier defence management, politics and administration, journalism, public affairs administration, accounting and intellectual property, information science and technology, business administration, cultural industry management, Chinese literature, social work, among which the law major offers undergraduate programs intended for a second bachelor's degree in law.

International economic law and history of law are the key subjects assigned by the Ministry of Justice, and the subject of law is the key subject by the local government. The university has four journals, named, Law, Studies of Crime, Issues of Juvenile delinquency, and the Journal of East China University of Political Science and Law. It also has more than 30 research institutions, studying ancient Chinese legal documents, juvenile delinquency and so on. The library in the university has a collection of books more than 600,000 volumes and has over 1,200 Chinese and foreign journals and magazines. ECUPL has established cooperative relationship with more than 100 overseas colleges and universities, research institutions and legal institutions in the country. There are about 800 faculty members, among whom more than 400 are teaching and research staff and more than 160 are professors or associate professors, and over 10,000 students. It is also a Shanghai Model Unit and Shanghai Garden Unit and its architecture on campus receives special protection from the government.
 
For the last fifty years, ECUPL has adhered to the party's policies on education, struck to the principle of "Behave sincerely and learn thirstily; revere virtues and respect laws." It bases herself in Shanghai, faces east China and radiates the whole nation and has gradually developed into a higher learning institution with abundant teaching staff, distinct   
operating features, high teaching quality, advanced academic level, outstanding academic achievements, frequent operations and exchanges and beautiful campus. ECUPL has become an "oriental pearl in the law education", which makes a great contribution to the socialistic legal construction and modernization construction by bringing up more than 40,000 high-level talents of law for the party and the country.

In December 2013 the school attracted international headlines on news that lecturer [[Zhang Xuezhong (academic)|Zhang Xuezhong]] had been expelled.  Prior to his dismissal Zhang had provided legal counsel to the [[New Citizens' Movement (China)|New Citizens' Movement]] and, according to state-controlled media, expressed "political opinions that go against the law."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Jacobs (journalist)|Andrew Jacobs]] (10 December 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/world/asia/chinese-professor-who-advocated-free-speech-is-fired.html Chinese Professor Who Advocated Free Speech Is Fired] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Phillips (10 December 2013), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10507646/Fresh-fears-of-crackdown-as-Chinese-professor-is-fired-for-criticising-Xi-Jinping.html Fresh fears of crackdown as Chinese professor is fired for 'criticising Xi Jinping'] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu Sha (10 December 2013), [http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/831398.shtml Vocal law professor fails to renew contract with university] ''[[Global Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Cooperation and Exchange==
East China University of Political Science and Law (ECUPL) is always paying much attention to the cooperative exchanges with overseas universities or higher institutions. It has set up joint program with the National University of Singapore and the City University of Hong Kong. Also, it receives students groups annually from the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecupl.edu.cn/en/cooperation/cooper.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Currently, it has signed cooperation agreements with around 35 overseas universities, including Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio in the United States, Wisconsin University of the United States, Willammette University of the United States,Golden Gate University of the United States, Ghent University of Ghent, Vrije University of the Netherlands, Groningen University of the Netherlands, Queensland University of Australia, Bond University of Australia, Kyushu University of Japan, Kumamoto University of Japan, Anshan University of South Korea and so on. Every year, it selects and sends excellent faculty members and students to sister universities for further study and research. Also it encourages graduate and first-year postgraduate students to pursue the LLM degree in overseas universities. At the same time, the East China University of Political Science and Law also maintains good relationships with well-known law firms in Shanghai and world-renowned companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5849">{{expert-subject|date=December 2010}}&lt;!-- explains what it *does*, but not what it *is*. what is it? the (evolutionarily) sudden disappearance of a limiting ecological factor. hence "release". population size, behaviors and whatnot else may have been held down by that factor can expand to the new (higher) limit. --&gt;
'''Ecological release''' refers to a population increase or population explosion that occurs when a [[species]] is freed from limiting factors in its environment.  Sometimes this may occur when a plant or animal species is introduced, for example, to an island or to a new territory or environment other than its native [[habitat]].  When this happens, the new arrivals may find themselves suddenly free from the competitors, diseases, or predatory species, etc. in their previous environment, allowing their population numbers to increase beyond their previous limitations.  Another common example of ecological release can occur if a disease or a competitor or a [[keystone species]], such as a top predator, is removed from a community or ecosystem.  Classical examples of this latter dynamics include population explosions of sea urchins in California's offshore kelp beds, for example, when human hunters began to kill too many sea otters, and/or sudden population explosions of jackrabbits if hunters or ranchers kill too many coyotes.   

The foreign species either flourishes into a local population or dies out. Not all released species will become invasive; most released species that don’t immediately die out tend to find a small [[Ecological niche|niche]] in the local ecosystem.
Ecological release also occurs when a species expands its niche within its own [[habitat]] or into a new habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G.W. and R.E. Ricklefs (1977). Species diversity and ecological release in Caribbean land bird faunas. Oikos 28: 113-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The term “ecological release” first appeared in the scientific literature in 1972 in the American Zoologist Journal discussing the effects of the introduction of a sea snail on an isolated ecosystem, Easter Island.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A.J. (1972). Conus-miliaris at Easter Island – ecological release of diet and habitat in an isolated population. American Zoologist 12: 712.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first studies that linked niche shifts to the presence and absence of competitors was by Lack and Southern&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D., and H. N. Southern (1949). Birds on Tenerife. Ibis 91: 607-26.&lt;/ref&gt; where habitat broadness of song birds was positively correlated to the absence of a related species.

==Common example==
[[Invasive species]] are an excellent example of successful ecological release because low levels of biodiversity, an abundance of resources, and particular life history traits allow their numbers to increase dramatically. Additionally, there are few predators for these species.

==Causes and mechanisms==
===Cascade effect===
When a [[keystone species]], such as a top predator, is removed from a community or ecosystem, a [[cascade effect]] can occur through which a series of secondary extinctions take place. Keystone predators are responsible for the control of prey densities, and their removal can result in an increase in one or a number of predators, consumers, or competitors elsewhere in the food web.&lt;ref name=Paine&gt;Paine, R.T. (1966). Food web complexity and species diversity. The American Naturalist 100: 65-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Several prey or competitor species can consequently suffer a population decline and potentially be extirpated; the result of this would be a decrease in community diversity.&lt;ref name=Paine/&gt; Without the keystone species, prey populations can grow indefinitely and will, ultimately, be limited by resources such as food and shelter. Due to these secondary extinctions, a niche is left unfilled: this allows a new species to invade and exploit the resources that are no longer being used by other species.&lt;ref name=Paine/&gt;

==Human causes ecological release==
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}

[[File:Efez Celsus Library 5 RB.jpg|thumb|Personification of Episteme in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], Turkey.]]
"'''Episteme'''" is a philosophical term derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:ἐπιστήμη|ἐπιστήμη]] ''epistēmē'', which can refer to [[knowledge]], [[science]] or [[understanding]], and which comes from the verb {{lang|grc|ἐπίστασθαι}}, meaning "to know, to understand, or to be acquainted with".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)pisth/mh|ἐπιστήμη}}, {{LSJ|e)pi/stamai|ἐπίστασθαι|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Plato contrasts episteme with "[[doxa]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|do/ca^|δόξα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; common belief or opinion. Episteme is also distinguished from "[[techne]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|te/xnh|τέχνη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a craft or applied practice. The word "[[epistemology]]"  is derived from episteme.

== Western philosophy ==
=== Michel Foucault ===&lt;!-- 'Episteme (Foucault)' redirects here --&gt;
The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] used the term ''épistémè'' in a specialized sense in his work ''[[The Order of Things]]'' to mean the historical, but non-temporal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' which grounds knowledge and its [[discourse]]s and thus represents the [[condition of possibility| condition of their possibility]] within a particular epoch. 

In subsequent writings, he made it clear that several ''épistémè'' may co-exist and interact at the same time, being parts of various power-knowledge systems. But he did not discard the concept:
{{Quote | I would define the episteme retrospectively as the strategic apparatus which permits of separating out from among all the statements which are possible those that will be acceptable within, I won’t say a scientific theory, but a field of scientificity, and which it is possible to say are true or false. The episteme is the ‘apparatus’ which makes possible the separation, not of the true from the false, but of what may from what may not be characterised as scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Power/Knowledge | year = 1980 | page = 197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet in Foucault's ''The Order of Things'' he describes ''épistémè'' as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, if in any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice. (Foucault, 168)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Relation of the Foucaultian épistémè to Kuhn's ''paradigm'' ====
Foucault's use of ''épistémè'' has been asserted as being similar to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of a ''[[paradigm]]'', as for example by [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jean | last = Piaget | title = Structuralism | origyear = 1968 | year = 1970 | page = 132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are decisive differences. 

Whereas Kuhn's ''paradigm'' is an all-encompassing collection of beliefs and assumptions that result in the organization of scientific worldviews and practices, Foucault's ''episteme'' is not merely confined to science but to a wider range of discourse (all of science itself would fall under the ''episteme'' of the epoch). 

Kuhn's paradigm shifts are a consequence of a series of conscious decisions made by scientists to pursue a neglected set of questions. Foucault's ''episteme'' is something like the 'epistemological unconscious' of an era; the resultant configuration of knowledge of a particular ''episteme'' is, to Foucault, based on a set of primordial, fundamental assumptions that are so basic to the ''episteme'' that they're experientially "invisible" to the constituents (such as people, organizations, or systems) operating within the ''episteme.''

Moreover, Kuhn's concept corresponds to what Foucault calls ''theme'' or theory of a science, but Foucault analyzed how ''opposing'' theories and themes could ''co-exist'' within a science.{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. II.IV}}  Kuhn doesn't search for the conditions of possibility of opposing discourses within a science, but simply for the invariant dominant paradigm governing scientific research (supposing that ''one'' paradigm always ''is'' pervading, except under paradigmatic transition).  

Foucault attempts to demonstrate the constitutive limits of discourse, and in particular, the rules enabling their productivity; however, Foucault maintained that though [[ideology]] may infiltrate and form science, it need not do so: it must be demonstrated how [[ideology]] actually forms the science in question; contradictions and lack of objectivity is not an indicator of [[ideology]].{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. IV.VI.c}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power. Each society has its regime of truth, its "general politics” of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true." &lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (1980): ‘Truth and Power’. In C. Gordon (ed.): ''Power/Knowledge. Selected Interviews &amp; Other Writings 1972-1977'' by Michel Foucault, Brighton: Havester, pp. 109-
133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, Paul (editor) ''The Foucault Reader: An introduction to Foucault’s thought''. (1991)  London, Penguin. 400 pages, {{ISBN|0140124861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kuhn's and Foucault's notions are possibly influenced by the French philosopher of science [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s notion of an "[[epistemological rupture]]", as indeed was Althusser.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

=== Judith Butler ===
In 1997, [[Judith Butler]] used the concept of episteme in her book ''[[Judith Butler#Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative (1997)|Excitable Speech]]'', examining the use of [[speech-act|speech-act theory]] for political purposes.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

== Distant and local, trans- and cis-eQTLs, respectively ==

Expression traits differ from most other classical [[complex traits]] in one important respect—the measured [[mRNA]] or [[protein]] trait is almost always the product of a single [[gene]] with a specific chromosomal location. eQTLs that map to the approximate location of their gene-of-origin are referred to as '''local eQTLs'''. In contrast, those that map far from the location of their gene of origin, often on different chromosomes, are referred to as '''distant eQTLs'''. Often, these two types of eQTLs are referred to as '''cis''' and '''trans''', respectively, but these terms are best reserved for instances when the regulatory mechanism (cis vs. trans) of the underlying sequence has been established. The first genome-wide study of gene expression was carried out in yeast and published in 2002.&lt;ref name="Brem2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brem RB, Yvert G, Clinton R, Kruglyak L | title = Genetic dissection of transcriptional regulation in budding yeast | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5568 | pages = 752–5 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11923494 | doi = 10.1126/science.1069516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial wave of eQTL studies employed microarrays to measure genome-wide gene expression; more recent studies have employed massively parallel RNA sequencing.

== Detecting eQTLs ==

Mapping eQTLs is done using standard [[QTL]] mapping methods that test the linkage between variation in expression and genetic polymorphisms. The only considerable difference is that eQTL studies can involve a million or more expression microtraits. Standard gene mapping software packages can be used, although it is often faster to use custom code such as QTL Reaper or the web-based eQTL mapping system [[GeneNetwork]]. GeneNetwork hosts many large eQTL mapping data sets and provide access to fast algorithms to map single loci and epistatic interactions. As is true in all QTL mapping studies, the final steps in  defining DNA variants that cause variation in traits are usually difficult and require a second round of experimentation.  This is especially the case for trans eQTLs that do not benefit from the strong prior probability that relevant variants are in the immediate vicinity of the parent gene. Statistical, graphical, and bioinformatic methods are used to evaluate positional candidate genes and entire systems of interactions.&lt;ref name="Kulp_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulp DC, Jagalur M | title = Causal inference of regulator-target pairs by gene mapping of expression phenotypes | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 125 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16719927 | pmc = 1481560 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-7-125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee SI, Dudley AM, Drubin D, Silver PA, Krogan NJ, Pe'er D, Koller D | title = Learning a prior on regulatory potential from eQTL data | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e1000358 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19180192 | pmc = 2627940 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|350px|A historic extraterrestrial sky—''[[Earthrise]]'', the [[Earth]] viewed from the [[Moon]], [[Apollo 8|Apollo 8 mission]], [[Lunar orbit]], December 24, 1968]]
In [[astronomy]], an '''extraterrestrial sky''' is a view of [[outer space]] from the surface of an astronomical body other than [[Earth]].

The only extraterrestrial [[sky]] that has been directly observed and photographed by [[astronaut]]s is that of the [[The Moon|Moon]]. The skies of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Mars]], and [[Venus]] have been observed by [[space probe]]s designed to land on the surface and transmit images back to Earth.

Characteristics of extraterrestrial skies appear to vary substantially due to a number of factors. An [[extraterrestrial atmosphere]], if present, has a large bearing on visible characteristics. The [[atmosphere]]'s density and [[chemical composition]] can contribute to differences in [[colour]], [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] (including [[haze]]) and the presence of [[cloud]]s. Astronomical objects may also be visible and can include [[natural satellite]]s, [[planetary ring|ring]]s, [[star system]]s and [[nebula]]s and other [[planetary system]] bodies.

For skies that have not been directly or indirectly observed, their appearance can be simulated based on known parameters, such as the position of astronomical objects relative to the surface and atmospheric composition.

==[[Luminosity]] and angular diameter of the Sun==
{{main article|Angular diameter}}

The [[Sun]]'s [[apparent magnitude]] changes according to the [[inverse square law]], therefore, the difference in magnitude as a result of greater or lesser distances from different [[celestial bodies]] can be predicted by the following [[formula]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{intensity} \ \propto \ \frac{1}{\text{distance}^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

Where "distance" can be in [[km]], [[Astronomical unit|au]], or any other appropriate unit.

To illustrate, since [[Pluto]] is 40 au away from the Sun on average, it follows that the parent star would appear to be 1,600 times dimmer than it is on [[Earth]].

Though a [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]] observer would find a dramatic decrease in available [[sunlight]] in these environments, the Sun would still be bright enough to cast shadows even as far as the hypothetical [[Planet Nine]], possibly located 1,200 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] away, and would still outshine the [[full Moon]].

The change in angular diameter of the sun with distance is illustrated in the diagram below:

[[File:Angular dia formula.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Diagram for the formula of the angular diameter]]

The angular diameter of a [[circle]] whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the centre of said circle can be calculated using the formula&lt;ref&gt;This can be derived using the formula for the length of a cord found at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arctan \left(\frac{d}{2D}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular diameter, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are the actual diameter of and the distance to the object. When &lt;math&gt;D \gg d&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\delta \approx d / D&lt;/math&gt;, and the result obtained is in [[radians]].

For a spherical object whose ''actual'' diameter equals &lt;math&gt;d_\mathrm{act},&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the ''centre'' of the sphere, the angular diameter can be found by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arcsin \left(\frac{d_\mathrm{act}}{2D}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The difference is due to the fact that the apparent edges of a sphere are its tangent points, which are closer to the observer than the centre of the sphere. For practical use, the distinction is only significant for spherical objects that are relatively close, since the [[small-angle approximation]] holds for &lt;math&gt; x \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathstat.concordia.ca/faculty/rhall/mc/arctan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin x \approx \arctan x \approx x&lt;/math&gt; .

Differences in how the sun appears can be visualized with this chart:
 
[[File:Comparison angular diameter solar system.svg|thumb|center|350px|Comparison of angular diameter of the Sun, Moon and planets. To get a true representation of the sizes, view the image at a distance of 103 times the width of the "Moon: max." circle. For example, if this circle is 10 cm wide on your monitor, view it from 10.3 m away.]]

==Horizon==
On [[terrestrial planet]]s and other solid celestial bodies with negligible atmospheric effects, the distance to the [[horizon]] for a "standard observer" varies as the square root of the planet's radius. Thus, the horizon on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is 62% as far away from the observer as it is on Earth, on [[Mars]] the figure is 73%, on the [[Moon]] the figure is 52%, on [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] the figure is 18%, and so on. For smaller, non-spherical objects, the observer's height must be taken into account when calculating the distance to the horizon.

==Mercury==
Because [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] has little or no [[Atmosphere of Mercury|atmosphere]], a view of the planet's skies would be no different from viewing space from orbit. Mercury has a southern [[pole star]], [[Alpha Pictoris|α Pictoris]], a magnitude 3.2 star. It is fainter than Earth's [[Polaris]] (α Ursae Minoris).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/mercury/Atmosphere/atmosphere.html |title=Thin Atmosphere of Mercury, Formation and Composition – Windows to the Universe |website=www.windows.ucar.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, the visible diameter of the Sun on Mercury is 2.5 times as large as it appears from Earth, and its total brightness is more than 6 times as great. Because of the planet's eccentric orbit, the Sun's apparent diameter in the sky would vary from 2.2 times that from Earth at [[Apsis|aphelion]] (with total brightness 4.8 times as great), to 3.2 times at [[Apsis|perihelion]] (with total brightness 10.2 times as great).

Mercury has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance. This means that although a [[sidereal day]] (the period of rotation) lasts around 58.7 Earth days, a [[solar day]] (the length between two [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] [[Astronomical transit|transit]]s of the Sun) lasts around 176 Earth days. (In contrast, the difference between Earth's sidereal and solar days is only 4 minutes.)

The large eccentricity of Mercury's orbit coupled with the long length of a Mercurian day results in an unusual effect in which the Sun appears to briefly reverse its usual east-to-west motion once every Mercurian year. The on-sky distance over which the Sun appears to be travelling in this reversed (west-to-east) direction is slightly larger than the apparent size of the Sun itself. Thus, while the effect is visible wherever one happens to be on Mercury, there are certain points on Mercury's surface where an observer would be able to see the Sun rise, reverse and set, and then rise again, all within the same Mercurian day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cseligman.com/text/planets/mercuryrot.htm |title=The Rotation of Mercury |last1=Seligman |first1=Courtney |website=cseligman.com |accessdate=18 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent motion reverses because approximately four (Earth) days prior to perihelion, the angular speed of Mercury's orbit exactly equals its [[rotational velocity]], so that the Sun's [[improper motion|apparent motion]] ceases. At perihelion, Mercury's orbital angular velocity slightly exceeds the rotational velocity, so the Sun appears to be [[retrograde motion|retrograde]]. Four days after perihelion, the Sun's normal apparent motion resumes. Because of its spin–orbit resonance, Mercury presents one of two spots of its surface to the Sun on alternate perihelia. One of these subsolar points is [[Caloris Planitia]] ("hot basin"), appropriately named because an observer near its centre would see the Sun loop around the zenith once per Mercurian day, and hence experience a very hot day indeed.

===Other planets seen from Mercury===
After the Sun, the second-brightest object in the Mercurian sky is [[Venus]], which is much brighter there than for terrestrial observers. The reason for this is that when Venus is closest to Earth, it is between the Earth and the Sun, so we see only its night side. Indeed, even when Venus is brightest in the Earth's sky, we are actually seeing only a narrow crescent. For a Mercurian observer, on the other hand, Venus is closest when it is in [[Astronomical opposition|opposition]] to the Sun and is showing its full disk. The [[apparent magnitude]] of Venus is as bright as −7.7.&lt;ref name="Perelman"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1 = Yakov |last1=Perelman |first2=Arthur |last2=Shkarovsky-Raffe

 |isbn = 0-89875-056-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth and the Moon are also very prominent, their apparent magnitudes being about −5&lt;ref name="Perelman" /&gt; and −1.2, respectively. The maximum apparent distance between the Earth and the Moon is about 15′. All other planets are visible just as they are on Earth, but somewhat less bright at opposition.

The [[zodiacal light]] is probably more prominent than it is from Earth.

==Venus==
The atmosphere of [[Venus]] is so thick that the Sun is not distinguishable in the daytime sky, and the [[star]]s are not visible at night. Color images taken by the Soviet [[Venera program|Venera]] probes suggest that the sky on Venus is orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/venera_13/ |title=Venera 13 – Missions – NASA Solar System Exploration |website=NASA Solar System Exploration }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Sun could be seen from Venus's surface, the time from one sunrise to the next (a [[solar day]]) would be 116.75 Earth days. Because of Venus's [[retrograde motion|retrograde rotation]], the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/compare_the_planets/terrestrial.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/616VoDl1i?url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/compare_the_planets/terrestrial.html |archivedate=21 August 2011 |title=The Terrestrial Planets |publisher=The Planetary Society |accessdate=3 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An observer aloft in Venus's cloud tops, on the other hand, would circumnavigate the planet in about four Earth days and see a sky in which Earth and the Moon shine brightly (about magnitudes −6.6&lt;ref name="Perelman" /&gt; and −2.7, respectively) at [[opposition (planets)|opposition]]. Mercury would also be easy to spot, because it is closer and brighter, at up to magnitude −2.7,&lt;ref name="Perelman" /&gt; and because its maximum [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] from the Sun is considerably larger (40.5°) than when observed from Earth (28.3°).

==The Moon==
[[File:EarthFromTheMoon-LRO-20151012a.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Earth from the Moon, October 12, 2015]]
&lt;!---[[File:Eclipse from moon.jpg|thumb|An artist's conception of a solar eclipse from the moon, during a [[lunar eclipse]] as viewed from the earth]]---&gt;
The Moon's atmosphere is negligibly thin, essentially vacuum, so its sky is always black, as in the case of Mercury. However, the Sun is so bright that it is impossible to see stars during the daytime, unless the observer is well shielded from sunlight (direct or reflected from the ground). The Moon has a southern polar star, [[Delta Doradus|δ Doradus]], a magnitude 4.34 star. It is better aligned than Earth's [[Polaris]] (α Ursae Minoris), but much fainter.

===The Sun from the Moon===
The Sun looks the same from the Moon as it does from Earth's orbit, somewhat brighter than it does from the Earth's surface, and colored pure white, due to the lack of atmospheric scattering and absorption.

Since the Moon's axial tilt relative to its orbit around the Sun is nearly zero, the Sun traces out almost exactly the same path through the Moon's sky over the course of a year. As a result, there are craters and valleys near the Moon's poles that never receive direct sunlight, and there may exist mountains and hilltops that are never in shadow (see [[Lunar south pole]] and [[Peak of eternal light]]).

===The Earth from the Moon===
[[File:Apollo17.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 17]] commander [[Eugene Cernan]] on the Moon, with Earth visible in the sky]]

Among the most prominent features of the Moon's sky is Earth. Earth's [[angular diameter]] (1.9°) is four times the Moon's as seen from Earth, although because the Moon's orbit is eccentric, Earth's apparent size in the sky varies by about 5% either way (ranging between 1.8° and 2.0° in diameter). Earth shows [[planetary phase|phases]], just like the Moon does for terrestrial observers. The phases, however, are opposite; when the terrestrial observer sees the full Moon, the lunar observer sees a "new Earth", and vice versa. Earth's [[albedo]] is three times as high as that of the Moon (due in part to its whitish cloud cover), and coupled with the wider area, the full Earth glows over 50 times brighter than the full Moon at zenith does for the terrestrial observer. This Earth light reflected on the Moon's un-sunlit half is bright enough to be visible from Earth, even to the unaided eye – a phenomenon known as [[earthshine]].

As a result of the Moon's [[synchronous rotation]], one side of the Moon (the "[[near side of the Moon|near side]]") is permanently turned towards Earth, and the other side, the "[[Far side (Moon)|far side]]", mostly cannot be seen from Earth. This means, conversely, that Earth can only be seen from the near side of the Moon and would always be invisible from the far side.
&lt;!---
[[File:Mars violet sky.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mars's sky turned violet by water ice clouds (August 1997)]]
[[File:Mars sunset PIA00920.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Close-up of Mars sky at sunset, showing more color variation, as imaged by [[Mars Pathfinder]] (August 1997)]]
---&gt;
If the Moon's rotation were purely synchronous, Earth would not have any noticeable movement in the Moon's sky. However, due to the Moon's [[libration]], Earth does perform a slow and complex wobbling movement. Once a month, as seen from the Moon, Earth traces out an approximate oval 18° in diameter. The exact shape and orientation of this oval depend on one's location on the Moon. As a result, near the boundary of the near and far sides of the Moon, Earth is sometimes below the [[horizon]] and sometimes above it.

===Eclipses from the Moon===
[[File:An_EPIC_Eclipse.gif|thumb|From space, the Moon's shadow during the [[solar eclipse of March 9, 2016]] appears as a dark spot moving across the Earth.]]

Earth and the Sun sometimes meet in the lunar sky, causing an [[eclipse]]. On Earth, one would see a [[lunar eclipse]], when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a [[solar eclipse]], when the Sun goes behind the Earth. Since the apparent diameter of the Earth is four times as large as that of the Sun, the Sun would be hidden behind the Earth for hours. [[Earth's atmosphere]] would be visible as a reddish ring. During the [[Apollo 15]] mission, an attempt was made to use the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]'s TV camera to view such an eclipse, but the camera or its power source failed after the astronauts left for Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.launch.html |title=Return to Orbit |website=www.hq.nasa.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrestrial [[solar eclipse]]s, on the other hand, would not be as spectacular for lunar observers because the Moon's [[umbra]] nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would barely be visible. The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object {{convert|5|m|feet|abbr=on|0}} away. Lunar observers with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot at the center of a less dark region ([[penumbra]]) traveling across the full Earth's disk. It would look essentially the same as it does to the [[Deep Space Climate Observatory]].

In summary, whenever an eclipse of some sort is occurring on Earth, an eclipse of another sort is occurring on the Moon. Eclipses occur for observers on both Earth and the Moon whenever the two bodies and the Sun align in a straight line, or [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].

==Mars==
{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}
[[Mars]] has only a thin atmosphere; however, it is extremely dusty and there is much light that is scattered about. The sky is thus rather bright during the daytime and stars are not visible. The Martian northern pole star is [[Deneb]]&lt;ref&gt;Eric Burgess, ''To the Red Planet'', Columbia University Press, 1978; see [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993Ap&amp;SS.201..160B review]: Gurbir Singh, ''Astrophysics and Space Science'', vol. 201, no. 1 (February), 1993, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; (although the actual pole is somewhat offset in the direction of [[Alpha Cephei]]).

===The color of the Martian sky===

Generating accurate true-color images from Mars's surface is surprisingly complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Phil |last=Plait |url=http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/hoagland/mars_colors.html |title=Phil Plait's Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions: What Color is Mars? |website=www.badastronomy.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; To give but one aspect to consider, there is the [[Purkinje effect]]: the human eye's response to color depends on the level of ambient light; red objects appear to darken faster than blue objects as the level of illumination goes down. There is much variation in the color of the sky as reproduced in published images, since many of those images have used filters to maximize their scientific value and are not trying to show true color. For many years, the sky on Mars was thought to be more pinkish than it is now believed to be.

It is now known that during the Martian day, the sky is a [[butterscotch]] color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810170442/http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |archivedate=10 August 2004 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is [[rose (color)|rose]] in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. This is the opposite of the situation on Earth.  Twilight lasts a long time after the Sun has set and before it rises because of the dust high in Mars's atmosphere.

On Mars, [[Rayleigh scattering]] is usually a very weak effect; the red color of the sky is caused by the presence of [[iron(III) oxide]] in the airborne dust particles. These particles are larger in size than gas molecules, so most of the light is scattered by [[Mie theory|Mie scattering]]. Dust absorbs blue light and scatters longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow).

===The Sun from Mars===
{{see also|Timekeeping on Mars}}
The [[Sun]] as seen from [[Mars]] appears to be {{frac|5|8}} the angular diameter as seen from Earth (0.35°), and sends 40% of the light, approximately the brightness of a slightly cloudy afternoon on [[Earth]].

On June 3, 2014, the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] on Mars observed the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] transiting the Sun, marking the first time a [[planetary transit]] has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140610"&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Guy |title=Mercury Passes in Front of the Sun, as Seen From Mars |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-183 |date=10 June 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=10 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mars's moons as seen from Mars===
[[File:15-ml-06-phobos2-A067R1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] [[astronomical transit|transits]] the [[Sun]], as seen by Mars Rover ''[[MER-B|Opportunity]]'' on March 10, 2004]]

Mars has two small moons: [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. From the Martian surface, Phobos has one-third to one-half the [[angular diameter]] of the Sun while Deimos is barely more than a dot (only 2′ angular diameter). The orbital period of Phobos is so much shorter than the Martian day that the apparent motion of Phobos is in reverse: it rises in the west and sets in the east. Phobos orbits so close (in a low-inclination equatorial orbit) that it cannot be seen north of 70.4°N or south of 70.4°S latitude; high-latitude observers would also notice a decrease in Phobos's apparent size, the additional distance being non-negligible. Phobos's apparent size varies by up to 45% as it passes overhead, due to its proximity to Mars's surface. For an equatorial observer, for example, Phobos is about 0.14° upon rising and swells to 0.20° by the time it reaches the zenith. It crosses the sky swiftly, in about 4.24 hours, every 11.11 hours.&lt;!--- Phobos can be seen from the equator for 68.725° on either side of the zenith; this doesn't match the 70.4° latitude limit because of Mars's oblateness, I presume ---&gt;
Deimos rises in the east and sets in the west, like a "normal" moon, although its appearance to the naked eye would be starlike (angular diameter between 1.8′ and 2.1′). Its brightness would vary between that of Venus and of the star [[Vega]] (as seen from Earth). Being relatively close to Mars, Deimos cannot be seen from Martian latitudes greater than 82.7°. Finally, Deimos's orbital period of about 30.3 hours exceeds the Martian rotation period (of about 24.6 hours) by such a small amount that it rises every 5.5 days and takes 2.5 days between rising and setting for an equatorial observer.&lt;!--- Deimos can be seen from the equator for 81.662° on either side of the zenith; this doesn't match the 82.7° latitude limit because of Mars's oblateness, I presume ---&gt; Thus Phobos crosses the Martian sky nearly 12 times&lt;!--- 11.836 ---&gt; in the time it takes Deimos to cross it just once.

Phobos and Deimos can both [[eclipse]] the Sun as seen from Mars, although neither can completely cover its disk and so the event is in fact a [[Astronomical transit|transit]], rather than an eclipse. For a detailed description of such events see the articles [[Transit of Phobos from Mars]] and [[Transit of Deimos from Mars]].

===Earth from Mars===
The Earth is visible from Mars as a double star; the Moon would be visible alongside it as a fainter companion. The maximum visible distance between the Earth and the Moon would be about 25′, at [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|inferior conjunction]] of the Earth and the Sun (for the terrestrial observer, this is the [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]] of Mars and the Sun). Near maximum [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] (47.4°), the Earth and Moon would shine at apparent magnitudes −2.5 and +0.9, respectively.&lt;ref name="Perelman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EarthfromMars"&gt;{{cite web |date=2003-05-08 |title=Earth and Moon as Viewed from Mars |publisher=Earth Observatory |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=15293 |accessdate=3 June 2008 }} (JPL Horizons shows: 0.9304AU from Earth; Phase 43%; Sun Elongation 43°)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venus from Mars===
[[Venus]] as seen from Mars (when near the maximum elongation from the Sun of 31.7°) would have an apparent magnitude of about −3.2.&lt;ref name="Perelman" /&gt;

===The outer planets===
Compared with their view from Earth, the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) would appear slightly brighter during opposition, but slightly dimmer during [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]]. This effect is most noticeable for Jupiter, and results from Mars' larger orbit compared with that of Earth causing larger variations of interplanetary distance.

===The skies of Mars's moons===
From Phobos, Mars appears 6,400 times larger and 2,500 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from Earth, and appears as a sphere of angular diameter roughly 42°—taking up a quarter of the width of a celestial hemisphere.

From Deimos, Mars appears 1,000 times larger and 400 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from Earth, and appears as a sphere of angular diameter roughly 16.5°—taking up an eleventh of the width of a celestial hemisphere.

==The Asteroid Belt==
The [[asteroid belt]] is sparsely populated and most asteroids are very small, so that an observer situated on one asteroid would be unlikely to be able to see another without the aid of a telescope. Occasional "close approaches" do occur, but these are spread out over aeons.

Some asteroids that cross the orbits of planets may occasionally get close enough to a planet or asteroid so that an observer from that asteroid can make out the disc of the nearby object without the aid of binoculars or a telescope. For example, in September 2004, [[4179 Toutatis]] came about four times the distance from the Earth that the Moon does. At the closest point in its encounter, the Earth would have appeared about the same size as the Moon appears from Earth. The Moon would also be easily visible as a small shape in Toutatis's sky at that time.

Asteroids with unusual orbits also offer a lot to the imagination. For instance, the asteroid (or more likely, [[extinct comet]]) [[3200 Phaethon]] has one of the most eccentric orbits: its distance from the Sun varies between 0.14 and 2.4 [[astronomical unit|AU]]. At perihelion, the Sun would loom over 7 times larger than it does in our sky, and blast the surface with over 50 times as much energy; at aphelion, the Sun would shrink to less than half its apparent diameter on Earth, and give little more than a sixth as much illumination.

===87 Sylvia and its moons Romulus and Remus===
The asteroid [[87 Sylvia]] is one of the largest main-belt asteroids and the first asteroid observed to have two moons. These moons, [[Romulus (moon)|Romulus]] and [[Remus (moon)|Remus]], would appear roughly the same size. Romulus, the farther one, would be about 0.89° across, slightly bigger than the closer but smaller Remus, which would be about 0.78° across. Because Sylvia is far from spherical, these values can vary by about a little more than 10%, depending on where the observer is on Sylvia's surface. Since the two asteroidal moons appear to orbit (as best we can tell) in the same plane, they would occult each other once every 2.2 days. When the season is right, twice during Sylvia's 6.52 year orbital period, they would eclipse the Sun, which, at 0.15° across, is much smaller than when seen from Earth (0.53°). From Remus, the inner moon, Sylvia is huge, roughly 30°×18° across, while its view of Romulus varies between 1.59 and 0.50° across. From Romulus, Sylvia measures 16°×10° across, while Remus varies between 0.62° and 0.19°.

===243 Ida and its moon Dactyl===
[[File:Dactyl from Ida.jpg|thumb|Simulated view of Dactyl from Ida]]
The asteroid [[243 Ida]] was visited by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]] on its way to Jupiter. It discovered a small moon named Dactyl. Although the exact orbital characteristics of Dactyl are not fully known, it was 90 [[kilometer]]s from Ida when Galileo passed by. This would mean that from Ida, Dactyl would appear as large as 1.76 degrees across, which is huge for such a small moon (1.4&amp;nbsp;km).

==Jupiter==
Although no images from within [[Jupiter]]'s atmosphere have ever been taken, artistic representations typically assume that the planet's sky is blue, though dimmer than Earth's, because the sunlight there is on average 27 times fainter, at least in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. The planet's narrow [[planetary ring|rings]] might be faintly visible from latitudes above the equator. Further down into the atmosphere, the Sun would be obscured by clouds and haze of various colors, most commonly blue, brown, and red. Although theories abound on the cause of the colors, there is currently no unambiguous answer.&lt;ref name="bagenal"&gt;{{cite web

From Jupiter, the Sun appears to cover only 5 arcminutes, less than a quarter of its size as seen from Earth.

===Jupiter's moons as seen from Jupiter===
[[File:Jupiter's moons.jpg|thumb|left|Simulated view of Io, Europa, and the rings of Jupiter seen from their parent planet&lt;ref&gt;This and other simulated images on this page were made with the [[Celestia]] space simulation software.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Aside from the Sun, the most prominent objects in Jupiter's sky are the four [[Galilean moon]]s. [[Io (moon)|Io]], the nearest to the planet, would be slightly larger than the full moon in Earth's sky, though less bright, and would be the largest moon in the Solar System as seen from its parent planet. The higher [[albedo]] of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] would not overcome its greater distance from Jupiter, so it would not outshine Io. In fact, the low [[solar constant]] at Jupiter's distance (3.7% Earth's) ensures that none of the Galilean satellites would be as bright as the full moon is on Earth; from Io to Callisto their [[apparent magnitude]]s would be: −11.2, −9.7, −9.4, and −7.0.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
[[File:Artist's Concept of Europa Water Vapor Plume.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Water vapor]] plume on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (artist concept) (December 12, 2013)&lt;ref name="NASA-20131212-EU"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Jia-Rui C. |last2=Gutro |first2=Rob |last3=Brown |first3=Dwayne |last4=Harrington |first4=J.

[[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], the largest moon and third from Jupiter, is almost as bright as Io and Europa, but appears only half the size of Io. However, its great size means that it appears about 2″ larger than Europa. Also, a triple conjunction of Io, Europa and Ganymede would be impossible, because the [[Orbital resonance#Laplace resonance|Laplace resonance]] that they share prevents this. When two of the Galilean moons are aligned, the third is never less than 90 degrees to the left or right of these moons in its orbit. [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], still further out, would appear only a quarter the size of Io.

None of the surface features on Jupiter's moons would appear as prominent as the lunar maria do when the Moon is viewed from Earth. Dark and light patches would be visible on Io's surface due to the coloration of sulfur that covers Io, and the largest volcanoes would be designated by dark points, but the lack of large, contrasting features results in a poor view of it. Europa, however, would appear as a completely featureless white disc. Even when viewed from nearby, most spacecraft images use contrast enhancements to clearly show the cracks in the Europan ice, which are only about 10–15 percent darker than the rest of the surface. Vague dark and light patches would be visible on Ganymede, whereas Callisto is much too distant for any features to be made out.

All four Galilean moons stand out because of the swiftness of their motion, compared to the Moon. They are all also large enough to fully [[eclipse]] the Sun.&lt;ref name="CallistoSun"&gt;{{cite web

Because Jupiter's axial tilt is minimal, and the Galilean moons all orbit in the plane of Jupiter's equator, solar eclipses are quite common.

Jupiter's small inner moons appear only as starlike points except Amalthea, which can occasionally appear as large as Callisto. However, they would all be brighter than any star, ranging from magnitudes −1.5 to −4.9. The outer moons would be invisible except for [[Himalia (moon)|Himalia]], which would appear as a dim, starlike point to the naked eye (magnitude +5.5) only under favorable circumstances (if its periapsis happens to coincide exactly with its full phase).

===The skies of Jupiter's moons===
[[File:ITS Interplanetary Spaceship, landed on Europa.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist's impression of an ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' on the [[Jupiter (planet)|Jovian]] moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], after 2020; a part of the [[Interplanetary Transport System]] currently in funded development, under the name [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]], by [[SpaceX]]]]
None of Jupiter's moons have more than traces of atmosphere, so their skies are black or very nearly so. For an observer on one of the moons, the most prominent feature of the sky by far would be Jupiter. For an observer on [[Io (moon)|Io]], the closest large moon to the planet, Jupiter's apparent diameter would be about 20° (38 times the visible diameter of the Moon, covering 1% of Io's sky). An observer on [[Metis (moon)|Metis]], the innermost moon, would see Jupiter's apparent diameter increased to 68° (130 times the visible diameter of the Moon, covering 18% of Metis's sky). A "full Jupiter" over Metis shines with about 4% of the Sun's brightness (light on Earth from a full moon is 400 thousand times dimmer than sunlight).

Because the inner moons of Jupiter are in [[synchronous rotation]] around Jupiter, the planet always appears in nearly the same spot in their skies (Jupiter would wiggle a bit because of the non-zero eccentricities). Observers on the sides of the Galilean satellites facing away from the planet would never see Jupiter, for instance.

From the moons of Jupiter, [[solar eclipse]]s caused by the Galilean satellites would be spectacular, because an observer would see the circular shadow of the eclipsing moon travel across Jupiter's face.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;{{cite web

==Saturn==
[[File:Earth-Moon system as seen from Saturn (PIA17171).jpg|left|thumb|250px|NASA's [[Cassini spacecraft]] photographs the [[Earth]] and [[Moon]] (visible bottom-right) from [[Saturn]] (July 19, 2013)]] 
The sky in the upper reaches of [[Saturn]]'s atmosphere is blue (from imagery of the Cassini mission at the time of its September 2017 demise), but the predominant color of its cloud decks suggests that it may be yellowish further down. Observations from spacecraft show that seasonal smog develops in Saturn's southern hemisphere at its perihelion due to its axial tilt. This could cause the sky to become yellowish at times. As the northern hemisphere is pointed towards the sun only at aphelion, the sky there would likely remain blue. The [[rings of Saturn]] are almost certainly visible from the upper reaches of its atmosphere. The rings are so thin that from a position on Saturn's equator, they would be almost invisible. However, from anywhere else on the planet, they could be seen as a spectacular arc stretching across half the celestial hemisphere.&lt;ref name="bagenal" /&gt;
[[File:Saturn sunset.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated view of Saturn's rings seen from its equator]]
[[File:Saturn rings.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated view of Saturn's rings seen from a latitude above its equator]] 
Saturn's moons would not look particularly impressive in its sky, as most are fairly small, and the largest are a long way from the planet. Even [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of Saturn, appears only half the size of Earth's moon, and only grows as bright as −7. In fact, Titan is the dimmest of Saturn's large moons due to its great distance and low albedo; Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea are all brighter, at magnitudes −7.8, −7.9, −8.8, −8, and −7.8, respectively. Here are the approximate [[angular diameter]]s of the main moons (for comparison, Earth's moon has an average angular diameter of 31′): Mimas: 7–11′, Enceladus: 7–9′, Tethys: 12–15′, Dione: 10–12′, Rhea: 8–11′, Titan: 14–15′, Iapetus: 1′. Most of the inner moons would appear as bright, starlike points (with the exception of [[Janus (moon)|Janus]], which would appear 7 arcseconds across at its zenith), although most would shine brighter than any star; for example, Janus and Epimetheus would both shine as bright as magnitude −6. Meanwhile, none of the outer moons would be visible except Phoebe, which nears the naked eye limit (6.2–6.6) even at full phase.

Saturn has a southern polar star, [[δ Octantis]], a magnitude 4.3 star. It is much fainter than Earth's [[Polaris]] (α Ursae Minoris).

===The skies of Saturn's moons===
Since the inner moons of Saturn are all in [[synchronous rotation]], the planet always appears in the same spot in their skies. Observers on the sides of those satellites facing away from the planet would never see Saturn.

In the skies of Saturn's inner moons, Saturn is an enormous object. For instance, Saturn seen from [[Pan (moon)|Pan]] has an apparent diameter of ~50°, 104 times larger than our Moon and occupying 11% of Pan's sky. Because Pan orbits along the [[Encke division]] within Saturn's rings, they are visible from anywhere on Pan, even on its side facing away from Saturn.

====The rings from Saturn's moons====
Saturn's rings would not be prominent from most of the moons. This is because the rings, though wide, are not very thick, and most of the moons orbit almost exactly (within 1.5°) in the planet's ring plane. Thus, the rings are edge-on and practically invisible from the inner moons. From the outer moons, starting with [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], a more oblique view of the rings would be available, although the greater distance would make Saturn appear smaller in the sky; from [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], the largest of Saturn's irregular moons, Saturn would appear only as big as the full Moon does from Earth. The play of distance and angle is quite sensitive to the values used, but calculations show the best view of the rings would be achieved from the inner moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], which lies a full 1.5° off Saturn's equatorial plane ''and'' is fairly near the rings. At their widest opening, when Mimas is at its maximum distance from Saturn's equatorial plane, the edges of the rings (from B to A) would be separated by 2.7 degrees. The co-orbitals [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]] would also get a good view, with maximum opening angles ranging between 1.5 and 2.9°. [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] gets the next best view, with nearly half a degree. Iapetus achieves 15.47°, which is more than any of the outer moons can claim.

====The sky of Titan====
[[File:Huygens surface color.jpg|thumb|right|Image of the surface of Titan from the Huygens probe]]
[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is the only moon in the solar system to have a thick atmosphere. Images from the [[Huygens probe]] show that the Titanean sky is a light tangerine color. However, an astronaut standing on the surface of Titan would see a hazy brownish/dark orange color. As a consequence of its greater distance from the Sun and the opacity of its atmosphere, the surface of Titan receives only about {{frac|3000}} of the sunlight Earth does – daytime on Titan is thus only as bright as twilight on the Earth. It seems likely that Saturn is permanently invisible behind orange smog, and even the Sun would only be a lighter patch in the haze, barely illuminating the surface of ice and methane lakes. However, in the upper atmosphere, the sky would have a blue color and Saturn would be visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beugungsbild.de/huygens/povray/titan_rendered.html |title=POV-Ray renderings of Huygens descending to Titan |first=René |last=Pascal |website=www.beugungsbild.de }}&lt;/ref&gt; With its thick atmosphere and methane rain, Titan is the only celestial body other than Earth upon which [[rainbow]]s could form. However, given the extreme opacity of the atmosphere in visible light, the vast majority would be in the infrared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rainbows on Titan |work=[[NASA]] |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/25feb_titan2/|accessdate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The sky of Enceladus====
[[File:Saturn seen from Enceladus (artist concept).jpg|thumb|250px|left|An artist's conception of Enceladus's sky]]
Seen from [[Enceladus]], Saturn would have a visible diameter of almost 30°, sixty times more than the Moon visible from Earth. Moreover, since Enceladus rotates synchronously with its orbital period and therefore keeps one face pointed toward Saturn, the planet never moves in Enceladus's sky (albeit with slight variations coming from the orbit's [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]]), and cannot be seen from the far side of the satellite.

Saturn's rings would be seen from an angle of only 0.019° and be almost invisible, but their shadow on Saturn's disk would be clearly distinguishable. Like our own Moon from Earth, Saturn itself would show regular [[Lunar phase|phase]]s. From Enceladus, the Sun would have a diameter of only 3.5 minutes of arc, one-ninth that of the Moon as seen from Earth.

An observer located on Enceladus could also observe [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] (the biggest satellite located inside Enceladus's orbit) transit in front of Saturn every 72 hours, on average. Its apparent size would be at most 26 minutes of arc, about the same size as the Moon seen from Earth. [[Pallene (moon)|Pallene]] and [[Methone (moon)|Methone]] would appear nearly star-like (maximum 30 seconds of arc). [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], visible from Enceladus's anti-Saturnian side, would reach a maximum apparent size of about 64 minutes of arc, about twice that of the Moon as seen from the Earth.

==Uranus==
Judging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of [[Uranus]] is probably a light blue, i.e. [[Cyan (color)|cyan]] color. It is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark. Uranus has a northern polar star, [[Sabik]] (η Ophiuchi), a magnitude 2.4 star. Uranus also has a southern polar star, [[15 Orionis]], an unremarkable magnitude 4.8 star. Both are fainter than Earth's [[Polaris]] (α Ursae Minoris), although Sabik only slightly.&lt;ref name="bagenal" /&gt;
[[File:Uranian sky.jpg|thumb|Simulated view of Ariel in the sky of Uranus]]
Uranus is unusual in that the obliquity of its ecliptic is 82° (angle between the orbital and rotational poles). The North Pole of Uranus&lt;!--- R.A. 17 h 9 min 15 s, Dec. −15° 10' 30"; the orbital pole lies at R.A. 18 h 7 min 23 s, Dec. +66° 20' 26" ---&gt; points to somewhere near [[Sabik|η Ophiuchi]] (in Earth's ''southern'' celestial hemisphere), about 15° northeast of [[Antares]], and its South Pole halfway between [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Aldebaran]]. Uranus's "tropics" lie at 82° latitude and its "Arctic circles" at 8° latitude. On December 17, 2007, the Sun passed the Uranian celestial equator to the North and in 2029 the North Pole of Uranus will be nearly pointed at the Sun.

None of Uranus's moons would appear as large as a full moon on Earth from the surface of their parent planet, but the large number of them would present an interesting sight for observers hovering above the cloudtops. The [[angular diameter]]s of the five large moons are as follows (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31′ for terrestrial observers): Miranda, 11–15′; Ariel, 20–23′; Umbriel, 15–17′; Titania, 11–13′; Oberon, 8–9′. Unlike on Jupiter and Saturn, many of the inner moons can be seen as disks rather than starlike points; the moons [[Portia (moon)|Portia]] and [[Juliet (moon)|Juliet]] can appear around the size of Miranda at times, and a number of other inner moons appear larger than Oberon. Several others range from 6′ to 8′. The outer irregular moons would not be visible to the naked eye.

However, the low light levels at such a great distance from the sun ensure that the moons appear very dim; the brightest, Ariel, would only shine at magnitude −7.4, more than 100 times dimmer than the moon as seen from Earth. Meanwhile, the outer large moon Oberon would only be as bright as magnitude −4.9, about the same as Venus despite its proximity.

==Neptune==
[[File:Neptunian sky.jpg|thumb|Simulated view of Triton in the sky of Neptune.]]
Judging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of [[Neptune]] is probably an [[Azure (color)|azure or sky blue]], similar to [[Uranus]]'. As in the case of Uranus, it is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark.

Aside from the Sun, the most impressive object in Neptune's sky is its large moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], which would appear slightly smaller than a full Moon on Earth. It moves more swiftly than our Moon, because of its shorter period (5.8 days) compounded by its [[retrograde orbit]]. The smaller moon [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]] would show a disk about half the size of the full Moon. Surprisingly, Neptune's small inner moons all cover, at some point in their orbits, more than 10′ in Neptune's sky. At some points, Despina's angular diameter rivals that of Ariel from Uranus and Ganymede from Jupiter. Here are the angular diameters for Neptune's moons (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31′ for terrestrial observers): Naiad, 7–13′; Thalassa, 8–14′; Despina, 14–22′; Galatea, 13–18′; Larissa, 10–14′; Proteus, 12–16′; Triton, 26–28′. An alignment of the inner moons would likely produce a spectacular sight. Neptune's large outer satellite, [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], is not large enough to appear as a disk from Neptune, and is not noticeable in the sky, as its brightness at full phase varies from magnitude 2.2–6.4, depending on which point in its eccentric orbit it happens to be. The other irregular outer moons would not be visible to the naked eye, although a dedicated telescopic observer could potentially spot some at full phase.

As with Uranus, the low light levels cause the major moons to appear very dim. The brightness of Triton at full phase is only −7.11, despite the fact that Triton is more than 4 times as intrinsically bright as our moon and orbits much closer to Neptune.

===The sky of Triton===
[[File:Tritonian sky.jpg|thumb|left|Simulated view of Neptune in the sky of Triton]]
[[Triton (moon)|Triton]], Neptune's largest moon, has an atmosphere, but it is so thin that its sky is still black, possibly with some pale haze at the horizon. Because Triton orbits with [[synchronous rotation]], Neptune always appears in the same position in its sky. Triton's rotation axis is inclined 130° to Neptune's orbital plane and thus points within 40° of the [[Sun]] twice per Neptunian year, much like [[Uranus]]'s. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun for 82 years at a stretch, resulting in radical seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight.

Neptune itself would span 8 degrees in Triton's sky, though with a maximum brightness roughly comparable to that of the full moon on Earth it would appear only about {{frac|256}} as bright as the full moon, per unit area. Due to its eccentric orbit, [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]] would vary considerably in brightness, from fifth to first magnitude; its disk would be far too small to see with the naked eye. [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]] would also be difficult to resolve at just 5–6 arcminutes across, but it would never be fainter than first magnitude, and at its closest would rival [[Canopus]].

==Trans-Neptunian Objects==

A [[trans-Neptunian object]] is any minor planet in the Solar System that orbits the Sun at a greater average distance (semi-major axis) than Neptune, 30 astronomical units (AU).

===Pluto and Charon===
[[Pluto]], accompanied by its largest moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], orbits the Sun at a distance usually outside the orbit of [[Neptune]] except for a twenty-year period in each orbit.

From Pluto, the Sun is point-like to human eyes, but still very bright, giving roughly 150 to 450 times the light of the full Moon from Earth (the variability being due to the fact that Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, stretching from just 4.4 billion km to over 7.3 billion km from the Sun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/03/15/bafact-math-how-bright-is-the-sun-from-pluto/ |title=BAFact math: How bright is the Sun from Pluto? |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=15 March 2012 |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=6 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, human observers would find a large decrease in available light.

Pluto's atmosphere consists of a thin envelope of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide gases, all of which are derived from the ices of these substances on its surface. When Pluto is close to the Sun, the temperature of Pluto's solid surface increases, causing these ices to sublimate into gasses. This atmosphere also produces a noticeable blue haze that is visible at sunset and possibly other times of the Plutonian day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830433-200-new-horizons-shows-pluto-sporting-blue-skies-and-red-water-ice/ |title=New Horizons shows Pluto sporting blue skies and red water ice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluto and Charon are [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to each other. This means that Charon always presents the same face to Pluto, and Pluto also always presents the same face to Charon. Observers on the far side of Charon from Pluto would never see the dwarf planet; observers on the far side of Pluto from Charon would never see the moon. Every 124 years, for several years it is mutual-eclipse season, during which Pluto and Charon each alternatively eclipse the Sun for the other at intervals of 3.2 days.

===50000 Quaoar and its moon Weywot===
The asteroid [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] is a [[Kuiper belt]] object with a circular orbit and moderate inclination. From its surface and at the average distance between its perihelion and aphelion the Sun would have an [[angular diameter]] of 44.2″ ([[Minute and second of arc|arcseconds]]) comparable to the maximum diameter of Venus of 63.0″; the [[human eye]] has a resolution of 72″, so the Sun from Quaoar's surface would appear as a point. The Sun's [[apparent magnitude]] would be −18.56, in comparison the magnitude of the Moon at [[Phase angle (astronomy)|full phase]] is −12.74, so the Sun would appear on Quaoar as a point of light 212 times brighter than a full Moon on Earth. The amount of light depends on the atmosphere: if present the amount of light received at noon would be similar to the light at dusk or dawn on Earth.

Quaoar's moon [[50000 Quaoar#Satellite|Weywot]] has an angular diameter of 15.9′ ([[Minute and second of arc|arcminutes]]) at [[apsis|apoapsis]] and 21.4′ at [[apsis|periapsis]], in comparison the Moon's angular diameter varies between 29.4′ and 33.5′. In comparison to the size of the Sun from Quaoar's surface Weywot would appear much bigger: 15.9′ is equal to 954″ or 21.6 times the diameter of the Sun as seen from Quaoar. Most solar eclipses would be total and a partial eclipse would be extremely rare. At full phase Weywot's visual magnitude is −3.24 somewhere between Jupiter's maximum magnitude (−2.94) and Venus's minimum magnitude (−3.82), in comparison the Moon at full phase is 6,301 times brighter than Weywot.

Quaoar's [[Umbra, penumbra and antumbra|umbra]] extends 5,180,390&amp;nbsp;km and at the distance of Weywot's apoapsis it would have a diameter of 1,106.5&amp;nbsp;km or 15 times Weywot's diameter. In comparison, Earth's umbra at the Moon's position is 2.65 times wider. Weywot's inclination is not determined yet, it's either 14° or 30°, if we assume the smaller value then Weywot's center at apoapsis can be up to 4,121&amp;nbsp;km above or below Quaoar's [[equatorial plane]], this mean for most of the time Weywot is outside of the umbra completely.

==Comets==
The sky of a [[comet]] changes dramatically as it nears the Sun. During perihelion, a comet's ices begin to [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublime]] from its surface, forming tails of gas and dust, and a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]]. An observer on a comet nearing the Sun might see the stars slightly obscured by a milky haze, which could create [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] effects around the Sun and other bright objects.

==Extrasolar planets==
===Basics===
{{OR section|date=April 2013}}
For observers on [[extrasolar planet]]s, the [[constellation]]s would differ depending on the distances involved. The view of outer space of [[exoplanets]] can be extrapolated from open source software such as [[Celestia]] or [[Stellarium]], and it appears that due to [[parallax]], distant stars change their position less than nearby ones.  For alien observers, the Sun would be visible to the [[naked eye|naked human eye]] only at distances below 20&lt;ref name="SIMBAD-mag6.5"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vmag&lt;6.5 |publisher=SIMBAD Astronomical Database |url=http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-sam?Criteria=Vmag%3C6.5 |accessdate=26 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – 27&lt;ref name="Bortle"&gt;{{cite web |date = February 2001|title=The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale |publisher=Sky &amp; Telescope |first=John E. |last=Bortle |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html |accessdate=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[parsec]] (60–90 [[light year|ly]]).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;These numbers are extrapolated from the fact that the human eye can generally see up to magnitude 6.5 on [[Earth]], while it can see up to magnitude 7 under the best possible conditions.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whenever the sun is observed from another star, it always appears on the opposite coordinates in the sky.  Thus an observer located near a star with [[right ascension|RA]] at 4 [[minute of arc|hr]] and [[declination]] −10 would see the sun located at RA: 16 hr, dec: +10.  A consequence of observing the universe from other stars is that stars that may appear bright in our own sky may appear dimmer in other skies and vice versa.

===View from nearby stars (0 – 10 ly)===

If the Sun were to be observed from the [[Alpha Centauri]] system, the nearest [[star system]] to ours, it would appear to be a 0.46 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] star in the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and would create a "/W" shape instead of the "W" as seen from [[Earth]].  Due to the proximity of the Alpha Centauri system, the constellations would, for the most part, appear similar. However, there are some notable differences with the position of other nearby stars; for example, [[Sirius]] would appear about one degree from the star [[Betelgeuse]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Also, [[Procyon]] would appear in the constellation [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], about 13 degrees below [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]].

&lt;!--- To compute the following figures, use masses 1.1 and 0.92 Suns, luminosities 1.57 and 0.51 Suns (Sun visual magnitude -26.73), and an orbit of 11.2 to 35.6 AUs; min luminosity adds the planet's orbital radius to the max A-B distance (conjunction), max luminosity subtracts the planet's orbital radius from the min A-B distance (opposition) ---&gt;
[[File:Sky-from-alpha-centauri.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Looking towards the sky around Orion from Alpha Centauri with [[Sirius]] near [[Betelgeuse]], [[Procyon]] in [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], and the [[Sun]] between [[Perseus]] and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] generated by [[Celestia]]]]
A planet around either α Centauri A or B would see the other star as a very bright secondary. For example, an Earth-like planet at 1.25 [[astronomical unit]]s from α Cen A (with a revolution period of 1.34 years) would get Sun-like illumination from its primary, and α Cen B would appear 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes dimmer (−21.0 to −18.2), 190 to 2,700 times dimmer than α Cen A but still 150 to 2,100 times brighter than the full Moon. Conversely, an Earth-like planet at 0.71 AU from α Cen B (with a revolution period of 0.63 years) would get Sun-like illumination from its primary, and α Cen A would appear 4.6 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer (−22.1 to −19.4), 70 to 840 times dimmer than α Cen B but still 470 to 5,700 times brighter than the full Moon. In both cases the secondary sun would, in the course of the planet's year, appear to circle the sky. It would start off right beside the primary and end up, half a period later, opposite it in the sky (at "full"). After another half period, it would complete the cycle. Other planets orbiting one member of a binary system would enjoy similar skies. The angular separation between the two stars would not be exactly the same after one orbit of the planet however, because during that time the parent star will have completed part of its orbit around the other star in the system.

===View from more distant stars (10 ly – )===

From [[40 Eridani]], 16 light years away, the Sun would be an average looking star of about [[apparent magnitude]] 3.3 in the constellation [[Serpens Caput]]. At this distance most of the [[List of nearest stars|stars nearest to us]] would be in different locations to those in our sky, including [[Alpha Centauri]], [[Sirius]], and [[Procyon]].

From a planet orbiting [[Aldebaran]], 65 light years away, our [[Sun]] would be seen as an insignificant 6.4 magnitude star between [[Ophiuchus]] and Scorpius (more specifically, it would in the vicinity of [[Phi Ophiuchi]] and [[24 Scorpii]]).  Constellations made of bright, distant stars would look somewhat similar (such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]) but much of the night sky would seem unfamiliar to someone from Earth. Even Orion would appear somewhat different; viewed from this position, [[Alnilam]] and [[Mintaka]] would appear to be on top of each other, only 15 arcminutes apart, thus reducing the belt to two stars.  Also [[Bellatrix]] would be much closer to the [[Orion's Belt|belt]], making the "chest" somewhat smaller.

A '''fan''' is a powered [[machine]] used to create flow within a [[fluid]], typically a [[gas]] such as [[air]].
A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades which act on the air. The rotating assembly of blades and hub is known as an impeller, a rotor, or a runner. Usually, it is contained within some form of housing or case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/201417/fan|title=Fan|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may direct the airflow or increase safety by preventing objects from contacting the fan blades. Most fans are powered by [[electricity|electric]] motors, but other sources of power may be used, including [[hydraulic motor]]s, [[handcrank]]s, [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engines]], and [[Solar power|solar power]].

Mechanically, a fan can be any revolving [[wikt:vane#English|vane]] or vanes used for producing [[air current|currents of air]]. Fans produce air flows with high [[volume]] and low [[pressure]] (although higher than [[ambient pressure]]), as opposed to [[gas compressor|compressors]] which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume. A fan [[blade]] will often rotate when exposed to an air fluid stream, and devices that take advantage of this, such as [[anemometer]]s and [[wind turbine]]s, often have designs similar to that of a fan.
{{details|centrifugal compressor}}
Typical applications include [[HVAC#Ventilation|climate control]] and personal [[thermal comfort]] (e.g., an electric table or floor fan), vehicle engine cooling systems (e.g., in front of a [[radiator]]), machinery cooling systems (e.g., inside computers and [[audio power amplifier]]s), ventilation, fume extraction, [[winnowing]] (e.g., separating chaff of [[cereal]] grains), removing [[dust]] (e.g. [[sucking]] as in a [[vacuum cleaner]]), drying (usually in combination with a heat source) and to provide draft for a [[fire]].

While fans are often used to cool people, they do not actually cool air (if anything, electric fans warm it slightly due to the warming of their motors), but work by [[evaporative cooling]] of [[sweat]] and increased heat [[convection]] into the surrounding air due to the airflow from the fans. Thus, fans may become ineffective at cooling the body if the surrounding air is near body temperature and contains high humidity. {{citation needed span|text=During periods of very high heat and humidity, governments actually advise against the use of fans.|date=July 2018}}

== History ==
The [[punkah]] fan was used in [[India]] about 500 BCE. It was a handheld fan made from bamboo strips or other plant fibre, that could be rotated or fanned to move air. During [[British India|British rule]], the word came to be used by Anglo-Indians to mean a large swinging flat fan, fixed to the ceiling, and pulled by a servant, called the [[punkawallah]].
[[File:Patent, Mechanical Fan, 1830.png|thumb|left|225px|[[Patent drawing]] for a ''Fan Moved by Mechanism'', 27 November 1830]]

For purposes of [[air conditioning]], the Han Dynasty craftsman and engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 CE) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied [[Hydraulics|hydraulic power]] to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan became even more common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 99, 134, 151, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the experiments of scientists including [[Otto von Guericke]], [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]], established the basic principles of vacuum and airflow. The English architect Sir [[Christopher Wren]] applied an early ventilation system in the [[Houses of Parliament]] that used bellows to circulate air. Wren's design would be the catalyst for much later improvement and innovation. The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by [[Georg Agricola]] (1494–1555).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 154"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], a British engineer, demonstrated a successful use of a fan system to draw out stagnant air from coal mines in 1727 and soon afterwards he installed a similar apparatus in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanmakers.com/text.aspx?id=26 |title=A Short History of Mechanical Fans |publisher=The Worshipful Company of Fan Makers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204080959/http://www.fanmakers.com/text.aspx?id=26 |archivedate=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Good ventilation was particularly important in coal mines to reduce casualties from asphyxiation. The civil engineer [[John Smeaton]], and later [[John Buddle]] installed reciprocating air pumps in the mines in the North of [[England]]. However, this arrangement was not ideal as the machinery was liable to breaking down.

=== Steam ===
With the advent of practical [[steam power]], fans could finally be used for ventilation. In 1837 William Fourness of England installed a steam-driven fan at [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AHp8K45uCmwC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Fourness+Steam+Fan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZwLjft83QAhUHAsAKHc9SDc4Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fourness%20Steam%20Fan&amp;f=false Collieries of Wales: Engineering and Architecture], By Stephen R. Hughes, Page 97&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 a 6&amp;nbsp;m radius steam driven fan, designed by [[William Brunton]], was made operational in the Gelly Gaer [[Colliery]] of [[South Wales]]. The model was exhibited at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. Also in 1851 [[David Boswell Reid]], a Scottish doctor, installed four steam powered fans in the ceiling of [[St George's Hospital]] in [[Liverpool]], so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/8_Engineers%20Contractors%20and%20Industrial%20Construction/Bruegmann_Central.pdf|title=Central Heating and Ventilation:Origins and Effects on Architectural Design|author=Robert Bruegmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/heating-ventilation/heatingventilation.pdf/ HISTORIC BUILDING ENGINEERING SYSTEMS &amp; EQUIPMENT HEATING &amp; VENTILATION], By Brian Roberts, CIBSE Heritage Group&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the technology were made by [[James Nasmyth]], Frenchman Theophile Guibal and J. R. Waddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x-pL19ro-qsC|title=Fans and Ventilation: A practical guide|author=Cory, William|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080531588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrical ===
Between 1882 and 1886 [[Schuyler Wheeler]] invented a fan powered by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B. A. C. (Before Air Conditioning)|publisher=New Orleans Bar Association|url=http://www.neworleansbar.org/documents/BeforeA.C.8-5_000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commercially marketed by the American firm Crocker &amp; Curtis electric motor company. In 1882, [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl]] developed the world's first electric [[ceiling fan]].  During this intense period of innovation, fans powered by alcohol, oil, or kerosene were common around the turn of the 20th century.
In 1909, [[KDK]] of Japan pioneered the invention of mass-produced electric fans for home use. In the 1920s, industrial advances allowed steel fans to be mass-produced in different shapes, bringing fan prices down and allowing more homeowners to afford them. In the 1930s, the first art deco fan (the "swan fan") was designed. By the 1940s, [[Crompton Greaves]] of India became the world's largest manufacturer of electric ceiling fans mainly for sale in India, Asia and the Middle East. By the 1950s, table and stand fans were manufactured in colors that were bright and eye catching.

Window and central [[air conditioning]] in the 1960s caused many companies to discontinue production of fans.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Fans"&gt;[http://www.fancollectors.org/fanhistory.htm Fancollectors.org – A Brief History of Fans] Information Provided by Steve Cunningham – retrieved July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; But in the mid 1970s, with an increasing awareness of the cost of electricity and the amount of energy used to heat and cool homes, turn-of-the-century styled ceiling fans became immensely popular again as both decorative and energy efficient units.

In 1998, Walter K. Boyd invented the [[High-volume low-speed fan|HVLS ceiling fan]]. A lifelong inventor, Boyd was charged with developing a system to cool dairy cattle. Dairy cattle, when overheated, decrease milk production. Using the laws of physics and airflow, Boyd developed a slow moving fan that incorporated 10 aluminum blades and was 8-feet diameter. Unlike traditional ceiling fans that move quickly, this large fan moved slowly. Due to its diameter size, the fan moved a large column of air down and out 360 degrees and continuously mixed fresh air with the stale air inside the barn. They are used in many industrial and agricultural settings, because of their energy efficiency. It also cooled the inside of the barn without causing the dairy cattle undue stress or kicking up dust.

After much testing, Boyd discovered HVLS fan technology to be energy efficient as it costs less to run one HVLS fan than it did to run 50 small high-speed fans. Due to the skyrocketing costs of energy, HVLS commercial ceiling fans are used today to supplement HVAC systems in industrial and commercial settings, including warehouses, manufacturing facilities and malls, as HVLS fans help lower heating and cooling costs.&lt;ref name="Industrial Fan Designer Finds Niche in Energy Efficiency"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101227180929/http://www.designnews.com/blog/Automation_and_Control/40243-Industrial_Fan_Designer_Finds_Niche_in_Energy_Efficiency.php Industrial Fan Designer Finds Niche in Energy Efficiency – Automation and Control], By David Greenfield, December 20, 2010, Blog on Design News,  Information provided by Dianna Huff – retrieved May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Two box fans.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Two c. 1980 box fans]]
[[File:Ceiling fan with lamp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ceiling fan with a lamp.]]
Mechanical revolving blade fans are made in a wide range of designs. They are used on the floor, table, desk, or hung from the ceiling (ceiling fan). They can also be built into a [[Window fan|window]], wall, roof, chimney, etc. Most electronic systems such as [[computer]]s include fans to cool the circuits inside, and in appliances such as hair dryers and portable space heaters and mounted/installed wall heaters. They are also used for moving air in air-conditioning systems, and in automotive engines, where they are driven by belts or by direct motor. Fans used for comfort create a [[wind chill]] by increasing the [[heat transfer coefficient]], but do not lower temperatures directly. Fans used to cool electrical equipment or in engines or other machines do cool the equipment directly by forcing hot air into the cooler environment outside of the machine.

There are three main types of fans used for moving air, ''axial'', ''centrifugal'' (also called ''radial'') and ''cross flow'' (also called ''tangential''). [[ASME|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] Performance Testing Code 11 (PTC)&lt;ref name="PTC 11 – Fans"&gt;[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/ptc-11-2008-fans ASME PTC 11 – Fans].&lt;/ref&gt; provides standard procedures for conducting and reporting tests on fans, including those of the centrifugal, axial, and mixed flows.

=== Axial-flow ===
[[File:Luefter y.s.tech pd1270153b-2f.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An axial box fan for cooling electrical equipment.]]
Axial-flow fans have blades that force air to move [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the shaft about which the blades rotate. This type of fan is used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from small cooling fans for electronics to the giant fans used in [[wind tunnel]]s. Axial flow fans are applied in air conditioning and industrial process applications. Standard axial flow fans have diameters from 300–400&amp;nbsp;mm or 1800 to 2000&amp;nbsp;mm and work under pressures up to 800 Pa. Special types of fans are used as low pressure compressor stages in aircraft engines.
Examples of axial fans are:
* Table fan: Basic elements of a typical table fan include the fan blade, base, armature and lead [[wire]]s, motor, blade [[safety barrier|guard]], motor housing, [[oscillator]] gearbox, and oscillator shaft. The oscillator is a mechanism that motions the fan from side to side. The armature axle shaft comes out on both ends of the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator. The oscillator shaft combines to the weighted base and the gearbox. A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety.
[[File:Ceiling fan with light.png|thumb|right|200px|A [[Ceiling fan]] is an example of an axial fan.]]
*Domestic Extractor Fan: Wall or ceiling mounted, the domestic extractor fan is employed to remove moisture and stale air from domestic dwellings. Bathroom extractor fans typically utilize a four inch (100mm) impeller, whilst kitchen extractor fans typically use a six inch (150mm) impeller as the room itself is often bigger. Axial fans with 125mm impellers are also used in larger bathrooms though are much less common. Domestic axial extractor fans are not suitable for duct runs over 3m or 4m, depending on the number of bends in the run, as the increased air pressure in longer pipework inhibits the performance of the fan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/choosing-a-bathroom-extractor-fan-123-c.asp|title=Choosing a Bathroom Extractor Fan|last=|first=|date=10 July 2018|website=Extarctor Fan World|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Electro-mechanical fans: Among collectors, are rated according to their condition, size, age, and number of blades. Four-blade designs are the most common. Five-blade or six-blade designs are rare. The materials from which the components are made, such as brass, are important factors in fan desirability.
*[[Ceiling fan]]: A fan suspended from the ceiling of a room is a ceiling fan. Most ceiling fans rotate at relatively low speeds and do not have blade guards. Ceiling fans can be found in both residential and industrial/commercial settings.
* In [[automobile]]s, a mechanical fan provides [[engine cooling]] and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a [[coolant]]-filled [[radiator]]. The fan may be driven with a [[pulley#Belt and pulley systems|belt and pulley]] off the [[internal-combustion engine|engine]]'s [[crankshaft]] or an electric motor switched on or off by a [[thermostat]]ic [[switch]].
* [[Computer fan|Computer cooling fan]] for cooling electrical components
* Fans inside [[audio power amplifier]]s help to draw heat away from the electrical components.
* [[Variable pitch fan|variable-pitch fan]]: A variable-pitch fan is used where precise control of static pressure within supply ducts is required. The blades are arranged to rotate upon a control-pitch hub. The fan wheel will spin at a constant  speed. The blades follow the control pitch hub. As the hub moves toward the rotor, the blades increase their angle of attack and an increase in flow results.

=== Centrifugal ===
{{Main|centrifugal fan}}
[[File:CentrifugalFan.png|thumb|right|upright|Typical centrifugal fan.]]
[[File:Centrifugal fan.png|thumb|left|200px|A diagram of a centrifugal fan, with top view to show airflow.]]
Often called a "squirrel cage" (because of its general similarity in appearance to [[Hamster wheel|exercise wheels]] for pet rodents) or "scroll fan", the centrifugal fan has a moving component (called an [[impeller]]) that consists of a central shaft about which a set of blades form a [[spiral]], or ribs, are positioned. Centrifugal fans blow air at right angles to the intake of the fan, and spin the air outwards to the outlet (by deflection and [[centrifugal force]]). The impeller rotates, causing air to enter the fan near the shaft and move [[perpendicular]]ly from the shaft to the opening in the scroll-shaped fan casing. A centrifugal fan produces more pressure for a given air volume, and is used where this is desirable such as in [[leaf blower]]s, [[blowdryer]]s, air mattress inflators, [[inflatable structure]]s, [[climate control]], and various industrial purposes. They are typically quieter than comparable axial fans.

=== Cross-flow fan ===
[[File:Cross-flow fan schematic patent.png|thumb|Cross-section of cross-flow fan, from the 1893 patent. The rotation is clock-wise. The stream guide ''F'' is usually not present in modern implementations.]]
[[File:Tangential-flow-coloured-labels.png|thumb|right|upright|Cross-flow fan]]
The ''cross-flow'' or ''tangential'' fan, sometimes known as a ''tubular'' fan, was patented in 1893 by Paul Mortier,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mortier. ''Fan or Blowing apparatus''. [https://www.google.com/patents/US507445 US Pat. No. 507,445]&lt;/ref&gt; and is used extensively in the [[HVAC]] industry. The fan is usually long in relation to the diameter, so the flow approximately remains two-dimensional away from the ends. The CFF uses an impeller with forward curved blades, placed in a housing consisting of a rear wall and vortex wall. Unlike radial machines, the main flow moves transversely across the impeller, passing the blading twice.

The flow within a cross-flow fan may be broken up into three distinct regions: a vortex region near the fan discharge, called an eccentric vortex, the through-flow region, and a paddling region directly opposite. Both the vortex and paddling regions are dissipative, and as a result, only a portion of the impeller imparts usable work on the flow. The cross-flow fan, or transverse fan, is thus a two-stage partial admission machine. The popularity of the crossflow fan in the HVAC industry comes from its compactness, shape, quiet operation, and ability to provide high pressure coefficient. Effectively a rectangular fan in terms of inlet and outlet geometry, the diameter readily scales to fit the available space, and the length is adjustable to meet flow rate requirements for the particular application.

Common household tower fans are also cross-flow fans. Much of the early work focused on developing the cross-flow fan for both high and low-flow-rate conditions, and resulted in numerous patents. Key contributions were made by Coester, Ilberg and Sadeh, Porter and Markland, and Eck. One interesting phenomenon particular to the cross-flow fan is that, as the blades rotate, the local air incidence angle changes. The result is that in certain positions the blades act as compressors (pressure increase), while at other azimuthal locations the blades act as [[turbine]]s (pressure decrease).

Since the flow both enters and exits the impeller radially, the crossflow fan is well suited for aircraft applications. Due to the 2D nature of the flow, the fan readily integrates into a wing for use in both thrust production and boundary-layer control. A configuration that utilizes a crossflow fan is located at the wing [[leading edge]] is the [[fanwing]]. This design creates lift by deflecting the wake downward due to the rotational direction of the fan, causing large Magnus force, similar to a spinning leading-edge cylinder. Another configuration utilizing a crossflow fan for thrust and flow control is the propulsive wing. In this design, the crossflow fan is placed near the [[trailing edge]] of a thick wing, and draws the air off the wing's suction (top) surface. By doing this, the propulsive wing is nearly stall-free, even at extremely high angles of attack, producing very high lift. The external links section provides links to these concepts.

A cross flow fan, is a centrifugal fan in which the air flows through the fan, rather than through an inlet. The rotor of a cross flow fan is covered to create a pressure differential. When used in household fans, cross flow fans have smaller opening on one side and a larger opening on the other. Cross flow fans have openings of different sizes on the front and rear sides. The resultant pressure difference allows air to flow straight through the fan, even though the fan blades counter the flow of air on one side of the rotation. Cross flow fans give airflow along the entire width of the fan, however, they are noiser than ordinary centrifugal fans presumedly because the fan blades fight the flow of air on one side of the rotation unlike normal squirrel cage fans. Cross flow fans are often used in [[air conditioner]]s, automobile ventilation systems, and for cooling in medium-sized equipment such as [[photocopier]]s.

The action of a fan or blower causes pressures slightly above atmospheric, which are called [[Plenum chamber|plenum]]s.

== Bladeless Indirect viscous-shear fan ==
{{Cleanup-jargon|section|date=December 2010}}
This is an indirect blower system which collects pressurized airflow from a standard blower device that can be of any type mentioned in this article, and directs the collected airflow through a hollow tube or toroid, blowing a thin high-velocity laminar airflow from holes or a continuous slot across the surface of the tube or toroid. These fans have a 3-dimensional mixed-flow impeller in a lower compartment. Air is drawn in and compressed, before being expelled  through an annulus, and accelerated over an airfoil lamp. Inducing and entraining ambient air through viscous shearing, the loop-shaped upper section multiplies the total airflow many times. The high velocity laminar airflow tends to drag ambient air along with it, due to [[viscous shear]]. Only around 7% of the total airflow actually passes through the fan itself.

== Uncommon types of fans ==

=== Bellows ===
{{Main|Bellows}}
[[File:Bellows (PSF).svg|thumb|Diagram of a single-acting hand bellows]]
[[Bellows]] are also used to move air, although not generally considered fans. A hand-operated bellows is essentially a bag with a nozzle and handles, which can be filled with air by one movement, and the air expelled by another. Typically it would comprise two rigid flat surfaces hinged at one end, where a nozzle is fitted, and with handles at the other.

The sides of the surfaces are joined by a flexible and air-proof material such as leather; the surfaces and joining material comprise a bag sealed everywhere but at the nozzle. (The joining material typically has a characteristic pleated construction that is so common that similar expanding fabric arrangements not used for moving air, such as on a [[folding camera]], are called [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]].) Separating the handles expands the bag, which fills with air; squeezing them together expels the air. A simple [[valve]] (e.g., a flap) may be fitted so that air enters without having to come from the nozzle, which may be close to a fire.

Bellows produce a directed pressurized stream of air; the airflow volume is typically low with moderate pressure. They are an older technology, used mainly to produce a strong and directed airflow unlike non-electric bladed mechanical fans, before the introduction of electricity.
* A single-acting bellows will only produce airflow during the exhaust stroke.
* A double-acting bellows is a pair of bellows capable of blowing out air from one while inhaling air into the other, but airflow still temporarily ceases when the stroke direction is reversed.
* Combining multiple bellows at third-cycle or quarter-cycle arrangements on a crank arm allows for nearly continuous airflow from several bellows at once; each is in a different phase of inhaling and exhausting during the cycle.

The [[Dyson Air Multiplier]] fans, and the Imperial C2000 series range hood fans, have no exposed fan blades or other visibly moving parts except their oscillating and tilting head. The airflow is generated using the [[Coandă effect]]; a small quantity of air from a high-pressure-bladed impeller fan, contained in the base rather than exposed, drives a large airmass via a low-pressure area created by the [[airfoil]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6377644/Dyson-fan-was-it-invented-30-years-ago.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=Dyson fan: was it invented 30 years ago? | date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5379890/dyson-air-multiplier-review-making-a-300-fan-takes-cojones Dyson Air Multiplier Review: Making a $300 Fan Takes Cojones]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/10/12/video-review-the-dyson-air-multiplier/ Video Review: The Dyson Air Multiplier], Posted Oct 12, 2009, by John Biggs, TechCrunch&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Patent &amp; Trademark Office initially ruled that Dyson's patent was not an improvement on the [[Toshiba]] patent on a nearly identical bladeless desktop fan granted in 1981.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt;
[[Air door|Air curtains and air doors]] also utilize this effect to help retain warm or cool air within an otherwise exposed area that lacks a cover or door. Air curtains are commonly used on open-face dairy, freezer, and vegetable displays to help retain chilled air within the cabinet using a laminar airflow circulated across the display opening. The airflow is typically generated by a mechanical fan of any type described in this article hidden in the base of the display cabinet.

=== Convective ===
Differences in air temperature will affect the density of air and can be used to induce air circulation through the mere act of heating or cooling an air mass. This effect is so subtle and works at such low air pressures that it does not appear to fit the definition of a fan technology. However, prior to the development of electricity, convective airflow was the primary method of inducing airflow in living spaces.
Old fashioned oil and coal furnaces were not electric and operated simply on the principle of convection to move the warm air. Very large volume air ducts were sloped upwards away from the top of the furnace towards floor and wall registers above the furnace. Cool air was returned through similar large ducts leading to the bottom of the furnace.
Older houses from before electrification often had open duct grilles leading from the ceiling of a lower level to the floor of an upper level, to allow convective airflow to slowly rise up the building from one floor to the next.
[[Outhouse]]s commonly rely on a simple enclosed air channel in a corner of the structure to exhaust offensive odors. Exposed to sunlight, the channel is warmed and a slow convective air current is vented out the top of the building, while fresh air enters the pit through the seat hole.

=== Electrostatic ===
An [[electrostatic fluid accelerator]] propels airflow by inducing motion in airborne charged particles.  A high voltage electric field (commonly 25,000 to 50,000 volts) formed between exposed charged [[anode]] and [[cathode]] surfaces is capable of inducing airflow through a principle referred to as [[ionic wind]]. The airflow pressure is typically very low but the air volume can be large. However, a sufficiently high voltage potential can also cause the formation of [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]], which are reactive and irritating to [[mucous membrane]]s.

== Noise ==
Fans generate noise from the rapid flow of air around blades and obstacles, and sometimes from the motor. Fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 [[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/top10noise.pdf UK Health and Safetey Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fan motor drive methods ==
[[File:UMA 2.JPG|thumb|Building heating and cooling systems commonly use a squirrel cage fan driven by belt from a separate electric motor.]]
[[File:1989 Toyota 1HD-T Type engine front.jpg|thumb|[[Internal combustion engine]]s sometimes drive an engine cooling fan directly, or may use a separate electric motor.]]
[[File:Silniki by Zureks.jpg|thumb|Large electric motors may have a cooling fan either on the back or inside the case. (Shown with black rear cover removed.)]]
[[File:Air conditioning unit-en.svg|thumb|Dual shaft fan motor in a window air conditioner.]]
Standalone fans are usually powered by an [[electric motor]]s, often attached directly to the motor's output, with no gears or belts. The motor is either hidden in the fan's center hub or extends behind it. For big industrial fans, three-phase asynchronous motors are commonly used, placed near the fan and driving it through a [[Pulley#Belt and pulley systems|belt and pulleys]]. Smaller fans are often powered by [[Shaded-pole motor|shaded pole AC motors]], or [[Brushed DC Electric Motor|brushed]] or [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motors]]. AC-powered fans usually use mains voltage, while DC-powered fans use low voltage, typically 24V, 12V, or 5 V. Cooling fans for computer equipment always use brushless DC motors, which generate much less [[electromagnetic interference]] than other types.

In machines with a rotating part, the fan is often connected to it rather than being powered separately. This is commonly seen in motor vehicles with [[internal combustion engine]]s, large cooling systems, locomotives, and winnowing machines, where the fan is connected to the [[drive shaft]] or through a belt and pulleys. Another common configuration is a dual-shaft motor, where one end of the shaft drives a mechanism, while the other has a fan mounted on it to cool the motor itself. Window [[air conditioner]]s commonly use a dual-shaft fan to operate separate blowers for the interior and exterior parts of the device.

Where electrical power or rotating parts are not readily available, fans may be driven by other methods. High-pressure gases such as steam can be used to drive a small [[turbine]], and high-pressure liquids can be used to drive a [[pelton wheel]], either which can provide the rotational drive for a fan. 

Large, slow-moving energy sources such as a flowing river can also power a fan using a [[water wheel]] and a series of step-down gears or pulleys to increase the rotational speed to that which is required for efficient fan operation.

== Solar powered fan ==
Electric fans used for ventilation may be powered by [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s instead of mains current. This is an attractive option because once the capital costs of the solar panel have been covered, the resulting electricity is free. In addition, electricity is always available when the sun is shining and the fan needs to run.

A typical example uses a detached 10-[[watt]], 12x12 [[inch]] (30x30 [[metre|cm]]) solar panel and is supplied with appropriate brackets, [[Power cable|cables]], and [[Electrical connector|connector]]s. It can be used to ventilate up to 1,250 [[square feet]] (100 m2) of [[area]] and can move air at up to 800 [[cubic feet]] per minute (400 L/s). Because of the wide availability of 12 V [[brushless DC electric motor]]s and the convenience of wiring such a low voltage, such fans usually operate on 12 [[volt]]s.

The detached solar panel is typically installed in the spot which gets most of the sun light and then connected to the fan mounted as far as 20 to 25 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (6 to 7 m) away. Other permanently-mounted and small portable fans include an integrated (non-detachable) solar panel.

}}

'''GLITS''' is an acronym for '''Graham's Line Identification Tone System''', a test signal for stereo systems devised by [[BBC TV]] Sound Supervisor and Fellow of the [https://ips.org.uk/?post_type=fellow&amp;p=5887 IPS] Graham Haines in the mid 1980s. It comprises a 1&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]]  tone at 0&amp;nbsp;[[dBu]] (-&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;[[dBFS]]) on both channels, with interruptions which identify the channels.

{| style="margin:auto;"
|-
|||valign="top"|The left channel is interrupted once for 250&amp;nbsp;ms every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds. 250&amp;nbsp;ms later the right channel has two interruptions of 250&amp;nbsp;ms spaced by 250&amp;nbsp;ms.
|}



This arrangement has an advantage over the EBU stereo ident tone in that each channel is explicitly identified as belonging to a stereo pair. The EBU Technical Document [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3304.pdf Multichannel Audio Line-up Tone] (Tech 3304) defines stereo lineup tone as having an interruption in the left channel only, lasting 250&amp;nbsp;ms every 3&amp;nbsp;s.

== Multichannel GLITS ==
There is now an official EBU standard for a multichannel BLITS 5.1 channel ident tone which is also described in the Tech 3304 paper, along with an alternative film-style multichannel ident tone system for systems larger than 5.1 arrays.

[[Black &amp; Lane's Ident Tones for Surround|Blits]] plays a sequence of tones (based on the musical notes A and E) at -18dBFS on each channel in the AES channel format order (L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs), followed by an EBU-style ident on just the front left and right channels, again at -18dBFS and with four interruptions on the left channel. The four interruptions provides a unique confirmation that the stereo or mono downmix came from a 5.1 source and avoids any possible confusion with stereo EBU or GLITS downmixes. The final BLITS tone sequence is a 2&amp;nbsp;kHz tone at -24dBFS on all six channels – the lower source signal level ensuring that any derived downmixes remain close to -18dBFS.

The alternative EBU multichannel ident tone follows a format more closely associated with the film industry. A sustained 80Hz runs on the LFE channel throughout the sequence. After a 3&amp;nbsp;second period of constant 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, -18dBFS tone on all main channels, each channel is identified in turn with a 0.5s pulse of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone, separated from its neighbours by 0.5s silence. The ident sequence starts at Front Left and continues clockwise through each available channel. The amount of time between the 3&amp;nbsp;second constant tone periods indicates the total number of channels in the system - e.g. a 7.1 system will have an ident sequence lasting 8&amp;nbsp;seconds.

Snell &amp; Wilcox have used the following on the embedded audio in their VALID8 (Video Audio Line-up &amp; IDentification) equipment:
* Ch1 (L) 980Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch2 (R) 980Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch3 (C) 432Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch4 (Lfe) 432Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds (probably not audible from a subwoofer)
* Ch5 (Ls) 990Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch6 (Rs) 990Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch7 (Lo) 436Hz one 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruption every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds
* Ch8 (Ro) 436Hz two 250&amp;nbsp;ms interruptions every 4&amp;nbsp;seconds

[[Marine biology]] is a hybrid subject that combines aspects of organismal function, ecological interaction and the study of marine biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest studies of marine biology trace back to the [[Phoenicians]] and the [[Greeks]] who are known as the initial explorers of the oceans and their composition.&lt;ref name=MarineBio&gt;[http://marinebio.org/oceans/history-of-marine-biology.asp "History of the Study of Marine Biology"] MarineBio Conservation Society. Retrieved: April 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded observations on the distribution and habits of marine life were made by [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC).&lt;ref name="Levinton, Jeffrey S. 1995. p.4"&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations made in the earliest studies of marine biology provided an impetus for the age of discovery and exploration that followed. During this time, a vast amount of knowledge was gained about life that exists in the oceans. Individuals who contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge include [[Captain James Cook]] (1728-1779), [[Charles Darwin]] (1809-1882) and [[Wyville Thomson]] (1830-1882).&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1974) p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

These individuals took part in some of the more well-known expeditions of all time, making foundation contributions to marine biology.&lt;ref&gt;Gage &amp; Tyler (1991) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The era was important for the history of marine biology, but naturalists were still constrained by available technologies that limited their ability to effectively locate and accurately examine species that inhabited the deep parts of the ocean.

The subsequent creation of marine laboratories was another important development because marine scientists now had places to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions. Technological advances, such as sound ranging, scuba diving gear, submersibles and remotely operated vehicles,  progressively made it easier to study the deep ocean. This allowed marine biologists to explore depths people once thought never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S. (1995) ''Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology'', New York: Oxford University Press. p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early exploration of the deep sea ==
[[File:Model of a greek trireme.jpg|thumb|left|Model of a Greek boat]]

===Phoenicians and Greeks===
The history of marine biology can be traced as far back as 1200 BC when the Phoenicians and the Greeks began ocean voyages using celestial navigation.&lt;ref name=MarineBio /&gt; Phoenicians and Greeks were some of the first known explorers to leave their local communities bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They ventured outside the Mediterranean to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with their knowledge of tides, currents and seasonal changes. It wasn’t until much later at around 450 BC when observations of natural phenomena related to the oceans started getting recorded. [[Herodotus]] (484-425 BC) wrote of the regular tides in the [[Persian Gulf]], the deposition of silt in the [[Nile Delta]] and used the term “Atlantic” to describe the western seas for the first time. It was during this time when many of the first recorded observations about the composition of the oceans.&lt;ref name=MEER&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Marine Biology and Oceanography|publisher=University of California|url=http://www.meer.org/ebook/mbhist.htm|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] was one of the most notable Greek philosophers to examine and keep written records of observations concerning marine organisms.&lt;ref name=MEER /&gt; Aristotle identified a large range of species such as [[crustaceans]], [[echinoderms]], [[mollusks]] and [[fish]]. Aristotle has been known as the initiator of the tradition of natural philosophy and an influential player in the beginnings of marine biology because of the early observations he made about marine life &lt;ref name="Levinton, Jeffrey S. 1995. p.4"/&gt;

[[Image:Priests traveling across kealakekua bay for first contact rituals.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hawaiian navigators sailing multi-hulled canoe]]

===Polynesians===
The [[Polynesians]] were also very involved in the exploration of marine life and their efforts are often overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1974) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the time period of 300-1275 AD the Polynesians made efforts to explore and populate the great [[Polynesian triangle]], which is bounded in the east by [[Easter Island]], in the north by [[Hawaii]] and in the southwest by [[New Zealand]]. The Polynesians were among the first to go out and explore the mysteries of the ocean and marine life. In the years that followed the Polynesian efforts, there were minimal efforts that aimed to further man’s understanding of the sea. This ended with the Age of Discovery in the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1974) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of discovery==
{{main|Age of Discovery}}

Between the late 15th century and early 20th century, humans explored the oceans like never before creating new maps and charts and collecting specimens to bring back to their home ports. Most of the exploration that took place during this time was fueled by European countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Scotland and Germany. Some of the landmark explorers of marine biology carried out their famous work during this time period. Explorers such as Captain James Cook, Charles Darwin and Wyville Thomson made revolutionary contributions to the history of marine biology during this time of exploration.&lt;ref name="Levinton, Jeffrey S. 1995"&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Cook===
[[James Cook]] is well known for his [[James Cook#Voyages of exploration|voyages of exploration]] for the British Navy in which he mapped out a significant amount of the world’s uncharted waters. Cook’s explorations took him around the world twice and led to countless descriptions of previously unknown plants and animals. Cook’s explorations influenced many others and led to a number of scientists examining marine life more closely. Among those influenced was Charles Darwin who went on to make many contributions of his own.&lt;ref name=MarineBio /&gt;

Northwest to the Keeling Islands, southwest to Mauritius and Cape Town, then northwest to Bahia and northeast back to Plymouth.|The voyage of the ''Beagle'']]

===Charles Darwin===
[[Charles Darwin]], best known for his [[theory of evolution]], made many significant contributions to the early study of marine biology. He spent much of his time from 1831 to 1836 on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']] collecting and studying specimens from a variety of marine organisms. It was also on this expedition where Darwin began to study [[coral reefs]] and their formation. He came up with the theory that the overall growth of corals is a balance between the growth of corals upward and the sinking of the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995.p.5&lt;/ref&gt; He then came up with the idea that wherever coral atolls would be found, the central island where the coral had started to grow would be gradually subsiding &lt;ref&gt;Ward (1974) p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Wyville Thomson===
Another influential expedition was the [[Challenger expedition|voyage of HMS ''Challenger'']] from 1872 to 1876, organized and later led by [[Charles Wyville Thomson]]. It was the first expedition purely devoted to marine science. The expedition collected and analyzed thousands of marine specimens, laying the foundation for present knowledge about life near the deep-sea floor.&lt;ref name=Gage6&gt;Gage &amp; Tyler (1991) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from the expedition were a summary of the known natural, physical and chemical ocean science to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rozwadowski, Helen M.. Fathoming the ocean the discovery and exploration of the deep sea. New ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap, 2005. p173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later exploration===
This era of marine exploration came to a close with the first and second round-the-world voyages of the Danish [[Galathea expeditions]] and Atlantic voyages by the [[USS Albatross (1882)|USS ''Albatross'']], the first [[research vessel]] purpose built for marine research. These voyages further cleared the way for modern marine biology by building a base of knowledge about marine biology. This was followed by the progressive development of more advanced technologies which began to allow more extensive explorations of ocean depths that were once thought too deep to sustain life.&lt;ref name=Gage6 /&gt;

==Modern studies==
===Marine biology labs===
In the 1960s and 1970s, ecological research into the life of the ocean was undertaken at institutions set up specifically to study marine biology. Notable was the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in America,&lt;ref&gt;Maienschein, Jane. 100 years exploring life, 1888-1988: the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. Boston: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 1989: 189-192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gage7&gt;Gage &amp; Tyler (1991) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; which established a model for other marine laboratories subsequently set up around the world.&lt;ref name="Levinton, Jeffrey S. 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1974) p.142&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings of unexpectedly high species diversity in places thought to be inhabitable stimulated much theorizing by population ecologists on how high diversification could be maintained in such a food-poor and seemingly hostile environment.&lt;ref name=Gage7 /&gt;

[[File:ROV Hercules 2005.JPG|thumb|right|A science ROV being retrieved by an [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research vessel.]]

===Exploration technology===
In the past, the study of marine biology has been limited by a lack of technology as researchers could only go so deep to examine life in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Rozwadowski, Helen M.. Fathoming the ocean the discovery and exploration of the deep sea. Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap, 2005:5&lt;/ref&gt; Before the mid-twentieth century, the deep-sea bottom could not be seen unless one dredged a piece of it and brought it to the surface. This has changed dramatically due to the development of new technologies in both the laboratory and the open sea. These new technological developments have allowed scientists to explore parts of the ocean they didn't even know existed.&lt;ref&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of scuba gear allowed researchers to visually explore the oceans as it contains a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus allowing a person to breathe while being submerged 100 to 200 feet into the ocean.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Genny|title=Beginnings: History of Marine Science|url=http://marinebio.net/marinescience/01intro/behist.htm#top}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Submersibles]] were built like small submarines with the purpose of taking marine scientists to deeper depths of the ocean while protecting them from increasing atmospheric pressures that cause complications deep under water. The first models could hold several individuals and allowed limited visibility but enabled marine biologists to see and photograph the deeper portions of the oceans.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s are now used with and without submersibles to see the deepest areas of the ocean that would be too dangerous for humans. ROVs are fully equipped with cameras and sampling equipment which allows researchers to see and control everything the vehicle does. ROVs have become the dominant type of technology used to view the deepest parts of the ocean.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

===Romanticization===
In the late 20th century and into the 21st, marine biology was "glorified and romanticized through films and television shows," leading to an influx in interested students who required a damping on their enthusiasm with the day-to-day realities of the field.&lt;ref name="woolston2014"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | department=Careers | title=Marine Dreams | author=Woolston, Chris | date=11 December 2014 | volume=516 | issue=7530 | page=277 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v516/n7530/full/nj7530-277a.html | format=paper | doi=10.1038/nj7530-277a}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology''' ('''CSIR-IGIB''') is a scientific [[research institute]] devoted primarily to biological research. It is a part of [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csir.res.in Council of Scientific and Industrial Research India Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927141436/http://csir.res.in/ |date=2015-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] with a primary focus on biochemical research, but has since shifted its research focus to integrative biology.

==Location==
The Institute has two campuses in Delhi. The North Campus is older of the two campuses and is in the campus of [[Delhi University]], on Mall Road opposite to [[Jubilee Hall, Delhi|Jubilee Hall]]. 
The new campus is in South Delhi, on Mathura Road at Sukhdev Vihar. 

== History ==

IGIB was established in 1977 as the [[Center for Biochemical Technology]] (CBT). The Functional Genomics Unit was established in 1998 with the focus shifting from chemical to genomics research. The institute was renamed "Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology" in 2002.

== Achievements ==
In 2009, a team at the institute sequenced the [[genome]] of the wild-type [[zebrafish]], with about 1.7 billion base pairs. This made the fish, which is native to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region, the first [[vertebrate]] to have its whole genome sequenced in India, as previously Indian scientists had only sequenced bacteria and plant genomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in Zebrafish Genome Webpage] 'Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology' (IGIB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Decoding-the-Genome-Mystery/485122 Decoding the Genome Mystery] [[Indian Express]], 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, scientists at IGIB performed the first re-sequencing of a human genome in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/videoie.php?videoId=201 Indian Scientists decode human genome] ''[[Indian Express]]'', 10 December 2009 {{deadlink|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal | author=Patowary| title=Systematic analysis and functional annotation of variations in the genome of an Indian individual. | journal=Human Mutation | volume=33| issue=7 | year=2012| pages=1133–40 | doi= 10.1002/humu.22091 | pmid=22461382 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22091/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/indian-genome Compilation of news articles and Press releases on Indian Genome], 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also collaborated on decoding the first Sri Lankan &lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.igib.res.in/SriLankan/ Sri Lankan genome ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Dissanayake| title=The Sri Lankan Personal Genome Project: an overview. | journal=Sri Lanka Journal of Biomedical Informatics | volume=1| issue=2 | year=2012| pages=4–8 | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.sljol.info/index.php/SLJBMI/article/download/3711/3073]&lt;/ref&gt; genome and Malayasian genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promiseuitm.org/component/content/article/34-slideshow/50-the-first-malay-genome.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is also a member of the Open Personal Genomics Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://openpgx.org/ |title=OpenPGx Consortium |access-date=7 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218064848/http://www.openpgx.org/ |archive-date=18 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genomics of Rare Genetic Diseases==
The institute has initiated a unique programme to use cutting edge genomic technologies to understand Rare [[genetic diseases]] in India and pioneering the application of genomics for [[Precision Medicine]] in clinics. One of the programmes which has been initiated on this front is Genomics for Understanding Rare Disease, India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt; GUaRDIAN is a large-scale collaborative network of clinicians from around India trying to use genomics in clinical practice, with the focussed aim to understand genetic structure of rare genetic diseases in India.

The consortium aims at using cutting edge genomics technology to enable identification of genetic variations in diseases  and enable clinicians arrive at precise diagnosis for rare genetic disease. Apart from working closely with clinicians, the consortium aims to foster education, awareness and the widespread adoption of genomic technology in clinical settings, in addition to creating and disseminating the highest standards of genomic data generation and interpretation in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/exome-sequence-analysis-and-interpretation Exome Sequencing Analysis and Interpretation page on GUaRDIAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the few years, it has been able to work closely with clinicians in the network to be able to offer proof of principles for the application of Genomics for Precision Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole-exome sequencing solves diagnostic dilemma in a rare case of sporadic acrokeratosis verruciformis. | journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.12983/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Gupta  |title=Whole exome sequencing helps in accurate molecular diagnosis in siblings with a rare co-occurrence of paternally inherited 22q12 duplication and autosomal recessive non-syndromic ichthyosis. | journal=F1000 Research. | volume=| issue= | year=2015| pages= | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://f1000research.com/articles/4-446/v1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Vellarikkal  |title=Exome sequencing reveals a novel mutation, p.L325H, in the KRT5 gene associated with autosomal dominant Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex Koebner type in a large family from western India. | journal=Human Genome Variation. | volume=1| issue=1 | year=2014| pages=14007  | ref=harv|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.nature.com/articles/hgv20147]&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive programme for patient referral is also functional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardian.meragenome.com/referral Patient Referral Page Genomics for Understanding Rare Diseases India Alliance Network (GUaRDIAN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension Centers (Branches)==
The main IGIB campus is located at Mall Road, New Delhi near Delhi University North Campus. IGIB's alliance with the Biotech/Pharmaceuticals has led to its growth and setting up of two extension centers - one at South Delhi (IGIB Annex at TCGA, Okhla) and the other at Western Delhi at Naraina.

==International Meetings==
IGIB was a co-host of the 13th meeting of the [[Human Genome Organization]] (HUGO) in 2008, held at [[Hyderabad International Convention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hgm2008.hugo-international.org HGM-2008 website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish Historical Institute''' ({{lang-pl|Żydowski Instytut Historyczny}} or ''ŻIH'', {{lang-yi|‏ייִדישער היסטאָרישער אינסטיטוט‎}}) also known as the [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] Jewish Historical Institute, is a research foundation in [[Warsaw]], Poland, primarily dealing with the [[history of Jews in Poland]].

==History==
The Jewish Historical Institute was created in 1947 as a continuation of the Central Jewish Historical Commission, founded in 1944. The Jewish Historical Institute Association is the corporate body responsible for the building and the Institute’s holdings. The Institute falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. In 2009 it was named after [[Emanuel Ringelblum]]. The institute is a repository of documentary materials relating to the Jewish historical presence in Poland. It is also a centre for academic research, study and the dissemination of knowledge about the history and culture of Polish Jewry.&lt;ref name=JHI&gt;[http://www.jhi.pl/en/institute/history The Jewish Historical Institute, homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable part of the collection is the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] Archive, known as the Ringelblum Archive (collected by the [[Oyneg Shabbos (group)|Oyneg Shabbos]]). It contains about 6000 documents (about 30 000 individual pieces of paper).&lt;ref name=JHI/&gt;

[[Image:Exhibition Jewish Historical Institute Warsaw.JPG|thumb|left|An exhibition on the first floor]]

Other important collections concerning World War II include testimonies (mainly of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust), memoirs and diaries, documentation of the Joint and Jewish Self-Help (welfare organizations active in Poland under the occupation), and documents from the Jewish Councils (Judenräte). The section on the documentation of Jewish historical sites holds about 40 thousand photographs concerning Jewish life and culture in Poland.&lt;ref name=JHI/&gt;

The Institute has published a series of documents from the Ringelblum Archive, as well as numerous wartime memoirs and diaries.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Stach ''Geschichtsschreibung und politische Vereinnahmungen: Das Jüdische Historische Institut in Warschau 1947-1968'', in: Jahrbuch des Simon-Dubnow-Instituts / Simon Dubnow Institute Yearbook VII (2008), 401-431, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36934-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, for over 60 years now, the Institute has been publishing an academic journal renamed in 2001 as ''The Jewish History Quarterly'', registered on the Master Journal List of outstanding academic journals in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Historical Institute, ''[http://www.jhi.pl/en/blog/2013-03-01-the-jewish-history-quarterly The Jewish History Quarterly.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Paweł Śpiewak]], a Professor of Sociology at [[Warsaw University]] and former politician, was nominated as the Director of the Jewish Historical Institute by [[Bogdan Zdrojewski]], Minister of Culture and National Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Uncredited, [http://www.jewishinstitute.org.pl/en/home/index/0.html Change at the top] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203214108/http://www.jewishinstitute.org.pl/en/home/index/0.html |date=February 3, 2009 }}; Jewish Historical Institute.

'''Adolph Konrad Fiedler''' or '''Conrad Fiedler''' (September 23, 1841 – June 13, 1895) was a German art historian, art collector and writer. Fiedler was one of the most important German art theorist of the 19th century

[[File:Conrad Fiedler, 1884.jpg|thumb|left|Gemalde von Hans Thoma (1839-1924)/ Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. Conrad Fiedler, 1884]]

Fiedler was born in [[Oederan]]. He studied law at the [[Heidelberg University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/fiedlerk.htm|title=Fiedler, Konrad|work=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Lausanne]]. In 1876 Fiedler married Mary Meyer. In 1895 Konrad Fiedler died in [[Munich]] by the fall from a balcony. He was buried in the family tomb on the estate [[Crostewitz]].

'''Limnoforming''' (from Greek: limnee, "lake"; Latin: formo, "to shape", as in shaping, fashioning, molding, modeling) is the process of  manipulating the physical or chemical properties of a body of water by introducing organisms which facilitate higher level biological activity, thus impacting the overall [[ecology]] of a given body of water, and eventually adjacent [[ecosystems]]. 
	
Limnoforming is a process using living organisms to enhance a habitat's [[abiotic component]], ultimately rendering it more conducive to a higher ecological quality. This could be accomplished by introducing a population of organisms, e.g., [[invertebrates]] or [[microorganisms|microbes]], en masse to the substrate of a body of water.  These organisms would then physically and/or chemically alter the underwater environment to furnish a more suitable substrate for a wider range of biological activity; the result being an increased ecological function (e.g., in [[Food web|trophic dynamics]]), and thus a higher quality ecological state. Ultimately, limnoforming aims to accelerate the rate of ecological succession in distressed aquatic systems (e.g., lower Green Bay, Lake Michigan), so as to produce a biologically complex climax community in a comparatively short amount of time.
	
The concept of limnoforming originated from the [[benthic ecology]] laboratory of Dr. Jerry L. Kaster, School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee. Limnoforming was partially inspired by, and is similar in several aspects to, the concept of [[terraforming]]. The two concepts' main similarity is that both aim to accelerate the rate of change occurring in a given environment, in terms of its habitability for a given species or for a number of species, and furthermore, the overall function of its ecology. Instead of creating a habitable ecosystem or biosphere from scratch, limnoforming simply aims to amend degradated Earthly aqueous environments less apt to harboring a high quality ecological community into an environment which does support an ecologically flourishing system. Limnoforming differs from traditional habitat rehabilitation or restoration in that limnoforming is driven by an early [[Seral community|sere]] biological succession process that modifies the physical substrate making it better suited for later seres, whereas rehabilitation/restoration is generally driven by targeting a terminal sere that is poorly adapted at re-forming habitat upon which it depends.
	
The initial limnoforming study, in [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay, Lake Michigan]], uses freshwater [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]] to re-consolidate highly fluid [[gyttja]] substrate (organic black ooze) found extensively in lower Green Bay. The goal is to modify substrate suitability for the [[mayfly]] ''Hexagenia''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaster, et al. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, this mayfly was found in abundance but the [[eutrophication]] of the bay led to their demise in first half of the 20th century.

This is a list of '''data breaches''',  using data compiled from various sources, including press reports, government news releases and mainstream news articles. The list includes those involving the theft or compromise of 30,000 or more records, although many more smaller breaches occur continually. Breaches of large organizations where the number of records is still unknown are also listed. The various methods used in the breaches are also listed, with [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] being the most common.

Most breaches occur in North America. It is estimated that the average cost of a data breach will be over $150 million by 2020, with the global annual cost forecast to be $2.1 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cuna.org/articles/105948-data-breach-costs-will-soar-to-2t-juniper "Data breach costs will soar to $2T: Juniper"], CUNA, May 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2015-industry-forecast-experian.pdf "Data Breach Industry Forecast"], ''[[Experian]]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in first half of 2018 alone, about 4.5 billion records were exposed as a result of data breaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecitizenng.com/analysis-data-breaches-compromised-4-5bn-records-in-half-year-2018-gemalto/ "Data breaches compromised 4.5bn records in half year 2018 – Gemalto"], [https://thecitizenng.com The Citizen], October 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The March of Remembrance and Hope''' (MRH) is a program designed for university and college students of all religions and backgrounds. The program takes place in mid-May, and includes a two-day trip to Germany, followed by a five-day visit to Poland. The international MRH program was founded in 2001 by Dr. David Machlis of the United States and Eli Rubenstein of Canada, both of whom were involved in the [[March of the Living]] program.

During the trip students visit locations in Germany and Poland related to the [[Holocaust]] and other World War II genocides, including the site of the [[Wannsee Conference]], and the former concentration/death camps of  [[Auschwitz]],  [[Treblinka]] and [[Majdanek]].

The purpose of the March of Remembrance and Hope is to teach students of various religious and ethnic backgrounds about the dangers of intolerance through the study of the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, and to promote better relations among people of diverse cultures.

Holocaust survivors also participate in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, sharing their painful memories in the very places in which their stories transpired. During the trip, the students also meet one of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]], and learn of the heroic actions a minority of Europe's population took to resist Nazi tyranny.

Since its inception, students of many diverse religions, backgrounds and ethnicities have taken part in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, including: Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Seventh Day Adventist, and many others. In addition, students who come from their own history of persecution (such as survivors of the [[Rwandan Genocide]], [[First Nation]] students, African Americans, etc.) have also participated in the March of Remembrance and Hope.

From 2007 to 2011 the program was run annually in Canada for Canadian university students, by the
[[Canadian Centre for Diversity]], with the cooperation of other organizations. In 2013, CCD transferred the program over to [[March of the Living]] Canada. The major funder of the Canadian program is the Azrieli Foundation, founded by Canadian Holocaust survivor, [[David Azrieli]], which is a Canadian philanthropic organization that supports a wide range of initiatives and programs, among which include Holocaust commemoration and education.

The international MRH program is currently on hold, but there are American groups who have traveled with the Canadian delegation, namely [[Nazareth College (New York)|Nazareth College]] and [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].  There is also an [http://www.morah.at/ Austrian program] by the same name for university students of diverse backgrounds that travels to Poland earlier during the year,  during the [[March of the Living]] (MOL). In 2010,  [[Nazareth College (New York)|Nazareth College]] and [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] launched their own program called The March: Bearing Witness to Hope - http://morah.naz.edu/.

(While there are similarities,  MRH and MOL are two different programs. MRH is primarily aimed at university students of diverse backgrounds,  does not include a trip to Israel, and its goals are of a universal nature.  MOL is primarily aimed at Jewish high school students, and in addition to universal goals, also includes goals related to Jewish identity and connection to Israel, and usually includes a week long trip to Israel following the Poland portion of the trip.)

Two student organizations in Canada dedicated to teaching tolerance and combating genocide, "’[http://www.shoutcanada.ca Shout Canada] "’ and  "’[https://web.archive.org/web/20080918004057/http://www.standcanada.org/pages/home.html Stand Canada] "’, were founded by students who participated in Marches to Poland. Many of the student leaders and active members of these two organizations are alumni of the March of Remembrance and Hope program.

==Goals of the March of Remembrance and Hope Program==
# To never again allow for the unchecked rise of the menace of anti-Semitism or any kind of racial discrimination directed by any individual or group in society against another to gain strength. Included in this goal is the teaching that all human beings are equal, precious and valued, and the diminution of the dignity of any member of the human family is a cardinal violation of all ethical teachings.
# To recognize and learn from the altruistic actions of the "righteous among the nations", who teach us to never be a bystander in the face of oppression.
# To remember those who perished, to be a witness, thus denying Hitler a "posthumous victory". The role of the survivor is a key element in this goal.
# To pay tribute to the courage of those who survived the Holocaust, who rebuilt their lives despite the haunting memories of the past.
# To honor the heroic veterans of World War II who fought to liberate Europe from the hands of Nazi tyranny.
# To welcome opportunities to learn about participants' different ethnicities and beliefs so that we may transcend our religious, political, and cultural boundaries in order to bear witness to the common humanity we all share.
# To inspire participants to commit to building a world free of oppression and intolerance, a world of freedom, democracy and justice, for all members of the human family. Related to this goal is to teach the message that, when participants return to their communities, each of them has the ability to make a real and lasting difference in the world.
# The final goal is not so much to learn from or about history, but to enter into history. By visiting Germany and Poland, students are taking part in a commemorative act that declares that the memory of six million Jews and millions of other innocent victims -  Poles, Roma and Sinti, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, the disabled and political prisoners -  who were murdered during the Holocaust and World War II, has been marked and will never be forgotten.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26713">The concept of '''motor cognition''' grasps the notion that [[cognition]] is embodied in action, and that the [[motor system]] participates in what is usually considered as mental processing, including those involved in [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Sommerville 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Sommerville | first1 = JA. | last2 = Decety | first2 = J. | title = Weaving the fabric of social interaction: articulating developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience in the domain of motor cognition. | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–200 |date=Apr 2006 | doi = 10.3758/BF03193831 | pmid = 16892982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental unit of the motor cognition paradigm is action, defined as the movements produced to satisfy an intention towards a specific [[motor goal]], or in reaction to a meaningful event in the physical and social environments. Motor cognition takes into account the preparation and production of actions, as well as the processes involved in recognizing, predicting, mimicking and understanding the behavior of other people. This paradigm has received a great deal of attention and empirical support in recent years from a variety of research domains including [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[social psychology]].

==Perception-action coupling==
The idea of a continuity between the different aspects of motor cognition is not new. In fact, this idea can be traced to the work of the American psychologist [[William James]] and more recently, American neurophysiologist and Nobel prize winner [[Roger Sperry]]. Sperry argued that the perception–action cycle is the fundamental logic of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sperry | first1 = R.W. | year = 1952 | title = Neurology and the mind-brain problem | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 291–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perception and action processes are functionally intertwined: [[perception]] is a means to action and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] is a means to perception. Indeed, the vertebrate brain has evolved for governing motor activity with the basic function to transform sensory patterns into patterns of motor coordination.

More recently, there is growing empirical evidence from cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, [[Cognitive model#Behavioral dynamics|cognitive science]], as well as social psychology which demonstrates that perception and action share common computational codes and underlying neural architectures. This evidence has been marshaled in the "[[common coding theory]]" put forward by [[Wolfgang Prinz]] and his colleagues at the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = W. | year = 1997 | title = Perception and action planning | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 129–154 | doi=10.1080/713752551}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate.&lt;ref name="Hommel 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hommel | first1 = B. | last2 = Müsseler | first2 = J. | last3 = Aschersleben | first3 = G. | last4 = Prinz | first4 = W. | title = The Theory of Event Coding (TEC): a framework for perception and action planning. | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 849–78; discussion 878–937 |date=Oct 2001 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.77.9446  | pmid = 12239891 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x01000103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing a [[Motion (physics)|movement]] leaves behind a bidirectional association between the motor pattern it has generated by and the sensory effects that it produces. Such an association can then be used backwards to retrieve a movement by anticipating its effects. These perception/action codes are also accessible during action observation. Other authors suggest a new notion of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic origin of action understanding that utilizes the motor system; motor cognition hypothesis. This states that motor cognition provides both human and nonhuman primates with a direct, prereflexive understanding of biological actions that match their own action catalog.&lt;ref name="Gallese 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gallese | first1 = V. | last2 = Rochat | first2 = M. | last3 = Cossu | first3 = G. | last4 = Sinigaglia | first4 = C. | title = Motor cognition and its role in the phylogeny and ontogeny of action understanding. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–13 |date=Jan 2009 | doi = 10.1037/a0014436 | pmid = 19209994 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.379.8550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[mirror neurons]] in the ventral premotor and parietal cortices of the macaque monkey that fire both when it carries out a goal-directed action and when it observes the same action performed by another individual provides [[neurophysiological]] evidence for a direct matching between action perception and action production.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Craighero | first2 = L. | title = The mirror-neuron system. | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue =  | pages = 169–92 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 | pmid = 15217330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such coupling is the ease with which people can engage in [[speech repetition]] when asked to [[speech shadowing|shadow]] words heard in earphones.&lt;ref name="Marslen-Wilson 1973"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Marslen-Wilson | first1 = W. | title = Linguistic structure and speech shadowing at very short latencies. | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5417 | pages = 522–3 |date=Aug 1973 | doi =  10.1038/244522a0| pmid = 4621131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, common neural activation during action observation and execution has been well documented. A variety of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), positron emission tomography, and [[magnetoencephalography]] have demonstrated that a motor resonance mechanism in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices occurs when participants observe or produce goal directed actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grèzes | first1 = J. | last2 = Armony | first2 = J.

==Shared representations between other and self==
The common coding theory also states that perception of an action should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knoblich | first1 = G. | last2 = Flach | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = Predicting the effects of actions: interactions of perception and action | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 467–472 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00387| pmid = 11760133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, these representations may be shared between individuals. Indeed, the meaning of a given object, action, or social situation may be common to several people and activate corresponding distributed patterns of neural activity in their respective brains.&lt;ref name="Decety 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Sommerville | first2 = JA. | title = Shared representations between self and other: a social cognitive neuroscience view. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 527–33 |date=Dec 2003 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2003.10.004 | pmid = 14643368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an impressive number of behavioral and neurophysiological studies demonstrating that perception and action have a common neuronal coding and that this leads to shared representations between self and others, which can lead to host of phenomena such as [[emotional contagion]], [[empathy]], social facilitation, and understanding others minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blakemore | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Frith | first2 = C.D. | year = 2005 | title = The role of motor contagion in the prediction of action | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 260–267 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.012 | pmid=15707910| citeseerx = 10.1.1.130.2472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motor priming==
One consequence of the functional equivalence between perception and action is that watching an action performed by another person facilitates the later reproduction of that action in the observer. For instance, in one study, participants executed arm movements while observing either a robot or another human producing the same or qualitatively different arm movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kilner | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Paulignan | first2 = Y. | last3 = Blakemore | first3 = S.J. | year = 2003 | title = An interference effect of observed biological movement on action | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 522–525 | doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00165-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that observing another human make incongruent movements interferes with movement execution but observing a robotic arm making incongruent movements does not.

==Social facilitation==
The fact that the observation of action can prime a similar response in the observer, and that the degree to which the observed action facilitates a similar response in the observer cast some light into the phenomenon called [[social facilitation]], first described by [[Robert Zajonc]], which accounts for the demonstration that the presence of other people can affect individual performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chartrand | first1 = T.L. | last2 = Bargh | first2 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = The chameleon effect: The perception-behavior link and social interaction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 893–910 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.893 | pmid=10402679}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have demonstrated that watching facial expression of emotions prompts the observer to resonate with the state of another individual, with the observer activating the motor representations and associated autonomic and somatic responses that stem from the observed target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatfield | first1 = E. | last2 = Cacioppo | first2 = J.T. | last3 = Rapson | first3 = R.L. | year = 1993 | title = Emotional contagion | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 96–99 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental state understanding==
Humans have a tendency to interpret the actions of others with respect to underlying mental states. One important question is whether the perception-action matching mechanism and its product, shared motor representations, can account (or to what extent it does) for the attribution of mental states to others (often dubbed [[theory of mind]] mechanism). Some authors have suggested that the shared representations network that stems from the perception-action matching mechanism may support mental state attribution via covert (i.e., non conscious) mental simulation.&lt;ref name="Gallese 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gallese | first1 = V. | last2 = Goldman | first2 = A. | title = Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 493–501 |date=Dec 1998 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5 | pmid = 21227300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some other scholars have argued that the mirror system and the theory of mind system are two distinct processes and it’s likely that the former cannot account for mental state understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saxe | first1 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Against simulation: the argument from error | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 174–179 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.01.012 | pmid=15808499| citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.3655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decety 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Michalska | first2 = KJ. | last3 = Akitsuki | first3 = Y. | title = Who caused the pain?

==Cognition and action==
To understand the relationship between cognition and action, Cherie L. Gerstadt, Yoon Joo Hong and Adele Diamond of University of Pennsylvania carried out a ''Stroop like day-night test'' &lt;ref name = "Stroop"&gt;{{Cite journal | editor=C. Brainerd | title = A review of the day–night task: The Stroop paradigm and interference control in young children| volume = 30 | issue = 3| year = 2010 | pages = 257–330 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273229710000298 | doi=10.1016/j.dr.2010.07.001 | journal=Developmental Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; on children between the age of 3&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; - 7 years. They tested one hundred and sixty children on a task that requires inhibitory control of action plus learning and remembering two rules. They found that the response latency decreased from 3&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; to 4&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; years. They concluded that the requirement to learn and remember two rules is not in itself sufficient to account for the poor performance of the younger children.&lt;ref name = "Cognition and Action"&gt;{{Cite journal | editor=Gerry T. M Altmann | title = The relationship between cognition and action: performance of children 312–7 years old on a stroop- like day-night test| volume = 53 | issue = 2| year = 1994 | pages = 91–180 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779490068X | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90068-X | journal=Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vygotsky’s Theory of Cognitive Development tells us that children are more likely to be cognitively advanced if they are more physically active. This is because playing and physical activity allows children to branch out into new situations and helps them learn strategies for learning new information&lt;ref name="Simply Psychology"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Lev Vygotsky|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html|website=Simply Psychology|publisher=Simply Psychology|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyun | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Luck | first2 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Visual working memory as the substrate for mental rotation | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.3758/bf03194043}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;"Moreau, D. (2012). The role of motor processes in three-dimensional mental rotation: Shaping cognitive processing via sensorimotor experience. ''Learning and Individual Differences'', 22(3), 354-359"&lt;/ref&gt; A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | year = 2013a | title = Constraining movement alters the recruitment of motor processes in mental rotation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 224 | issue = 3| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3324-0| pmid = 23138523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | last2 = Clerc | first2 = J. | last3 = Mansy-Dannay | first3 = A. | last4 = Guerrien | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Enhancing spatial ability through sport practice: Evidence for an effect of motor training on mental rotation performance | url = | journal = Journal of Individual Differences | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 83–88 | doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | year = 2013b | title = Motor expertise modulates movement processing in working memory | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 356–361 | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.01.011| pmid = 23422289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mirror neurons==
Recent discoveries in the field of [[social neuroscience]] have heavily implicated [[mirror neuron]]s and their related systems as a possible neurological basis for [[social cognition]] specifically factors which involve motor cognition. In chimpanzees (the closest living relative to humans) mirror neuron systems have been shown to be highly active when the ape is observing another individual (ape or human) perform a physical action such as grasping, holding, or hitting.&lt;ref name="Marco"&gt;{{Cite journal

A study by Spunt and Liberman (2013) used an fMRI study to observe mirror neurons in the brain. Participants observed a video of an action being performed under a high or low cognitive load. While watching, they were instructed to observe for why the action was being performed, what action was being performed, or how the action was being performed. The end result provided direct evidence for activation and more importantly automaticity of the mirror neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex and anterior Intraparietal sulcus.&lt;ref name="Spunt 80–86"/&gt;

Although there are large amounts of supporting evidence which indicate mirror neurons activate in situations where one is analyzing oneself to the actions of others,&lt;ref name="Sinigaglia 3–29"/&gt; there is still debate as to whether these activations should be interpreted as intentional understanding. Shannon Spaulding (2013) argues that the neuroscientists who offer up mirror neurons as a physiological answer to social cognition are misinterpreting their results and not using the correct philosophical definitions of goal and intention. Rather than being interchangeable or one leading to the other, she argues they need to be thought of two separate actions.&lt;ref name="Spaulding 233–257"/&gt;

The discovery of the link between mirror neurons and social cognition provides further links to a neurological basis found in other social phenomena such as [[social learning theory]], [[empathy]], and [[observational learning]].&lt;ref name="Marco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Aquatic fungi – Are they planktonic?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic fungi can be classified using three groups:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Lower fungi''' - adapted to marine habitats ([[Zoospore|zoosporic]] fungi, including mastigomycetes: [[oomycete]]s &amp; [[chytridiomycetes]])
* '''Higher fungi''' -filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle ([[hyphomycetes]], [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]])
* '''Terrestrial fungi''' - contain appendages of marine fungi ([[trichomycetes]])
The majority of mycoplankton species are higher fungi, found in the [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]] phylums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to fossil records, fungi date back to the late [[Proterozoic]] era, 900-570 million years ago. It is hypothesized that mycoplankton evolved from terrestrial fungi, likely in the [[Paleozoic]] era (390 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marine Fungi: and Fungal-like Organisms|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RcF97cHppPsC|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 2012-08-31|isbn = 9783110264067|first = E. B. Gareth|last = Jones|first2 = Ka-Lai|last2 = Pang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods and pathways of terrestrial fungi's adaption to the marine environment are still under study.

== Biogeochemical Contributions ==
The primary role of all fungi is to degrade detrital [[organic matter]] from plants,&lt;ref&gt;Carlile MJ, Watkinson SC, Gooday GW (2001) The fungi. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular approaches for assessing fungal diversity in marine substrata|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bot.2005.48.issue-5/bot.2005.046/bot.2005.046.xml|journal = Botanica Marina|volume = 48|issue = 5–6|doi = 10.1515/bot.2005.046|first = Ka-Lai|last = Pang|first2 = Julian I.|last2 = Mitchell|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mycoplankton is no exception. By working with microbial communities, mycoplankton efficiently converts particulate organic matter to dissolved organic matter as part of the [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Marine snow, organic solute plumes, and optimal chemosensory behavior of bacteria|journal = Limnology and Oceanography|date = 2001-09-01|issn = 1939-5590|pages = 1309–1318|volume = 46|issue = 6|doi = 10.4319/lo.2001.46.6.1309|first = Thomas|last = Kiørboe|first2 = George A.|last2 = Jackson|citeseerx = 10.1.1.570.5719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria mediate carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other nutrient fluxes in marine ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Benthic Bacterial and Fungal Productivity and Carbon Turnover in a Freshwater Marsh|url = http://aem.asm.org/content/72/1/596|journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 0099-2240|pmc = 1352256|pmid = 16391096|pages = 596–605|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1128/AEM.72.1.596-605.2006|first = Nanna|last = Buesing|first2 = Mark O.|last2 = Gessner}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that there are higher concentrations of mycoplankton near the surface and in shallow waters, which indicates their connection with the upwelling of organic matter. This further correlates with abundant [[phytoplankton]] communities at the surface, implying that mycoplankton is intimately involved in organic matter consumption in the [[Photic zone|euphotic]] zone.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Distribution and Diversity of Planktonic Fungi in the West Pacific Warm Pool|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0101523.s001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''National Agrarian University''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Universidad Nacional Agraria'', '''UNA''') is a public university in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org.ve/docs/wrt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2542:nicaragua&amp;catid=210&amp;Itemid=757 UNESCO: Lista de universidades en Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.edu.ni/index.php/universidades?pid=56&amp;sid=62:Universidad-Nacional-Agraria-UNA Universities members of the CNU]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Agrarian University has its roots in the National School of Agriculture ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Escuela Nacional de Agricultura''), established on May 25, 1917. It was incorporated in 1986, by presidential decree, into the [[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]] as the Institute of Agricultural Sciences (ISCA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.una.edu.ni/index.php/institucional/resena-historica Reseña histórica de la UNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the ISCA faculty at the National University became an independent entity; the National Agrarian University, with four faculties:

* Faculty of Agronomy (FAGRO)
* Faculty of Natural Resources and Environment (FARENA)
* Faculty of Distance Education and Rural Development (FED-DR)
* Faculty of Animal Science (FACA)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5031">'''Non-representational theory''' is a [[theory]] developed in [[human geography]], largely through the work of [[Nigel Thrift]] ([[Warwick University]]),&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, N. 2000. "Non-representational theory" in RJ Johnston, D Gregory, G Pratt and M Watts (eds) The Dictionary of Human Geography (Blackwell, Oxford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, N. 2007. ''Non-representational theory: Space, Politics, Affect'' (Routledge, London)&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues such as J.D. Dewsbury ([[University of Bristol]]) and Derek McCormack ([[University of Oxford]]), and later by their respective graduate students. It challenges those using [[social theory]] and conducting [[geography|geographical]] research to "go beyond [[knowledge representation|representation]]"&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, Nigel; 1996; ''Spatial Formations''; Sage&lt;/ref&gt; and focus on embodied experience.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. {{doi|10.1111/area.12339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormack, D.P., 2017. The circumstances of post‐phenomenological life worlds. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 42(1), pp.2-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Dewsbury describes practices of "witnessing" that produce "knowledge without contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;Dewsbury, J.D., 2003; "Witnessing space: 'knowledge without contemplation'" Environment and Planning A", volume 35, pp. 1907–1932&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emphasis on practice==
Instead of studying and representing social relationships, non-representational theory focuses upon practices&amp;nbsp;– how human and nonhuman formations are enacted or performed&amp;nbsp;– not simply on what is produced.&lt;ref name="Thrift, Nigel pp 124"&gt;Thrift, Nigel; 1997; 'The still point: expressive embodiment and dance', in Pile, S and Keith, M (eds.), ''Geographies of Resistance''; (Routledge) pp 124–151&lt;/ref&gt; "First, it valorizes those processes  that operate before … conscious, reflective thought … [and] second, it insists on the  necessity of not prioritizing representations  as the primary epistemological vehicles through which knowledge is extracted from the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCormack|first1=Derek|date=2005|title=Diagramming Practice and Performance|url=http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=d51j|journal=Society and Planning|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have examined a wide range of activities including dance,&lt;ref name="Thrift, Nigel pp 124"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek, McCormack; 2003; 'Geographies for Moving Bodies: Thinking, Dancing, Spaces'; (Sage)&lt;/ref&gt; musical performance,&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Frances; 2005; 'Performing ethnography: Irish traditional music sessions and new methodological spaces' (Taylor and Frances)&lt;/ref&gt; walking,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, John; 2005' A single day's walking: narrating self and landscape on the South West Coast Path' (Transactions of the British Geographers)&lt;/ref&gt; gardening,&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, David; 2003; 'Performances and constitutions of natures: a consideration of the performance of lay geographies'&lt;/ref&gt; rave,&lt;ref&gt;Saldanha; 2005; 'Trance and visibility at dawn: racial dynamics in Goa's rave scene' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; listening to music&lt;ref&gt;Anderson; 2004; 'A Principle of Hope: Recorded Music, Listening Practices and the Immanence of Utopia'&lt;/ref&gt; and children's play.&lt;ref&gt;Harker; 'Playing and affective time-spaces'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-structuralist origins==
This is a [[post-structuralist]] theory inspired in part by the ideas of thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Michel Serres]], and by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenonologists]] such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Richard G. pp 67 - 84"&gt;Smith, Richard G., 2003; "Baudrillard's nonrepresentational theory: burn the signs and journey without maps" in ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space'' 21; pp 67–84&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it considers views from political science (including ideas about [[radical democracy]]) and anthropological discussions of the material dimensions of human life.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} It parallels the conception of "hybrid geographies" developed by [[Sarah Whatmore (geographer)|Sarah Whatmore]].&lt;ref&gt;Whatmore, S. 2002. ''Hybrid Geographies'' (Sage)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have suggested that Thrift's use of the term "non-representational theory" is problematic, and that other non-representational theories could be developed. [[Richard G. Smith (geographer)|Richard G. Smith]] said that [[Baudrillard]]'s work could be considered a "non-representational theory", for example,&lt;ref name="Smith, Richard G. pp 67 - 84"/&gt; which has fostered some debate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 2005, Hayden Lorimer (Glasgow University) said that the term "more-than-representational" as preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, H., 2005; "Cultural geography: the busyness of being 'more-than-representational'", ''Progress in Human Geography'' 29, 1 (2005) pp. 83–94&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">'''Normal science''', identified  and elaborated on by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'',&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; is the  regular work of [[scientists]] theorizing, observing, and experimenting within a settled [[paradigm]] or explanatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding [[science]] as puzzle-solving,&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1970) p. 35-42&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn explained normal science as slowly accumulating detail in accord with established broad [[theory]], without questioning or challenging the underlying assumptions of that theory.

==The route to normal science==
Kuhn stressed that historically the route to normal science could be a difficult one.  Prior to the formation of a shared paradigm or research consensus, would-be scientists were reduced to the accumulation of random facts and unverified observations, in the manner recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] or [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p.  10-22&lt;/ref&gt; while simultaneously beginning the foundations of their field from scratch through a plethora of competing theories.

Arguably at least the [[social sciences]] remain at such a pre-paradigmatic level today.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rosenberg, ''Philosophy of Science'' (2005) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normal science at work==
Kuhn considered that the bulk of scientific work was that done by the 'normal' scientist, as they engaged with the threefold tasks of articulating the paradigm, precisely evaluating key paradigmatic facts, and testing those new points at which the theoretical paradigm is open to empirical appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 25-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==The breakdown of consensus==
For the normal scientist anomalies represent challenges to be puzzled out and solved ''within'' the paradigm. Only if an anomaly or series of anomalies resists successful deciphering long enough and for enough members of the scientific community will the paradigm itself gradually come under challenge, and perhaps be subjected to a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 52-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way however, according to Kuhn, normal science possesses a built-in mechanism that ensures the relaxation of the restrictions that previously bound [[research]], whenever the paradigm from which they derive ceases to function effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Karl Popper]] has criticised Kuhn's view of normal science as excessively conservative and dogmatic&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Bernstein, ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism'' (2011) p. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;—though whether Kuhn is prescriptive or merely descriptive here is open to doubt. Popper, [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] and [[John W. N. Watkins|Watkins]] have also questioned whether the contrast between normal science versus revolutionary science is as stark as portrayed by Kuhn.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="791">The term '''pellis''' refers to the cellular cortical layers of a [[mushroom]]. The term was introduced by Dutch mycologist [[Cornelis Bas]] in 1969, who distinguished different layers of the pellis as suprapellis, mediopellis and subpellis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bas C.|year=1969|title=Morphology and subdivision of ''Amanita'' and a monograph on its section ''Lepidella'' |journal=Persoonia|volume=5|issue= |pages=285–579}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also distinguished various topographies of the pellis. For example, pileipellis refers to the cuticle of the mushroom [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (or cap), while stipitipellis is the cuticle of the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (the stem).

The '''Picower Institute for Learning and Memory''' is, along with the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]] and the Department of Brain and [[Cognitive Science]]s, one of the three [[neuroscience]] groups at [[MIT]]. The institute is focused on studying all aspects of learning and memory; specifically, it has received over [[US$]]50 million to study [[Alzheimer's]], [[schizophrenia]] and similar diseases.

When it was established in 1994, the institute was primarily funded by the [[Sherman Fairchild Foundation]], the [[RIKEN Brain Science Institute]] and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://web.mit.edu/picower/about/index.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed after a $50 million grant by the [[Jeffry Picower#Involvement with Bernard Madoff|Picower Foundation]] in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/uwire/uwire_WFR051720027396405.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=top&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">'''REFSMMAT''' is a term used by guidance, navigation, and control system [[flight controller]]s during the [[Apollo program]], which carried over into the [[Space Shuttle program]].&lt;ref name="Helms"&gt;{{Cite report |last1=W. |first1=Jason Helms |last2=Pohlkamp |first2=Kara M. |date=2011 |title=Docking Offset Between the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station and Resulting Impacts to the Transfer of Attitude Reference and Control |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110005501.pdf |publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] |page=2 |accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; REFSMMAT stands for "Reference to Stable Member Matrix".&lt;ref name="Helms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book |last=Woods |first=W. David |date=2008 |title=How Apollo Flew to the Moon |location=Chichester |publisher=Springer-Praxis |isbn=978-0-387-71675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|387}} It is a numerical definition of a fixed orientation in space and is usually (but not always) defined with respect to the stars. It was used by the [[Apollo PGNCS|Apollo Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System (PGNCS)]] as a reference to which the gimbal-mounted platform at its core should be oriented. Every operation within the spacecraft that required knowledge of direction was carried out with respect to the orientation of the guidance platform, itself aligned according to a particular REFSMMAT.

During an Apollo flight, the REFSMMAT being used, and therefore the orientation of the guidance platform, would change as operational needs required it, but never during a guidance process—that is, one REFSMMAT might be in use from launch through Trans-Lunar Injection, another from TLI to Midpoint, but would not change during the middle of a burn or set of maneuvers.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|150}}

For example, it was considered good practice to have the spacecraft displays show some meaningful attitude value that would be easy to monitor during an important engine burn. Flight controllers at mission control in Houston would calculate what attitude the spacecraft had to be at for that burn and would devise a REFSMMAT that matched it in some way. Then, when it came time for the burn, if the spacecraft was in its correct attitude, the crew would see their 8-ball display a simple attitude that would be easy to interpret, allowing errors to be easily tracked and corrected.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|197}}

In the hallowed halls of mission control, [[Captain Refsmmat]] was a [[Kilroy was here|Kilroy]]-type character, first drawn by flight controller Ed Pavelka as the "ideal mission controller", as an aid to the esprit de corps within the mission control team.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|146}}

{{Fiqh|etiquette}}
'''''Raḍāʿ''''' or '''''riḍāʿa''''' ({{lang-ar|رضاع, رضاعة}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-ar|rɪˈdˤɑːʕ(æ)|pron}}, "breastfeeding") is a [[List of Islamic terms in Arabic|technical term]] from [[Sunni]] [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] meaning "the suckling which produces the legal impediment to marriage of foster-kinship".&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses: Medieval Islamic Views on Breastfeeding and Their Social Implications'', {{ISBN|90-04-11223-5}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  The term derives from the [[infinitive]] noun of the [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] ''radiʿa'' or ''radaʿa'' ("he sucked the breast of his mother").  Often it is translated as "[[fosterage]]" or "[[milk kinship]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. J. H. van Gelder, ''Close Relationships: Incest and Inbreeding in Classical Arabic Literature'', {{ISBN|1-85043-855-2}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''radāʿ'' derives from Islamic and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Islam and children#Breast-feeding|notions]] concerning the state of [[consanguinity]] created between [[wet nurse]] and unrelated nursling—that is, a woman and a baby other than her own—through the act of [[breastfeeding]].  ''Radāʿ'' also defines the links between various relations and family members of both wet nurse and baby, such that not only are the two [[Mahram|forbidden in marriage]] to one another, but so are their relations in various combination (e.g. the nursling's biological brother with the milk-mother's biological daughter).  Conversely, the milk-relationship allows usually forbidden familiarities between the two, particularly if the nursling is male and of adult stature, such as viewing the milk-mother [[Hijab|unveiled]] or [[Sex segregation in Islam|in private]], exactly as if he were a relation.{{Original research inline|date=April 2008}}

== In Islamic law ==
=== Sunni ===
''Radāʿ'' receives extensive treatment in the Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') of the classical jurists (''[[Faqīh|faqih]]'').  A primary feature of such works is the delineation of which relationships are [[Harām|subject to prohibition]] once the milk relationship is established.  The following are the sorts of questions directed to the founder of the [[Hanbali]] [[Madhhab|school of jurisprudence]] by his son:

{{cquote|
I asked [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|my father]] about a man who has two wives, each of whom has a daughter.  Then one of the wives nurses a certain man.  'Is it [[Halal|lawful]] for this man's son to marry the daughter of the wife who did not nurse him?'  (...) I asked my father about a man who has a wife who nurses both a youth and a girl, and the youth has a brother.  'Is it lawful for the brother to marry the girl?' (...)  I hear my father asked about a woman who nurses a young female slave belonging to someone else.   Then a certain man marries the woman who has nursed the young female slave.  'Is it lawful for the man to have intercourse with the [[Islamic views on slavery|female slave]] his wife has nursed if he buys and takes [[Ma malakat aymanukum|possession of her]]?'&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Other common topics included the following:

* ''laban al-fahl'', "milk of the sire", as under Islam the wet nurse's husband is considered the actual owner of her milk (it is his semen which caused the pregnancy that stimulated her lactation), which ties of consanguinity exist between his relations and the nursling?
* ''sifat al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', "quality of the milk", which ways of transmission create consanguinity?
* '' ʿadad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish fosterage;
* ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', suckling of a grown-up person, the maximum age at which the milk-relationship may be established;
* ''al-radāʿ min mayyita'', whether or not the absorption of milk from a dead woman creates the impediment.

''ʿAdad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', or minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish the milk-kinship, was the subject of extensive debate and ever more elaborate [[Tafsīr|exegetical theorizing]].  For the adherents of older [[Madhhab|schools of law]], such as the [[Maliki]]s and [[Hanafi]]s, one suckling was enough.  Others, such as the [[Shafiʿi|Shāfi'ī]]s, maintained that the minimum number was five or ten, and that in fact a [[Qur'ān|Qur'ainic]] verse had once stipulated this exact number until [[Naskh (tafsir)#Modes|its wording]] had been [[Naskh (tafsir)|expurgated]] from the [[mushaf|Qur'ānic text]]&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', {{ISBN|0-7486-0108-2}}, pp. 156-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|Naskh]]'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]²&lt;/ref&gt;  The following tradition (''[[Hadīth|hadith]]'') treats both this topic as well as that of ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', or suckling of an adult:

{{cquote|
She [Aisha] [[Isnad|reported]] that 'in what was revealed of the Qur'ān, ten attested breast-feedings were mentioned as required to establish the marriage-ban.  The ten were replaced by mention of five attested breast-feeds.  The [[Muhammad|Prophet]] died and the five were still being recited in the Qur'ān.  No man ever called upon [[Aisha|'Ā'isha]] who had not completed the minimum number of five sucklings'...

[[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwa b. al-Zubayr]] reports that the Prophet commanded the wife of Abū Hudhayfa to feed her husband's [[mawla|mawlā]] [i.e. servant], Sālim, so that he could go on living with them [upon attaining manhood]. Sāalim b. 'Abdullāh reports that he was never able to visit 'Ā'isha.  She had sent him to be suckled by her sister [[Umm Kulthum (name)|Umm Kulthum]] who, however, suckled him only three times, then fell sick.  Sālim added, 'Thus I never did complete the course of ten sucklings.'&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

For most jurists ([[Ibn Hazm]] being one prominent exception), the bar to marriage was effective only if the nursling was an infant.  Yet even these allowed that a new relationship resulted between the two; [[Ibn Rushd]], for example, ruled that the woman could now comport herself more freely in front of the nursed adult male, such as appearing before him [[hijab|unveiled]].&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Muhaddith|traditionist]] [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] was forced to resign his position of ''[[mufti]]'' and leave the city of [[Bukhara]] after ruling that two nurslings who suckled from the same farm animal became milk-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shia ===
As per Quranic guidelines, non-mahram (not related) people are forbidden for each other as long as they are not legally married. Shi'ite Islam prohibits marriage to the consanguineous kin of a milk-parent. In Shi'ite societies, the wet nurse was always from a subordinate group, so that marriage to her kin would not have been likely.

== Examples ==
=== Egypt ===
In May 2007 Dr. Izzat Atiyya, lecturer at [[Cairo]]'s [[Al-Azhar University]], issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' that suggested that male and female colleagues could use breastfeeding to get around a religious ban on being alone together.  The ''fatwa'' said that if a woman fed a male colleague "directly from her breast" at least five times they would establish a family bond and thus be allowed to be alone together at work. "Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting, and does not ban marriage," he ruled. "A woman at work can take off the veil or reveal her hair in front of someone whom she breastfed."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6681511.stm Breastfeeding fatwa causes stir]''. BBC. May 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''fatwa'' sparked outrage and embarrassment, with critics deriding the author on [[Egyptian television]]. The university suspended the lecturer, who headed the university's ''[[hadith]]'' department.  The ''fatwa'' was widely publicized by Arabic-language [[satellite television]] channels and was discussed in the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian parliament]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;''[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL2173061220070521 Lecturer suspended after breastfeeding fatwa]''. Reuters. May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  After being threatened with disciplinary action by the university, Atiyya issued a retraction, saying the ''fatwa'' was "a bad interpretation of a particular case" during the time of Muhammad&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and that it was based on the opinions of only a minority of scholars.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;  Egypt's minister of religious affairs, [[Mahmoud Zaqzouq]], has called for future ''fatwas'' to "be compatible with logic and human nature".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In 2010, a clerical adviser to the Royal court and Ministry of Justice issued a [[fatwa]] suggesting that women should provide breast milk to their employed drivers thereby making them relatives (a concept known as ''Rada'').&lt;ref name=Shaheen&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaheen|first=Abdul Rahman|title=Saudi women use fatwa in driving bid|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-women-use-fatwa-in-driving-bid-1.643431|accessdate=19 September 2010|newspaper=gulfnews.com|date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver could then be trusted to be alone with the woman. The fatwa was ridiculed by women campaigners.

[[File:Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece, Forest Women by Artist Mumbiram.jpeg|thumb|Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece "Forest Women" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

'''Rasa Renaissance''' is a movement in the art of painting that makes evocation of rasas (emotional moods) the prime aim in the creation and appreciation of a work of art. [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] is the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art produces through the personalities, their expression and the situation presented in a painting. Rasa is a [[Sanskrit]] word that denotes the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art brings about. Rasa Theory is a theory of aesthetic criticism that has been prevalent in appreciation of literary works in Sanskrit language for millenniums (see: [[Indian aesthetics|Indian aesthetic]]).

The idea of Rasa Renaissance evolved in the last quarter of the twentieth century in the domain of painting, as a countermovement to [[abstract art |abstract]] and conceptual art. Rasa Renaissance is led by artist, philosopher and Sanskrit scholar Dr. [[Mumbiram]] of India (Ph.D. Berkeley California). In the twentieth century, the art of painting progressively became dissociated from depiction of personalities in real-world situations. It concerned itself with exploration of forms and colours for their own sake. It became more or less an exercise in clever intellectual sophistication. Art of Rasa Renaissance presupposes personalities in various situations, and in various emotional states, as being central to a work of art.

== Rasa art and personalist art ==
The emotions that the creator of a painting has in mind, the emotions that personalities who appear in a painting share with each other, as also the emotions that are aroused in the viewer of a painting, are all of concern in appreciation of a work of rasa art.
As emotions are states in the minds of personalities, rasa art presupposes depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states to be the subject matter of a rasa painting. Painting that concerns itself with depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states is "personalist art". The realm of personalist art is '''personalism'''.

[[File:Rasa Art, "Encounter on the Way back from the Forest", Charcoal by Mumbiram.jpg|thumb|Rasa Art Charcoal "Encounter on the Way back from the Forest" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

== Personalist and impersonalist in history of art ==
Throughout the long history of art there has always been personalist as well as impersonal art. Portraits of kings, demigods, gods, mythological figures, saints as also ordinary people are examples of personalist art. Scenes in the lives of important as well as ordinary people are other examples. There were also battle scenes, domestic scenes, mythological and religious events. Impersonal Art existed in the form of landscapes, still-life and decorative designs. Till the late 19th century, art remained more or less representational. The beginning of the 20th century saw art indulging in deliberate distortions in depictions of personalities as well as inanimate objects. Soon afterwards, art saw itself dissociating from representation of real-world objects and personalities. Exploration of colours and forms for their own sake, without reference to any real-world entities became the subject matter of abstract paintings. Art became impersonal.

== Origins of personalist art and Rasa Renaissance ==
The idea of Rasa Renaissance first appeared in the art and writings of artist [[Mumbiram]] of India. The idea of personalist art first appears in two articles that Mumbiram wrote in 1985 in his native Marathi language in Pune's ''Ravivar Sakal''. "In Search of an Art that transcends Culture" and "The Practice of Personalist Art". In these autobiographical articles, Mumbiram describes his affectionate rapport with his artist grandfather, his success as a prodigious child artist, his giving up art to devote himself to mathematics, his years in the graduate school at Berkeley, his ''déjà vu'' with art, his search for art that does not align itself with any culture (''sanskritinirapeksha''), his falling in love with Krishna and his arrival back in India as a personalist artist.

Here Mumbiram calls his own art ''Vyaktisaapeksha Kalaa''. ''Saapekshataa'' would translate to relativity. ''Saapeksha'' would translate to 'depending on' or 'in expectation of'. ''Kalaa'' translates to Art, Art in reference to persons - Art in the context of persons. This is where the usage ''Personalist Art'' first appears.

In an article appearing in the ''Sunday Maharashtra Herald'', "Waiting in the Wings" in 1986, journalist Ashok Gopal introduces Mumbiram: "Mumbiram calls his Art Personalist Art..." The same article carries an Artist's Manifesto which makes clear reference to Personalism: "Personalism is a frontal attack on materialism on the aesthetic front", "Personalism leaves no room for the existential void".

The idea of Rasa Theory as basic to appreciation of art appears in an article about Mumbiram appearing in Mumbai's ''Sunday Observer'' in 1988 written by Sudhir Sonalkar. An interview with Mumbiram for the Mumbai tabloid ''Mid-Day'' has Mumbiram talking about Rasa Theory.

Distant Drummer Publishing has produced ''High Five of Love'', a five-volume ensemble of English translations of Sanskrit Rasa classics wherein Mumbiram's original Rasa art is juxtaposed with Rasa literature. A catalog of exhibition of Mumbiram's ''Book Readers: Love on the Gutenberg Galaxy'' cites Rasa theory of aesthetic appreciation as relevant to appreciation of Mumbiram's art. It also gives an extensive bibliography of classical works on Rasa theory. Another extensive catalog of Mumbiram's work is titled: ''Rasa Renaissance''.

[[File:Rasa Art, "I let him persuade me", Charcoal by Mumbiram.jpg|thumb|Rasa Art Charcoal "I let him persuade me" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

== ''Prema vivarta'' mood ==
According to [[Vaishnavism]] theology, Krishna is Rasaraj, the supreme source of all rasas. Depictions of incidents in Krishna's biography are most attractive subjects for Rasa art. In the ''prema vivarta'' mood of attachment to Krishna, everything in the phenomenal world appears to the lover of Krishna as a ''[[déjà vu]]'' of something related to Krishna. Many Rasa masterpieces are made in the prema vivarta mood. Ashok Gopal quotes Mumbiram: "My raven-dark rambunctious, roaming, rag-picking girlfriends remind me of Krishna and his boys in the forests of Vrindavan."

== Comparison with the Pre-Raphaelites (a paradigm shift) ==
[[Pre-Raphaelites]] were rebelling against the 'stodgy' Royal Academy. Somehow the romance was missing in the artists' lives. This group formed a secret brotherhood. Real life muses inspired their works. The inspiration was reflected in their paintings. The real lives of the artists and their works had a symbiotic relationship between them.

Rasa art, or art of Rasa Renaissance, is rebelling against the far more 'stodgy' art establishment of the twentieth century. Art degenerated into creation of 'brand equity' in logos. Depiction of persons was pigeonholed into the category of 'figurative' and 'representational' art for the less intelligent simpletons. Art museums, auction houses, art galleries and art schools all descended into a rut of vested interests. Rasa Renaissance rebels by bringing back into the purview of contemporary art the noble situations of human existence, the innate beauty of personalities and love amongst individuals. By the standards of the Rasa Theory of aesthetics, only Personalist Art can genuinely evoke rasas. So-called 'abstract' art is merely Impersonal Art, severely limited in its ability to invoke any rasa.

The Pre-Raphaelites used muses as models. They used monochrome, posed photographs of their muses/models to achieve realism. They spent considerable effort in painting carpets and folds in clothing. They strived to make paintings appear 'as good as' colour photographs.

Rasa art is inspired by real-life muses. They are not professional models. They are from an entirely different milieu. The artist meets them through personal encounter of the [[Romanticism|romantic type]]. Living in an era when color photography and photoshop are commonplace, rasa art is predominantly charcoal renderings. They are effortless quick live renderings. They don't aspire for photorealism. The person is of prime importance. The surroundings are not even depicted. The drama of the meeting and also the rendering is the 'high' the artist and the muses share. The admirers meet the artist in equally surprising ways. They are thrilled to be caught in the real life milieu of a classical painter. They are impulsively inspired to buy the work from the artist himself, from the environment where the work was produced.

== Personalism in theology, love and art ==
According to tenets of Personalism, an Impersonal paradigm of divinity gives rise to the existential void and absence of values.
Love of impersonal objects, in preference to love of individuals, gives rise to materialism. Impersonalism in art is epitomized in abstract art.

Proponents of Rasa Renaissance see distortions in painting as sarcastic and cynical expressions. Rasa Art strives for simplicity, innocence, faith and devotion. Rasa Art strives for honesty to an indigenous aesthetic and an awareness of one's own beauty. Personalism sees man made in the image of God. There is no room for 'existential void'. Personalism focuses attention on love and grace amongst individuals, in preference to fascination with matter.

The casket survived all the confiscations after the collapses of the Polish national uprisings, because it had been moved to [[Kraków]].

When [[World War II]] broke out, it was transported together with the rich collection of the [[Czartoryski Museum]] to [[Sieniawa]] and hidden in a repository, in a palace outbuilding, which was later bricked up. However, the German owner of a mill who worked for the [[Czartoryski family]] betrayed the hiding place to ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' soldiers, who entered [[Sieniawa]] on 14 September 1939.&lt;ref name="priceless_ookz" /&gt; The soldiers broke into the palace and plundered the collection.

[[Sex]] and the use of [[drug]]s (legal and illegal) have been linked throughout human history, encompassing all aspects of sex: [[desire]], [[performance improvement|performance]], [[pleasure]], [[fertilisation|conception]], [[gestation]], and [[disease]].

== Disinhibition ==
Drugs are frequently associated with reduced sexual inhibition, both when used voluntarily in social circumstances, and involuntarily, as in the case of some [[date rape drug]]s.

Because the use of drugs, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], is commonly presented as an excuse for risky or socially unacceptable behaviour, it is necessary to treat the idea of a direct causal relation between drug use and [[unsafe sex]] with caution.  Drugs may provide a socially acceptable excuse for engaging in sexual behaviours in which people may want to engage but perhaps feel that they should not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Race|first1=Kane|title=Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The Queer Politics of Drugs|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822390884|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVuU9KmotYC&amp;&amp;pg=PA176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual function ==
Some forms of sexual dysfunction such as [[erectile dysfunction]] can be treated with drugs. Because of their effects, erectile dysfunction drugs are sometimes used for recreational purposes.

Many [[drug]]s, both legal and illegal, some sold online, have side effects that affect the user's sexual function. Many drugs can cause [[loss of libido]] as a side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=JR|last2=Ratamess|first2=NA|title=Medical issues associated with anabolic steroid use: are they exaggerated?|journal=Journal of sports science &amp; medicine|date=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=182-93|pmid=24259990|pmc=3827559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-male-enhancement-products-deliver-more-you-bargained-f1C8993189 | title = FDA: ‘Male enhancement’ products deliver more than you bargained for | publisher = NBC News | date  = 21 March 2013| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the partial cause of the [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] is the inhibition of [[dopamine]] by an orgasm-induced [[secretion]] of [[prolactin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such potent [[dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]]s as [[cabergoline]] may help achieve multiple [[orgasm]]s as well as the retention of sexual arousal for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraception and abortion == 
Drug-based contraception has been available since the development of the [[contraceptive pill]]. As well as their contraceptive effects, contraceptive drugs can also have adverse sexual and reproductive side-effects. Prior to the availability of effective contraceptives, some substances were also used as [[abortifacient]]s to terminate pregnancy; [[medical abortion]] exists as a modern medical practice.

&lt;!--This probably isn't really the article's lead; as sections are added,
text shd move into 'graphics rendering' and be replaced by a more general introduction--&gt;

In [[computer graphics]], [[tessellation]] is used to manage datasets of polygons (sometimes called ''vertex sets'') presenting objects in a scene and divide them into suitable structures for [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]]. Especially for [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time rendering]], data is [[polygon triangulation|tessellated into triangles]], for example in [[OpenGL|OpenGL 4.0]] and [[Direct3D 11]].&lt;ref name=OpenGL&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec40.core.20100311.pdf The OpenGL® Graphics System: A Specification (Version 4.0 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MS&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff476340%28v=VS.85%29.aspx MSDN: Tessellation Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In graphics rendering==

A key advantage of tessellation for [[realtime graphics]] is that it allows detail to be dynamically added and subtracted from a [[3D polygon mesh]] and its silhouette edges based on control parameters (often camera distance). In previously leading realtime techniques such as [[parallax mapping]] and [[bump mapping]], surface details could be simulated at the pixel level, but silhouette edge detail was fundamentally limited by the quality of the original dataset.

In [[Direct3D 11]] pipeline (a part of DirectX 11), the [[graphics primitive]] is the [[Bézier curve|patch]].&lt;ref name=Abi-Chahla2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Abi-Chahla|first=Fedy|title=Tessellation|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/opengl-directx,2019-7.html|publisher=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tessellator'' generates a triangle-based [[tessellation]] of the patch according to tessellation parameters such as the ''TessFactor'', which controls the degree of fineness of the [[polygon mesh|mesh]]. The tessellation, along with [[shader]]s such as a [[Phong shading|Phong shader]], allows for producing smoother surfaces than would be generated by the original mesh.&lt;ref name=Abi-Chahla2013 /&gt; By offloading the tessellation process onto the [[GPU]] hardware, smoothing can be performed in real time. Tessellation can also be used for implementing [[subdivision surface]]s, [[level of detail]] scaling and fine [[displacement mapping]].&lt;ref name=Tariq2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Tariq|first=Sara|title=D3D11 Tessellation|url=http://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2009/GDC/GDC09_D3D11Tessellation.pdf|publisher=Nvida|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenGL|OpenGL 4.0]] uses a similar pipeline, where tessellation into triangles is controlled by the ''[[Tessellation Control Shader]]'' and a set of four tessellation parameters.&lt;ref name=OpenGLTess&gt;{{cite web|title=Tessellation|url=http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Tessellation#Tessellation_control_shader|publisher=OpenGL|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer-aided design==

In [[computer-aided design]] the constructed design is represented by a [[boundary representation]] topological model, where analytical 3D surfaces and curves, limited to faces, edges, and vertices, constitute a continuous boundary of a 3D body.
Arbitrary 3D bodies are often too complicated to analyze directly. So they are approximated (tessellated) with a [[polygon mesh|mesh]] of small, easy-to-analyze pieces of 3D volume—usually either irregular [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], or irregular [[hexahedron|hexahedra]]. The mesh is used for [[finite element analysis]].

The mesh of a surface is usually generated per individual faces and edges (approximated to [[Polygonal chain|polylines]]) so that original limit vertices are included into mesh. To ensure that approximation of the original surface suits the needs of further processing, three basic parameters are usually defined for the surface mesh generator:

* The maximum allowed distance between the planar approximation polygon and the surface (known as "sag"). This parameter ensures that mesh is similar enough to the original analytical surface (or the polyline is similar to the original curve).
* The maximum allowed size of the approximation polygon (for triangulations it can be maximum allowed length of triangle sides). This parameter ensures enough detail for further analysis.

'''Trait leadership''' is defined as integrated patterns of personal characteristics that reflect a range of individual differences and foster consistent leader effectiveness across a variety of group and organizational situations (Zaccaro, Kemp, &amp; Bader, 2004).&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Zaccaro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen J. Zaccaro|first1=George Mason University|title=Trait-Based Perspectives of Leadership|date=January 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/nwphli/2006/docs/Trait_based_perspectives_of_leadership-2.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of trait leadership is developed from early leadership research which focused primarily on finding a group of heritable attributes that differentiate leaders from nonleaders. [https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1133&amp;context=ojwed Leader effectiveness] refers to the amount of influence a leader has on individual or group performance, followers’ satisfaction, and overall effectiveness (Derue, Nahrgang, Wellman, &amp; Humphrey, 2011). &lt;ref name="The Leadership Quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=The Leadership Quarterly|title=Personality predictors of leadership styles and the self–other agreement problem|date=13 March 2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Reinout_De_Vries/publication/229316315_Personality_predictors_of_leadership_styles_and_the_self-other/links/0fcfd50f9718514c46000000/Personality-predictors-of-leadership-styles-and-the-self-other.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have argued that leadership is unique to only a select number of individuals and that these individuals possess certain immutable traits that cannot be developed (Galton, 1869). Although this perspective has been criticized immensely over the past century, scholars still continue to study the effects of personality traits on leader effectiveness. Research has demonstrated that successful leaders differ from other people and possess certain core personality traits that significantly contribute to their success. Understanding the importance of these core personality traits that predict leader effectiveness can help organizations with their leader selection, training, and development practices (Derue et al., 2011).

== History of research ==
The emergence of the concept of trait leadership can be traced back to [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s [[Great Man theory|"great man" theory]], which stated that "The History of the World [...] was the Biography of Great Men."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequent commentators interpreted this view to conclude that the forces of extraordinary leadership&lt;ref&gt;
Carlyle in [[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History|''On Heroes'']] did not use the word "leadership" in his discussion of the hero as divinity, as prophet, as poet, as priest, as man of letters, and as "king" ; he mentions "leader" and "leaders" only 6 times (once quite disparagingly) in that work.

shape history (Judge, Piccolo, &amp; Kosalka, 2009). Influenced by Carlyle, [[Francis Galton]] in ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) took this idea further. Galton found that leadership was a unique property of extraordinary individuals and suggested that the traits which leaders possessed were immutable and could not be developed. Throughout the early 1900s, the study of leadership focused on traits.  Cowley (1931) commented that the approach to the research of leadership has usually been and should always be through the study of traits (Cowley, 1931). Many theorists, influenced by Carlyle and Galton, believed that trait leadership depended on the personal qualities of the leader, however, they did not assume that leadership only resides within a select number of people (Judge, Bono, Ilies, &amp; Gerhardt, 2002). This trait perspective of leadership was widely accepted until the late 1940s and early 1950s, when researchers began to deem personality traits insufficient in predicting leader effectiveness (Stogdill, 1948; Mann, 1959).

In 1948, Stogdill stated that leadership exists between persons in a social situation, and that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. This statement has been cited ubiquitously as sounding the death knell for trait-leadership theory. Furthermore, scholars commented that any trait's effect on leadership behavior will always depend on the situation (Huges, Ginnett, &amp; Curphy, 1996; Yukl &amp; Van Fleet, 1992).  Subsequently, leadership stopped being characterized by individual differences, and behavioral and situational analyses of leadership took over and began to dominate the field of leadership research (Bass, 1990). During this period of widespread rejection, several dominant theories took the place of trait leadership theory, including Fiedler's (1967) contingency model, Blake and Mouton's (1964) managerial grid, Hersey and Blanchard's (1969) situational leadership model, and transformational and transactional leadership models (Avolio, Sosik, Jung, &amp; Berson, 2003; Bass, 1985; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, &amp; Fetter, 1990).

Despite the growing criticisms of trait leadership, the purported basis for the rejection of trait-leadership models began to encounter strong challenges (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983; Lord, DeVader, &amp; Alliger, 1986) in the 1980s. Zaccaro (2007) pointed out that even Stogdill's (1948) review, although cited as evidence against leader traits, contained conclusions supporting that individual differences could still be predictors of leader effectiveness. With an increasing number of empirical studies directly supporting trait leadership (Judge et al., 2002; Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004), traits have reemerged in the lexicon of the scientific research into leadership. In recent years, the research about leader traits has made some progress in identifying a list of personality traits that are highly predictive of leader effectiveness. Additionally, to account for the arguments for situational leadership, researchers have used the [[round-robin design methodology]] to test whether certain individuals emerge as leaders across multiple situations (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983). Scholars have also proposed new ways of studying the relationship of certain traits to leader effectiveness. For instance, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} suggest the integration of trait and behavioral theories to understand how traits relate to leader effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). Furthermore, scholars have expanded their focus and have proposed looking at more malleable traits (ones susceptible to development) in addition to the traditional dispositional traits as predictors of leader effectiveness (Hoffman, Woehr, Maldagen-Youngjohn, &amp; Lyons, 2011). Context is only now beginning to be examined as a contributor to leaders' success and failure. [[Productive narcissism|Productive narcissistic]] CEOs like [[Steven Jobs]] of Apple and [[Jack Welch]] of GE have demonstrated a gift for creating [[innovation]], whereas leaders with idealized traits prove more successful in more stable environments requiring less innovation and [[creativity]] (Maccoby, 2007).

Cultural fit and leadership value can be determined by evaluating an individual’s own behavior, perceptions of their employees and peers, and the direct objective results of their organization, and then comparing these findings against the needs of the company (Bass, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah,  NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leader traits ==
The investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007). In recent years, several studies have made comprehensive reviews about leader traits which have been historically studied (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). There are many ways that traits related to leadership can be categorized; however, the two most recent categorizations have organized traits into (1) demographic vs. task competence vs. interpersonal and (2) distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like): 

=== Demographic, task competence and interpersonal leadership ===
Based on a recent review of the trait leadership literature, Derue and others (2011) stated that most leader traits can be organized into three categories: demographic, task competence, and interpersonal attributes. For the demographics category, gender has by far received the most attention in terms of leadership; however, most scholars have found that male and female leaders are both equally effective. Task competence relates to how individuals approach the execution and performance of tasks (Bass &amp; Bass, 2008). Hoffman grouped intelligence, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Emotional Stability into this category. Lastly, interpersonal attributes are related to how a leader approaches social interactions. According to Hoffman and others (2011), Extraversion and Agreeableness should be grouped into this category.

=== Distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like) ===
Recent research has shifted from focusing solely on distal (dispositional/trait-like) characteristics of leaders to more proximal (malleable/state-like) individual differences often in the form of knowledge and skills (Hoffman et al., 2011). The hope is that emergence of proximal traits in trait leadership theory will help researchers answer the ancient question: are leaders born or made?  Proximal individual differences suggest that the characteristics that distinguish effective leaders from non-effective leaders are not necessarily stable through the life-span, implying that these traits may be able to be developed. Hoffman and others (2011) examined the effects of distal vs. proximal traits on leader effectiveness. He found that distal individual differences of achievement motivation, energy, flexibility, dominance, honesty/integrity, self-confidence, creativity, and charisma were strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. Additionally, he found that the proximal individual differences of interpersonal skills, oral communication, written communication, management skills, problem solving skills, and decision making were also strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. His results suggested that on average, distal and proximal individual differences have a similar relationship with effective leadership (Hoffman et al., 2011).

== Trait-leadership model ==
Zaccaro and colleagues (2004) created a model to understand leader traits and their influence on leader effectiveness/performance. This model, shown in the figure below, is based on other models of leader traits and leader effectiveness/performance (Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, Fleishman, &amp; Reiter-Palmon, 1993; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000) and rests on two basic premises about leader traits. The first premise is that leadership emerges from the combined influence of multiple traits as opposed to emerging from the independent assessment of traits. Zaccaro (2001) argued that effective leadership is derived from an integrated set of cognitive abilities, social capabilities, and dispositional tendencies, with each set of traits adding to the influence of the other. The second premise is that leader traits differ in their proximal influence on leadership. This model is a multistage one in which certain distal attributes (i.e. dispositional attributes, cognitive abilities, and motives/values) serve as precursors for the development of proximal personal characteristics (i.e. social skills, problem solving skills and expertise knowledge) (Ackerman &amp; Humphreys, 1990; Barrick, Mitchell, &amp; Stewart, 2003; Chen, Gully, Whiteman, &amp; Kilcullen, 2000; Schneider, Hough, &amp; Dunnette, 1996; Kanfer, 1990, 1992; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000). Adopting this categorization approach and based on several comprehensive reviews/meta-analysis of trait leadership in recent years (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2010; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007), we tried to make an inclusive list of leader traits (Table 1). However, the investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007).

'''Table 1. Leader Traits based on Zaccaro’s (2004) Model'''
|-
| [[Extraversion]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to be sociable, assertive, active, and to experience positive affects, such as energy and zeal. In Judge and other’s (2002) [[meta-analysis]], Extraversion was significantly positively related to leadership ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] = .31).
|-
| [[Agreeableness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; refers to the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle. The relationship between Agreeableness and leadership is still ambiguous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Agreeableness was not significantly related to leadership (r = .08).
|-
| [[Conscientiousness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; it comprises two related facets, namely achievement and dependability. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Conscientiousness was significantly positively related to leadership (r = .28).
|-
| [[Openness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Openness was found to be significantly positively related with leadership (r = .24).
|-
| [[Neuroticism]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative affects, such as anxiety, insecurity, and hostility. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Neuroticism was significantly negatively correlated with (r = -.24).
|-
| [[Honesty]]/[[integrity]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Defined as the correspondence between work and deed, and as being truthful and non deceitful (Locke, 1991). In Hoffman and other’s (2011) meta analysis, honesty/integrity was found to be positively related to leadership effectiveness of others and surrounding factors(r = .29).
|-
| [[Charisma]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Charismatic leaders are able to influence followers by articulating a compelling vision for the future, arousing commitment to organizational objectives and inspiring commitment and a sense of self-efficacy among followers. Hoffman and others (2011) found it has a significant influence on leadership (r = .57).
|-
| [[Intelligence]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Intelligence is regarded as the most important trait in psychology. It has been identified as one of the most critical traits that must be possessed by all leaders (Judge et al., 2004).
|-
| [[Creativity]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Creativity has been proposed as an important component of effective leadership; Hoffman and others (2011) found a significant relationship between creativity and leader effectiveness (r = .31).
|-
| Achievement motivation (Distal - Motive/Value)|| The motivation to achieve has been proved to have significant relationship with leader effectiveness (r = .23) (Judge et al., 2002).
|-
| [[Need for power]](Distal - Motive/Value)|| Characterized by the satisfaction leaders derive from exerting influence over the attitudes and behaviors of others. Need for power has a positive relationship with leader effectiveness (McClelland &amp; Boyatzis, 1982).
|-
| Oral/written communication (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Oral and written communication skills are found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Interpersonal skills]] (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Including a broad range of skills associated with un understanding of human behavior and the dynamics of groups (Locke, 1991; Yukl, 2006), interpersonal skills were found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| General [[problem solving]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| General problem solving skills were found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Decision making]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| Decision skills were also found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| Technical knowledge (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Technical knowledge includes methods, processes, and equipment for conducting the specialized activities of the managers’ organizational unit (Yukl, 2006). It has been proved to be positively correlated with leader effectiveness (Bass, 1990).
|-
| [[Management]] skills (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Given that leaders’ key responsibilities involve coordinating the work of multiple constituents, the ability to manage is likely crucial to leader effectiveness. This relationship has also been proved significant (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|}

== Other models of trait leadership ==
Multiple models have been proposed to explain the relationship of traits to leader effectiveness.  Recently, integrated trait leadership models were put forward by summarizing the historical findings and reconciling the conflict between traits and other factors such as situations in determining effective leadership (Derue et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). In addition to Zaccaro’s Model of Leader Attributes and Leader Performance described in the previous section, two other models have emerged in recent trait leadership literature. The Leader Trait Emergence Effectiveness (LTEE) Model, created by Judge and colleagues (2009), combines the behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology theories of how personality traits are developed into a model that explains leader emergence and effectiveness. Additionally, this model separates objective and subjective leader effectiveness into different criterion. The authors created this model to be broad and flexible as to diverge from how the relationship between traits and leadership had been studied in past research. Another model that has emerged in the trait leadership literature is the Integrated Model of Leader Traits, Behaviors, and Effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). This model combines traits and behaviors in predicting leader effectiveness and tested the mediation effect of leader behaviors on the relationship between leader traits and effectiveness. The authors found that some types of leader behaviors mediated the effect between traits and leader effectiveness. The results of Derue and colleagues' (2011) study supported an integrated trait-behavioral model that can be used in future research.

== Criticisms of trait leadership ==
Although there has been an increased focus by researchers on trait leadership, this theory remains one of the most criticized theories of leadership. Over the years, many reviewers of trait leadership theory have commented that this approach to leadership is “too simplistic” (Conger &amp; Kanugo, 1998), and “futile” (House &amp; Aditya, 1997). Additionally, scholars have noted that trait leadership theory usually only focuses on how leader effectiveness is perceived by followers (Lord et al., 1986) rather than a leader’s actual effectiveness (Judge et al., 2009). Because the process through which personality predicts the actual effectiveness of leaders has been relatively unexplored (Ng, Ang, &amp; Chan, 2008), these scholars have concluded that personality currently has low explanatory and predictive power over job performance and cannot help organizations select leaders who will be effective (Morgeson &amp; Ilies, 2007). Furthermore, Derue and colleagues (2011) found that leader behaviors are more predictive of leader effectiveness than are traits.

Another criticism of trait leadership is its silence on the influence of the situational context surrounding leaders (Ng et al., 2008). Stogdill (1948) found that persons who are leaders in one situation may not be leaders in another situation. Complimenting this situational theory of leadership, Murphy (1941) wrote that leadership does not reside in the person, and it usually requires examining the whole situation. In addition to situational leadership theory, there has been growing support for other leadership theories such as transformational, transactional, charismatic, and authentic leadership theories. These theories have gained popularity because they are more normative than the trait and behavioral leadership theories (Schaubroeck, Lam, &amp; Cha, 2007).

Further criticisms include the failure of studies to uncover a trait or group of traits that are consistently associated with leadership emergence or help differentiate leaders from followers (Kenny &amp; Zacarro, 1983). Additionally, trait leadership’s focus on a small set of personality traits and neglect of more malleable traits such as social skills and problem solving skills has received considerable criticism.  Lastly, trait leadership often fails to consider the integration of multiple traits when studying the effects of traits on leader effectiveness (Zaccaro, 2007).

== Implications for practice ==
Given the recent increase in evidence and support of trait leadership theory (Ng et al., 2008), scholars have suggested a variety of strategies for human resource departments within organizations.  Companies should use personality traits as selection tools for identifying emerging leaders (Ng et al., 2008). These companies, however, should be aware of the individual traits that predict success in leader effectiveness as well as the traits that could be detrimental to leader effectiveness. For example, while Derue and colleagues (2011) found that individuals who are high in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness are predicted to be more likely to be perceived as successful in leadership positions, Judge, Woolf, Hurst, &amp; Livingston (2006) wrote that individuals who are high in narcissism are more likely to be a liability in certain jobs. Narcissism is just one example of a personality trait that should be explored further by HR practitioners to ensure they are not placing individuals with certain traits in the wrong positions.

Complementing the suggestion that personality traits should be used as selection tools, Judge and colleagues (2002) found that the Big Five Personality traits were more strongly related to leadership than intelligence. This finding suggests that selecting leaders based on their personality is more important than selecting them based on intelligence. If organizations select leaders based on intelligence, it is recommended by Judge and colleagues (2002) that these individuals be placed in leadership positions when the stress level is low and the individual has the ability to be directive.

Another way in which HR practitioners can use the research on trait leadership is for leadership development programs. Although inherent personality traits (distal/trait-like) are relatively immune to leadership development, Zaccaro (2007) suggested that proximal traits (state-like) will be more malleable and susceptible to leadership development programs. Companies should use different types of development interventions to stretch the existing capabilities of their leaders (Zaccaro, 2007).

There is also evidence to suggest that Americans have an Extrovert Ideal, which dictates that people, most times unconsciously, favor the traits of extroverted individuals and suppress the qualities unique to introverts (Cain, 2012). Susan Cain's research points to a transition sometime around the turn of the century during which we stopped evaluating our leaders based on character and began judging them instead based on personality. While both extroverted and introverted leaders have been shown to be effective, we have a general proclivity towards extroverted traits, which when evaluating trait leadership, could skew our perception of what's important.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">'''Universal Accounting Center (UA)''' is a [[Privately owned enterprise|privately owned]] training organization located in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  Founded in 1979, they offer self-paced [[Home study course|home-study courses]] in [[accounting]], [[bookkeeping]], [[tax preparation]], [[QuickBooks]] and [[marketing]] that specializes in [[small business]].

==History==
Universal Accounting was established in 1979.  The training center was founded as Universal Training Systems by Alf Bostrom with the purpose to teach students full-charge bookkeeping and accounting.  It first functioned under the parent company Metropolitan Business Bureau (MBB) which Alf began as a [[Financial consultant|financial consulting]] firm in 1960.  Through his experience with MBB, Alf established the [[business model]] upon which Universal Accounting would be built. Until quite recently, Universal Accounting was run by Alf’s son, [[Allen Bostrom]].

Universal Training Systems initially followed a [[classroom]]-based learning model, and the first Universal classroom was opened in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Shortly thereafter, several school locations in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] were opened and franchised.

In 1992, Alf’s sons, Allen and Ken Bostrom, joined his staff, and in 1994, Alf retired, and Allen Bostrom became president and [[CEO]] of the newly named Universal Accounting Center. The school has evolved from offering local live courses to developing and selling home-based study materials for bookkeeping, accounting, tax preparation, QuickBooks and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upgrade.slco.org/upAndComing/UaC008.html] Upgrade.com "Teaching Basics Propels Company to Inc. 500 List."&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1st, 2014, Roger Knecht became UAC's new president and CEO; Allen Bostrom remains as the chair of Universal's Board of Directors.

==Accreditation==
Universal Accounting has been approved by the California Tax Education Council (CTEC) to offer the Professional Tax Preparer Certification (PTP) as a [[distance learning]] course in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enewschannels.com/2006/11/09/enc381_012629.php] Berg, Tabitha (2006-11-09).“Universal Accounting Center Tax Education Approved by California.” eNewsChannels.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continuing professional development|Continuing Professional Education]] (CPE) credits are awarded for each of Universal’s training programs.

In domains of [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], the '''Universal Dielectric Response''', or '''UDR''', refers to the observed emergent behaviour  of the [[dielectric]] properties exhibited by diverse solid state systems. In particular this widely observed response involves power law scaling of dielectric properties with [[frequency]] under conditions of [[alternating current]], AC. First defined in a landmark article by [[A. K. Jonscher]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The 'universal'dielectric response| journal= Nature| year=1977| volume=267| issue=5613| page=673| bibcode=1977Natur.267..673J| doi=10.1038/267673a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of the UDR were attributed to the dominance many-body interactions in systems, and their analogous RC network equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The universal dielectric response and its physical significance| journal= ." IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation| year=1992| volume=27| issue=3| page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Dielectric Response manifests in the variation of AC Conductivity with frequency and is most often observed in complex systems consisting of multiple phases of similar or dissimilar materials. Such systems, which can be called heterogenous or composite materials, can be described from a dielectric perspective as a large network consisting of resistor and capacitor elements, known also as an [[RC circuit|RC network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCullen | first1= Nicholas J. | title= The robustness of the emergent scaling property of random RC network models of complex materials | journal= . Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics  | year=2009 | volume=42 | issue=6
| page=064001| bibcode= 2009JPhD...42f4001M | doi= 10.1088/0022-3727/42/6/064001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At low and high frequencies, the dielectric response of heterogeneous materials is governed by percolation pathways. If a heterogeneous material is represented by a network in which more than 50% of the elements are capacitors, [[percolation]] through capacitor elements will occur. This percolation results in conductivity at high and low frequencies that is directly proportional to frequency. Conversely, if the fraction of capacitor elements in the representative RC network (P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is lower than 0.5, dielectric behavior at low and high frequency regimes is independent of frequency. At intermediate frequencies, a very broad range of heterogeneous materials show a well-defined emergent region, in which power law correlation of [[admittance]] to frequency is observed. The power law emergent region is they key feature of the UDR. In materials or systems exhibiting UDR, the overall dielectric response from high to low frequencies is symmetrical, being centered at the middle point of the emergent region, which occurs in equivalent RC networks at a frequency of :&lt;math&gt;\omega = (RC)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. In the power law emergent region, the  admittance of the overall system follows the general power law proportionality &lt;math&gt; Y\propto\omega^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;, where the power law exponent α can be approximated to the fraction of capacitors in the equivalent RC network of the system α≅P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Universality of the emergent scaling in finite random binary percolation networks| journal= PLOS One | year=2017 | volume=12 |issue=2 | pages= e0172298| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0172298| pmid= 28207872 | pmc= 5312937 | last1= Zhai | first1= C | last2= et al | bibcode= 2017PLoSO..1272298Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of the UDR ==
The power law scaling of dielectric properties with frequency is valuable in interpreting [[impedance spectroscopy]] data towards the characterisation of responses in emerging [[ferroelectric]] and [[multiferroic]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=MacDonald | first1= J.R.| title= Generalizations of ''universal dielectric response''and a general distribution‐of‐activation‐energies model for dielectric and conducting systems| journal= Journal of Applied Physics| year=1985| volume=58| issue=5| page=1971| bibcode=1985JAP....58.1971M| doi=10.1063/1.336004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Pattanayak | first1= Samita| title= Generalizations of ''Effect of Dy-substitution on structural, electrical and magnetic properties of multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramics| journal= Ceramics International | year=2014| volume=40| issue=6| page=7983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Vertex (disambiguation)}}

A '''vertex''' (plural '''vertices''') in [[computer graphics]] is a data structure that describes certain attributes, like the position of a point in 2D or 3D [[space]], at multiple points on a surface.

==Application to 3D models==

[[3D models]] are most-often represented as triangulated [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] forming a [[triangle mesh]]. Non triangular surfaces can be converted to an array of triangles through [[Tessellation (computer graphics)|tessellation]]. Attributes from the vertices are typically interpolated across mesh surfaces.

==Vertex attributes==

The vertices of triangles are associated not only with spatial position but also with other values used to [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the object correctly.  Most attributes of a vertex represent vectors in the space to be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]]. These vectors are typically 1 (''x''), 2 (''x, y''), or 3 (''x, y, z'') dimensional and can include a fourth [[Homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous coordinate]] (''w''). These values are given meaning by a [[Material (computer graphics)|material]] description. In [[realtime rendering]] these properties are used by a [[vertex shader]] or [[vertex pipeline]].

Such attributes can include:

{{term|Position}}
{{defn|2D or 3D coordinates representing a position in space}}

{{term|Color}}
{{defn|Typically diffuse or specular [[RGB]] values, either representing surface colour or [[precomputed lighting]] information.}}

{{term|Reflectance}}
{{defn|of the surface at the vertex, e.g. [[specular exponent]], metallicity, fresnel values.}}

{{term|Texture coordinates}}
{{defn|Also known as [[UV coordinates]],these control the [[texture mapping]] of the surface, possibly for multiple layers.}}
{{term|normal vectors|content=[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]}}
{{defn|These define an approximated curved surface at the location of the vertex, used for lighting calculations (such as [[Phong shading]]), [[normal mapping]], or [[displacement mapping]], and to control subdivision.}}
{{term|tangent vectors|content=[[tangent vectors]]}}
{{defn| These define an approximated curved surface at the location of the vertex, used for lighting calculations (such as [[Phong shading]]), [[normal mapping]], or [[displacement mapping]], and to control subdivision.}}

{{term|[[Weight maps|Blend weights]]}}
{{term|[[Weight maps|Bone weights]]}}
{{defn|[[Weighting]] for assignment to bones to control deformation in [[skeletal animation]].}}

{{term|Blend shapes}}
{{defn|Multiple position vectors may be specified to be blended over time, especially for [[facial animation]].}}
