{{USBankruptcy}}
A '''discharge''' in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|United States bankruptcy law]], when referring to a debtor's discharge, is a statutory [[injunction]] against the commencement or continuation of an action (or the employment of process, or an act) to collect, recover or offset a [[debt]] as a personal liability of the debtor. The discharge is one of the primary benefits afforded by relief under the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]] and is essential to the "fresh start" of debtors following bankruptcy that is a central principle under federal bankruptcy law. Discharge is also believed to play an important role in credit markets by encouraging lenders, who may be more sophisticated and have better information than debtors, to monitor debtors and limit risk-taking.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; 

A discharge of debts is granted to debtors but can be denied or revoked by the court based on certain misconduct of debtors, including fraudulent actions or failure of a debtor to disclose all assets during a bankruptcy case.  Some debts, such as alimony and childsupport, cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, while others, such as student loans, are difficult to discharge and are therefore rarely discharged.&lt;ref name = Simkovic/&gt;

The benefit of the discharge injunction is narrower than (but similar to) the benefit afforded by the [[automatic stay]] in bankruptcy.

U.S. law also provides for specialized discharges in bankruptcy (see below).

==Bankruptcy discharge for the debtor==

In the [[United States]], there are generally seven kinds of debtor discharges in bankruptcy, found in the following statutes:

::{{usc|11|727(a)}} (relating to liquidation bankruptcies for individuals);

::{{usc|11|944(b)}} (relating to municipal bankruptcies);

::{{usc|11|1141(d)(1)(A)}} (relating to discharges resulting from confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization);

::{{usc|11|1228(a)}} (relating to certain family farmer or fisherman cases);

::{{usc|11|1228(b)}} (relating to certain family farmer or fisherman cases);

::{{usc|11|1328(a)}} (relating to certain cases involving adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income);

::{{usc|11|1328(b)}} (relating to certain cases involving adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income).

The effect of the debtor's discharge is provided for at {{usc|11|524}}. In addition, certain limitations on the debtor's discharge are described at {{usc|11|523}}.

For more information on the debtor's discharge, see [[Bankruptcy in the United States]].

==Other discharges in bankruptcy==

In the United States, with respect to taxes incurred by the bankruptcy estate (as opposed to the debtor) during case administration, a specialized discharge for the trustee, the debtor, any successor to the debtor, and (for cases commenced on or after October 17, 2005) the bankruptcy estate is provided in {{usc|11|505(b)}}.

At the conclusion of a case the trustee (if any) may be discharged as trustee under {{usc|11|350(a)}}.

'''Bayer AG''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|.|ər|,_|ˈ|b|aɪ|.|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈbaɪɐ|lang}}) is a [[Germany|German]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] and [[life sciences]] company. Headquartered in [[Leverkusen]], where its illuminated corporate logo, the Bayer cross, is a landmark, Bayer's areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high-value [[polymers]]. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.boerse-frankfurt.de/index/constituents/Euro_Stoxx_50#Constituents|title=Euro Stoxx 50, Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange)|publisher=Deutsche Boerse|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Baumann]] has been CEO since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Natalie |title=Bayer confirms Werner Baumann as new chief |url=https://www.ft.com/content/33118c7f-c1af-3ea0-8eaf-134a0530c04f |work=Financial Times |date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in [[Barmen]] in 1863 as a [[Dye|dyestuffs]] factory, Bayer's first and best-known product was [[aspirin]]. In 1898 Bayer [[trademarked]] the name ''[[heroin]]'' for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for [[morphine]] until 1910. Bayer also introduced [[phenobarbital]]; [[prontosil]], the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine; the antibiotic Cipro ([[ciprofloxacin]]); and Yaz ([[drospirenone]]) [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]].

In 1925 Bayer was one of six chemical companies that merged to form [[IG Farben]],{{sfn|Tammen|1978|p=195}} the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company. The [[Allied Control Council]] seized IG Farben after [[World War II]],{{efn|name=seized}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Law No. 9 |url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/PropControl/reference/history.propcontrol.i0039.pdf |publisher=Allied Control Council|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922015412/http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/PropControl/reference/history.propcontrol.i0039.pdf|archive-date=22 September 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its role in the [[Nazi]] war effort and involvement in [[the Holocaust]], which included using slave labour from concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2001|pp=xxi–xxii}}; {{harvnb|Dickerman|2017|p=440}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was split into its six constituent companies in 1951, then split again into three: BASF, Bayer and Hoechst.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=xxii}}&lt;ref name=Schneibel19Aug2011&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dw.com/en/stock-of-former-nazi-chemicals-giant-to-be-delisted/a-15327052| first=Gerhard|last=Schneibel| title=Stock of former Nazi chemicals giant to be delisted|work=Deutsche Welle| date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer played a key role in the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] in post-war [[West Germany]], quickly regaining its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. In 2006 the company acquired [[Schering AG|Schering]], in 2014 it acquired [[Merck &amp; Co.]]'s consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's, and in 2018 it acquired [[Monsanto]], a leading producer of genetically engineered crops, for $63 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neate |first1=Rupert |title=Monsanto to ditch its infamous name after sale to Bayer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/monsanto-to-ditch-its-infamous-name-after-sale-to-bayer |work=The Guardian |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer CropScience develops [[genetically modified crops]] and [[pesticides]].

==Early history==
===Foundation===
[[File:Farbenfabrik vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Comp 1908.jpg|left|thumb|Share of Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Comp in Elberfeld, issued 1 May 1908]]

Bayer AG was founded as a [[Dye|dyestuffs]] factory in 1863 in [[Barmen]] (later part of [[Wuppertal]]), Germany, by [[Friedrich Bayer]] and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott, a master dyer.{{sfn|Lewis|Zitzlsperger|2016|p=92}} Bayer was responsible for the commercial tasks. [[Fuchsine]] and [[aniline]] became the company's most important products.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The headquarters and most production facilities moved from Barmen to a larger area in [[Elberfeld]] in 1866. Friedrich Bayer (1851–1920), son of the company’s founder, was a chemist and joined the company in 1873. After the death of his father in 1880, the company became a joint-stock company, Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayern &amp; Co, also known as Elberfelder Farbenfabriken.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Bayer-Kreuz.jpg|thumb|upright|Bayer cross, [[Leverkusen]]]]
A further expansion in Elberfeld was impossible, so the company moved to the village Wiesdorf at Rhein and settled in the area of the [[alizarin]] producer [[Carl Leverkus|Leverkus and Sons]]. A new city, [[Leverkusen]], was founded there in 1930 and became home to Bayer AG's headquarters. The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904, consisting of the word ''BAYER'' written vertically and horizontally, sharing the ''Y'' and enclosed in a circle.{{sfn|Sánchez-Serrano|2011|p=51}} An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen.&lt;ref&gt;Europe Tourism. 5 March 2015 [http://europetourism.ga/category/landmarks/ landmarks Landmarks: Cologne: Nearby Attractions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspirin===
[[File:Aspirin-Fläschchen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bottle of Bayer aspirin, 1899]]
Bayer's first major product was [[acetylsalicylic acid]]—first described by French chemist [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]] in 1853{{sfn|Schrör|2016|p=12}}—a modification of [[salicylic acid]] or [[salicin]], a [[folk remedy]] found in the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the [[willow]] plant.{{sfn|Schrör|2016|p=8}}&lt;ref name=Mahdi2006/&gt; By 1899 Bayer's trademark [[Aspirin]] was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but it lost its trademark status in the United States, France and the United Kingdom after the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during [[World War I]] by the United States, and because of the subsequent widespread usage of the word.&lt;ref name=Tulett28May2014/&gt;

The term ''aspirin'' continued to be used in the US, UK and France for all brands of the drug,&lt;ref name=Tulett28May2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27026704|title='Genericide': Brands destroyed by their own success|first=Simon|last=Tulett|date=28 May 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in over 80 countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany and Switzerland. As of 2011 approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin were produced each year and 10–20 billion tablets consumed in the United States alone for prevention of cardiovascular events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuster|first1=Valentin|last2=Sweeny|first2=Joseph M. |title=Aspirin: A Historical and Contemporary Therapeutic Overview |journal=Circulation |volume=123 |issue=7 |pages=768–778 |date=22 February 2011 |pmid=21343593 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.963843 |url=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.963843}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |publisher=World Health Organization |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an unresolved controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. [[Arthur Eichengrün]], a Bayer chemist, said he was the first to discover an aspirin formulation that did not have the unpleasant [[adverse effect|side effects]] of [[nausea]] and [[gastric pain]]. He also said he had invented the name ''aspirin'' and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by [[Felix Hoffmann]] to help his father, who had [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Felix Hoffmann ist der "Vater" des Aspirin|date=September 1999|publisher=Bayer AG, courtesy of LaHave Media Services Limited|url=http://pressearchiv-kubitschek.www.de/pharma-presse/presseerklaerungen/texte/pharma_medikamente/bayer/bayer_110999.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132933/http://pressearchiv-kubitschek.www.de/pharma-presse/presseerklaerungen/texte/pharma_medikamente/bayer/bayer_110999.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources support the conflicting claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|date=1999|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|url=http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|title=Jewish Scientist's Claim to Discover Aspirin Denied by Nazis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528215006/http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2005|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sneader&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sneader, Walter|date=23 December 2000|title=The discovery of aspirin: a reappraisal|journal=BMJ|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7276/1591|volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1591–1594 |year=2000 |pmid=11124191 |pmc=1119266 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Hoffmann and/or Eichengrün.&lt;ref name=Sneader/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mahdi2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mahdi|first1=J.G.| last2=Mahdi|first2=A.J.|last3=Mahdi|first3=A.J.|last4=Bowen|first4=I.D. |title=The historical analysis of aspirin discovery, its relation to the willow tree and antiproliferative and anticancer potential |journal=Cell Proliferation |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=147–155 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16542349 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00377.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroin===
[[File:Bayer Heroin bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Bayer Heroin bottle]]
[[Heroin]] (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was introduced as a non-addictive substitute for morphine,&lt;ref name=TimesUnion&gt;Moore, Deborah (24 August 2014).

''Business Insider''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenobarbital===
In 1903 Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug [[diethylbarbituric acid]] from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of [[phenobarbital]] in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014 it remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.&lt;ref name="Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD 26–39"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD |title=How phenobarbital revolutionized epilepsy therapy: the story of phenobarbital therapy in epilepsy in the last 100 years |journal=Epilepsia |volume=53 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=26–39 |date=December 2012  |pmid=23205960 |doi=10.1111/epi.12026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C 329–43"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C |title=The history of barbiturates a century after their clinical introduction |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=329–343 |date=December 2005 |pmid=18568113 |pmc=2424120 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), Bayer's assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada and several other countries.&lt;ref name="bayer1"/&gt; In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks, including the well-known Bayer cross, were acquired by [[Sterling Drug]], a predecessor of [[Sterling Winthrop]] and were not reclaimed until 1994.

In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered [[suramin]], an anti-[[trypanosomes|parasite]] drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons, but it was elucidated and published in 1924 by [[Ernest Fourneau]] and his team at the [[Pasteur Institute]].{{sfn|Sneader|2005|pp=378–379}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fourneau | first1 = E. | last2 = Th | last3 = Vallée | first3 = J. | year = 1924 | title = Sur une nouvelle série de médicaments trypanocides | url = | journal = Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences | volume = 178 | issue = | page = 675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
In 1953 Bayer brought the first neuroleptic ([[chlorpromazine]]) onto the German market.{{sfn|Bangen|1992}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}} In the 1960s Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, [[Primodos]], that consisted of two pills that contained [[norethisterone]] (as acetate) and [[ethinylestradiol]]. It detected pregnancy by inducing [[menstruation]] in women who were not pregnant; the presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for [[birth defect]]s, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date and found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.&lt;ref name=MHRAreview2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con404471.pdf|title=Assessment of historical evidence on Primodos and congenital malformations – a synopsis|publisher=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|date=2014|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alka-Seltzer Ged Handelsmerk.JPG|thumb|Bayer has owned [[Alka-Seltzer]] since 1978.]]
In 1978 Bayer purchased [[Miles Laboratories]] and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and [[Cutter Laboratories]], acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Flintstones chewable vitamins|Flintstones vitamins]] and [[One A Day|One-A-Day]] vitamins, and Cutter [[insect repellent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich_djvu.txt "Cutter Laboratories: 1897–1972. A Dual Trust"]. The Bancroft Library, University of California/Berkeley, Regional Oral History Office, transcript 1972–1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's [[Factor VIII]] business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat [[hemophilia]], was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the [[History of HIV/AIDS#1981: From GRID to AIDS|early days of the AIDS epidemic]], people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated blood products]] as a source of infection. According to the ''New York Times'', this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history". Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997 Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States. But in 2003 documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985, including in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and Argentina, to offload a product they were unable to sell in Europe and the US; they also continued manufacturing the unheated product for several months. Bayer said it did this because some countries were doubtful about the efficacy of the new product.&lt;ref name = NYTimes2003&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html | title = 2 Paths of Bayer Drug in 80's: Riskier One Steered Overseas | last1=Bogdanich|first1=Walt|authorlink1=Walt Bogdanich|last2=Koli|first2=Eric|authorlink2=|work=The New York Times |date=19 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer has been involved in other controversies regarding its drug products. In the late 1990s it introduced a [[statin]] drug, Baycol ([[cerivastatin]]), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was [[rhabdomyolysis]], causing [[renal failure]], which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Spin off of Covestro===
In September 2015 Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called [[Covestro]] in which it retained about a 70% interest.&lt;ref name="WSJCovestro2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Joyce (1 September 2015).

''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.&lt;ref name=WSJCovestro2015&gt;Alessi, Christopher (1 September 2015).

==Corporate structure==
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a [[holding company]]. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; [[Bayer MaterialScience|Bayer MaterialScience AG]] and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services [[GmbH]], Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH &amp; Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a [[life sciences]] based company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manufacturingchemist.com/news/article_page/Bayer_organises_its_Life_Science_businesses_into_three_divisions_Pharmaceuticals_Consumer_Health_and_Crop_Science/112053|title=Bayer organises its Life Science businesses into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and Crop Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bayer.com/en/profile-and-organization.aspx | title=Names, Facts, Figures about Bayer | date=31 December 2015 | publisher=Bayer | accessdate=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-aligns-organization-with-Life-Science-businesses|title=Bayer aligns organization with Life Science businesses - Bayer News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayer CropScience===
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. [[pesticides]]), nonagricultural [[pest (animal)|pest]] control, [[seeds]] and plant [[biotechnology]]. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in [[Genetically modified food|genetic engineering of food]].&lt;ref name="AR2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.annualreport2010.bayer.com/en/bayer-annual-report-2010.pdfx |title=Annual Report 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2011 |publisher=Bayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of [[Sanofi]]) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company [[Plant Genetic Systems]] became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.&lt;ref name="AR2010" /&gt;  Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.&lt;ref&gt;Fruitnet. 4 April 2014 [http://www.fruitnet.com/americafruit/article/161152/bayer-announces-nunhems-rebranding Bayer Cropscience rebrands Nunhems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ram HH and Yadava, R.

New India Publishing, 2007 {{ISBN|9788189422653}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bloomberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/business/02rice.html|newspaper=The New York Times | title=Bayer Settles With Farmers Over Modified Rice Seeds|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the [[United States]] between 2013 and 2016.  A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty.  Liberty is an alternative to Monsanto's product, [[Glyphosate|Roundup]], which are both used to kill weeds.

==Bayer 04 Leverkusen==
{{Main|Bayer 04 Leverkusen}}
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming [[TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) owners are the largest private owners in the country 
(2) it possesses sufficient political power to promote its own interests
(3) owners control multiple businesses, which intensively coordinate their activities.&lt;ref name=Chern2018&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A typical example of a post-Soviet oligarch entity is the [[Privat Group]] - a large [[Ukraine]]-based transnational business conglomerate comprising dozens of industrial companies in several markets, controlled by only three stakeholders, and not through the [[stock exchange]]. For the history of business oligarchs in post-Soviet Union states see:

* [[Ukrainian oligarchs]]

More generally, an '''oligarch''' is a "member of an [[oligarchy]]; a person who is part of a small group holding power in a state".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite OED | oligarch}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle gave the concept of oligarchy some negative connotations, but the term does not necessarily imply wealth.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| title= Oligarchy
| publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica| date= June 20, 2013
| quote= Oligarchy, government by the few, especially despotic power exercised by a small and privileged group for corrupt or selfish purposes. [...] Aristotle used the term oligarchia to designate the rule of the few when it was exercised not by the best but by bad men unjustly. In this sense, oligarchy is a debased form of aristocracy, which denotes government by the few in which power is vested in the best individuals. Most classic oligarchies have resulted when governing elites were recruited exclusively from a ruling caste [...].

'''Carlos Casado del Alisal''' (March 16, 1833 — June 29, 1899) was a [[Spanish Argentine]] businessman.

==Life and times==

Carlos Casado del Alisal was born in [[Villada]], [[Palencia Province]], [[Spain]]. He arrived in [[Santa Fe Province]], [[Argentina]] in 1857, and in 1864, was named to the Board of Directors of the newly established [[Central Argentine Railway]] by its chief stockholder, [[William Wheelwright]]. Serving in the [[Rosario]] City Council, he also established the Casado Bank in 1865, and ''Colonia Candelaria'', an [[Agricultural colonies in Argentina|agricultural colony]], in 1870; the latter was later reestablished as [[Casilda]], in honor of his mother. He founded the [[New Bank of Santa Fe|Provincial Bank of Santa Fe]] in 1874, and purchased the highly indebted ''Colonia Caridad'' in 1878, redeveloping it as San Genaro (in honor of his daughter's [[patron saint]], [[Saint Gennaro]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casildavirtual.com.ar/historia1.php Carlos Casado y la historia de la ciudad de Casilda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722012346/http://www.casildavirtual.com.ar/historia1.php |date=July 22, 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casado arranged the first shipment of Argentine [[wheat]] to [[Europe]] in 1878; the 4,500 tons of wheat had been grown in Candelaria, and were shipped on April 12, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbosa.com.ar/lbosa/granos/notas.vsp?nid=4138 La primera exportación de trigo argentino] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706081703/http://www.lbosa.com.ar/lbosa/granos/notas.vsp?nid=4138 |date=July 6, 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently named [[monetary policy]] adviser by President [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], and helped direct national support toward the export of cereal at a time when [[leather]] and [[dried meat]]s earned most of the nation's [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]].&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; President of the Bank of Santa Fe, he also sat on the boards of the [[Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires]] and the [[Banco Hipotecario|Mortgage Bank]] as the representative for Santa Fe Province stockholders from 1882. Casado founded the [[Santa Fe Western Railway]] in 1883, and the rail line would, by 1890, connect much of the agriculturally-rich province to the [[Port of Rosario]] and the [[Paraná River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bancobsf.com.ar/institucional_historia.asp Nuevo Banco de Santa Fe. ''Historia institucional''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Paraguayan War]], in which Argentina annexed what became [[Formosa Province]] from [[Paraguay]], Casado became of the new province's leading landowners. He died in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1899, at age 66.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

Carlos Casado del Alisal was honored with a monument sculpted by [[Eduardo Barnes]], and unveiled at the Rosario headquarters of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe in 1970.

His brother was the well-known Spanish painter [[José Casado del Alisal]].

'''Celera''' is a subsidiary of [[Quest Diagnostics]] which focuses on genetic sequencing and related technologies. It was founded in 1998 as a business unit of [[Applera]], spun off into an independent company in 2008, and finally acquired by [[Quest Diagnostics]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.celera.com/celera/pr_1305673632 Quest Diagnostics Successfully Completes Acquisition of Celera, May 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally headquartered in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]] (relocated to [[Alameda, California]]), it was established in May 1998 by [[PE Corporation]] (later renamed to [[Applera]]), with Dr. J. [[Craig Venter]] from [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) as its first president. While at TIGR, Venter and [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]] led the first successful effort to [[sequencing|sequence]] an entire organism's [[genome]], that of the ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' [[bacterium]]. Celera was formed for the purpose of generating and commercializing genomic information.  Its stock is a [[tracking stock]] of Applera, along with the tracking stock of Applera's larger [[Applied Biosystems]] Group business unit.

Celera sequenced the human genome at a fraction of the cost of the public project, approximately $3 billion of taxpayer dollars versus about $300 million of private funding. However, a significant portion of the human genome had already been sequenced when Celera entered the field, and thus Celera did not incur any costs with obtaining the existing data, which was freely available to the public from [[GenBank]]. Celera's use of the shotgun strategy spurred the public HGP to change its own strategy, leading to a rapid acceleration of the public effort.

Critics of initial efforts by Celera Genomics to hold back data from sections of genome they sequenced for commercial exploitation felt that it would retard progress in science as a whole.  These critics pointed to the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] policy for gene sequences from the publicly funded [[Human Genome Project]].  Later, the company changed their policy and made their sequences available for non-commercial use but set a maximum threshold for amount of sequence data that a researcher could download at any given time.

The rise and fall of Celera as an ambitious competitor of the [[Human Genome Project]] is the main subject of the book ''The Genome War'' by [[James Shreeve]], who followed Venter around for two years in the process of writing the book. A view from the public effort's side is that of [[Nobel laureate]] Sir [[John Sulston]] in his book ''The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics and the Human Genome''. Anthropologist Paul Rabinow also based his 2005 book ''A Machine to Make a Future'' on Celera.

A '''cost centre''' is a department within a business to which [[cost]]s can be allocated. The term includes departments which do not produce directly but incur costs to the business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Are the Functions of a Cost Center in a Management Accounting System?|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/functions-cost-center-management-accounting-system-76935.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the manager and employees of the cost centre are not accountable for the profitability and investment decisions of the business but they are responsible for some of its costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a cost center? {{!}} AccountingCoach|url = http://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-a-cost-center|website = AccountingCoach.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cost Center Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-center.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are two main types of cost centres:
* Production cost centres, where the products are manufactured or processed. Example of this is an assembly area.
* Service cost centres, where services are provided to other cost centres. Example of this is the personnel department or the canteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounting for non-accounting students|last = Dyson|first = John R.|publisher = Pearson Education Limited|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0-273-72297-7|location = England|pages = 286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples ==
* Marketing department
* [[Human resources]]
* [[Research and development]]
* Work office
* [[Quality assurance]]
* Engineering
* [[Logistics]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles and Practice of Cost Accounting|last = Bhattacharyya|first = Asish K.|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2006|isbn = 81 203 2555 9|location = India|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost centres can be trimmed down to the smallest segregated tasks within Departments. It is not necessary to consider departments as outright cost centres. Some companies adopt a different approach when treating cost centres.{{such as|date=June 2018}}

== Function-specific cost ==
The main function of a cost centre is the tracing of all expenses linked with a certain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Financial Accounting|last = Perks|first = Robert|publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|year = 2007|isbn = 9780077115401|location = Berkshire|pages = 352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by considering a call centre as an independent unit, the firm can calculate how much it is spending each year for its 1-800 support service. If a cost centre is not considered independent then it would take a lot of effort in measuring the cost of providing this service because it will include dividing up the company's entire personnel and phone bills by department each month.

==Benefits==
There are numerous benefits of a cost centre which include:
* Monitoring [[efficiency]] – Cost centres are beneficial as they allow the effectiveness of all aspects within a company to be monitored closely.
* Employee confidence – The delegation of authority that takes place when making employees accountable for cost centre is a way to improve confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SWOT Revision|url = http://www.swotrevision.com/pages/alevel/business/mod1_part10.html|website = www.swotrevision.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Loss prevention – Cost centres try to update processes, be more effective and save money so that they can reduce the expenses. Cost centres try to cover all of their costs with offsetting revenue by reducing expenses and producing unpredicted revenue, thus preventing loss.
* Increasing profit – If one of the cost centres is removed from a firm then it has a negative impact on the [[profit margin]] of that firm. For example, if an HR department was removed then basic employment functions and essential business processes cannot be performed which will affect the firm's profit negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is cost center? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/cost-center|website = SearchCRM|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Management efficiency – Managers compare cost data from different time periods in order to see whether the cost centre is becoming more or less profitable. Generally a specific person (a cost centre manager) is held accountable for costs incurring in the cost centre under his or her control, in which case, collecting and comparing costs may motivate the manager to be more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounting Information for Managers|last = Clarke|first = Peter J.|publisher = Oak Tree Press|year = 2002|isbn = 1 86076 248 4|location = Ireland|pages = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
There are a few drawbacks of cost centre which include:
* Negative effects on other departments - although the cost of operating a specific department is simple to calculate, cost centres are a source of encouragement for managers to underfund their elements so that it can benefit the cost centre, which can have a harmful effect on other departments within the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is cost center? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/cost-center|website = SearchCRM|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hard to monitor efficiency - It is hard to keep a track of how efficient these centres are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SWOT Revision|url = http://www.swotrevision.com/pages/alevel/business/mod1_part10.html|website = www.swotrevision.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Profit can not be controlled- Divisional performance can only be evaluated in terms of cost because profit is not in control of the manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Accounting for non-specialists|last = Gowthorpe|first = Catherine|publisher = Thomson Learning|year = 2005|isbn = 978 1 84480 206 7|location = London|pages = 302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Efficiency and productivity cannot be assessed properly - in a cost centre, the result of a decision is calculated by cost alone; the achievements of the cost centre are not measured in financial terms, therefore it is hard to assess efficiency and productivity properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Accounting|last = Pandey|first = I. M|publisher = Vikas Publishing|year = 1990|isbn = |location = India|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between a cost centre and a profit centre ==
A cost centre adds to a firm's cost whereas a [[profit center|profit centre]] adds to the firm's cost and profit. Furthermore, the main objective of a cost centre is to minimise cost whereas the main objective of a profit centre is to maximise profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cost Accounting|last = Tulsian|first = P C|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2006|isbn = 978 0 07 062043 8|location = Delhi|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Profit centres provide a wider and more general measurement of performance than the cost centre. In cost centre, the manager is only responsible for the cost whereas in a profit centre, the manager is responsible for cost and profit. In situations like this when manager is responsible for both, profit and cost, the contribution of each manager to the goal of the firm becomes easier to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cost Accounting|last = Khan|first = M Y|publisher = McGraw- Hill|year = 2000|isbn = 0 07 040224 8|location = New Delhi|pages = 21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dadja Altenburg-Kohl (2017).jpg|thumb|Dadja Altenburg-Kohl, 2017]]
Prof. MUDr. '''Drahoslava "Dadja" Altenburg-Kohl''' (born 30 May 1949, Prague) is a Czech doctor and entrepreneur who lived and worked in Germany from the 1970s to the 1990s. She is also a philanthropist and patron of the arts; shortly after returning to the Czech Republic, Altenburg-Kohl established the DrAk Foundation and the Museum Montanelli in Prague.

== Medical and business career ==
Altenburg-Kohl studied at the Faculty of Medicine at [[Charles University]] in Prague. In 1972 she emigrated to [[West Germany]] for political reasons, and began working as a doctor at the university clinic in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1973, where she specialized in jaw surgery. In 1980, she opened a private practice in this field. In 1986, she and her husband Edwin Kohl established a pharmaceutical company, Kohlpharma, which later became part of Kohl Medical AG, of which Dr. Altenburg-Kohl has been co-owner and board member since 1993.

Shortly after the 1989 revolution, Altenburg-Kohl founded the Czech-based company Pragofarm, focused on the sale and distribution of medication. Another project in Germany was Assist, founded in 1995, a company involved in providing enteral nutrition and aids for chronically ill patients. Since 1995, she has also been the co-owner of Amigo, which develops games for children and adults. In collaboration with professor [[Michael Melkonian]], head researcher at the Botanical Institute of the [[University of Cologne]], she established Algenion in 2004, a company involved in the use of [[microphytes]]. In 2004, she began to work in both the Czech Republic and Germany. She returned to Prague in 2006, where she lives with her husband [[Daniel Pešta]]. She has four adult children. Altenburg-Kohl has been a member of the advisory board of Munich-based UniCredit Group XX since 2010.

In 2012, Altenburg-Kohl was awarded the title of Professor at Kohlpharma for recognition of her work in the fine arts and relationship between Germany and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kohlpharma.com/de/unternehmen/historie|title=Historie|publisher=Kohlpharama|language=de|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural activities ==
In 2003, Altenburg-Kohl founded the Montanelli Gallery at Neruda 13 in Prague. Six years later, it became the Museum Montanelli. The museum's patron was president [[Václav Havel]], who officially opened the museum in 2009. In 2005, Altenburg-Kohl was elected to the board of the Europäisches Kulturforum in [[Berlin]]. She is also the curator for several joint projects between the Saarländische Galerie in [[Berlin]] and the Czech Republic.

The DrAk Foundation, founded in Prague in 2006, focuses on the fields of culture and medical prevention. The foundation's art collection is administered by the Museum Montanelli. As the museum's curator, Dr. Altenburg-Kohl has participated in monographic and thematic exhibitions and has organized international exchanges with other museums and galleries. The DrAk Foundation also supports theatre ([[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], Divadlo Ungelt), film (''Citizen Havel Is Rolling Barrels''), and cancer prevention (MammaCare manual breast examinations).

In Prague, Dr. Altenburg-Kohl has been a supporter of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]] since 2005. She is a member of the theatre's board and a founder of its Benefactors' Club. She has provided financial support for numerous performances ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Don Giovanni]], the jazz opera ''A Well-Paid Walk'' directed by [[Miloš Forman]], and the ballet ''Causa Carmen''). She also provided a large gift to the National Theatre's ballet ensemble and purchased a concert violin by Mihály Reményi (made in 1909) for the orchestra. In 2009, she helped to restore [[Vojtěch Hynais]]'s theatre curtains and with her husband donated a bronze bust of Václav Havel. In 2013, Altenburg-Kohl's family financed the first phase of restoring the National Theatre's [[lunette]]s by [[Mikoláš Aleš]] and [[František Ženíšek]]. The restoration work is set to last until 2015.

Since 2012, she has appeared on stage as a member of the National Theatre's ballet ensemble during performances of ''Sleeping Beauty''. She has twice been awarded the D Award by the National Theatre's director.

Dr. Altenburg-Kohl received the Trebbia Foundation's European Award for support of culture – 2011 Person of the Year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="553">'''Derivatives law''' is the area of law governing [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]. It is associated with principles of [[contract law]], and practitioners must also have a good understanding of [[insolvency]], netting and set-off, and [[conflict of laws]].

Over-the-counter derivatives are documented under master agreements, the most common of which is the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) Master Agreement.

The '''Donald J. Trump Foundation''' was a New York-based [[private foundation]] founded and chaired by [[Donald Trump]], 45th [[President of the United States]].  

Trump originally created the foundation to his proceeds from his book ''[[Trump: The Art of the Deal]]'' to charitable causes''.''  However Trump stopped contributing personal funds to the foundation in 2008 and instead solicited donations from outsiders.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election campaign]] the foundation's activities came under intense media scrutiny, initially by the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'s'' [[David Fahrenthold]], who went on to win the 2017 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for his investigatory work.  The foundation and its directors have since been accused of committing various ethical and legal violations, including [[self-dealing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=David A.

On June 14, 2018, New York Attorney General [[Barbara Underwood]] filed [[civil suit]] against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children, [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald, Jr.]], [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]], and [[Eric Trump|Eric]], alleging "persistently illegal conduct" with respect to foundation money, accusing them of engaging in campaign finance violations, using foundation money in their self-interest ("self-dealing"), and illegally coordinating donations with Donald Trump's presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/07/new-york-state-opens-tax-probe-into-trump-foundation.html|title=New York State Opens Tax Probe Into Trump Foundation|last=Hartmann|first=Margaret|work=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She ordered the charity dissolved and demanded $2.8 million in restitution and penalties.

On June 18 [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s office announced that the governor would refer the civil case to [[New York State Department of Taxation and Finance|New York's Department of Taxation and Finance]] if it is requested to do so by the AG's office.

On June 14, 2018, the new [[New York Attorney General]] [[Barbara Underwood]] filed a civil lawsuit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's three adult children, [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]], [[Eric Trump|Eric]], and [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr.]], alleging that they had engaged in "extensive unlawful political conduct" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation "as his personal checkbook," to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/nyregion/trump-foundation-tax-investigation-cuomo.html|title=New York Is Said to Open Tax Inquiry Into Trump Foundation|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

=== Purpose and structure ===
Donald Trump established the Donald J.

Until 2017 the [[board of directors]] consisted of Donald Trump, his three adult children, and Trump Organization treasurer/CFO [[Allen Weisselberg]] (although in 2017 Weisselberg claimed to investigators he wasn't even aware he was a board member "at least for the last 10 or 15 years").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ex_6.pdf|title=In the Matter of The Investigation of The Donald J Trump Foundation, Inc., Exhibit 6|last=Schneiderman|first=Eric|date=July 19, 2018|website=ag.ny.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/779101/trump-foundations-treasurer-didnt-know-treasurer-until-investigators-told|title=The Trump Foundation's treasurer didn't know he was treasurer until investigators told him|date=2018-06-14|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/opinion/an-uncharitable-foundation.html?_r=0|title=An Uncharitable Foundation|last=Sugin|first=Linda|date=September 30, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a Trump Organization spokesperson told the [[New York Post|''New York Post'']] that Trump made all decisions regarding the granting of Trump Foundation money.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In the 2018 lawsuit the [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]] alleged that the Foundation's board of directors had not met since 1999.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Like many other private foundations, the foundation conducted no charitable programs of its own. Instead, it granted money to other tax-exempt organizations.&lt;ref name="Tebow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SearchingforEvid"&gt;{{Cite web|authors= David A.

=== Sources of funds ===
Through 2015, Trump contributed $5.5 million to the Trump Foundation while outside donors contributed an additional $9.3 million.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  Trump's final gift to the foundation was $35,000 in 2008.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/12/13/trump-hasnt-contributed-to-his-own-foundation-in-years/|title=Trump hasn't contributed to his own foundation in years|last=Vincent|first=Isabel|last2=Klein|first2=Melissa|date=December 13, 2015|website=New York Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the outside donors to the foundation have done business with Trump or the [[The Trump Organization|Trump Organization]].&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; Several philanthropy experts noted that having a family foundation without any family money is unusual.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt;

The top donors to the foundation from 2004 to 2014 were [[Vince McMahon|Vince]] and [[Linda McMahon]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE).  They jointly donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at [[WrestleMania]] in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing"&gt;{{Cite web|authors=David A. Fahrenthold &amp; Rosalind S.

=== Dissolution ===
In September 2016 the [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]]'s office, which administers the state's [https://charitiesnys.com Charities Bureau], announced it was investigating the Trump Foundation based on its failure to file required forms with the bureau.  One week later the office issued a "Notice of Violation".&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

In December 2016, one month before his inauguration, then [[President-elect of the United States|President-Elect]] Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid "even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President".&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/24/trump-university-shut-down-conflict-of-interest|title=Donald Trump to dissolve his charitable foundation after mounting complaints|last=Jacobs|first=Ben|date=2016-12-24|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2016-12-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]]'s office, however, blocked the dissolution, stating that the foundation "cannot legally dissolve" until its current investigation is completed.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/us/politics/trump-family-conflicts.html|title=Denying Conflict, Trump Family Tries to Resolve Potential Problems|last=Lipton|first=Eric|date=2016-12-24|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-12-25|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2018 the same office filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump Foundation and its board members ordering, among other requirements, that it be shut down and that restitution be made by its board members.  The office also referred possible legal violations to the [[Federal Election Commission]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/392323-new-york-ags-office-trump-foundation-warrants-investigation-by-fec-irs|title=New York AG's office: Trump Foundation warrants investigation by FEC, IRS|last=Jagoda|first=Naomi|date=2018-06-14|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, the New York State Governor's chief counsel announced that [[Andrew Cuomo|Governor Cuomo]] was ready to provide the state's Attorney General's office with the requisite criminal referral in the matter for possible criminal prosecution under state law.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

== Investigations by ''The Washington Post'' and others ==
During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], [[David Fahrenthold]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' initiated an investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving after Trump had held a fundraiser for veterans in January 2016 in lieu of appearing at a televised Republican debate. Trump claimed that the event raised $6,000,000 for veteran's causes, including purportedly $1,000,000 of his own money.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-01-28/skipping-gop-debate-trump-headlines-event-for-veterans|title=Skipping GOP Debate-Trump Headlines Event For Veterans|last=|first=|date=January 28, 2016|website=|publisher=USA Today|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-ever-happened-to-all-that-money-trump-raised-for-the-veterans/2016/03/03/fbafd9a0-e0b2-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html|title=What ever happened to all that money Trump raised for the veterans?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; Fahrenthold began his investigation by attempting to verify the receipt and disbursal of the $6,000,000.   All donations were supposed to have gone into the Trump Foundation and then granted by the foundation to others.  Fahrenthold determined instead that, several months after the rally, the Trump Foundation had yet to disburse funds to any veteran-related charities.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt;  Although some of the funds went directly to causes without passing through the Trump Foundation, Fahrenthold widened his investigation into a larger investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving.&lt;ref name = "Pulitzer" /&gt;

In June 2016, in response to criticism, Trump asserted publicly that he had given approximately $102 million to charitable causes from 2009 through 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-and-the-truth-his-charitable-giving|title=Trump and the Truth: His Charitable Giving|date=2016-09-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a 93-page list of the beneficiaries of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2016/06/29/have-given-more-cash-to-charity-than-donald-trump.html|title=Have You Given More Cash to Charity Than Donald Trump?|date=2016-06-29|newspaper=Fox Business|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent reporting by the ''Post'' and other news organizations found that many of the donations Trump claimed as having made personally over this 5-year period were made by the Trump Foundation, which by 2009, no longer held any money donated by Trump.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Further investigations led to an increasing list of allegations of abuse inside the foundation since its creation.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FahrentholdPainting2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Trump Foundation lacks the certification required for charities that solicit money|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fahrenthold's investigation into the Trump Foundation and Trump's history of personal charitable giving involved hundreds of calls to charities associated with Donald Trump; it was also notable in that he drew heavily on support and investigative help from a large number of his [[Twitter|Twitter followers]] who helped him track down leads on specific charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/13/media/david-fahrenthold-washington-post-donald-trump/index.html|title=The secrets of David Fahrenthold's reporting on the Trump Foundation|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=2016-09-13|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fahrenthold received the 2017 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for his investigations into the Trump Foundation.&lt;ref name="Pulitzer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/david-fahrenthold-wins-pulitzer-prize-2017-winner-finalists/|title=Washington Post's David Fahrenthold wins Pulitzer Prize for coverage of Trump's charitable giving|date=April 10, 2017|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Legal affairs of Donald Trump}}

Accusations against Trump and his foundation include the following:

=== Failure to maintain proper governance ===
In a June 2018 petition filed by the office of the [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]], it was explained that:
{{quote|"...none of the Foundation's expenditures or activities were approved by its Board of Directors.&amp;nbsp; The investigation found that the Board existed in name only: it did not meet after 1999; it did not set policy or criteria for choosing grant recipients; and it did not approve of any grants. Mr. Trump alone made all decisions related to the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-underwood-announces-lawsuit-against-donald-j-trump-foundation-and-its|title=Attorney General Underwood Announces Lawsuit Against Donald J. Trump Foundation And Its Board Of Directors For Extensive And Persistent Violations Of State And Federal Law {{!}} New York State Attorney General|website=ag.ny.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an [https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ex_6.pdf exhibit attached to the filing], Trump Foundation treasurer Allen Weisselberg claimed he hadn't been aware that he treasurer or on the board of the foundation until he was approached by investigators.

=== Solicitation of donations without a license ===
Under New York State law, a not-for-profit foundation must register as a "7A Charitable Organization" if it plans to solicit outside donations in excess of $25,000 in any year.&lt;ref name="licensing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Donald J. Trump Foundation not certified as charity in New York|last=Farenthold|first=David A.|date=September 29, 2016|access-date=September 30, 2016|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump Foundation was initially registered as a private foundation set up solely to receive his own personal donations.  As long as it was registered as a private foundation and not soliciting outside funds, it did not have to file annual audited reports with the New York State Charities Bureau&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt; However, records show that Trump began soliciting donations at least as early as 2004&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt; and possibly as early as 1989.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/trump-files-when-donald-shook-down-mike-tyson-2-million|title=The time Donald Trump tried to shake down Mike Tyson for $2 million|newspaper=Mother Jones|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mishandling of funds raised for veteran's causes ===
In April 2016, [[Fox News]] reported that, more than two months after Trump said he had raised $6 million for military veterans at a pre-[[Iowa caucus]] fundraiser, "most of the organizations targeted to receive the money have gotten less than half of that amount."&lt;ref name="FoxNewsDJTF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/08/veterans-charities-reportedly-receive-fraction-money-raised-by-trump-event.html|title=Veterans' charities reportedly receive fraction of money raised by Trump event|date=April 8, 2016|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around that time, Trump also said he had contributed $1,000,000 of his personal funds.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/30/tomorrow-trump-will-give-more-details-about-his-donations-to-vets-heres-what-we-still-dont-know|title=Trump announced his gifts to veterans. Here's what we learned|date=May 31, 2016|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May, Trump revised his figures downward, saying that $5.6 million had been raised at the event and that he had contributed his $1,000,000 share only the previous week, after the media criticized him.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt; He also provided a list of the beneficiaries of the $5.6 million, although the full amount is further disputed in a lawsuit filed by New York State in 2018, which cites an amount of $2.8 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/veteran-fundraiser.pdf Donald J. Trump veteran fundraiser], Donaldjtrump.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2018_the_people_of_the_stat_v_the_people_of_the_stat_memorandum_9._.pdf|title=MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO RESPONDENTS' MOTION TO DISMISS AND IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF THE VERIFIED PETITION|last=Underwood|first=Barbara|date=October 4, 2018|website=www.ag.ny.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Coordinating foundation grants with Trump's presidential campaign ===
Trump may have used Trump Foundation grants to advance his presidential campaign, in violation of rules barring charities from engaging in political activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/watchdog-group-files-complaint-with-irs-against-trump-foundation.html|title=Watchdog Group Files Complaint With IRS Against Trump Foundation|last=Mak|first=Andrew Desiderio{{!}}Tim|date=August 8, 2016|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trump distributed at least some of the funds publicly at "Donald Trump for President" political rallies, displaying large-size donation checks that included his campaign slogan "[[Make America Great Again]]" or a link to a campaign website.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/137522/trumps-charity-tells-us-lot-business|title=Trump's Charity Tells Us a Lot About His Business|last=Hackney|first=Philip|date=October 6, 2016|website=New Republic|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump Organization CFO Allen Weissberg testified in an October 2017 [https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ex_6.pdf deposition] that he witnessed Donald Trump's campaign staff coordinate with Trump to use the Iowa fundraiser to benefit the campaign.   In 2018, [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Barbara Underwood]] alleged in a larger suit against the foundation that Trump, in using the foundation to promote his campaign during and after the Iowa fundraiser, had violated charities laws.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt;

=== Grants to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library ===
In each of 1995 and 1999, the Trump Foundation granted $50,000 to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library.  A 2001 report by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' stated, after visiting the museum in [[East Harlem]], that the facility had "next to no art" and no official connection to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]], despite having had a 10-year track record of soliciting large-scale donations for its collection.  The ''Voice'' and, later, ''The Washington Post'', concluded that Trump may have directed the grants to the museum to curry favor with the museum's then chairman, Eddie Malloy, who was also head of the [[Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York]]. The Council had worked on behalf of one of the unions of workers who worked on Trump construction projects.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html|title=Trump boasts about his philanthropy.

=== Failure to make pledged 9/11 donations ===
An investigation by the [[New York City Comptroller]]'s office in October 2016 showed that Trump and/or the Donald Trump Foundation may have failed to honor at least one pledge to charities established to provide relief for victims of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]]. Trump had made a pledge of $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in late September 2001.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-lied-donating-9-11-charities-article-1.2829908|title=Donald Trump may have lied about donating to 9/11 charities|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Twin Towers Fund, later administered as part of the New York City Public and Private Initiative, was created by then-[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] "to benefit the families of firefighters and police officers who died in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/nyregion/costs-of-twin-towers-fund-draws-criticism.html|title=Costs of Twin Towers Fund Draws Criticism|last=Herszenhorn|first=David M.|date=February 9, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], Giuliani announced that Trump had made unspecified "anonymous" donations after the Sep 11 attacks, although such donations have not been identified.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Giuliani also said, in support of Trump's candidacy, "Every time New York City suffered a tragedy Donald Trump was there to help,.... He's not going to like my telling you this but he did it anonymously."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The New York City Comptroller's office told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' it had manually reviewed "approximately 1,500 pages of donor records of the Twin Towers Fund and the related entity NYC Public/Private Initiatives Inc., containing the names of more than 110,000 individuals and entities that were collected as part of the audits" through August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nyc-audit-finds-donald-trump-donations-911-months/story?id=42801444|title=Despite 2001 Vow, Trump Made No 9/11 Donations in Year After Attack, Audit Finds|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=ABC News|access-date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''News'', Comptroller [[Scott Stringer]] "found that Trump and [the Trump Foundation] hadn't donated a dime in the months after 9/11"; however, because the reviewed period only covered one year after the attacks, the Comptroller's office was "unable to conclude definitively" that Trump never gave to the fund after August 2002.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  According to its [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] [[Form 990]] tax filings, the Trump Foundation made no grants to the Twin Towers Fund or to NYC Public/Private Initiatives, Inc. from 2002 through 2014, although Trump may have made personal donations after August 2002 that would not have shown up in these filings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2016, after the convention, Trump's campaign suggested that the Trump Foundation made a grant to the [[American Red Cross]] after the attacks; however no record of this exists in the foundation's tax filings from 2001 through 2014.  As with the Twin Towers Fund, if Trump instead had made a personal donation, it would not have shown up in the foundation's records.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Using Trump Foundation money to settle Trump Organization legal disputes===
Trump may have used foundation money to settle his personal or business legal disputes on at least two occasions.

In 2007, Trump used Trump Foundation funds to settle a 2006 legal dispute between the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Town of Palm Beach]], [[Florida]], and Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] country club. The town said that the club's flagpole violated town height limit rules and levied a daily accruing fine against the club. The club's flagpole was 80 feet tall, 38 feet above limits imposed by the town.  Palm Beach began fining Trump $1,250 per day for the violation.  Trump countersued Palm Beach for $25 million on US constitutional grounds for restricting his 1st amendment rights of free speech and his 14th amendment rights of equal protection.  The suit alleged that at least 20 other properties had violated the height restrictions but were not similarly fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-04-24/news/0704240036_1_mar-a-lago-american-flag-flagpole|title=Trump settles dispute over flag|newspaper=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also alleged that a shorter flagpole "would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump's…patriotism."&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-files-how-donald-drove-palm-beach-nuts-american-flag|title=The Trump Files: How Donald drove Palm Beach nuts with an American flag|newspaper=Mother Jones|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump eventually reached a legal settlement with Palm Beach after, according to the ''[[Sun-Sentinel|Sun Sentinel]],'' "secret, court-ordered negotiations."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Settlement documents show that Trump, in return for discharging the club's obligations to Palm Beach, had agreed to personally donate $100,000 to [[Fisher House Foundation|Fischer House]], a charity benefitting veterans and military families. However, Trump then made the grant using foundation money, not his own.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Trump's foundation paid $158,000 to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation as a settlement of a lawsuit brought by Greenberg against the [[Trump National Golf Club Westchester]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. Greenberg alleged that he had rightfully won a $1 million prize for scoring a [[hole-in-one]] in a 2010 charity golf tournament at the club.  But the club denied the award on technical grounds, arguing that the hole was shorter than the required 150 yards.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; Martin Greenberg sued and a settlement was reached at a significantly reduced amount. ''The Washington Post'' reported that "on the day that Trump and the other parties told the court that they had settled the case, the Donald J. Trump Foundation made its first and only grant to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation, for $158,000."&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt;  In September 2016, the ''Post'' reported that the grant was directly linked to the legal settlement, likely violating IRS self-dealing rules by using charitable funds to pay Trump's personal or business obligations.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html|title=Trump used $258,000 from his charity to settle legal problems|last=Farenthold|first=David A.|date=September 20, 2016|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To raise the money needed to make the settlement, the Trump Foundation auctioned a prize of lifetime golf membership at Trump-owned golf courses, with the winning bid bringing a $157,000 donation to the Trump Foundation to the foundation to offset the payment to the Greenberg Foundation.&lt;ref name="Self-Dealing"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/28/495782978/journalist-says-trump-foundation-may-have-engaged-in-self-dealing|title=Journalist Says Trump Foundation May Have Engaged In 'Self-Dealing'|website=NPR.org|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the auction may have believed he was donating to Trump Foundation charitable causes.&lt;ref name="Self-Dealing" /&gt;

According to the Trump Foundation's publicly available tax returns, Trump National Golf Club Westchester paid over $200,000 to the Trump Foundation in 2016, with $158,000 of the funds designated as repayment of the foundation funds used toward the Martin B . Greenberg settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-golf-course-reimbursed-president-trumps-charity-amid-ongoing-investigation-into-the-foundation/2017/11/20/5e7ff63c-ce05-11e7-81bc-c55a220c8cbe_story.html|title=Trump golf course reimbursed President Trump's charity amid ongoing investigation into the foundation|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|date=2017-11-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi ===
In 2013, the Trump Foundation donated $25,000 in support of [[Florida Attorney General]] [[Pam Bondi]]'s election campaign while Bondi's office was reviewing fraud allegations against [[Trump University]], a for-profit real estate program created by Donald Trump.&lt;ref name="WaPoPenalty"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/|title=Trump pays IRS a penalty for his foundation violating rules with gift to aid Florida attorney general|date=September 1, 2016|website=Washington Post|author=David A. Fahrenthold}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around that time Trump also hosted a fundraiser for Bondi at his Mar-a-Lago resort at a fee well below his normal market rate.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-files-criminal-bribery-complaint-donald-trump-pam-bondi/|title=CREW Files Criminal Bribery Complaint Against Donald Trump &amp; Pam Bondi – CREW|newspaper=CREW|language=en-US|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bondi's office later ended the investigation without bringing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/us/politics/donald-trump-pam-bondi.html|title=Donald Trump's Donation Is His Latest Brush With Campaign Fund Rules|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=September 6, 2016|last2=Twohey|first2=Megan|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Trump Foundation attorney, "the [$25,000] contribution was made in error due to a case of mistaken identity of organizations with the same name." Trump later personally reimbursed his foundation for the $25,000. The foundation paid a $2,500 fine for violating IRS rules against political contributions by charitable organizations.&lt;ref name="WaPoPenalty" /&gt; In 2016 New York Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] stated publicly that the Trump Foundation was the subject of an ongoing investigation by his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html|title=State Attorney General Orders Trump Foundation to Cease Raising Money in New York|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=2016-10-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), a not-for-profit watchdog group, filed a complaint with the IRS (see below).  It also cast doubt on Trump's story after obtaining a letter from the Trump Foundation's attorney to the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office.  "We're past the point where a reasonable person could believe this is just a never-ending series of once in a lifetime errors," said CREW Communications Director Jordan Libowitz. "This may not be anything nefarious, but if it isn't, that would mean that the Trump operation is completely inept when it comes to running the Trump Foundation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/trump-foundations-got-problems-taxes/|title=The Trump Foundation's Got Problems with Its Taxes.

On October 5, 2016, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported details of how Trump had on several other occasions since as early as the 1980s made campaign donations to various US state attorneys general while they had been reviewing cases involving the Trump Organization or Trump personally, although the Bondi case is the only one it cited as having involved Trump Foundation money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-often-made-donations-to-state-attorneys-general-reviewing-his-business-1475689963|title=Donald Trump Often Made Donations to State Attorneys General Reviewing His Business|last=Rothfeld|first=Michael|date=October 5, 2016|last2=Berzon|first2=Alexandra|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grants allegedly made for political purposes ===

Trump paid $100,000 of Trump Foundation funds in 2012 to [[Franklin Graham|Reverend Franklin Graham]]'s [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|Billy Graham Evangelical Association]]. [[NBC News]] has called Graham "an early ally" of Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-foundation-wrote-many-checks-path-nomination-n659811|title=Trump's foundation wrote many checks on path to nomination|publisher=NBC News|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The more you listen to him, the more you say to yourself, 'You know, maybe the guy's right,'" Graham had told [[ABC News]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In October 2016 Graham revealed to the ''[[The Charlotte Observer|Charlotte Observer]]'' that, in 2012, he had instructed Trump to make the $100,000 donation and that the money was used to pay for full page ads urging voters to support candidates in the [[2012 Presidential election|2012 presidential election]] who supported "biblical values".  The ''Observer'' has suggested the timing and tone of the ads indicate they were placed in support of [[Mitt Romney]]'s campaign.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/religion/article108054712.html|title=Franklin Graham praises McCrory, blames Charlotte for HB2-related disruption|newspaper=Charlotte Observer|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham also heads [[Boone, North Carolina]]-based [[Samaritan's Purse]], a Christian relief agency that received $25,000 from the Trump Foundation in 2012.  Graham credits then-[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] anchor [[Greta Van Susteren]] for soliciting the $25,000 donation from Trump.  Van Susteren and her TV crew had accompanied Graham on Samaritan's Purse trips to Haiti and North Korea.  The ''Charlotte Observer'' quoted Graham saying "[Trump] was on her show, and [Van Susteren] said, 'I was just in Haiti and Samaritan's Purse is doing this down there, and Donald, you need to help.' He sent a check out."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 2016, several media outlets alleged that Van Susteren had been producing overtly pro-Trump reports on her Fox News show [[On the Record (Fox News TV series)|''On the Record'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediamatters.org/research/2016/05/26/media-figures-mock-greta-van-susterens-hour-long-trump-infomercial/210608|title=Media Figures Mock Greta Van Susteren's Hour-Long Trump Infomercial|date=May 26, 2016|publisher=Media Matters for America|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Trump Foundation made a $100,000 grant to the [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United Foundation]], a charitable foundation closely related to [[David Bossie]]'s conservative group, [[Citizens United]].  At the time Citizens United was engaged in a lawsuit against [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]], whose office was pursuing a civil lawsuit against [[Trump University]]. It was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-charity-gave-100000-to-david-bossies-citizens-united-that-helped-fund-lawsuit-against-moguls-foe-151337835.html|title=Trump charity gave $100,000 to David Bossie's Citizens United that helped fund lawsuit against mogul's foe|date=September 9, 2016|author=[[Michael Isikoff]]|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderman's office called the grant part of a "vendetta" by Trump, while Citizens United rejected any connection between the grant and its own lawsuit against Schneiderman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/295178-trump-foundation-gave-100k-to-conservative-group-suing-ny|title=Trump Foundation gave $100K to conservative group suing NY attorney general: report|last=Smilowitz|first=Elliot|date=September 9, 2016|newspaper=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump Foundation's 2014 tax filing&lt;ref name="Search Results: Donald J Trump Foundation Inc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.charitiesnys.com/RegistrySearch/show_details.jsp?id=%7B412967CE-87D6-4FAF-A0E2-58CF382F8F53%7D|title=Charities Database|website=CharitiesNYS.com|publisher=New York State Office of the Attorney General|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; misidentified Citizens United as a public charity (501(c)(3)) when it is in fact a social welfare organization (501(c)(4)).

The Trump Foundation donated a total of $40,000 from 2011 through 2013 to the [[Drumthwacket]] Foundation, a charitable organization formed to pay for renovation and historical preservation of the New Jersey governor's mansion of the same name.  In 2011, Trump was seeking to acquire permits to build a personal cemetery on the fairway at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/donald_trump_death_burial.html|title=Donald Trump looks to spend eternity in N.J. as real estate mogul seeks private cemetery|newspaper=NJ.com|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have needed political help in obtaining approval for the permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/21/chris-christie-drumthwacket_n_4826459.html|title=Christie's Mansion Fund Collected Millions From Political Favor Seekers|last=Reporter|first=Christina Wilkie National|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=February 21, 2014|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump directed $100,000 of Trump Foundation money toward the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|National September 11 Memorial Museum]] days before the 2016 New York State Republican presidential primary, where he was on the ballot, mischaracterizing the foundation grant as a personal donation.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-publication-526|title=Publication 526, Charitable Contributions|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-charity-donations/|title=Searching for evidence of Trump's personal giving|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the Trump Foundation granted $10,000 to [[Project Veritas]], a charity run by conservative filmmaker [[James O'Keefe]]. In October 2016, O'Keefe released video which purportedly reveals how Democrats incited violence at Trump rallies.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web |last=Caldwell |first=Leigh Ann |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-foundation-paid-activist-filmmaker-james-o-keefe-n670381 |title=Trump Foundation Paid Activist Filmmaker James O'Keefe |work=NBC News |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the third [[2016 presidential debates|2016 presidential debate]], Trump claimed that new videos produced by O'Keefe and released that week proved that [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] had "hired people" and "paid them $1,500" to "be violent, cause fights, [and] do bad things" at Trump rallies.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://thinkprogress.org/trump-funded-james-okeefe-53015c2f44b6#.rpq0977jf |title=Trump used his foundation to fund guerrilla filmmaker James O'Keefe |last=Israel |first=Josh |date=October 20, 2016 |newspaper=ThinkProgress |access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Democratic National Committee]] spokesman noted Trump's donation after Project Veritas released another video on the 2016 presidential election.

Trump may have strategically directed money from the Trump Foundation to support his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article105849807.html|title=Trump used charity dollars for presidential campaign, report says|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, the grants were used specifically to pay for newspaper ads.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; In October 2016 ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'' reported that Trump directed significant amounts of foundation money to conservative organizations, possibly in return for political support and access.  The news organization found that, from 2011 through 2014, Trump had "harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups.... In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president." At least two of the groups are based in Republican-leaning early [[Presidential Primary|presidential primary]] states.&lt;ref name="RealClear"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/10/04/trump_used_foundation_funds_for_2016_run_filings_suggest.html|title=Trump Used Foundation Funds for 2016 Run, Filings Suggest|last=Berg|first=Rebecca|date=October 4, 2016|access-date=October 4, 2016|work=RealClearPolitics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Citizens United (above), groups include Iowa's [[The Family Leader]], the South Carolina Palmetto Family Council, the [[American Conservative Union]], and the American Spectator Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-foundation-wrote-many-checks-path-nomination-n659811|title=Trump's foundation wrote many checks on path to nomination|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zurcher"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37369515|title=What's the deal with the Trump Foundation?|last=Zurcher|first=Anthony|date=October 4, 2016|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's granting of foundation money to these groups could have violated the law, if it was in return for his personal right to speak or gain access to networking events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/10/04/cracks-in-the-donald-j-trump-foundation-report-alleges-he-self-dealt-funds-to-buy-conservative-favor/|title=Cracks in the Donald J.

* The Trump Foundation's grant of $10,000 in 2013 to [[The Family Leader]] may have led to a speaking engagement for Trump.  The Family Leader is an Iowa-based organization whose stated mission is to "strengthen families, by inspiring Christ-like leadership in the home, the church, and the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefamilyleader.com/our-mission-beliefs/|title=Our mission and beliefs|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2016|website=The Family Leader|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the grant, the group's leader, Vader Plaats, invited Trump to speak at i's leadership summit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These grants may also have been illegal because The Family Leader is a 501(c)(4) corporation established to "develop, advocate and support legislative agenda at the state level" and not a charity. The Trump Foundation is prohibited from donating money for non-charity purposes. However, Trump may have intended to make a grant to The Family Leader's affiliated foundation, The Family Leader Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation.&lt;ref name="RealClear" /&gt;
* Trump was invited to speak at the [[American Conservative Union]]'s [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] ("CPAC") in 2013 after directing $50,000 of Trump Foundation money to the organization. Also in 2013, Trump was invited to speak to the Economic Club of Washington after the Trump Foundation made a grant there.&lt;ref name="RealClear" /&gt;

=== Partial payment of an assessment owed by the Plaza Hotel ===
In 1989, the Trump Foundation paid more than half of a "voluntary assessment" imposed on the [[Plaza Hotel]] by the [[Central Park Conservancy]].  The hotel was owned by the Trump Organization at the time and the assessment was for the renovation of the severely dilapidated [[Pulitzer Fountain]] at [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]], which directly faced the hotel.  Toward the $500,000 assessment, the foundation granted $264,631 to the Conservancy while the Trump Organization paid between $100,000 and $250,000.  The grant to the Conservancy was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation from inception through at least 2015.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

=== Purchasing goods and services for personal or business benefit with foundation money ===

On two occasions, Trump used the Foundation's money to purchase artists' portraits of himself.
* In November 2007, Trump spent $10,000 in Trump Foundation funds to purchase a {{convert|6|ft|m}}-tall portrait of himself by artist Michael Israel at a benefit for a Florida charity, the [http://www.homesafeinc.org/home_page.aspx Children's Place at Homespace], held at his [[Mar-a-Lago]] country club in Florida after his wife [[Melania Trump]] made the highest bid.&lt;ref name="FahrentholdPainting2"&gt;David A.

* In 2014, at a charity for the Unicorn Children's Foundation, held at his [[Mar-a-Lago]] resort, Trump purchased a {{convert|4|ft|m}}-tall painting of a 1990s version of himself by Argentine artist [[Havi Schanz]], paying for it with $20,000 of Trump Foundation funds.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; A photo of the portrait was found on a [[TripAdvisor]] review of [[Trump National Doral Miami]] and, later, a reporter for [[Univision]] went to the club, asked various staff about the painting, and eventually discovered it hanging on a wall at the golf resort's Champions Bar &amp; Grill restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/how-i-found-trumps-controversial-10-000-portrait|title=How I found Trump's controversial $10,000 portrait.|last=Acevedo|first=Enrique|date=September 21, 2016|publisher=[[Univision]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] spokesperson [[Boris Epshteyn]] explained to [[MSNBC]] that Trump's use of the painting at Trump's Champion Bar &amp; Grill was not only proper but beneficial to the foundation based on IRS rules that allow individuals to store items "on behalf of the foundation – in order to help with storage costs" and that its use at the restaurant is "absolutely proper" in that Trump was "doing his foundation a favor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/27/trump-is-actually-doing-his-foundation-a-favor-by-storing-its-portrait-his-golf-resort-wall-his-adviser-says/|title=Trump is actually doing his foundation a favor, by 'storing' its portrait on his golf resort wall, his adviser says|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 at a charity auction, hosted at his [[Mar-a-Lago|Mar-a-lago]] club, to purchase an [[National Football League|NFL]] football helmet autographed by [[Tim Tebow]] and a Tebow football jersey. Trump was given credit for generosity in newspaper accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/komen-for-the-cure-perfect-pink-party-draws-hundre/nMFRJ/|title=Komen for the Cure Perfect Pink party draws hundreds, raises more than $1M|last=Donnelly|first=Shannon|date=January 21, 2012|work=Palm Beach Daily News|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the purchase was made with $12,000 of foundation money, not his own. The current whereabouts of the helmet and jersey are unknown. Tax law experts say if Trump kept them, the purchase might have violated the self-dealing rule, which bans private foundations from "the furnishing of goods" to their own officers.&lt;ref name="Tebow"/&gt;

In 2008 Trump used $107,000 of Trump Foundation funds to purchase a luxury trip to Paris, including a meeting with actress [[Salma Hayek]], at a charity auction for the Gucci Foundation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

In 2013 the Trump Foundation made a $5,000 grant to the non-profit D.C. Preservation League.  According to ''The Washington Post'', the nonprofit's support was helpful to the Trump Organization in obtaining the rights to convert [[Washington, D.C.]]'s historic [[Old Post Office Pavilion]] into the Trump International Hotel. In acknowledgment of the donation, the Trump Foundation received ads in the event programs; the ads promoted Trump's hotels rather than the foundation, in possible violation of IRS self-dealing rules.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;

''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'' has suggested that Trump benefited personally when the Trump Foundation made grants totaling $20,000 during 2012 through 2014 in return for band and choir performances held at his resorts.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extracredit.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/10/20/high-school-bands-performed-at-donald-trumps-businesses-then-his-foundation-cut-them-checks/|title=School bands play at Trump's businesses, and his charity writes checks {{!}} Extra Credit|last=Marra|first=Andrew|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diverting business or personal income to the foundation as donations ===
Trump may have directed income owed to him personally to be sent to the foundation instead, in possible violation of tax rules. ''The Washington Post'' reported in September 2016 that Donald Trump had directed that $2.3 million owed to him and his organization by various people and organizations should be paid instead to his foundation as donations, possibly evading personal income taxes.&lt;ref name=WaPoDirected&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-directed-23-million-owed-to-him-to-his-charity-instead/2016/09/26/7a9e9fac-8352-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Trump directed $2.3 million owed to him to his tax-exempt foundation instead|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Post'' found old ''[[Associated Press]]'' coverage showing that Trump may have started directing income to the Trump Foundation as early as 1989. IRS rules prohibit individuals from diverting taxable income owed to them toward charities if they benefit directly from those charities, unless the individual declares the income on his personal tax forms.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;  Since Trump had yet to release his personal income taxes at that time, the ''Post'' was unable to confirm if the income was declared for any of the donations received.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;

The Trump Foundation received at least $1.9 million from ticket broker Richard Ebbers. Richard Ebers had bought goods and services, including tickets, from "Trump or his businesses"; he was allegedly instructed to make payment for them to the Trump Foundation in the form of charitable contributions instead of as income for the Trump organization.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;

The Trump Foundation received a total of $5,000,000 in donations from [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] owner [[Vince McMahon]] and his wife [[Linda McMahon]] from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt; Trump appeared twice in [[WrestleMania]] events, in 2007 and again in 2009. One donation to the foundation was $4 million in 2007; the second was $1 million in 2009. The WWE later told [[The Huffington Post]] that "during this period of time, WWE paid Donald Trump appearance fees separately," and "separately, [WWE chief executives] Vince and Linda McMahon made personal donations to Donald Trump's foundation."&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

In 2007, the Celebrity Fight Night Foundation hosted a fundraiser to benefit the [[Muhammad Ali Center|Muhammad Ali Parkinson's Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].  According to a Celebrity Fight Night Foundation spokesperson, in return for Trump's appearance and his offering a New York-based dinner with himself at auction, Trump stipulated that the Parkinson's charity share the total auction proceeds with the Trump Foundation.  The Trump Foundation subsequently received $150,000 of auction proceeds that would otherwise have gone to the center benefitting [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's Disease]] research.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Other donations made to the Trump Foundation that may have been in return for Trump's personal work include:
* $400,000 from [[Comedy Central]] as payment for Trump's attendance at a [[Roast (comedy)|celebrity roast]] in his honor.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;
* $150,000 from [[People (magazine)|''People Magazine'']]  in return for exclusive photos of Trump's son, Barron Trump.&lt;ref name="Zurcher" /&gt;
* $500,000 from [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] in 2012 while the network was airing Trump's show, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/donald-trump-foundation-charity/index.html|title=Trump hasn't donated to his own charity since 2008|last=CNN|first=Curt Devine, David Fitzpatrick and Drew Griffin|website=CNN|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* $100,000 from the family of Donna Clancy, whose family law office had been renting space at the Trump Organization's [[40 Wall Street]] building.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-foundation-charity_us_56aa90bae4b00b033aae659f|title=Donald Trump Says He Can't Be Bought.

* $100,000 in 2005 for work by Trump's wife [[Melania Trump]] for [[Norwegian Cruise Line]]s for a segment that was later included in Trump's show, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.  A spokeswoman for the company confirmed that the appearance fee to Melania was paid in the form of a donation to the Trump Foundation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Granting money to charities that rented Trump Organization facilities ===
Trump has been accused of directing foundation money toward several charities that in turn paid the Trump Organization to host charity events at Trump-owned hotels and golf clubs.&lt;ref name="Self-Dealing" /&gt; High-profile charity events at [[Mar-a-Lago]] cost as much as $300,000.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/bedb4164bc9e48d190f112f7d83907a5#|title=Charities thinking twice about galas at Trump's Mar-a-Lago|newspaper=The Big Story|language=en-US|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples:
* In 2010, Trump was personally honored for his support by the Palm Beach Police Foundation after the Trump Foundation donated to the charity $150,000 during the period of 2009–2010.&lt;ref name="Retooled"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-retooled-his-charity-to-spend-other-peoples-money/2016/09/10/da8cce64-75df-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html|title=How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people's money|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the police foundation's public tax records, Palm Beach Police Foundation paid the Trump Organization $276,463 in rent in 2014 for its "Police Ball and Auction"&lt;ref name="PBPF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizenaudit.org/organization/830462654/palm-beach-police-foundation-inc/|publisher=Citizen's Audit|title=Palm Beach Police Foundation tax records Form 990 2014|last=|first=|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago hotel.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt;  The 2014 tax form also lists $44,332 in unattributed "direct expenses" paid by the police foundation for the same event as well as $36,608 in "direct expenses" for its annual "Golf Classic", which the police foundation holds annually at a Trump Organization-owned golf course.&lt;ref name="PBPF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpolicefoundation.org/golf-tournament|title=Golf Classic|date=|publisher=Palm Beach Police Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each of the four years prior to 2014, the police foundation's public tax records show significant "direct expenses" incurred for both the Police Ball and Auction and the golf tournament, although expense categories are not cited in the filings.&lt;ref name="PBPF" /&gt;
* In 2013, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Trump donated $10,000 to the [[V Foundation]], a cancer-fighting group founded by former basketball coach [[Jim Valvano]], in return for the V Foundation holding a fundraiser at his [[Trump Winery]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing"/&gt;
* The [[Dana–Farber Cancer Institute|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] paid the Trump Organization substantial fees to hold annual events at [[Mar-a-Lago|Mar-A-Lago]].  The Trump Foundation in turn granted to the Institute a total of $85,000 for 2006 and 2007, among other grants in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;''The Foundation Directory, 2009 Edition'', p. 7170 (David G. Jacobs, Senior Editor).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;''The Foundation Directory, 2010 Edition'', p. 7129 (David G. Jacobs, Senior Editor).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump taking personal credit for donations made using foundation money===
''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[Fox News]] reported that Trump has repeatedly claimed in public, beginning in 2015, to have made over "$102 million" in charitable donations "in the past five years". The Trump Organization provided journalists with a 93-page list of the donations.  None of the cash donations were confirmed to come from Trump himself; many were actually grants from the Trump Foundation,&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/a-94-page-list-of-donald-trumps-charitable-contributions-from-the-last-five-years/2013/|title=A 93-page list of Donald Trump's charitable contributions from the last five years|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2016/06/29/have-you-given-more-cash-to-charity-than-donald-trump/|title=Have you given more to charity than Donald Trump?|date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which no longer contained any of Trump's own money.

For example, Trump took personal credit and was honored for a Trump Foundation grant to the Palm Beach Police Foundation that was actually from an outside source (see above). He had pledged the money personally, and then the Trump Foundation solicited the $150,000 earmarked for the police foundation from an unrelated philanthropic organization, the Charles Evans Foundation.  The Trump Foundation then paid the $150,000 to the Palm Beach charity.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt; The police then honored Trump personally with its annual Palm Tree Award at Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] hotel at its annual fundraiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpolicefoundation.org/palm-tree-award|title=Palm Tree Award |publisher=Palm Beach Police Foundation|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Washington Post'' wrote that "Trump had effectively turned the Evans Foundation's gifts into his own gifts, without adding any money of his own."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37547094 |title=End NY fundraising, Trump foundation told |date=October 4, 2016 |work=BBC News |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dana–Farber Cancer Institute|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] has honored Trump variously as "Grand Benefactor" and "Grand Honorary Chair" at its annual fundraisers held at Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate.  Trump may have also earned more money on the event fees it received from the institute than the Trump Foundation paid to the institute in grants.  Trump has directed at least $300,000 of grants of the Trump Foundation money to Dana-Farber since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/29/dana-farber-trump/|title=How Trump was named 'Grand Benefactor' for a Dana-Farber gala without donating a penny|date=September 29, 2016|website=STAT|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump received highly visible praise for his personal generosity on his prime-time television show ''[[The Apprentice (US TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' on multiple occasions.  Trump had frequently offered to make generous donations to his contestants' charities, but records show that he ultimately either directed the Trump Foundation to make a grant, or instead had the show's network, [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]], make the donation instead.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; Examples include:
* A 2008 episode where Trump told contestant and mixed-martial arts star [[Tito Ortiz]]: "I think you're so incredible that — personally, out of my own account — I'm going to give you $50,000 for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude's]] [children's hospital]," Ortiz's chosen charity and also a favorite named charity of Trump's son, [[Eric Trump|Eric]].  Trump then had the Trump Foundation make a $50,000 grant to St Jude's.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-personal-gifts-on-celebrity-apprentice-heres-who-really-paid/2016/08/18/b8d087b4-5d9a-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html|title=Trump promised personal gifts on 'Celebrity Apprentice.' Here's who really paid.|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012 Trump promised at least six personal donations of $10,000 each to contestants' chosen charities during one episode of ''[[The Apprentice (US TV series)|Celebrity Apprentice]]''. In another episode of the same season, he pledged $10,000 to contestant [[Aubrey O'Day]]'s chosen charity, a gift "that moved [contestant and comedienne Lisa] [[Lisa Lampanelli|Lampanelli]] to tears."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  According to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s review of tax filings, Trump directed all of this money to be granted to the charities out of Trump Foundation funds.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* In 2013 Trump promised personal donations of $20,000 each to the charities of basketball star [[Dennis Rodman]], singer [[La Toya Jackson]], former [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Brande Roderick]], and actor [[Gary Busey]] during episodes of the ''Celebrity Apprentice.''  Trump then used Trump Foundation money to make the payments.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  "Remember, Donald Trump is a very nice person, okay?" he told them.  According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter, who reviewed transcripts of the show, by 2013 "contestants had come to expect these gifts — and even to demand them, when Trump didn't offer money on his own."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* A gift to Starkey Hearing Foundation, a charity chosen by actress [[Marlee Matlin]].  Trump was credited with a personal donation of at least $14,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hearingreview.com/2011/04/marlee-matlin-raises-986000-for-the-starkey-hearing-foundation/|title=Marlee Matlin Raises $986,000 for the Starkey Hearing Foundation – Hearing Review|newspaper=Hearing Review|language=en-US|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the donation came from the Trump Foundation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Other alleged examples include:
* Trump using foundation money to pay the personal bills of a viewer of the TV show [[Extra (U.S. TV program)|''Extra'']].  In 2009 he appeared on the show and promised that he would pay a struggling viewer's domestic bills. "This is really a bad time for a lot of people," Trump said as the contest was announced.  Trump eventually paid the winner with Trump Foundation money.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; A Trump representative later explained that the grant was legal because the winner qualified as an "indigent" individual under [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 4945(d)(3), a contention at least one tax expert has disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/05/01/donald-trump-turns-extra-contest-winner-into-charitable-contribution|title=Donald Trump Gave Himself Tax Break for Helping Contest Winner|date=2011-05-01|website=Showbiz411|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trump being honored with a chair and plaque in his personal name at the [[Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts]] after the Trump Foundation donated $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/05/the-monuments-to-donald-trumps-charitable-giving-a-chair-a-bench-and-now-another-chair/|title=The monuments to Donald Trump's charitable giving: A chair. A bench. And now….another chair.|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trump taking personal credit for a $25,000 grant from the Trump Foundation at a speech honoring slain journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] in 2014.  At the time, the ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'' published an article titled ''Trump leads tribute for slain journalist James Foley.''  Foley was posthumously awarded the 12th annual Nackey S. Loeb First Amendment Award, "given annually to New Hampshire organizations or residents who protect or exemplify the liberties listed in the First Amendment to the Constitution."  Trump was the "featured speaker of the event."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20141112/NEWS040201/141119641|title=Trump leads tribute for slain journalist James Foley {{!}} New Hampshire|newspaper=UnionLeader.com|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trump receiving personal praise for a $100,000 Trump Foundation grant in 2016 to the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|National September 11 Memorial Museum]] ahead of the 2016 New York State Republican Primary (above).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Making grants to other private foundations without fulfilling IRS "expenditure responsibility" rules ===
The Trump Foundation is responsible by law for ensuring that any grant it makes to another private foundation is used strictly for charitable purposes. To fulfill this [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] "expenditure responsibility" the foundation is required to attach "full and detailed" reports describing the use of the grant money to its IRS 990 tax return for each year a grant to a private foundation is made.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc26.com/news/national/democracy-2016/exclusive-trumps-private-foundation-violates-irs-rules-experts-say|title=Exclusive: Trump's private foundation violates IRS rules, experts say|last=Greenblatt|first=Mark|date=October 20, 2016|newspaper=WGBA|language=en-US|access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trump Foundation tax returns show that it failed to do this for all of the 20 grants it made to private foundations during the period of 2005 through 2014. Such grants in this period, which total at least $488,500, could be subject to significant fines and penalties.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4945|title=Cornell Law School|last=|first=|date=October 20, 2016|website=www.law.cornell.edu|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Receiving donation from Ukrainian oligarch during campaign for President ===
In 2015 Ukrainian Victor Pichkun made a $150,000 donation to the Trump Foundation in return for Trump's appearance by video conference link at the Yalta European Strategy Conference.  The appearance was broadcast on a large screen and lasted only 20 minutes, including delays caused by translation and by technical difficulties.  Pichkun is the son-in-law of former Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kuchma|Lionid Kuchma]]. In 2018 the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reported that the office of [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Special Counsel]] Robert Mueller was investigating the donation as a possible illegal in-kind campaign contribution from a foreign national intended to curry favor with then-candidate Trump.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/trump-mueller-ukraine-victor-pinchuk.html|title=Mueller Investigating Ukrainian's $150,000 Payment for a Trump Appearance|date=2018-04-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/mueller-reportedly-investigating-usd150-000-trump-foundation-payment-by-ukrainian-billionaire-during-campaign.html|title=Mueller Reportedly Investigating $150,000 Payment to Trump Foundation by Ukrainian Billionaire During Campaign|last=Hannon|first=Elliot|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal actions and closure ==
=== Intended dissolution of the Trump Foundation ===
In September and October 2016 there were several legal actions and complaints filed against the Trump Foundation. Former head of the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service's]] Office of Exempt Organizations Division Marc Owens told ''The Washington Post'' regarding the various allegations against the foundation: "This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues.... It's the first time I've ever seen this, and I've been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total."&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt; 

In late December 2016, one month before his inauguration, Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid "even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; However, a spokesperson from the New York State Attorney General's office told the ''New York Time''s, the same month, that the foundation "cannot legally dissolve" until its current investigation is completed.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

On September 13, 2016, [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]] announced that his office was investigating the foundation "to make sure it's complying with the laws governing charities in New York."&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/eric-schneiderman-donald-trump-foundation/|title=NY attorney general is investigating Trump Foundation practices|date=September 14, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/14/donald-trump-foundation/|title=Trump Foundation Falls Under Investigation By New York Attorney General|date=September 14, 2016|website=Fortune|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office had previously filed charges—at that time awaiting trial—against the Trump Organization's [[Trump University]]. [[Jason Miller (communications strategist)|Jason Miller]], a Trump campaign spokesman, responded to the announcement by labeling Schneiderman a "partisan hack".&lt;ref name = "hack" &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/NY-Attorney-General-Trump-Inquiry-393334141.html|title=NY Attorney General Reveals Inquiry Into Trump Foundation|date=September 13, 2016|work=NBC News Washington|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderman has endorsed Hillary Clinton and was identified as a member of her "New York leadership council" in October 2015.&lt;ref name = "hack" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/10/clintons-new-york-team-includes-more-than-100-leaders-no-de-blasio-027119|title=Clinton's New York team includes more than 100 leaders, no de Blasio|last=Rubinstein|first=Dana|date=September 26, 2015|work=Politico|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2016, the Attorney General's office issued a "Notice of Violation" to the Trump Foundation, ordering it to immediately stop all fundraising in New York and to file its registration and all required past audits within 15 days, or risk being "deemed to be a continuing fraud on the people of the State of New York".&lt;ref name="EderCease"&gt;Steve Eder, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html State Attorney General Orders Trump Foundation to Cease Raising Money in New York], ''The New York Times'' (October 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law, the foundation may eventually be required to return all donations it had solicited since inception.&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EderCease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBiancoCease"&gt;Tom LoBianco, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/trump-foundation-cease-and-desist/ NY AG orders Trump Foundation to cease fundraising], CNN (October 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGletter"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/03/us/politics/letter-trump-foundation.html Letter to Trump Foundation From New York Attorney General's Office] (republished by ''The New York Times'') (October 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The notice said the foundation has not been in compliance with New York law because it had failed to re-register in New York State as a "7A level charitable organization", as required for charities that solicit $25,000 or more a year from outside donors. The Donald J. Trump Foundation had been registered in New York under the state's Estates, Powers and Trusts Law with a designation intended for self-funded [[Private foundation (United States)|private foundations]].&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EderCease" /&gt;

On October 17 a spokesperson for the Attorney General's office confirmed that the Trump Foundation had agreed to cease solicitation of donations in New York State. The Trump Foundation was at the time granted an extension of time for filing its financial paperwork, including all past audits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/us/politics/trump-foundation-tells-new-york-it-has-stopped-soliciting-after-state-order.html|title=Trump Foundation Tells New York It Has Stopped Soliciting After State Order|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=October 17, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/prosecutor-trump-foundation-says-ny-fundraising-has-stopped/2016/10/17/a40fd0f2-94a2-11e6-9cae-2a3574e296a6_story.html|title=Prosecutor: Trump Foundation says NY fundraising has stopped|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General's office said the Trump Foundation also agreed to cooperate with their ongoing investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/17/ag-trump-foundation-ends-ny-fundraising/92315502/|title=AG: Trump Foundation ends N.Y. fundraising|newspaper=USA TODAY|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General's press secretary stated that Trump could not legally dissolve his foundation until the investigation is finished.&lt;ref name="dissolve plans"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/12/24/politics/trump-says-hell-dissolve-foundation/index.html|title=Trump says he'll dissolve foundation|last=Diamond|first=Jeremy|date=December 24, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Admission of self-dealing ====
In filing its 2015 IRS Form 990 (filed in 2016 while under investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office), the foundation appears to admit that it had, in previous years, engaged in self-dealing and illegal transfers of funds to "disqualified persons".  This admission contradicts its filings for previous years, where there is no admission of the same violations.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-apparently-admits-to-violating-ban-on-self-dealing-new-filing-to-irs-shows/2016/11/22/893f6508-b0a9-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html|title=Trump Foundation admits to violating ban on 'self-dealing,' new filing to IRS shows|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York State vs the Trump Foundation and Trump family ====

On June 14, 2018, the new [[New York Attorney General]] [[Barbara Underwood]] filed a civil lawsuit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's three adult children, [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]], [[Eric Trump|Eric]], and [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr]]. alleging that they had engaged in "extensive unlawful political conduct" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation "as his personal checkbook," to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-york-files-suit-against-president-trump-alleging-his-charity-engaged-in-illegal-conduct/2018/06/14/c3cbf71e-6fc9-11e8-bd50-b80389a4e569_story.html |title=New York files suit against President Trump, alleging his charity engaged in 'illegal conduct' |last=Fahrenthold |first=David A. |date=June 14, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=June 14, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The lawsuit sought $2.8 million in restitution and the dissolution of the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/nyregion/trump-foundation-lawsuit-attorney-general.html |title=N.Y.

Underwood's office also referred suspected Federal campaign and tax law violations to the [[Federal Election Commission]] and to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;  

Separately, in July 2018, the case was referred to the [[New York State Department of Taxation and Finance]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; In August 2018, the department issued a [[subpoena]] to [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], formerly Trump's personal attorney, in connection with the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/politics/michael-cohen-trump-foundation-subpoena/index.html|title=New York tax investigators subpoena Michael Cohen in Trump Foundation probe|last1=Orden|first1=Erica|last2=Tatum|first2=Sophie|date=August 22, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/politics/new-york-lawsuit-trump-foundation/index.html|title=New York attorney general sues Trump Foundation|last1=Isidore|first1=Chris|last2=Schuman|first2=Melanie|date=June 14, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2018, Trump attorney [[Alan Futerfas]] filed a [[motion to dismiss]] Underwood's suit, claiming it was without merit and was a result of "pervasive bias" by former New York Attorney General, [[Eric Schneiderman]], who had supervised the investigation before resigning that May.  On October 4, 2018, [[New York Attorney General]] [[Barbara Underwood]] filed a memorandum opposing the motion, instead strengthening the charges against the Trump Foundation and now alleging, among other claims, that the full $2.8 million of distributions resulting from the January 2016 Iowa fundraiser represented illegal campaign contributions that needed to be repaid.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt; The memorandum also stated that the Foundation had engaged in "persistent illegality," adding "Donald J. Trump used his control over the Donald J. Trump Foundation for his benefit to advance his personal, business, and political interests in violation of federal and state law governing charities."&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-foundation-engaged-persistent-illegality-york-attorney-general/story?id=58293404|title=Trump Foundation engaged in 'persistent illegality,' New York attorney general says|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=October 4, 2018|website=ABC News|accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On October 25, Judge Saliann Scarpulla heard arguments for and against the motion to dismissed, but declined to issue a ruling at the time, stating she would await a pending decision by judges from the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|New York Supreme Court's Appellate Division]] (the separate [[Summer Zervos|Trump-related suit]] involving [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|Summer Zervos]]) as to whether a sitting US president could be sued in state court at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-in-trump-charity-lawsuit-appears-skeptical-of-presidents-arguments-for-dismissal/2018/10/25/8b11eee0-d871-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html|title=Judge in Trump charity lawsuit appears skeptical of president’s arguments for dismissal|last=https://www.facebook.com/dafahrenthold|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/25/politics/trump-foundation-lawsuit-wait/index.html|title=Judge waits to hear if sitting president can be sued before ruling on Trump Foundation|last=Orden|first=Erica|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, Scarpulla ruled against the motion to dismiss, affirming that a sitting US president can face "a civil lawsuit in state court for actions not taken in his official capacity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/23/politics/trump-foundation-new-york-state-lawsuit/index.html|title=NY AG's lawsuit against Trump foundation can proceed, judge says|last=CNN|first=Erica Orden,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== US Special Counsel Investigation ===
On April 9, 2018 the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reported that the office of [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Special Counsel]] Robert Mueller, as part of his larger investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election, was investigating the 2015 donation to the Trump Foundation of $150,000 by Ukrainian billionaire [[Victor Pinchuk]].&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The ''Times'' reported that [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s personal attorney, [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], had solicited the donation from Pinchuk in return for Trump's appearance in a 20-minute video conference with Pinchuk and others in [[Kiev]] in September 2015, just a few months after Mr Trump officially began his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|campaign for US President]].&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/trump-investigation-mueller-probes-150000-donation-from-victor-pinchuk.html|title=Mueller is reportedly investigating $150,000 a Ukrainian billionaire gave Trump's foundation|last=Lee|first=Yen Nee|date=2018-04-09|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was part of a [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|broader investigation into foreign influence into the campaign]]. Federal election law prohibits non-US nationals from contributing to US political campaigns.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

=== Other complaints ===
==== Letter from the House Judiciary Committee to the US Attorney General ====
Also on September 13, 2016, all fifteen Democrats on the [[House Judiciary Committee]] sent a letter to [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Loretta Lynch]] requesting that the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] launch a criminal investigation of Trump in connection with his foundation's $25,000 grant to Pam Bondi's campaign. The letter specifically cited possible violations of two anti-[[bribery]] laws.&lt;ref name="FortuneDJTF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/14/trump-foundation-investigation-pam-bondi/|title=Trump Foundation Investigations Now Multiplying|date=September 14, 2016|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service ====
Also on September 13, 2016, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), a left-leaning watchdog group, filed a complaint with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] citing evidence they argued would compel the agency to seek back taxes and penalties and revoke the foundation's tax-free status.&lt;ref name="FortuneDJTF" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/trump-appears-violate-tax-code/|title=Trump appears to violate the tax code – CREW|newspaper=CREW|language=en-US|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egypt Post''' ({{lang-arz|البريد المصرى}} ''{{transl|arz|El-Barid el-Maṣri}}'') is the governmental agency responsible for [[mail|postal service]] in [[Egypt]]. Established in 1865, it is one of the oldest governmental institutions in the country.

=={{anchor|History of modern Egyptian post}}History==
Modern Egyptian postal service began when Carlo Meratti, an [[Italians|Italian]], living in [[Alexandria]], established a post office to send and receive mail to and from [[Universal Postal Union|foreign countries]] as early as 1821. Meratti took the responsibility of sending and distributing the letters for a price. He transferred his activity to [[Cairo]] and Alexandria through his office in Saint Catherine Square (formerly Qansal Square). After Meratti's departure his nephew, Tito Chini (who agreed with the importance of the project) succeeded his uncle with a friend, Giacomo Muzzi. The two [[Business partner|partners]] upgraded the project, naming it the ''Posta Europea''.

The post office began sending, receiving and delivering [[communication|correspondence]] from the government and individuals, and the ''Posta Europea'' earned the public trust. At the inauguration of the first [[Egyptian National Railways|railway]] between Alexandria and Kafr el-Zayyat in 1845 the company established branches in Cairo, Atfe, and Rashid (Rosetta), followed by another two branches (in [[Damanhur|Damanhour]] and Kafr El Zayyat) in 1855. When the railway was extended from Kafr El Zayyat to Cairo (via [[Tanta]], [[Benha]] and Birket el-Sab), the company exploited this opportunity and used the railways to carry the post between Cairo and Alexandria for a five-year contract beginning in January 1856. The contract was as a [[monopoly|monopolistic]] franchise to transport the post to northern Egypt, where it stipulated a fine to be paid to the ''Posta Europea'' by anyone caught pilfering mail.

Khedive Ismaiel realized the importance of the ''Posta Europea'' and purchased it from Muzzi (after the departure of his partner, Tito Chini) on October 29, 1864. The [[Egyptian government]] offered Muzzi the position of general manager of the post and on January 2, 1865, the private ''Posta Europea'' was transferred to the Egyptian government. This date is noted as Post Day.

=={{anchor|Establishment}}Government administration==
[[File:Smart Village building 00 (3).JPG|thumb|The Egypt Post building in [[Smart Village, Egypt|Smart Village]].]]
At its beginning, Egypt Post was affiliated with the Ministry of Occupations; it was then transferred to a succession of ministries, and in 1865 Egypt Post was attached to the [[Ministry of Finance (Egypt)|Ministry of Finance]].
On September 28, 1876, Egypt Post was put under the purview of the Rulings Council Chief and the [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Ministers of Interior]] and Finance. On May 19, 1875 it joined the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Egypt)|Ministry of Justice and Trade]] and the Ministry of Finance again on December 10, 1878. The [[regulation]]s related to the organization of a post office was issued by the Ministry of Finance on December 21, 1865, stipulating that transferring mail and issuing [[post stamp]]s was the exclusive job of the Egyptian government. In March 1876 a decree was issued for all post offices providing all employees with two [[uniform]]s: one for work and the other for ceremonies. The decree was amended to specify the model and type of the uniform.

In 1919, Law No. 7 was passed for the [[Ministry of Transportation (Egypt)|Ministry of Transportation]] appropriate the railways, [[telegraph]], telephones, postal authority, ports, and road and air transportation.
Comprehensive Law No. 9 was issued later to set fees for transporting the post and the postal-management headquarters was moved from Alexandria to Cairo, to its building in Al Aataba Square.

Since its establishment, the post (in addition to its regular postal activity) has sold [[Excise|salt and soda stamp]]s (discontinued in 1899), steamboat tickets, debt and shares coupons, stamped paper, and telegraph and telephone service in return for fees paid to the Telephone Authority.

[[File:Post box (5078283993).jpg|thumb|An Egypt Post mail box in [[Alexandria]].]]
In 1934 the 10th conference of the Universal Postal Union was held in Cairo, on the 70th anniversary of the Egyptian Post. After the July 1952 revolution a separate budget was allocated for the post, giving it the right to direct its [[Budget surplus|surplus]] revenues toward improving and boosting the postal service.

In 1957 Presidential Decree No. 710 was issued, establishing the Egyptian Post Authority to replace the previous postal authority. In 1959 the civil-services system (including local post offices and agencies) began, and in 1961 a secondary postal school was established by presidential decree. In 1965 the Institute of Postal Affairs was also established; in 1975, it joined the trade department at [[Helwan University]].

In 1966 a presidential decree was issued establishing the General Post Authority to replace the Egyptian Post Authority, and in 1970 Law No. 16 was passed regulating the Egyptian post. 1982 saw the issuance of Law No. 19 establishing the National Post Authority, replacing the General Post Authority and attaching it to the Ministry of Transportation.

[[Ministerial decree|Ministerial Decree]] No. 70, in 1982, was a special regulation concerning Post Authority's personnel; Decree No. 55 that same year regulated the authority's finances. In 1999 the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Egypt)|Ministry of Communications and Information Technology]] was established to supervise the National Post Authority, Egypt Telecom and the National Communications Institute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5132">'''EnergyCAP''' is a family of [[energy management software|energy management]] and [[energy accounting software]] products, used for tracking, managing, processing, reporting, benchmarking, and analyzing utility bills and energy and sustainability information. EnergyCAP also interfaces with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Energy Star]] Portfolio Manager. Multiple versions of EnergyCAP -- Enterprise, Express, and Professional -- are available to meet user functional requirements.

== History ==

EnergyCAP's history dates back to 1980. In response to a growing demand for energy management software when PCs were in their infancy, Steven D. Heinz founded OmniComp, Inc. in 1980 and launched the development of EnergyCAP predecessor FASER Energy Accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.com/NewsPress/tabid/63/newsid409/33/Default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; FASER was first commercially released in 1982 for utility bill verification, tracking and reporting, and the calculation of the cost avoidance attributable to energy management activities (also called [[Measurement and Verification|Measurement &amp; Verification]]). The City of Denver also uses this software to track energy usage throughout their parks system. 

FASER became widely used by retail chains, government, universities, school districts and property managers. By the mid-1990s, FASER's thousands of users tracked an estimated five million bills a year valued at $2 billion. FASER and OmniComp were purchased by [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/footprint/10K/Enron-1998-10-K-d.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Enron's bankruptcy in late 2001, Heinz acquired the energy information assets&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=178/pagename=alpha_list]&lt;/ref&gt; and launched Good Steward Software, which was renamed to EnergyCAP, Inc. in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/good-steward-software-announces-record-sales-in-2009-changes-name-to-energycap-inc-80720647.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The team developed a new line of energy efficiency software products called EnergyCAP. EnergyCAP, Inc. is a five-time [[Energy Star]] Partner of the Year.

== Software Versions ==

EnergyCAP Enterprise is software for large organizations with comprehensive energy information management needs. Users include Fortune 1,000 companies; universities; military; and city, county, and state governments. EnergyCAP Express is utility bill and energy management software for small to medium-sized organizations like colleges, towns, and small- to medium-sized businesses. EnergyCAP Professional is oriented toward measurement and verification of energy savings for certain qualifying organizations, most notably school districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=413/pagename=alpha_list]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software Features ==

EnergyCAP offers the following features: Account Tracking, [[Accounting software|Accounts Payable or G/L Export]], Bill Accruals, Bill Audits, Electronic Bills from Vendor, Energy Contract Administration, Issue Tracker, Workflow Management, Benchmarking Charts, Budgets &amp; Forecasts,  [[Measurement and Verification|Cost Avoidance (M&amp;V)]], Energy Procurement, Rate/Tariff Analysis, Weather Data, Automated Report Distribution, Custom Spreadsheets for Data Export, Energy Dashboard, PowerViews, Reports, TreeView Navigation, Energy Star Benchmarking, [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gas Emissions]], Bill Splits, Move-In Utility Vacant Expense Recovery (MUVER), [[Utility submeter|Submeters]] &amp; Chargebacks, Interval (Time-Series) Data, Meter Data Import, [[Microsoft SQL Server]], Unlimited Number of Users, Customizable User Permissions, Data Import Templates, Implementation Services, and Setup Wizards.

== Cost Avoidance ==

Cost Avoidance (Measurement &amp; Verification) is the calculation of the savings attributable to energy management by comparing current bills with a normalized baseline year. The cost avoidance calculation engine of EnergyCAP complies with the [[International performance measurement and verification protocol]], the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]'s standard for energy performance measurement and verification. EnergyCAP adjusts for factors like changes in building square footage, type of primary use, billing period length, and weather.

'''Enterprise coexistence''' refers to the means for users on different remote systems to communicate with each other seamlessly. This new technology is only just beginning to appear commercially. As a result, it's identified differently by different companies (Amazon WorkMail calls it 'interoperability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/10/amazon-workmail-now-supports-interoperability-with-microsoft-exchange-server/|title=Amazon WorkMail now supports interoperability with Microsoft Exchange Server|website=Amazon Web Services, Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;', [[Dell]] calls it coexistence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://software.dell.com/products/coexistence-manager-for-groupwise/|title=Coexistence Manager ensures Groupwise and Exchange Interperability|website=software.dell.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cloudiway calls it both coexistence and enterprise coexistence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cloudiway.com/coexistence-service-between-google-apps-and-office-365/|title=Coexistence Service between Google Apps and Office 365 {{!}} Cloudiway|website=www.cloudiway.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[BitTitan]] calls it enterprise coexistence:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bittitan.com/products/migrationwiz/overview|title=MigrationWiz - BitTitan|website=www.bittitan.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binary Tree]] has opted to market each aspect of enterprise coexistence as individual products&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.binarytree.com/products/|title=Binary Tree Software Solutions|website=www.binarytree.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Enterprise coexistence solutions usually include calendar free/busy scheduling as well as global address list management on each remote system. Additional features also exist, such as mail routing. The remote systems during enterprise coexistence do not need to be the same type, allowing interoperability between considerably different remote systems, such as G Suite and Exchange, whether cloud-based or on-premises.

Each remote system communicates through a dedicated coexistence server, which acts as an interpreter between the two, passing information between systems in a format they recognize and accept. Each system them passes the details back to the source of the request.

Enterprise coexistence is primarily used by businesses during mergers, acquisitions and specific collaborations. Some businesses opt to use coexistence long-term. It's also gaining popularity as a solution when moving business software tools from on-premises-based software to the cloud (such as G Suite and Office 365), which is due to see an increase in 2017 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2017/cloud-2017-seven-key-trends-aws-azure-voice-services-machine-learning/|title=The Cloud in 2017: Seven key trends, from AWS and Azure to voice services and machine learning|date=2017-01-02|newspaper=GeekWire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/3155764/cloud-computing/3-reasons-why-2017-will-see-massive-cloud-migration.html?platform=hootsuite|title=3 reasons why 2017 will see massive cloud migration|last=Linthicum|first=David|newspaper=InfoWorld|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Component details ==
Free/busy scheduling allows users to query the availability of external users or resources (such as rooms and equipment). For example, if Jill at Business A proposes a time and date for a meeting with a Jack at Business B, she can check if Jack is free by sending a calendar look-up request, then adjust the meeting time accordingly. Her server sends a message to the coexistence server which acts as a user at Business B to query Jack's calendar. When Business B's server provides the information to the coexistence server, the coexistence server passes this back to Jill at Business A. This can save time when setting up meetings between multiple people at different businesses.

Global address list management ensures that each server has an up-to-date and synchronized version of all users from all coexisting servers. For example, if Jack leaves Business B and his account is deleted, the global address list at Business B will be updated. The coexistence server will check for updates periodically, then automatically update the global address list at Business A so that the two are once again synchronized. Deletions, changes and additions are synchronized, so if Jack were valuable enough to be replaced, his replacement's details would also be added to the address list both locally at Business B and at Business A.

Mail routing during enterprise coexistence allows more than one remote server to share a single domain name. Although some examples of long-term usage may exist, mail routing is normally implemented during mergers or acquisitions, when data migration to a single remote system is planned (transitional coexistence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/10/transitional-coexistence-singing-an-it-harmony-in-the-enterprise/|title=Transitional Coexistence: Singing an IT Harmony in the Enterprise|last=Sciences|first=Thomas Hazel, Deep Information|newspaper=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16121">An '''enterprise planning system''' covers the methods of planning for the internal and external factors that affect an [[Business|enterprise]].

These factors generally fall under [[PESTLE]]. PESTLE refers to political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors.  Regularly addressing PESTLE factors falls under [[operations management]]. Meanwhile, addressing any event, opportunity or challenge in any one or many factors for the first time will involve [[project management]].

As opposed to [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), enterprise planning systems have broader coverage. Enterprise planning systems address the resources that are available or ''not'' available to an enterprise and its ability to produce products or resources and/or provide services. It also considers those factors that will positively or negatively affect the firm's ability to run these actions.

Enterprise planning systems will tend to vary and are flexible. These are due to the periodic and adaptive nature of strategy formation. These will also have tactical aspects. Typically, enterprise planning systems are part of a firm's knowledge base or corporate structure whether it formally identified and structured or simply executed these when the need appeared.

== Purposes ==

An enterprise planning system will address at least three basic purposes to help the enterprise: 
* survive
* compete
* thrive

===Survival===
An enterprise will plan for tactical moves for quick reaction to the PESTLE threats that affect its survival. For instance, right after Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant has experienced explosions due to the earthquake and the tsunami that followed, several enterprises (within and outside Japan) have publicly announced their course of actions to address the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Adam Gabbatt |author2=Richard Adams |author3=Ben Quinn |title=Japan tsunami and nuclear alert - Monday 14 March part two|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/mar/14/japan-tsunami-nuclear-alert-live|work=guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=30 April 2011|location=London|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
Meanwhile, an enterprise will plan for longer term strategic actions to address its competition or improve its [[competitiveness]]. For instance, enterprises will plan for, set budgets, implement and use [[strategic information systems]] as “information systems or information technology investments can be a source of competitive advantage”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ward |author2=Joe Peppard |title=Strategic Planning for Information Systems 3rd Edition|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex PO19 1UD, England|isbn=0-470-84147-8|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunities===
Most significantly, an enterprise will plan for using the PESTLE opportunities that are available to it. The profit and benefit motives justify most enterprise planning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Massood Samii|title=Project Financial Evaluation|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-040-project-management-spring-2009/lecture-notes/|work=Lecture Notes MIT OpenCourseWare|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerabilities===

A fourth noteworthy purpose for enterprise planning systems is preparedness against terrorist attacks. As noted in the US Presidential Directive for [[Critical infrastructure protection]], terrorist groups are likely to attack commercial infrastructure for economic sabotage. Enterprises that are providing products or services that are critical to the economic system of a nation are potential targets of extremists.

== Strategic planning ==
Two major characteristics of EPSs are (1) variety and (2) flexibility. For instance, technological risks abound as even enterprise software are prone to [[obsolescence]] and [[disruptive innovation]]s. Technology is not stagnant. Thus, variety and flexibility work to the advantage of a strategically adaptive or [[agile management|agile]] enterprise as PESTLE conditions change.

To illustrate this some more, ERP software prescribes processes to realize its promised benefits. However, compliance to these rigid, prescribed processes is often assumed rather than real. In many cases, the ERP software is accepted but the practices within the enterprise reflect inconsistencies with the prescribed processes of the software. In a sense, variety and flexibility in a standard ERP implementation will still manifest in many ways such as "workarounds, shadow systems, various forms of unintended improvisations, and organizational 'drift'" as the [[knowledge worker]]s in the enterprise adapt to the realities of daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berente|first=Nicholas |author2=Danail Ivanov |author3=Betty Vandenbosch|title=Process Compliance and Enterprise System Implementation|journal=IEEE Computer Society|year=2007|volume=40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|pages=1530–1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With changing real world conditions, at least three components can structure enterprise strategy. These are:  
* analytical frameworks for the evaluation of PESTLE data at a given time
* geographic coverage of operations to manage risks or maximize benefits from [[macroeconomic]] forces or government regulations
* projects integration to efficiently support enterprise operations

=== Strategy via analysis ===
Frameworks of analysis usually drive a firm's strategy. These enable the firm to cope with the actions of its competitors, demands of its consumers or clients, nature of its operating environments, effects of government regulations in the places where it does business, or opportunities that are available among other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kevan|title=Strategic Management|publisher=DK Publishing|location=375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, United States of America|isbn=978-0-7566-4859-6|pages=16–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, team planning is crucial. One group will normally specialize in one aspect like operations or government regulations. Managing the interrelation of PESTLE factors requires teamwork in the enterprise planning process.

A sample framework for general analysis is the [[SWOT analysis]]. Another is the [[Balanced Scorecard]] for performance measurement analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|author2=David P. Norton|title=Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=January–February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy via geography ===
Enterprise strategy can also refer to the mix of structured actions that address the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors that affect a business or firm. These structured actions can be local, [[International|transnational]], global or combination of local, transnational or global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mellahi, K., Frynas, J.G. &amp; Finlay, P.|title=Global Strategic Management|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-926615-9|pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, enterprises can have any of the following geographic strategies in their plans:
* local strategy
* regional strategy (Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, etc.)
* international strategy
* global strategy
* global and local strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=HSBC |title=The world's local bank |url=http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/ |work=2011 |publisher=HSBC Holdings plc 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303034643/http://www.hsbc.com/1/2 |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy via projects integration ===
Moreover, since management actions occur simultaneously in an enterprise, strategic planners can consider operations or [[project portfolio management]] (PPM) as crucial elements in an enterprise's strategic planning guide.

For instance, the need to have strategic priorities across many projects in companies with multiple product development projects have made executives borrow principles from investment portfolio management to better manage the distribution of resources compared with the assessed risks for each project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Michael E.|title=Next Generation Product Development: How to Increase Productivity, Cut Costs, and Reduce Cycle Times|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=0-07-143512-3|pages=229–232, Chapter 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, PESTLE factors lead to strategy formation that will enable the enterprise to adapt to changing conditions. Meanwhile, the strategies that have been formed from the analytical framework processes of evaluating an enterprise's condition will lead to detailed plans which could be part of a firm's manual of operations or projects portfolio thrusts for funding and execution across the units or geographic coverage of the enterprise.

== Planning and budgeting ==
Enterprise planning and budgeting go hand-in-hand as the wherewithal to execute plans will determine the success or failure of an enterprise strategy. In another light, expanding or limiting the budget for a particular operations aspect of the enterprise or an ongoing project in favor of another will signal changes to an enterprise's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Xiall M.|title=Global Engineering Economics: Financial Decision Making for Engineers|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-13-207161-1|pages=90–110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, planning and budgeting are integral parts of any enterprise planning systems as these impact the strategic directions of the enterprise.

For instance, enterprise projects tend to be mutually dependent with other projects to leverage a firm's engineering, financial and technology resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-Project Management: Strategy and Organization in Automobile Product Development|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2492/SWP-3609-29056920.pdf?sequence=1|work=WP-3609-93 BPS|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|accessdate=April 27, 2011|first=Kentaro|last=Nobeoka|author2=Michael A. Cusumano|date=11 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; A market research project will trigger a research, development and engineering (RD&amp;E) project for a new product. In turn, this RD&amp;E project could trigger a production strategy project to manufacture the new product at the most efficient locations to bring it closer to its target consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fujimoto |first=Takahiro |title=Production Strategy |url=http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/lecture-notes_eng/Eco_02/BusinessAdministration2_07.pdf |publisher=Department of Economics, University of Tokyo |accessdate=16 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080343/http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/lecture-notes_eng/Eco_02/BusinessAdministration2_07.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, cutting the RD&amp;E project budget in half or increasing it twice will have profound effects in the long term direction of an enterprise as this will affect the other units of the firm undertaking projects that are linked to the RD&amp;E project.

===Classifications===

Enterprise planning and budgeting can be generally classified into:
* centralized
* devolved
* hybrid

'''Centralized.''' Headquarters or executive management directs all planning and budgets from the top then downwards in the organization hierarchy. It will closely follow Frederick Winslow Taylor's Principles of [[Scientific Management]].

'''Devolved.''' Middle managers set plans effectively steering the enterprise's strategic direction. Executive management takes into account that the enterprise has knowledge workers that are experts in their respective fields. The Management Board approves the proposed strategic direction under certain financial constraints such as expected returns on investment or equity.

'''Hybrid.''' Executive management determines and sets the strategic direction of the enterprise based on the inputs of middle managers and the rank and file. In this set up, plans and budgets are negotiated.

Essentially, enterprise plans and budgets can be detailed in a top-down approach, generalized in a bottom-up approach, or combined in a top-down and bottom-up approach.

== Group planning ==
Enterprise group planning will typically refer to the involvement of the major units of an enterprise such as the finance, marketing, production or technology departments. It can also refer to the involvement of the geographic units of a transnational or global firm. Some enterprises also involve external parties in their group planning where inputs from the crucial parts of the supply chain, cooperation and collaboration, or outsiders-looking-in are part of the firm's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Usoro|first=Abel|author2=Abbas Abid |author3=Matthew Kuofie |title=Scales Construction for Organisational Variables that Influence the Use Of ICT for Global Planning|journal=International Journal of Global Business|date=December 2008|volume=1|series=1|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Richard|title=The Natural Laws of Business: How to Harness the Power of Evolution, Physics, and Economics to Achieve Business Success|year=2001|publisher=Doubleday, Random House Inc.|location=New York, USA|isbn=0-385-50159-5|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise group planning will usually manifest in regular board of directors' or management committee' meetings with varying frequencies such as monthly, quarterly or annually. Traditional meetings have required the physical presences of representatives from the various business units of the enterprise. With improvements in telecommunications, enterprise group planning can be conducted through video conferencing where participants may be dispersed geographically. However, video conferencing still appears to be an inadequate substitute when warm, interpersonal relations are part of the firm's culture.

Yet for fast-paced events like natural disasters or a meltdown of the financial markets that require immediate action from the enterprise, video conferencing might be the only option. Troubleshooting that requires the major resources of the enterprise will also entail enterprise group planning. Here, enterprise planning systems take a tactical form rather than a strategic focus to preserve the stability or ensure the survival of the enterprise.

== Transition plan ==
Enterprise transition plans will generally refer to change management-related actions in the case of mergers or in the implementation of an enterprise-wide project. The transition plan will cover the elimination of redundant functions in the case of a merger or the incorporation of new processes into business operations in the case of a technology project.

== Planning software ==
Enterprise planning software will have varied or depth of coverage but will not essentially refer to enterprise resource planning software. This will include planning-centric software and the tools to support strategic and tactical planning for and across the enterprise, such as:
* strategy formation and scenario planning software (for example, supporting [[Sales and operations planning]] process)
* performance measurement and evaluation software
* [[project management]] software
* [[data warehouse]] or [[business intelligence]] software
* [[enterprise optimization]] software

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2893">'''''Grant v Norway''''' (1851) &lt;ref&gt; ''Grant v Norway'' (1851) 10 CB 665, 138 ER 263, 20 LJCP 93, 15 Jur 296 [http://maritimelawdigital.com/uploads/HTML/Grant_Norway_1851.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is a case on the [[Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea]]; but since 1992 it has no longer been good law.

This was an action upon the case by the indorsees of a bill of lading, against the owners of a vessel, to recover the amount of advances made by the former upon the bills of lading, the goods never having in fact been shipped. 

The [[court]] held that a statement in a [[bill of lading]] that goods have been shipped is of only ''[[prima facie]]'' evidential value, and its terms may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.

The justification for the case was that a carrier should not  suffer liability if (as was not uncommon at the time) the ship's master had fraudulently colluded with a dishonest shipper and  had issued a bill declaring untruthfully that goods had been loaded. (The master would normally be both an employee and an [[Law of agency|agent]] of the carrier, but would (in both roles) be acting in breach of the legal [[fiduciary duty]] to his employer/principal).

The [[Hague-Visby Rules]] continued with this view, with Article III (4) stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Such a bill of lading shall be '''''prima facie''''' evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph 3 (a), (b) and (c). However, proof to the contrary shall not be admissible when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party acting in good faith."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the UK has adopted the Hague-Visby Rules,&lt;ref&gt;The UK ratified the Hague-Visby Rules in the [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]]&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of [[English Law]] a bill of lading is now deemed to be '''conclusive''' (not merely ''prima facie'') evidence of receipt as a result of section 4 of the [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]]. The reason for the change is that the [[Law Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission Report into "Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea" - Law Com No 196, Scot Law Com no 130), 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; deemed that, if international confidence were to be maintained, it was crucial that a bill of lading should be relied upon as a conclusive statement of fact.&lt;ref&gt; Commentary on ''Grant v Norway'' [https://www.ukpandi.com/knowledge-publications/article/an-agents-authority-to-sign-bills-of-lading-1555/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Swarb [http://swarb.co.uk/grant-and-others-v-norway-and-others-ccp-20-feb-1851/]&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the main rule ''Grant v Norway'' has been rendered void by the 1992 Act.

After the war he returned to Norway, enrolling at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] in 1946. He graduated in 1951, and then worked as a research assistant and fellow until 1954. In 1955 he was hired in [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Norway]], advancing to director of planning, public relations and environment in his later career. He left Shell in 1984, and was secretary-general in the [[Norwegian Petroleum Institute]] from 1985 to 1989.&lt;ref name=stikka&gt;{{cite news|title=Fortsatt energisk|last=Vinje|first=Marianne|date=10 February 2009|work=Budstikka|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goksøyr was also an amateur painter, and in 1954 he was represented with two works at the national Autumn Exhibit, [[Høstutstillingen]]. His other hobbies included [[golf]] and giving lectures. He settled in [[Nesøya, Akershus|Nesøya]] in 1963, was married and had two sons.&lt;ref name=stikka/&gt; He died in August 2016 at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jolstad.vareminnesider.no/choose_product.php?memorial_page_id=481793&amp;set_site_id=75&amp;booking_id=1162271&amp;cat=OrderFlowers&amp;action=buy_products&amp;sign=53acb9e97492bc4c00d6ed8f90b2124a Hans Goksøyr obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hetzner was co-founded in 1999 by Hans Wencke and Martin Hetzner. Its headquarters are located in [[Cape Town]] with data centre facilities in Samrand ([[Gauteng]]) and [[Newlands, Cape Town|Newlands]] (Cape Town).&lt;ref name="CRF"&gt;Corporate Research Foundation, 2003. Top ICT Companies in SA. 3rd Revised edition. Corporate Research Foundation Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, Hetzner's hosting accounts were transferred to co-located servers in the (then) UUNET data centre, Great Westerford Building, Newlands, Cape Town.&lt;ref name="CRF"/&gt; In 2003, the company established its head office at Frazzitta Business Park, [[Durbanville]].&lt;ref name="CRF"/&gt; In 2004, the company established a data centre in Gauteng.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate Research Foundation, 2007. Top ICT Companies in South Africa: Information, Communication Technology and Electronics. 5th edition. Corporate Research Foundation Publishing. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hetzner hosted over 130,000 domains for approximately 25,000 SME customers.&lt;ref&gt;CRF South African Partnership, 2009. Best Employers™South Africa 2009/10. 10th edition. CRF South African Partnership.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Hetzner was appointed as an accredited Registrant to better facilitate the administration of [[.co.za]] domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hetzner revamps data centre | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''itweb.co.za''| date =3 July 2013 | url =http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=65408 | accessdate =25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Hetzner started offering [[Colocation centre|Colocation services]] in [[Johannesburg]] for customers wanting to maintain complete control over their hardware and server administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =João Marques | first =Lima  | title =Global Cloud Backup Player Launches “European Data Centre On African Soil” | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''data-economy.com''| date =12 January 2017 | url =https://data-economy.com/global-cloud-backup-player-launches-european-data-centre-african-soil/ | accessdate =25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Hetzner became the second South African host of the [[Johannesburg Internet Exchange]] (JINX), and the first to receive a 10Gbit/s connection upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hetzner joins peering at NAPAfrica| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''techcentral.co.za''| date =13 April 2017 | url =https://techcentral.co.za/hetzner-joins-peering-at-napafrica/73173/ | accessdate =25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hetzner (Pty) Ltd is quite different  from its German namesake and partner company, [[Hetzner|Hetzner Online GmbH]]. The two are separate companies within their own rights, registered and incorporated  under their applicable country laws. The companies do not have the same shareholders.

==Products and services==
Hetzner provides web hosting solutions to the Southern African market with associated hosting products such as colocation hosting and root server hosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Liquid Telecom to host SA Internet exchange nodes | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''techcentral.co.za''| date =24 August 2017 | url =https://techcentral.co.za/liquid-telecom-host-sa-internet-exchange-nodes/76550/| accessdate =25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lafarge Africa Plc''' is a building materials solutions provider headquartered in [[Lagos]] and quoted on the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]]. It is majorly controlled by [[LafargeHolcim]]. Previously trading under the name of Lafarge Wapco Plc, the merger of [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] and [[Holcim]] and resulting consolidation of Lafarge's assets in Nigeria and South Africa resulted in the name change to Lafarge Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalcement.com/news/item/2557-lafarge-combines-nigeria-and-south-africa-businesses-to-create-lafarge-africa|title=Lafarge combines Nigeria and South Africa businesses to create Lafarge Africa - Cement industry news from Global Cement|last=staff|first=Global Cement|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Lafarge WAPCO ===
West African Portland Cement company began operations in 1961 at [[Ewekoro]], the firm was formally established in 1959 as a joint venture between [[Blue Circle Industries|Blue Circle]], [[United Africa Company of Nigeria]] and the Western regional government in Nigeria. Blue Circle, previously known as Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers was Nigeria's largest supplier of cement. But not to be lose the market to local producers especially after a Nigerian Cement Company was commissioned at [[Nkalagu]], [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Nigeria]], Blue Circle joined a consortium that included the Western Nigeria government to establish a new [[kiln]] at Ewekoro. The consortium adopted a capital intensive [[Cement kiln|dry process]] of cement production and&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mA4AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%2522Associated+Portland+Cement%2522++and+nigeria&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Industrialization in an open economy: 1945-1966|last=Kilby|first=Peter|date=1969|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=100–105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced Elephant brand of Portland cement. In 1978, a new plant was opened at [[Sagamu|Shagamu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Esubiyi|first=Akin|date=1995|title=Chapter 18: Technical Change in the Nigerian Cement Industry|url=http://www.nzdl.org/gsdlmod?e=d-00000-00---off-0hdl--00-0----0-10-0---0---0direct-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00-0-0-11-10-0utfZz-8-00&amp;cl=CL1.17&amp;d=HASHec1cc96e360e748d541c28.4.9&amp;gt=1|journal=International Development Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was eventually producing one million tonnes in 2003. When productivity of the aged plant at Ewekoro began to decline, the firm built a new plant and adopted the wet process method of producing cement, that facility was commissioned in 2003 with a capacity to produce 1.32 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/200308270570.html|title=West African Portland Cement (WAPCO) Turns Ewekoro Plant to the Future|last=Maduako|first=Dachi|date=August 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, WAPCO had become the largest cement producer in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cemnet.com/News/story/148130/nigerian-wapco-seeks-290m.html|title=Nigerian WAPCO seeks $290m|date=2004-01-05|website=International Cement Review|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, Lafarge of France acquired Blue Circle, including the latter's interest in WAPCO. Seven years later, the name became Lafarge Cement WAPCO plc. Lafarge increased production at WAPCO in 2011 with the commissioning of an additional 2.2 million metric tonnes plant at Lakatabu, [[Ogun State]]. Along with the new plant, the firm built a power plant to fire the new kilns.

=== Lafarge Africa ===
In 2014, Lafarge and Holcim merged and decided to consolidate some of their African businesses. A new entity Lafarge Africa was announced in June 2004, the company merged WAPCO of Nigeria's assets with the South African assets of Lafarge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lafarge.co.za/lafarge_to_merge_south_africa_nigeria_units_in_135bn_deal|title=Lafarge to merge South Africa, Nigeria units in $1.35bn deal|date=2017-09-27|website=Lafarge in South Africa - Cement, concrete, aggregates|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Lafarge welded together more holdings in Nigeria when Atlas Cement, Port Harcourt and UNICEM of Calabar were merged with Lafarge Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7859">The [[chemical company|chemical companies]] of the '''large scale chemical synthesis in Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Wielka synteza chemiczna}}) at the beginning of the [[21st century]] underwent the a process of intensive reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tygodnik7dni.pl/pierwsze-lata-xxi-wieku-czyli-przeksztalcenia-i-walka-z-kryzysem-2013,04,19.html | title = Pierwsze lata XXI wieku, czyli przekształcenia i walka z kryzysem | publisher = tygodnik7dni.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Since the majority of entities in the sector of great chemical synthesis was owned by State Treasury at that time, the reorganisation and privatisation strategy was developed for the sector of great chemical synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msp.gov.pl/download/2/11629/StrategiarestrukturyzacjiiprywatyzacjisektoraWielkiejSyntezyChemicznej102003.pdf | title = Strategia restrukturyzacji i prywatyzacji Sektora Wielkiej Syntezy Chemicznej | publisher = msp.gov.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It identified, e.g. weak connections between the particular production plants and the necessity to reorganise them. The effect of this strategy was, e.g. the consolidation of the chemical and fertiliser industry, by establishing Grupa Azoty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/wielka-polska-synteza-chemiczna/e9xxp  | title = Wielka polska synteza chemiczna | publisher = onet.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.msp.gov.pl/pl/media/aktualnosci/22655,Wielka-Synteza-Chemiczna-fuzja-dwoch-rownorzednych-podmiotow.html | title = Wielka Synteza Chemiczna fuzją dwóch równorzędnych podmiotów | publisher = msp.gov.pl | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">It is a [[master's degree]] designed to develop the capabilities and resources of managers in the [[economic globalization|global economy]]. It is for those seeking to establish or accelerate a career in [[international business]].

The origins of this type of program go back to the creation in 1946 of the American Institute of Foreign Trade, known today as [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]], in Glendale, Arizona. Thunderbird's program was referred to as a Master of International Management until 2000, when it adopted the MBA in Global Management denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Business MBA and Masters Degree Programs|url=http://www.thunderbird.edu/graduate-degrees|publisher=Thunderbird School of Global Management|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of the program combined international business, [[international political economy]], and learning of languages and world cultures. Other similar programs are now offered by a range of business schools under a variety of denominations.

Emphasizing the practical application of specialized knowledge, the program equips management with skills tailored to the [[international business]] environment.

The '''''Master in International Business''''' focuses on strategic planning for international operations and provides an in-depth understanding of the organizational capabilities required for international operations, including specialized functions such as international [[marketing]], [[finance]] and [[human resource management]]. Master in international business degrees also include classes that address topics such as imports and exports and intercultural communication.

The degree may be thought of as an [[MBA]] with a particular focus on [[multinational corporations]].

The standard degree abbreviations for this qualification are ''MIntBus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unimelb.edu.au/ExecServ/Statutes/r54r1eco.html "Statutes and Regulations: Regulation 5.4.R1 - Economics and Commerce: The University of Melbourne"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401004359/http://www.unimelb.edu.au/ExecServ/Statutes/r54r1eco.html |date=2009-04-01 }}, [[The University of Melbourne]].

Retrieved February 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or ''MIB''.

==Admission==
Admission normally requires an [[undergraduate degree]] in any discipline, the equivalent of two years full-time work in a role that has an international focus, a personal statement and a successful [[GMAT]]/[[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] score.

==Course Structure==
The course structure is modelled on that of the [[MBA]] program.

The course is normally offered as a 16 subject program that would take two years of full-time study or four years of part-time study to complete.

Students who meet certain prerequisites may be able to undertake the degree as a 12 subject program. In this case, there would be an expectation of completion within 18 months if studying full-time or three years if studying part-time.

 Macquarie University,Australia offers the Master of International Business program to be completed in 2 year.

[[File:Miss Leonora Brooke et son fiancé M. Max Auşnit, millionnaire roumain, Planet.jpg|thumb|250px|Auschnitt and fiancée Miss Leonora Brooke (daughter of [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]] [[Charles Vyner Brooke]]), in 1932]]
'''Max Auschnitt''', also known as '''Ausschnitt''', '''Auschnit''' or '''Aușnit''' (February 14, 1888 – 1959), was a [[Romania]]n industrialist and rival of [[Nicolae Malaxa]], who played an important role before [[World War II]]. Together with {{Interlanguage link multi|Aristide Blank|ro}} and Malaxa, he was one of the major businessmen present in [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s ''[[Camarilla (history)|camarilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. G. Waldeck]], ''Athene Palace'', New York: Robert M. McBride and Company, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; He was managing director of the Iron Domains and Factory (UDR) of [[Reşiţa]], the largest stock company that existed in Romania before the establishment of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]].

Born in [[Galaţi]] city to [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] parents, he graduated from the Academy for Advanced Studies in [[Vienna]]. He was president of the General Association of Industry of [[Banat]], Vice General of the Union of Industrialists of Romania and Senator at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Galați.

Auschnitt managed UDR successfully, leading it to become the Romanian firm with the largest capital (1 billion [[Romanian leu|lei]]), the highest turnover and the most employees (16,669 in 1938, and 22,892 in 1948). Together with his brother Edgar Ausnit (d. 1968), he owned several steel and munitions businesses including the Titan-Nădrag-Călan chain, which had over 4,900 employees in 1938. He was among the managers of various foreign companies in Vienna or [[Munich]], as well as of Romanian-based companies such as the [[Romanian Telephone Society]] and the [[Chrissoveloni Bank]]. He left Romania during the [[World War II]], eventually retreating into the [[United States]], where he died. All Ausnit property was confiscated by the wartime [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes, and later [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalized]] by the communist regime.

He started a degree in computer science at the [[University of Nottingham]], but soon changed to study international business at [[American Intercontinental University]] in 2002, where he obtained a bachelor's degree. He then enrolled at [[Cass Business School]] at [[City University London|City University]].&lt;ref name="midastouch1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://midastouch.asia/mohd-nazifuddin/ |title=Mohd Nazifuddin |publisher=Midas Touch Asia |date= |accessdate=2016-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226070103/http://midastouch.asia/mohd-nazifuddin/ |archivedate=2017-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Nazifuddin started his career with UBS Wealth Management Hong Kong and worked there for three years, before starting as an entrepreneur in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="midastouch1"/&gt;

Nazifuddin is the youngest-ever vice-president of the [[Olympic Council of Malaysia]] (OCM), when he was appointed in August 2015.&lt;ref name="themalaymailonline1"/&gt;

Nazifuddin has been named in the [[Panama Papers]], and has responded that he is no longer involved in the two companies involved in the data leak.&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Victoria Brown |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/04/05/nazif-najib-says-ties-cut-with-companies-implicated-in-panama-papers/ |title=Nazif Najib: Ties cut with companies implicated in Panama Papers - Nation &amp;#124; The Star Online |website=Thestar.com.my |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazifuddin further stated, "I held directorships in two companies based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI): Jay Marriot International and PCJ International Venture Limited. These companies were incorporated by the international law firm Mossack Fonseca," and that he had transferred all of his Jay Marriot shares to fellow director Ch'ng Soon Sen's sister and had resigned in 2011, and that PCJ was shut down a year after its 2013 foundation and had had no business transactions.&lt;ref name="thestar1"/&gt;

{{Other uses|Muhtar}}
'''Muhtar''' is the elected village head in [[villages of Turkey]]. In [[city|cities]], likewise, each quarter has a muhtar but with a slightly different status. Muhtars and their village councils ({{lang-tr|Azalar or İhtiyar heyeti}}) are elected during [[local election|local elections]] for five years. However, [[political party|political parties]] are not permitted to stand candidates for these posts.

== Rural muhtars ==

In each village, muhtar is the highest elected authority of the village. (There is no mayor in a village.) According to the [[Village Law (Turkey)|Village Law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mevzuat.gov.tr/MevzuatMetin/1.3.442.pdf Law 442 of 1924] (as amended; originally 68 [[T.C. Resmi Gazete]] 237, 7 April 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; tasks of the muhtars are in two groups: compulsory tasks are about public health, primary school education, security and notification of public announcements, etc. Noncompulsory tasks depend on the demands of village residents.

== Urban muhtars ==

In each [[town]] there are several [[neighbourhoods]]. In medium-sized cities, there may be tens of neighbourhoods, and in big cities, the number may exceed well over 100. Each has a muhtar. Urban muhtars have fewer tasks than rural muhtars &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilgispot.com/7111/muhtarin-gorevleri-nelerdir An essay on the tasks ({{tr icon}})]&lt;/ref&gt; like registering the residents of the quarter and providing official copies of birth certificates and ID cards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5158">'''The New York Women’s Agenda''' (NYWA) is an umbrella organization of women's groups in the [[New York City]] metropolitan area.  Its membership consists of both nonprofit women's organizations and individuals.

==About NYWA==

Founded in 1992 by [[Elinor Guggenheimer]], NYWA is a [[nonprofit]] organization dedicated to bettering the lives of [[women and children]] of New York.

NYWA's members represent the diversity of New York City and include community-based groups; [[religious]], [[ethnic]], and [[political groups]]; [[professional associations]]; and issues-based groups. Through NYWA, these groups unite to work on issues of common interest and to advocate for public policy.

==Agendas==

NYWA is involved in various activities which focus on a broad range of public policy issues that affect the quality of life of women and their families.  These are grouped into three main areas, or "agendas" that are the focus of NYWA's work each year.

* Governmental Affairs Agenda: Their most recent success was the Fair Pay Forum held at [[Hunter College]] in December 2008 featuring [[Lilly Ledbetter]] which stimulated passage of the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]]. "The legislation expanded workers’ rights to sue in this kind of case, and relaxed the statute of limitations, restarting the six-month clock every time the worker receives a paycheck." &lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/lilly_m_ledbetter/index.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Lilly%20Ledbetter&amp;st=cse] "Times Topics" ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the most current information, go to NYWA/EPCNYC BLOG: www.nywaepcnyc.org
* Economic Security Agenda: Most recently, NYWA has developed the ''Strategic Business Leadership'' program with the [[New York University|School of Continuing and Professional Studies]], [[New York University]], Department of Leadership and Human Capital Management.  This program is tailored specifically towards women leaders of profit and nonprofit organizations and government agencies who are looking to improve their leadership skills and increase their organization’s effectiveness.  Participants in this program receive an Executive Certificate in Strategic Business Leadership.
* Quality of Life Agenda: focuses on what may improve living conditions for New York women and their families, including affordability of housing, the physical environment, recreation, health, safety, culture, and the sense of community.

==Programs==

* Financial Literacy: Financial literacy was first addressed in 1998 when [[Muriel Siebert]] was NYWA president.  Now, in conjunction with the [[Manhattan Chamber of Commerce]] NYWA created ''The New York City Financial Literacy Guide for Girls and Women.'' "Women are in a special need of becoming financially literate. Yet women often do not want to admit their problems in money management. This Guide provides numerous different resources including self-study possibilities as well as workshops, courses and events."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manhattancc.org/common/news/reports/detail.cfm?Classification=reports&amp;QID=5978&amp;TopicID=]  The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/ref&gt;
* New York Breaks the Silence Together: This program was begun by [[Linda Fairstein]], former chief of the [[Manhattan District Attorney]]'s sex crimes unit because, "We lose the victims before the trial...The victims withdraw, choose not to prosecute, some because of fear of reprisal, some because of the psychological feelings involved. The perception has been nationally...that these cases don't do well in the system"&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E7D81E39F935A35751C1A963958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/F/Fairstein,%20Linda&amp;scp=26&amp;sq=%22Linda%20Fairstein%22&amp;st=cse] by George James, ''The New York Times,'' 12/6/95.&lt;/ref&gt;
*New York Reads Together:  This is the first citywide book discussion project to foster literacy. Supported by the [[New York City]] school system and nationally known newscaster [[Roz Abrams]], it is one of NYWA's most successful programs.  At its 2005 commencement, [[Pace University]] President [[David A. Caputo]] honored Roz Abrams's work on this program, "You serve as cochair of the New York Reads Together Program, a program of New York’s Women’s Agenda that aims to foster citywide discussions based on people all reading the same book at the same time." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pace.edu/page.cfm?doc_id=15480] David A Caputo, Pace University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Star Breakfast==

In 2008, the Star Breakfast presented the inaugural Elinor Guggenheimer Lifetime Achievement Award to [[Barbara Walters]].  Honored speakers were New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] and first lady of New York State [[Michelle Paterson]].  In 2009, [[Gloria Steinem]] presented this award to [[Jane Fonda]].  Michelle Paterson was honored speaker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">The '''New Zealand Press Council''' is a [[Non Governmental Organisation]] which exists to uphold standards in the [[New Zealand]] [[print media]] and promote freedom of speech in New Zealand. Founded in 1975, it is enabled to hear complaints against newspapers and other publications, particularly regarding allegations of [[bias]] and inaccuracy. It can order an offending publication to publish a summary of the Council's ruling, and will generally specify the prominence of the summary (for example, where in the newspaper). 

The Council consists of an independent chair, five members representing the public, two representing the Newspaper Publishers’ Association, one representing magazine publishers, and two journalists who are appointed by the journalists’ union, the [[Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union]] (EPMU). It is entirely funded by the print media industry. 

In March 2013 the Law Commission proposed moving complaints about news and current affairs out of the jurisdiction of the Press Council, the [[Broadcasting Standards Authority]] and the Online Media Standards Authority, placing them under a proposed new body, the [[News Media Standards Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/new-media-regulator-proposed-2013032611|work=3 News NZ|title=New media regulator proposed|author=Lloyd Burr and Kim Choe|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pareto.PNG|thumb|Simple example of a Pareto chart using hypothetical data showing the relative frequency of reasons for arriving late at work|right|384px]]
A '''Pareto chart''', named after  [[Vilfredo Pareto]], is a type of chart that contains both [[bar chart|bars]] and a [[line chart|line graph]], where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line.

The left vertical axis is the [[Frequency probability|frequency of occurrence]], but it can alternatively represent cost or another important [[Units of measurement|unit of measure]].  The right vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of the total number of occurrences, total cost, or total of the particular unit of measure. Because the values are in decreasing order, the cumulative function is a [[concave function]]. To take the example below, in order to lower the amount of late arrivals by 78%, it is sufficient to solve the first three issues.

The purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors. In [[quality control]], it often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, and so on. [[Leland Wilkinson|Wilkinson]] (2006) 
devised an algorithm for producing statistically based acceptance limits (similar to [[confidence interval]]s) for each bar in the Pareto chart.

These charts can be generated by simple spreadsheet programs, such as [[Apache OpenOffice]]/[[LibreOffice Calc]] &lt;ref name=LIB&gt;[https://help.libreoffice.org/Chart/Chart_Type_Column_and_Line Chart Type Column and Line]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Excel]],&lt;ref name=BET&gt;Pareto Chart in Excel [http://best-excel-tutorial.com/56-charts/77-pareto-chart Best Excel Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; visualization tools such as [[ThoughtSpot]] or [[Tableau Software]],&lt;ref name=TAB&gt;[http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/pareto-analysis Pareto in Tableau]&lt;/ref&gt; specialized statistical software tools, and online quality charts generators.

The Pareto chart is one of the [[Seven Basic Tools of Quality|seven basic tools of quality control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/seven-basic-quality-tools/overview/overview.html | author = Nancy R.

'''''Project Space Station''''' is a game published in 1985 by [[HESware]], originally written for  the [[Commodore 64]] home computer, then ported to the [[Apple II series]] and [[PC compatible]]s.

==Summary==
In the game the player is put in control of [[NASA]] and tasked with building and maintaining a space station and generating enough money with commercial contracts to make up for an anemic yearly budget. This can be seen as a discrete set of phases, except that they all proceed simultaneously. The exception is at the beginning of the game where the player has unlimited time in the planning phase before the game clock starts.

In the planning phase, the player first allocates the funds they have to various budget items, like crew selection, station modules, and research and development. Then they choose their crew, who have intrinsic task sets (like piloting and physics), and varying levels of competence and compatibility with other potential employees. From there the player purchases equipment like space suits and satellites, and station modules like laboratories and solar arrays. Then they schedule their launches using the two space shuttles available (''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', though the initial release used the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]), and have their budget approved. In the final stage of the planning phase the player can create a simulated station with an unlimited number of parts, and without dealing with the later constrictions of the EVA.

The launch phase has the player decide whether launch conditions are stable enough to merit launch. If they give the implicit go-ahead, they engage in a light arcade sequence where the player attempts to keep the shuttle on course throughout its orbital burn. The more successful the player is, the closer the shuttle will be to the station.

Once the shuttle is in orbit, the player is tasked to assemble the components they brought up (or to fire off any satellites they have contracts for) in the Extra-Vehicular Activity, or EVA phase. Here the player directly controls an Orbital Construction Pod, a small ship with mechanical arms that an astronaut can use to move large equipment. Being careless here could have consequences as the pod or equipment may become damaged, and it may run out of fuel and become stranded until another pod can rescue it.  Consequences were not limited to equipment damage: Stranded astronauts in pods could die when oxygen ran out.  Other crew hazards included solar flares, which could kill astronauts on the station or shuttle if precautions (using an emergency module in station design) were not taken.  Crew died in reverse alphabetical order from solar flares.

The player then transfers crew to and from the space station and assigns them to research tasks. Completing these tasks awards the player with government contracts that supplement NASA's budget. A math bug (or intentional cheat) in the game allowed an infinite supply of money, if the player allocated more than $10,000K to any budget. For example, if $800k is spent, the budget would be recalculated to $19,200K instead of $9,200, as expected.

Finally the player lands the shuttle. After determining that landing conditions are adequate, the player again keeps the shuttle on course as it turns from the station and enters its descent. Skill here determines how close the shuttle will be to the optimal point from the runway. After this the player controls the shuttle with a simple landing simulator viewed from the side. The more abrupt or overshot the landing, the more damage will be done to the shuttle and the longer it will need to be repaired before it can venture out on another mission.

The game is played using a menu system. Every option can be queried for in-game help, and every major task has a tutorial that simulates that task without the consequences of failure, and sometimes with additional assistance (like being able to pause a landing attempt). Another major feature is the message system that alerts the player when there are changes to mission status, wherever the player might be within the menu system.

'''Pudong''' is a [[list of administrative divisions of Shanghai|district]] of [[Shanghai]] located east of the [[Huangpu River]] across from the historic city center of Shanghai in [[Puxi]]. The name refers to its historic position as "The East [[bank (river)|Bank]]" of the [[Huangpu River]], which flows through central Shanghai, although it is now administered as the '''Pudong New Area''', a [[State-level new areas of the People's Republic of China|state-level new area]] which extends all the way to the [[East China Sea]].

The traditional area of Pudong is now home to the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]], the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]], and the [[Shanghai Tower]]. These modern skyscrapers directly face [[Puxi]]'s historic [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]], a remnant of former [[concessions in China|foreign concessions]] in China. The rest of the new area includes the [[Port of Shanghai]], the [[Shanghai Expo Park|Shanghai Expo]] and [[Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park]], [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], the [[Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve]], and the [[Shanghai Disney Resort]].

==History==
''Pudong''&amp;mdash;literally "The East Bank of the Huangpu River"&amp;mdash;originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's [[Old City of Shanghai|Old City]] and [[Shanghai International Settlement|foreign concessions]]. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the districts of [[Puxi]] on the west bank: [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], and [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]]. Pudong was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu]], [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Nanshi District, Shanghai|Nanshi]], [[Wusong District|Wusong]] and [[Chuansha County]]. In October 1, 1992 the original area of Pudong County and Chuansha County merged and established Pudong New Area.

In 1993, the Chinese government set up a [[Special Economic Zone]] in Chuansha, creating the Pudong New Area. The western tip of the Pudong district was designated as the [[Lujiazui|Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone]] and has become a financial hub of modern China.  Several landmark buildings were constructed, including the Oriental Pearl Tower, the Jin Mao Building, and the [[supertall]] Shanghai World Financial Center {{convert|494|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} and Shanghai Tower (projected to reach {{convert|565.6|m|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}). These buildings&amp;mdash;all along Century Avenue and visible from the historic Bund&amp;mdash;now form the most common [[skyline]] of Shanghai.

On May 6, 2009, it was disclosed that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] had approved the proposal to merge [[Nanhui District]] with Pudong and comprise the majority of eastern Shanghai. In 2010, Pudong was host to the main venues of the [[Shanghai Expo]], whose grounds now form a [[Shanghai Expo Park|public park]].

Pudong New Area consist of the original Pudong County (northeastern portion of Shanghai County), [[Chuansha County]], and [[Nanhui District|Nanhui County]].

==Government==
[[District of China|Districts]] of the [[direct-controlled municipality]] of Shanghai are administratively on the same level as [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]. However, the government of Pudong has a status equivalent to that of a [[sub-provincial city]], which is a half-level above a prefecture-level city. This is due to Pudong's size and importance as the financial hub of China. The Pudong Communist Party Secretary is the top office of the district, followed by the district governor of Pudong.  The Pudong party chief is customarily also a member of the Shanghai [[Party Standing Committee]].

On April 27, 2015, People's Government of Pudong New Area is working with China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone Administrative Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150428/43646093_0.shtml |script-title=zh:上海自贸区空间扩大4倍 将与浦东新区合署办公 |date=April 27, 2015|accessdate =April 27, 2015|publisher=People's Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Pudong literally means "East Bank". Pudong is bounded by the [[Huangpu River]] in the west and the [[East China Sea]] in the east. Pudong is distinguished from [[Puxi]] ("West Bank"), the older part of [[Shanghai]]. It has an area of {{convert|1210.4|km2}} and according to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], a population of 5,044,430 inhabitants, 1.9 million more than in 2000. Currently, at least 2.1 million of residents of Pudong are newcomers from other provinces or cities in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} China Statistical Office. [http://wenku.baidu.com/view/4f76dd6f1eb91a37f1115c3d.html Data from the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pudong is the most populous district in [[Shanghai]]. According to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], it has 5,044,430 people in 1,814,802 families, around 1/4 of Shanghai's total population, an explosive growth since the last census thanks to immigrants.&lt;ref name="10thcencus"&gt;Summary of Pudong Data from the Sixth National Population Census http://gov.pudong.gov.cn/pudongNews_inform/Info/Detail_365360.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Pudong's resident population growth is well above national average because it is a popular immigration destination. The 2010 census shows a 58.26% increase in the last decade, or an annual pace of 4.7%. In particular, the district saw am immigration growth of 189.5%, or an annual pace of 11.22%.

Excluding immigrants, the birth rate is 0.806% while the death rate is 0.729, resulting a net growth of 0.077%. The [[total fertility rate]] is 1.03, well below the replacement level.&lt;ref&gt;Population analysis of Pudong, 2011 http://rkjsw.sh.gov.cn/dr/qxinfo/310115/2012227/000000003500038000944464363.html?openpath=spfp/qxinfo/310115 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109061229/http://rkjsw.sh.gov.cn/dr/qxinfo/310115/2012227/000000003500038000944464363.html?openpath=spfp%2Fqxinfo%2F310115 |date=2015-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The district actually has a negative registered household population growth if immigrants are excluded, thus the growth is purely driven by immigration.

The 2010 Census shows a population density of 3,909/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. About 3/4 of the population live in the northern part and part of city center called "Northern Territory". 1/4 live in the "Southern Territory" that was the Nanhui District. The Northern Territory has a 6,667 population density, while the Southern Territory has 1,732/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Suburbs saw a greater increase in population during 2000-2010 with the help of the city's suburb expansion policy. Some counties in the traditional city center saw a population decrease.

With the Nanhui District merger in May 2009, the size of Pudong's economy grew. The district's 2015 [[gross domestic product]] amounts to an estimated 789.8 billion RMB (~US$113.5 billion), with services comprising 70% of economic output.&lt;ref name="pudong"&gt;{{cite news |script-title=zh:经济发展|url=http://pdxq.sh.gov.cn/shpd/about/20161208/008001002_a9a039e5-07fb-4843-a7cd-7db30502f3b1.htm|date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[GDP per capita]] is approximately $21,911. The area is divided into four distinct economic districts. Apart from [[Lujiazui]] Trade and Finance Zone, there is [[Waigaoqiao]] Free Trade Zone, the largest free trade zone in [[mainland China]] covering approximately {{convert|10|km2}} in north-east Pudong.  The [[Jinqiao Export Processing Zone]] is another major industrial area in Pudong covering {{convert|19|km2}}  [[Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park]] is a special area for technology-oriented businesses.

The Pudong area continues to experience rapid development, especially in the commercial sector, with 1.3 million square meters of prime office space reaching completion in 2008, more than the previous two years combined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightfrank.com.cn Knight Frank China] Knight Frank China, Shanghai Commercial Market Quarterly Report, Q4 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Pudong has also attracted considerable fixed asset and real estate investment, reporting 87.268 billion RMB in fixed asset investment and 27.997 billion RMB in real estate investment in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightfrank.com.cn Knight Frank China] Knight Frank China, Shanghai Commercial Market Quarterly Report, Q1 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] opened its doors in 1999, shortening the travel time for visitors.

In the same year, [[Line 2, Shanghai Metro|Line 2]] of the [[Shanghai Metro]] commenced services. An extension brought the line further east, where it serves the [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|airport]]. Other lines, namely Lines [[Line 4, Shanghai Metro|4]], [[Line 6, Shanghai Metro|6]], [[Line 7, Shanghai Metro|7]], [[Line 8, Shanghai Metro|8]], [[Line 9, Shanghai Metro|9]], [[Line 11, Shanghai Metro|11]], [[Line 12, Shanghai Metro|12]], [[Line 13, Shanghai Metro|13]] and [[Line 16, Shanghai Metro|16]] also have sections that serve parts of Pudong. A [[Shanghai Maglev Train|magnetic levitation train]] began operating in 2004, moving passengers between the airport and Longyang Road Metro station.
[[Image:Huangpu River-The Bund.JPG|thumb|Ships on the Huangpu River with Pudong in view]]

Pudong is connected to [[Puxi]] by several tunnels and four major [[bridge]]s. The first of these bridges were the [[Nanpu Bridge]] (1991) and the [[Yangpu Bridge]] (1993).  The [[Xupu Bridge]] opened in 1996. The latest of these is [[Lupu Bridge]], which is the world's second longest [[arch bridge]] and was completed in 2002. Currently there are five tunnels that link the two sides, Dapu Rd. Tunnel, the first tunnel across the Huangpu River, Yan'an Rd. Tunnel, running east-west, and Dalian Rd. Tunnel, running north-south, [[Fuxing Rd.]] Tunnel, complementing the Yan'an Rd. Tunnel, Waihuan Tunnel, one part of Shanghai Outer Ring Express. Two new tunnels linking [[Lujiazui]] to [[Puxi]] are under construction.

Roads in Pudong have no particular longitudinal or latitudinal orientation. Major thoroughfares Pudong Avenue, Zhangyang Road and Yanggao Road run east-west until [[Yangpu Bridge]] before turning gradually to become north-south. Century Avenue crosses all three major roads and extends from [[Lujiazui]] to Century Park. Yanggao Road extends south to the A20, Shanghai's outer Ring road, which runs east-west from [[Xupu Bridge]] and then north-south beginning at the interchange near Renxi Village, when the east-west expressway turns into Yingbin Avenue, headed for Pudong International Airport.

===Metro===
Pudong is currently served by ten metro lines and one tram line operated by [[Shanghai Metro]] and one maglev line operated by [[Shanghai Maglev Train]] and one suburban line operated by [[China Railway]]:

'''Pulpwood''' refers to [[timber]] with the principal use of making [[wood pulp]] for [[paper]] production.

==Applications==
* Trees raised specifically for pulp production account for 16% of world pulp production, old growth forests 9% and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the balance.&lt;ref name="chase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |title=Paper Chase |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last=Martin |first=Sam |year=2004 |work= |publisher=Ecology Communications, Inc. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619104819/http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |archivedate=2007-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforestation is practiced in most areas, so trees are a renewable resource.
* Pulpwood is also used as the raw material for some wood products, such as oriented strand board (OSB). {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
* There is an increasing demand for pulpwood as a source of 'green energy' by the bio-energy sector for burning and baking into charcoal.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Properties==
The fiber length of the cellulose fiber is the most important parameter of the pulpwood and determines what it may be used for. The first separation is into softwood and hardwood, that have long and short fibers respectively. In [[Paper mill|paper]] production fiber from softwood give tensile strength and fibers from hardwood give [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]].

==Sources==

===Logging===
In the [[logging]] of mixed [[forest]] stands, the better [[tree]]s are usually used for sawlogs for [[lumber]] production, while the inferior trees and components are harvested for pulpwood production. Pulpwood usually derives from four types of woody materials in a mixed logging operation:
* Open-grown trees, that are heavily branched low on the trunk, and so make poor sawlogs.
* Dead or diseased trees.
* Tops cut from trees harvested for sawlogs (branches are rarely used since they contain little usable wood after the bark has been removed).
* Small trees, too small to harvest for sawlogs.

Natural forest stands may also be harvested solely for pulpwood where, for various reasons, the value of the trees as sawlogs is low. This may be due to the predominant species in the forest stand (for example, some [[aspen]] forests in northern North America), or to the relative proximity of the nearest sawmill or [[pulp mill]].

===Plantations===
Pulpwood is also harvested from [[plantations|tree farms]] established for the specific purpose of growing pulpwood, with little or minimal sawlog production. Monoculture of species intended specifically for pulpwood include [[Pinus taeda|loblolly]] and [[Pinus elliottii|slash]] pines in the southern USA; various species of eucalyptus (most commonly ''Eucalyptus globulus'' and ''Eucalyptus grandis'') in Latin America, Iberian Peninsula, Australia, south-east Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Areerat  |last=Kittisiri|title=Impacts of Monoculture: The Case of Eucalyptus Plantations in Thailand |work=Monoculture: Environmental and Social Effects and Sustainable Alternatives Conference  |pages= |publisher=|date=1996-06-02 |location=Songkhla, Thailand  |url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/7813/euca_1.htm |accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207103456/http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/7813/euca_1.htm|archivedate=2006-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and southern Africa and acacia (most commonly ''Acacia mangium'') in south-east Asia and southern Africa.

===Salvage cuttings===
Salvage cuts after forest fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other natural disasters are often used for pulpwood. An alternative source of wood for use in [[Kraft process|Kraft pulping]] is recovered lumber from demolition, industrial processing of wood and wooden pallets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Aziz |last=Ahmed |author2=Akhtar, Masood |author3=Myers, Gary C. |author4=Scott, Gary M. |title=Kraft Pulping of Industrial Wood Waste |booktitle=TAPPI Pulping Conference, Montreal |pages=993–1000 |publisher= |year=1998 |location= |url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1998/amhed98b.pdf |accessdate=2007-10-16 |id= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203174904/http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1998/amhed98b.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood residuals===
Saw residuals are used as pulp wood. The most important of these are the side cuttings from lumber edger. This gives wood with almost only [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] and no heartwood. The sapwood is easier to [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Johan|editor1-last= Gullichsen|editor2-first= Hannu|editor2-last= Paulapuro|title= Forest Products Chemistry|series= Paper making Science and Technology |volume= 6A |year= 1999|publisher= Capet YO |location=Helsinki, Finland |language= |ISBN=952-5216-06-3 |page=298|chapter= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a more open structure and less content of [[Black liquor|extractive]] than the heartwood. The fiber length of sapwood is generally longer than the fiber length of heartwood. The sapwood is also normally lighter and that is an advantage when producing mechanical pulp as less Bleaching of wood pulp bleaching is needed.

Earlier{{clarify|date=November 2018}} sawdust had some limited use in paper production. It gives very short fibers that are suitable as part of the furnish for paper tissue and [[Printing and writing paper|writing papers]]. Saw blades have become thinner and with smaller teeth making the sawdust too small as fiber source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Biermann |first=Christopher J. |author link= |title=Essentials of Pulping and Paper making|page = 22 |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego |ISBN=0-12-097360-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teheranno''' (alternatively '''Teheran-ro''', translation "[[Tehran]] Boulevard") is a street in the [[Gangnam district]] of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. It runs from [[Gangnam Station]] through [[Yeoksam-dong]] and into [[Samseong-dong]]. It is colloquially known as "'''Teheran Valley'''" (after [[Silicon Valley]]) due to the number of [[internet]]-related companies operating there. The district of [[Gangnam-gu]] experienced phenomenal growth and waves of construction, with Teheranno becoming one of the busiest streets in South Korea. Its counterpart, Seoul St. in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] , runs in the north of that city, close to the [[Evin]] district.

Teheranno is a 3.5&amp;nbsp;km section of Korean Highway 90, and runs eastwards from [[Gangnam Station]] to [[Samseong Station]] and the [[COEX]]/[[KWTC]] complex. [[Yeoksam Station|Yeoksam]] and [[Seolleung Station|Seolleung]] stations are also on Teheranno. All stations are on [[Seoul Subway Line 2]].

Some of Korea's tallest skyscrapers and most expensive real estate are in Teheranno, while Seoul Metropolitan Government estimates that more than half of Korea's [[venture capital]], some 200,000,000,000 won (approximately $200,000,000), is invested in Teheran Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.seoul.go.kr/business/indust/indust_05ven_02.html|title=Teheran Valley, Seoul Metropolitan Government|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408214016/http://english.seoul.go.kr/business/indust/indust_05ven_02.html|archivedate=2004-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:لوح یادبود خیابان تهران در سئول.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The tablet of commemorating the visit by [[Gholamreza Nikpey|Mr. Gholamreza Nikpay]], Tehran's Mayor, to Mr. Kuh Cha-chun, Seoul's Mayor]]
On 27 June 1977, the Seoul Metropolitan Government suggested that the city of Seoul and [[Tehran]], pre-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] [[Pahlavi Dynasty|Iran]] exchange the names of streets on the [[Iran–South Korea relations|occasion of the visit]] to Korea of [[Gholamreza Nikpey]], [[Mayor of Tehran]]. The following year, Samneungno street was renamed Teheranno, which then ran through a relatively underdeveloped area that been annexed into Seoul in 1963.

==Economy==
The area hosts major domestic [[internet portals]] [[Daum Communications|Daum]] and [[Naver]] as well as [[Google]]. [[Samsung Electronics]] and [[Hynix]] both operate offices there. Various Korean and international financial and business institutions including [[POSCO]], [[Standard Chartered]] and [[Citibank]] also maintain offices there. 

The headquarters of [[LOEN Entertainment]], one of the largest music companies in the country, is located in Teheranno.

'''WDCH-FM''' (99.1 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a radio station currently broadcasting a [[business news]] format to the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. metropolitan area]].  Licensed to [[Bowie, Maryland]] the station is currently owned by [[Entercom]] and operated by [[Bloomberg L.P.]] Its transmitter is located near [[Crofton, Maryland]], and the broadcasting studios are located near the [[Washington Navy Yard]] along the north/west bank of the [[Anacostia River]] (Eastern Branch of the [[Potomac River]]) in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|Southeast Washington]]. 

WDCH is one of the few stations in the Baltimore/Washington corridor that directly targets ''both'' markets. This is because its transmitter is located halfway between the two cities, providing a strong city-grade signal to both.

WDCH-FM often airs [[D.C. United]] soccer and [[Washington Wizards]] pro [[basketball]] games in the [[NBA]] whenever sister station [[WJFK-FM]] (106.7 "The Fan") is already covering a game elsewhere.

==History==
{{see also|WHFS (historic)}}
The 99.1&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency was originally '''WNAV-FM''', licensed to [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and featuring a [[beautiful music]] format. It competed with similar stations in both the Baltimore and Washington markets. In 1983, the station changed calls to '''WLOM-FM'''.

In 1983 the owners of WHFS, then licensed to [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] at 102.3 FM, sold that station for $2&amp;nbsp;million and used the money to purchase WLOM along with and its sister station [[WNAV]] (1430 AM).  The '''WHFS''' format and call letters were then moved to 99.1 FM, licensed to operate with 50,000 watts ([[list of broadcast station classes|Class B FM]]) with much higher power than the 102.3 facility, which broadcasts with only 3,000 watts (Class A) at the time; a Class A FM is the lowest coverage area as opposed to a [[list of broadcast station classes|Class A]] AM which is the greatest coverage area.  Thus WHFS on 99.1 could then be heard in Baltimore, Washington, and much of the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]]. Eventually Einstein's group sold WHFS. When the station switched formats, it was located at the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity Broadcasting]] Center in [[Lanham, Maryland]]. The 102.3 frequency is now occupied by an Urban AC station in Washington, using the call letters [[WMMJ]] and nicknamed "Majic 102.3".

{{see also|HFStival}}
Since 1990, WHFS has hosted an event called the HFStival, an annual (sometimes semi-annual) day-long (sometimes two-day-long) outdoor concert. The concert, often held at Washington's [[RFK Stadium]], features a variety local and national acts; for example, the 2004 lineup included [[The Cure]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Modest Mouse]], the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], and [[Cypress Hill]]. Robert Benjamin, Bob Waugh and Bill Glasser took the HFStival from a small yearly concert in Fairfax, Virginia, to a large festival in Washington, D.C. that was headlined by major acts and was surrounded by culturally significant booths, games, food, and rides, as well as an outdoor second stage. Amongst others, [[Billy Zero]] was instrumental in growing the [[HFStival]] Locals Only Stage where bands like [[Good Charlotte]] and [[Jimmie's Chicken Shack]] got their big break. The term Locals Only stuck and is still used today and the Locals Only Stage was copied by Modern Rock Stations across the Country.

In the mid-1990s, Liberty Broadcasting published a quarterly magazine titled "WHFS Press" that was mailed to listeners and available in local music outlets.&lt;ref&gt;"WHFS Press", Liberty Broadcasting, Winter 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Though becoming famous as a cutting-edge station playing the latest underground music (and often beating the mainstream to the punch by months and even years), under Infinity Broadcasting's [[ownership]], the station became the local modern alternative rock station in the mid 90s.  No longer playing rather obscure progressive rock, nor the classic and hard rock of its Baltimore competitor [[WIYY]], HFS was now formatted more towards a younger set of fans who were more apt to listen to [[Green Day]] and Fuel than less mainstream artists such as [[Fugazi]] or [[Lou Reed]]. The station played much of the alternative hits that were touted by the mainstream press and MTV, turning off many old-school HFS listeners, but in turn gaining many listeners in the 18–24 age demographic.

During this period, WHFS featured a specialty show called "Now Hear This", hosted by Dave Marsh, which highlighted indie and local music.  The station never fully reverted to its prior all-indie status, but it did begin to combine more underground programming with its modern rock format.

In 1999, WHFS released a New Music New Video Compilation Volume 1 on VHS that was distributed free at Washington area [[Tower Records]] outlets. It featured tracks by [[Cyclefly]], [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]], [[Fastball (band)|Fastball]], [[Elliott Smith]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Eve 6]], [[3 Colours Red]], [[Puya (band)|Puya]], and [[Joydrop]].

==="El Zol 99.1 FM"===
At noon on January 12, 2005, 99.1 switched to a [[Tropical (radio format)|Tropical]] Latin music format. Its call letters were changed to '''WZLL'''  on January 28, 2005, and then again to '''WLZL''' on February 5, 2005, and the station was rebranded as "El Zol 99.1 FM". [[AOL]], which had a partnership with Infinity Broadcasting and recognized that many people would miss the old WHFS format, quickly launched an internet-only streaming radio station with a playlist much like that of WHFS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7886-2005Jan13.html WHFS: For Many, The Only Alternative]&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to numerous complaints about the format change, which attracted media attention, then-owner Infinity brought the WHFS format back a month later on the 105.7 FM frequency (now [[WJZ-FM]]). The WHFS call letters have since relocated first to a talk station on 1580 AM (now [[WJFK (AM)|WJFK]]), then to [[WUUB|a sister station]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]].  WLZL was also [[CBS Radio]]'s first Spanish radio station, and the company's only Spanish station outside the southern United States.

On November 16, 2011, CBS Radio announced plans to acquire WFSI (107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) from religious broadcaster [[Family Radio]], with the intention of moving WLZL's Spanish Tropical format and ''"El Zol"'' branding from 99.1 to 107.9, with a new [[News radio|all-news]] format launched on 99.1 FM to compete directly with the region's leading all-news format station, long-time powerhouse [[WTOP-FM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/official-cbs-buying-dc-baltimore-wfsi-1079-will-debut-all-news-on-991 |title=Radio-Info: "Official: CBS buying D.C.-Baltimore WFSI (107.9), will debut all-news on 99.1", November 16, 2011. |access-date=November 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120012948/http://www.radio-info.com/news/official-cbs-buying-dc-baltimore-wfsi-1079-will-debut-all-news-on-991 |archive-date=November 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsradio.com"&gt;[http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease145027-11-16-2011.html CBS Radio press release: "CBS RADIO TO BRING ALL-NEWS STATION TO 99.1 FM IN WASHINGTON, D.C.", November 16, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 99.1&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency then adopted the '''WNEW-FM''' call sign, which was named after the former [[WBBR|AM]] and [[WNEW-FM|FM]] stations of the same name in New York City.

On December 27, 2011, WNEW-FM ended its Christmas music stunting and began stunting with the 1981 Silver Anniversary Edition of ''[[The History of Rock and Roll]]''.

===All News 99.1===
[[File:WNEW991.png|thumb|Logo as All News 99.1, 2012–15]]
The all-news format launched at noon on January 22, 2012;&lt;ref name=rinsight-callandsoftlaunch/&gt; the station initially planned to launch at 5 a.m. on January 19,&lt;ref name=ri-wnewlaunch&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS Radio's "All News 99.1" WNEW to debut in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, 1/19|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/cbs-radios-all-news-991-wnew-to-debut-in-washington-dc-on-thursday-119|accessdate=January 3, 2012|newspaper=Radio-Info.com|date=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but postponed it due to technical problems.&lt;ref name=ri-wnewdelay&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS delays the launch of Washington DC's "News 99.1"|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/cbs-delays-the-launch-of-washington-dcs-news-991|accessdate=January 18, 2012|newspaper=Radio-Info.com|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station also broadcasts simultaneously in [[HD Radio]] on [[WIAD|94.7 FM – HD2]] and [[WJZ-FM|105.7 FM – HD2]].

WNEW-FM regularly programmed traffic reports and weather every five minutes between 5&amp;nbsp;am and 7&amp;nbsp;pm on the ones and sixes weekdays, and every ten minutes on the ones (six times an hour) the rest of the week (both from CBS local affiliate television station [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]], Channel 9), sports updates twice an hour at :25 and :55 from sister all-sports station [[WJFK-FM]], entertainment news once an hour, and business news from [[Bloomberg News]] twice an hour at :15 and :45. When breaking news warranted, WNEW-FM would break format to provide continuous coverage of any event. When the station began, it had traffic reports only every ten minutes, and had weather reports every four minutes. At the beginning, it focused on Washington area news, traffic, and weather. In 2014, the station expanded its coverage of the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] by providing news, traffic and weather reports, and coordinated with on-air personalities in the news, sports and weather departments from its long-time market-leading station [[WJZ-TV]]; the change was widely promoted and advertised at the time. This was thought to be an opportune time, since competitor [[WFED|WTOP]] had switched from its long-time wide-ranging AM signal at 1500, to several FM repeaters which curtailed its traditionally strong signal across two states and the District. WNEW-FM was now the only station to provide coverage to ''both'' [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Baltimore]], unlike WTOP, which had, since the early 1970s, focused on the Washington area and only occasionally carried Baltimore news events, sports or the slightly different weather and temperature readings.

As done with other CBS-owned all-news stations, WNEW-FM provided the audio feed of such network news programming as the daily ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' each weeknight at 7&amp;nbsp;pm, Sunday's ''[[Face the Nation]]'' interview/discussion program, and the weekly Sunday news magazine, ''[[60 Minutes]]''; the latter's simulcast was frequently promoted by WJZ-TV, but the radio broadcast was paused every 10 minutes for traffic and weather updates, and as a result, the WNEW-FM simulcast would be a few minutes behind the CBS television broadcast. In addition, similar to other CBS-owned all-news stations, ''60 Minutes'' was broadcast at 7&amp;nbsp;pm on Sundays each and every week, regardless of whether or not the televised version (usually an [[National Football League|NFL]] football game) was delayed on CBS.

===99.1 WNEW===
On February 23, 2015, WNEW-FM began airing [[Talk radio|Talk]] programs, including the syndicated [[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]] in the evenings, a business and personal finance call-in program&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first weekend in March 2015, media insider local internet news website dcrtv.com reported that CBS Radio was moving their DC-area radio stations studios and offices closer to [[Nationals Park]], which is the home of the local baseball team, the [[Washington Nationals]]. WNEW-FM was the first station to move. On March 8, 2015, WNEW-FM claimed that they were renovating their studios and could not continue broadcasting their ordinary news programming, promising to return to regular programming later that night. This came weeks after hosts on sister station [[WJFK-FM|WJFK-FM, 106.7, "The Fan"]] had similar problems.

===Bloomberg 99-1===
On December 18, 2015, at 10&amp;nbsp;am, WNEW-FM began simulcasting [[Bloomberg Radio]] as "Bloomberg 99.1 &amp; 105.7-HD2" after CBS began leasing the station to Bloomberg earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/95575/dc-all-news-battle-comes-to-end-as-cbs-sells-99-1-wnew/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://formatchange.com/wnew-becomes-bloomberg-99-1/&lt;/ref&gt; WIAD-HD2 would drop the WNEW simulcast and flip to [[classic hits]] a couple months later in February.

On March 15, 2016, WNEW-FM changed calls to '''WDCH-FM'''. The WNEW-FM call letters returned to New York City that same day.&lt;ref&gt;https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/105426/wnew-fm-call-letters-return-to-102-7-new-york/&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with [[Entercom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/116299/cbs-radio-to-merge-with-entercom/  CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom]&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entercom.com/press/entercom-receives-fcc-approval-merger-cbs-radio/|title=Entercom Receives FCC Approval for Merger with CBS Radio|work=Entercom|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/121072/entercom-completes-cbs-radio-merger/|title=Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger|last=Venta|first=Lance|work=Radio Insight|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the merger, Bloomberg will continue to lease the station via a [[time brokerage agreement]].

'''The Whistle blower Week''' is the name given to a series of events in Washington, D.C. meant to raise awareness about [[whistleblower|whistle blowing]]. There were two whistle blower weeks which took place in Washington in two different years.

The first Whistle blower Week took place in Washington, D.C. from May 13–19, 2007 and was sponsored by a loose coalition of whistle blower-related advocacy groups. The week was timed to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the May 15, 2002 enactment of the "Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002" (Public Law 107-174), now known as the [[No-FEAR Act]].&lt;ref name="federal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://federaltimes.com/index.php?S=2744160 |title=First Whistleblower Week in Washington begins Sunday |author=Tim Kauffman |publisher=federaltimes.com |date=May 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123194012/http://federaltimes.com/index.php?S=2744160 |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; During the week, whistle blowers and their allies gathered for awards ceremonies, speeches, panel discussions, and training sessions. The 2007 event was featured in the ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/washington/18whistleblower.htm?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=From Out of the Shadows, Whistle-Blowers Convene |author=Scott Shane |work=The New York Times |date=May 18, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the [[Congressional Record]] by Republican Senator [[Chuck Grassley|Charles Grassley]] of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=110-s20070514-9#sMonofilemx003Ammx002Fmmx002Fmmx002Fmhomemx002Fmgovtrackmx002Fmdatamx002Fmusmx002Fm110mx002Fmcrmx002Fms20070514-9.xmlElementm0m0m0m |title=WHISTLEBLOWER WEEK IN WASHINGTON |author=Senator Charles Grassley |publisher=Congressional Record |date=May 14, 2007 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Whistle blower Week took place May 12–15, 2008 and was sponsored by the No Fear Coalition, the [[Semmelweis Society]], and the Bill of Rights Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whistleblower.org/content/press_detail.cfm?press_id=1367 |title=GAP Whistleblower Week Events Kick Off Monday |publisher=[[Government Accountability Project]] |date=May 8, 2008 |accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 Week events and participants==
The first Whistle blower Week was organized by around fifty organizations&lt;ref name="federal" /&gt; and included a diverse group of participants, from a United States Senator to a 9–11 conspiracy theorist recruiting followers.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Their main objective was to address issues about whistle blowing and more than forty public interests were addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ipsdc.org/events/washington_whistleblower_week|title=Washington Whistleblower Week - IPS|newspaper=Institute for Policy Studies|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Biography==
Chichvarkin was born in Saint-Petersburg, former Leningrad, USSR, from mother Lyudmila of Russian tatar descent and father Aleksandr from Moscow. His father was a pilot and his mother was an economist working for the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade; during his childhood, the family moved to Moscow.&lt;ref name=Lentapedia/&gt;

From 1991 to 1996 Chichvarkin studied at the [[The State University of Management|State Academy of Management]], as well as earning money trading on Moscow flea markets. After graduating Chichvarkin started studying for a PhD ([[Kandidat]]), which he abandoned in 1998. 

==Yevroset Company==
In 1997 Chichvarkin and his friend Timur Artemiev started a business named Yevroset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=26381840|title=Yevroset}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sell mobile phones. 
In 2002 Yevroset became one of the top three Moscow mobile phone retailers, with 92 retail outlets. The company opened 100 more outlets in 2002, 117 more outlets in 2003, 800 more outlets in 2004, 1934 more outlets in 2005, etc. In 2007 they had 5156 outlets in 12 countries: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=Lentapedia/&gt;

In June 2005, Yevroset has received the "Superbrand-2005" public award, in October 2005  "Brand of the Year / EFFIE 2005" awards and in December 2005 "The Company of the Year" in the nomination "Business Reputation". Yevroset is holders of the Diploma of the Russian Foundation for the Protection of Consumer Rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://ria.ru/society/20090311/164457497.html&lt;/ref&gt;

September 21, 2008 Evgeny Chichvarkin sold "Euroset" to Alexander Mamut, the owner of investment company ANN and internet portal "Live Journal". &lt;ref&gt;https://dni.ru/economy/2008/9/22/149532.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right Cause political party==
In November 2008 Chichvarkin jointed [[Right Cause (political party)|Right Cause]], a Russian [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] [[list of political parties in Russia|political party]] founded on 16 November 2008 as a merger of the [[Union of Right Forces]], [[Civilian Power]] and the [[Democratic Party of Russia]].

==Criminal prosecution==
In August 2005 Chichvarkin was accused of involvement in the illegal import of a $100 million shipment of mobile phones, but the accusations were eventually dropped. In March 2006 a large consignment of [[Motorola]] mobile phones shipped for Chichvarkin was seized on the pretext that their emissions of [[microwave radiation]] exceeded the levels permitted by Russian health regulations. After those cases Chichvarkin accused Russian law-enforcement agencies of [[corporate raid]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.og.ru/news/2009/01/23/42694.shtml Экс-владелец «Евросети» Евгений Чичваркин объявлен в розыск] [[Obshchaya Gazeta]] 23 January 2009 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 Chichvarkin was mentioned by the media in connection with the case of Dmitry Sidorov, the founder ''Iled M'', which was accused of large scale tax avoidance. Iled M had sold mobile phones to Yevroset as well as to other retailers. In August 2007 the apartments of many Yevroset employees were searched by police.&lt;ref name=Lentapedia/&gt; Some experts considered the searches to be connected with the Idel M case, while other saw it as a continuation of Motorola case. Others still viewed it as a marketing ploy by Yevroset themselves (the last chance to buy their phones before they are confiscated), others as a [[silovik]]s' revenge on Chichvarkin.&lt;ref name=Lentapedia/&gt;

In September 2008 the headquarters of Yevroset were searched in connection with its handling of Andrey Vlaskin, a Yevroset employee who in 2003 stole mobile phones worth around 20 million [[Russian rouble]]s (approximately US$1 million). Vlaskin was caught by Yevroset security in [[Tambov]], moved to Moscow to a Yevroset-owned apartment and after some time agreed to compensate Yevroset for their losses. While between 2004 and 2007 Yevroset and Vlaskin apparently had no claims on each other, in 2008 Yevroset was accused of kidnapping, illegal imprisonment and extortion.  

On 21 September 2008 Chichvarkin sold 100% of Yevroset stock to [[Alexander Mamut]].&lt;ref name=Lentapedia/&gt; The volume of the transaction was US$400 million.&lt;ref name=Lentapedia/&gt; 

In January 2009 Chichvarkin moved to the United Kingdom and on 23 January 2009 on Russian federal search list in connection with the Vlaskin case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/27/russia-kremlin-oligarchs |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Luke | last=Harding | title=Mobile phone oligarch flees Russia for new life in Britain | date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January the Basmanny Court of Moscow approved Chichvarkin's arrest ([[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']]).&lt;ref name=Lentapedia/&gt; On 12 March 2009 his details were passed to [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name=interpol&gt;{{cite news |first=Vladislav |last=Trifonov |title=Евгения Чичваркина передали Интерполу |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?docsid=1136809 |publisher=[[Kommersant]] |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=18 March 2009 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 2009 the Investigative Committee of the [[Prosecutor General of Russia]] noticed that a key investigator of Chichvarkin's case, Vladimir Knyazyev, had previously been sentenced for stealing a large consignment of mobile phones from Chichvarkin's Yevroset. During the 2007 contraband case he had forged the act of destroying the phones confiscated as evidence. The investigation committee demanded the dismissal of Knyazyev because of the conflict of interest but their demands were refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vremya.ru/2009/62/46/227040.html|script-title=ru:Мобильные споры|last=Karacheva|first=Yekaterina|date=13 April 2009|work=Vremya Novostey N62|language=Russian|accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 2010 the jury found all the defendants in the Vlaskin case not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|url=http://rian.ru/justice/20101117/297501879.html|title=Фигуранты дела "Евросети" не виновны в похищении человека – присяжные|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lawyer Yuri Gervis noted that Chichvarkin is still worried that he might be charged again in connection with the 2005 contraband case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|url=http://www.infosud.ru/incident_news/20110124/251683421.html|script-title=ru:Чичваркин опасается быть привлеченным по делу от 2005 года – адвокат|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=24 January 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

International search of Euroset Evgeny Chichvarkin has been discontinued. As reported on 25 January 2011 by an official representative of the National Central Bureau (NCB) of Interpol at the Interior Ministry Olga Shklyarov, it is due to the termination of criminal proceedings against Chichvarkin under Article 24 of the Code (the absence of a crime).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsru.com/russia/25jan2011/chichfree.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While in London Chichvarkin has participated in protests highlighting the dangers of conducting business in Russia, referring to the cases of [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and [[Sergei Magnitsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/01/idUSLDE7501VC20110601 | work=Reuters | title=Russian ex-tycoon protests outside London forum | date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is aware of being observed by "men with russian behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2018/03/13/140135-chichvarkin-rasskazal-o-slezhke-za-nim-posle-pereezda-v-london Chichvarkin told about being watched after moving to London], Novaya Gazeta, March 13th 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
