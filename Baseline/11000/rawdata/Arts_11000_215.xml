The '''Ascoli Piceno Baptistery''' (Italian: ''Il battistero di San Giovanni di [[Ascoli Piceno]]''), also known as the [[baptistery]] of Saint John, is a religious building found on the eastern end of the [[piazza Arringo]] at the center of Ascoli Piceno and sitting next to and just north of the [[Ascoli Piceno Cathedral|cathedral dedicated to St. Emygdius]], the city's [[patron saint]].

The structure, simple and austere in its architectural form, perfectly represents the Romanesque style in Ascoli, and, being ranked among the best examples of Italian works of art, is included in the list of Italian [[national monument]]s &lt;small&gt;(r.d. n.7033 del 20/07/1890)&lt;/small&gt;.

== History ==
The beginning of the baptistery's construction is difficult to date accurately, but archeological finds from 1828 and other excavations between 1870-1880 suggest that the interior of the structure was a pagan temple on Ascoli's forum which may have been dedicated to [[Hercules]].

According to Giambattista Carducci, the temple was used as a baptistery already by the 6th century. He also notes that its octagonal form is like the baptistery of [[Florence Baptistery|Saint John in Florence]], of the [[Arian Baptistery|Arian baptistery]] of [[Ravenna]], and of the [[Lateran Baptistery|Lateran baptistery i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n [[Rome]] built by [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carducci|first1=Giambattista|title=Su le memorie e i monumenti di Ascoli nel Piceno|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=PBI5AAAAcAAJ|website=googlebooks|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=88–89|date=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The baptistery's first restoration came prior to the 9th century, with interventions following in the 10th and 11th centuries as shown in the triangular decorations and the framing of the principal entrance. Most recently, the interior of the baptistery was restored in 2006.

== Architecture ==
The baptistery is constructed of large, square blocks of travertine, some of which were taken from earlier structures. Visible at the base of the eastern side are the remains of a Roman wall. It is a freestanding structure with a massive, square base containing entrances on two sides. The ''tiburio'' (the upper part of the structure designed to shape and protect the cupola within) is octagonal in shape, decorated with four small windows, and crowned with a square lantern, also containing windows to allow light inside. Each side of the ''tiburio'' is decorated with a [[blind arcade]] containing three round arches, with exception of the east facing side which contains a pair of arcades with only two arches each. All of these arcades were added during the 12th century.

The original monument had three entrances symbolizing the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] as well as [[Churches Militant, Penitent, and Triumphant|the Three Churches]]: ''the church militant'', composed of all the baptized faithful to [[Jesus|Christ]] and the [[Pope]]; ''the church penitent'', which includes all the souls in [[purgatory]] that are being prepared for heaven; and ''the church triumphant'', comprising the [[saint]]s and [[angel]]s. Today the baptistery has two entrances. The main entrance, found on [[piazza Arringo]], is flanked by two recessed rectangular forms, and the architrave above is decorated with three recessed triangles, one large triangle in the center which is marked by a wide horizontal slit, and two small ones on the sides. The other entrance faces the cathedral door known as the ''La porta della Musa'', and contains stone work from various periods, including Romanesque capitals and an bas-relief architrave that contains a knotted cord (a type of decoration that was very diffuse around the year 1000).

The interior of the baptistery has an irregular, octagonal shape, typically Roman, with [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] that correspond to the angles of the square base. The octagonal walls measure about 5,5 [[Metre|meters]] each; the dimensions of the interiore are 9,14 x 9 meters. Inside at the center of the floor, directly below the [[oculus]] of the [[Dome|cupola]], is a slightly raised circular pool, dated to the 5th or 6th century but rediscovered only in 1839, that was used by Christians for baptism by immersion. This unique spot was used for the baptism of both men and women who were assisted, respectively, by [[deacon]]s and [[deaconess]]es. On the right side is a [[baptismal font]] from the 14th or 15th century, set on top of a twisted column. On the altar is a painting of the ''Baptism of Christ'', a 16th-century oil on canvas, attributed to Venceslao Corrigioli di Reggio.

== Symbolism ==
The historian Mario Sabatucci has attributed a symbolic reading to the form of Ascoli's baptistery according to Christian doctrine. According to his interpretation, the square base represents the earth and its four elements (air, earth, fire, and water), the four points of the compass, the four seasons, and the four periods of a human life-span. The octagonal ''tiburio'' calls to mind baptism as described by St. Peter in his first letter: &lt;small&gt;(3,20-21)&lt;/small&gt; ''« while God patiently waited to receive them, in Noah's time when the ark was being built. In it only a few, that is eight souls, were saved through water. It is the baptism corresponding to this water which saves you now ... »''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The first letter of Peter|url=http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=67&amp;bible_chapter=3|website=Catholic Online|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The round cupola, like a circle or a sphere, represents eternity and paradise.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''''Bacchus and Ariadne''''' (1522–1523)&lt;ref name="keyfacts"/&gt; is an [[oil painting]] by [[Titian]]. It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], for the [[Camerini d'alabastro|Camerino d'Alabastro]]&amp;nbsp;– a private room in his [[palazzo]] in Ferrara decorated with paintings based on classical texts. An advance payment was given to [[Raphael]], who originally held the commission for the subject of a ''Triumph of Bacchus''. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of ''Bacchus and Ariadne'', the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets [[Catullus]] and [[Ovid]]. 

The painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the [[National Gallery]] in London. The other major paintings in the cycle are ''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'' (mostly by [[Giovanni Bellini]], now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C), and Titian's ''[[The Bacchanal of the Andrians]]'' and ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'' (both now in the [[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]]).

==Description==
[[Ariadne]] has been left on the island of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], deserted by her lover [[Theseus]], whose ship sails away to the far left. She is discovered on the shore by the god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], leading a procession of revelers in a chariot drawn by two [[cheetah]]s (these were probably modelled on those in the Duke's menagerie and were [[tiger]]s in Ovid's original text&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi004.perseus-eng1:1 P. Ovidius Naso, ''Ars Amatoria'', Book I, Perseus Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt;). Bacchus is depicted  in mid-air as he leaps out of the chariot to protect Ariadne from these beasts. In the sky above the figure of Ariadne is the star constellation [[Corona Borealis]] (Northern crown). There are two possible variations of the story both going back to Ovid. In his Metamorphoses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph8.htm#482327660 Ovid, ''Metamorphoses''], translated by A. S. Kline, Book VIII:bv152–182 The Minotaur, Theseus, and Ariadne&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid has Bacchus throw the crown of Ariadne into the sky where it becomes the constellation Northern Crown. In Ars Amatoria,&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; Bacchus promises the entire sky to Ariadne where she then would become the constellation Northern Crown. The National Gallery's website states that in the painting, "Bacchus, god of wine, emerges with his followers from the landscape to the right. Falling in love with Ariadne on first sight, he leaps from his chariot, drawn by two cheetahs, towards her. Ariadne had been abandoned on the Greek island of Naxos by Theseus, whose ship is shown in the distance. The picture shows her initial fear of Bacchus, but he raised her to heaven and turned her into a constellation, represented by the stars above her head."

The composition is divided diagonally into two triangles, one of blue sky (using the expensive [[ultramarine]] pigment) and still but for the two lovers caught in movement, the other a riot of movement and predominantly green/brown in colour. The follower of Bacchus who struggles with a snake is sometimes falsely associated with the antique sculpture of ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' who had been killed by snakes. This statue had recently been discovered in Rome. But the satyr in Titian's painting is not in a mortal combat with the snakes, he is merely girding himself with them as is described in the original text by Catullus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/cat64.shtml Catullus, ''The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis'', 250–265, Translated by Thomas Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King Charles Spaniel]] that barks at the boy [[satyr]] is a common motif in Titian's work and was probably a court pet. The gold urn inscribed with the artist's signature (&lt;small&gt;TICIANVS&lt;/small&gt;) may also have been familiar to the Duke as one of the antiquities in his collection.

The analysis of pigments used by Titian in this painting has been undertaken by scientists at the National Gallery in London&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/pdf/lucas_plesters1978.pdf Lucas, A., Plesters, J. "Titian's 'Bacchus and Ariadne{{'"}}. ''National Gallery Technical Bulletin'' Vol. 2, pp. 25–47]&lt;/ref&gt; and this analysis is illustrated at ColourLex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/bacchus-ariadne-pigment-analysis/ "Titian, Bacchus and Ariadne, Pigment Analysis"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
The canvas on which ''Bacchus and Ariadne'' is painted was rolled up twice in the first century of its existence, which had consequences for the painting. From the turn of the 19th century onwards it was frequently being restored to stop paint from flaking off, with the most controversial restoration being that carried out at the National Gallery between 1967 and 1968. This greatly brightened the surface of the painting, and came as something of a shock to many viewers, used to a heavy [[varnish]] finish.  When discoloured [[varnish]] lying directly on top of the paint surface was removed, some of the paint itself came off as well and repainting was necessary. This has caused some critics to note that the expanse of blue sky on the left-hand side, one of the worst-affected areas of the painting, appears flat and pallid. It has also been argued that the removal of the varnish has left the painting tonally out of balance, since Titian is likely to have added some subtle glazes to the paint surface in order to tone down some of the more jarring colors. The National Gallery maintains that this was an unavoidable loss, because the accrued layers of later varnish had turned the painting brown and sludgy and had to be removed.  More recent examination has confirmed that the paint remains largely original.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, A., Plesters, J. 'Titian's "Bacchus and Ariadne"'. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 2, pp 25–47.  [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/technical-bulletin/lucas_plesters1978 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other paintings==
There are many other paintings of the subject in museum collections, including the following: 
*[[Giovan Battista Pittoni]] (1720–25), in the [[Louvre]]
*[[Guido Reni]] ([[Los Angeles]])
*[[Ferdinand Bol]], [[Hermitage Museum]]
*[[Eustache Le Sueur]], Boston MFA
*[[Sebastiano Ricci]], [[Chiswick House]]
*[[Jacopo Tintoretto]], ''Bacchus, Venus and Ariadne'', [[Doge's Palace]], Venice

==References in other media==
[[John Keats]] alluded to this painting (which was brought to England in 1806) in his "Ode to a Nightingale" ("''Away! away! for I will fly to thee, Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards''").

[[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] reviews this work in her poem ''Bacchus and Ariadne'', first published in 1822, as a ''Dramatic Scene'', being a dialogue between Leonardi and Alvine.

The painting was the basis for the cover of the album ''[[God Shuffled His Feet]]'' by rock band [[Crash Test Dummies]].  

The Indonesian composer [[Ananda Sukarlan]] has made a musical work for flute and piano, "Rescuing Ariadne" after being inspired by Titian's painting in the National Gallery of London.

In her novel [[Misalliance]], [[Anita Brookner]] alludes to Titian's painting and depicts the encounter between Ariadne and Bacchus as an "ecstatic moment of recognition  [...], so immediate that Bacchus' foot has not had time to touch the ground as he leaps from his chariot, so shocking that Ariadne flings up a hand protest."

[[File:Zeegezicht bij Scheveningen - s0416M1990 - Van Gogh Museum.jpg|thumb|390px|''Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather'']]

'''''Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather''''', also known as '''''View of the Sea at Scheveningen''''' (Dutch: ''Zeegezicht bij Scheveningen''), is an early oil painting by [[Vincent van Gogh]], painted at [[Scheveningen]] near [[The Hague]] in August 1882. It is held in the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam.

Van Gogh made his first paintings in December 1881, under the supervision of [[Anton Mauve]], the husband of Van Gogh's cousin, Ariëtte (Jet) Sophia Jeannette Carbentus.  This work was made in Van Gogh's second attempt at painting in August 1882.

The painting shows the beach at [[Scheveningen]], on the North Sea coast a few miles from The Hague, on a stormy day on 21 or 22 August 1882.  The painting was made quickly, ''[[en plein air]]'', on an easel at the beach, with the wind whipping up sand and nearly blowing Van Gogh off his feet.  He managed to scrape most of the wind-blown sand off the thick wet painting, but some remains.

The painting  is an [[Impressionist]] take on the grey-tinged [[seascape]]s of [[Hague School]] paintings such as [[Hendrik Mesdag]]'s 1881 ''[[Panorama Mesdag|Panorama]]'' of  Scheveningen.  The composition is broken into three horizontal zones: a threatening grey sky with dark roiling clouds, the greenish-grey sea with lines of white-capped waves crashing onto the shore, and the beach and sand dunes in browns, oranges, yellows and greens.  A number of people are on the beach, some [[fishwife|fishwives]] in their white bonnets, watching as a group of men with horses and a cart are about to pull on a rope attached to a waiting fishing boat to bring it safely ashore.  The people are suggested by a few economical brushstrokes, and the breakers by thick lines of paint applied directly from the tube.

The work measures {{convert|34.5|x|51|cm}}.  It was catalogued as "F4" in [[Jacob Baart de la Faille]]'s 1928 ''The Works of Vincent van Gogh'' and as "JH187" in [[Jan Hulsker]]'s 1978 ''The Complete Van Gogh''.

The painting was stored the Van Gogh family house in [[Breda]].  Along with many early other works, it was left behind in the attic when the family moved away in 1886, and it came into the possession of a carpenter, Adrianus Schrauwen.  It was sold as part of a job lot of worthless "rubbish" to the merchant J.C. Couvreur in 1902, and it came to [[Kunstzalen Oldenzeel]] in Rotterdam.  It was bought by tobacco importer [[Gerlach Ribbius Peletier]] in 1903 for the record price of 2,500 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]], when other works by Van Gogh were selling for less than 1,000 guilders.  It was inherited by his daughter {{ill|Liesbeth Ribbius Peletier|nl}}, and she donated it to the state of the Netherlands on her death in 1989.

==Theft and recovery==
''Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather'' had been held by the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam since 1989, but was stolen on 7 December 2002, along with Van Gogh's early painting of ''[[Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen]]''.  It remained [[stolen art|missing]] for over 13 years, until it was recovered by the Italian [[Guardia di Finanza]] at [[Castellammare di Stabia]] near Naples in January 2016, without its original frame.  Its recovery was not announced until September 2016, and it was subsequently returned to the museum and went back on display in March 2017.

A '''black cube''' (or '''black box''') '''art museum''' is a term used by some scholars{{who|date=August 2010}} referring to the type of [[art museum]] that is architecturally designed or renovated with special consideration for the particular needs of modern [[digital art]], [[installation art]], and [[video art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/Black_Cube_Art_Museums |title=Black Cube Art Museums : Who, What, Where, When |publisher=Servinghistory.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the black box art museums originated from a need to accommodate these works in a better way than was previously possible in earlier art museums in the classic style (e.g., the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]] in [[Paris]]) or "[[white cube]]" style (e.g., the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]]). Although earlier examples exist,{{where|date=August 2010}} black cube museums have been most prevalent from the 1990s onwards.

==Development==
Architectural shifts in the design of art galleries have always followed shifts in art itself. Just as white cube museums embraced modernist artwork and perception, black cube museums originated to house and adopt the zeitgeist of avant-garde [[video art|video works]] and [[installation art|installations]]. Perhaps more importantly, there were also practical issues where the avant-garde works poorly functioned in white cube or classical museums. These issues could not be solved by anything less than an entirely new architectural thinking.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:LE TUNNEL SOUS L'ATLANTIQUE (2).jpg|thumb|''The Tunnel under the Atlantic'' (1995), [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[virtual reality]] interactive installation in the [[Centre Pompidou]].]]

===Problems with video art and installations===
When interactive [[video art]] was first considered for exhibitions in the respected public galleries, curators found the spaces in traditional galleries were incredibly unsuited to the new medium.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The traditional art galleries had static walls designed to display 2D artworks in a hierarchal manner or 3D sculpture where it could be viewed from all angles. Out of all the mediums through which art was expressed and displayed in a gallery, none demanded so much input from the viewer's themselves. When several artists began [[London Video Arts]] (LVA), their interactive art was arranged by [[Tate Gallery]] in ways which severely hampered the way they communicated with viewers. [[David Hall (video artist)|David Hall]]'s work reflected the movement of audiences themselves by showing images taken from a camera (facing the viewers) on a single monitor. The work was placed in a lecture room in the basement of the Tate's Education Department. The curators claimed this environment was the most appropriate since too much lighting would make it difficult to see the monitors so often used in video art.

Before moveable walls became commonly used in art museums, [[installation art|Installation]] artworks posed severe difficulties for curators. In 1960, the curators of MoMA were bewildered when [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Billy Klüver]] created a machine that destroyed itself for the 27 minute ''Homage to New York exhibition''. Even today, traditional museums have to go to great and expensive lengths to exhibit what has become a well-respected medium. When the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Australia]] displayed [[Olafur Eliasson]]'s ''Take your time'', walls were cut, doorways made taller and rooms darkened for the exhibition. It was becoming clear to architects that considerations would need to be made for installations, [[video art]] and [[digital art|digital interactive art]] in future galleries.

[[File:MoMa NY USA 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[MoMA]] New York, Typical of a "white cube" museum.]]

===Solutions offered by black cube===
Many projected images or monitors are optimally viewed in low lighting. Therefore, the implementation of adjustable lighting systems was the most obvious consideration made by black cube museums. However many installations require the space itself to be controlled. The typical black cube museum would hence have movable walls in its interior. Some artists may even have preferences as to the temperature of the environment. The essential idea behind the black cube museums is that the museum should be malleable to the needs of any artwork. The [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre]] is early architectural evidence of this way of thinking. However, in the Pompidou Centre, the hightech architecture form of the museum itself influences the way the artwork is viewed. The majority of black cube museums prefer to develop an environment in which artworks can be viewed objectively, an idea taken from modernist white cube museums.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==The future==

===Threats to the black cube===
New forms of art constantly develop and art museums must adapt alongside. Some black cube museums such as the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] ([[ACMI]]) have a large focus on film works or interactive works that use a simple keyboard and mouse. There is an argument that these works can be equally viewed from home through the internet. Indeed, some developing avant-garde forms of artwork are designed primarily to be viewed online. Works such as ''Automated Beacon'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automatedbeacon.net/ automatedbeacon.net]&lt;/ref&gt; a feedback loop of the [[Google search engine]] designed by Thomas and Craighead in 2005, perform very efficiently the role of the avant-garde and make us question "what is art?"

===Black cube's future===
The [[Internet]] may be the modern [[Library of Alexandria]] but, from the perspective of art, it suffers the same flaw as classical museums. Just as the old halls of the Louvre force an artist unto two-dimensional work if he wishes to be displayed in the classical museum, so to does the Internet force all its content to conform unto the easily accessible web page. Black cube museums however, with their flexible and accommodating interiors, allow the artist total control of what we objectively experience. Able to house any form of mainstream artwork, it seems unlikely that modern black cube museums can be entirely made redundant by the Internet.

A [[Speech scroll#European banderoles|banderole]] emanating from the centurion's mouth reads "{{lang|la|Vere filius Dei erat iste}}" ("This was really the son of God").]]

The [[Woodblock printing|woodblock]] fragment '''Bois Protat''' ({{IPA-fr|bwɑ pʁɔta|}} ("Protat wood[block]"); also '''Protat block''' or '''Protat woodblock''', {{circa|1370–1380}}) is a fragmentary woodblock for printing, and the images on it are the oldest surviving [[woodcut]] images from the Western world.  It is cut on both sides, with a scene from [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]] on the [[Recto and verso|recto]], and a kneeling angel from a presumed [[Annunciation]] scene on the verso.  The crucifixion scene likely consisted of three or more blocks; the surviving block fragment features [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] the Roman [[centurion]] at the Crucifixion, shown speaking with a [[Speech scroll#European banderoles|banderole]], a mediaeval precursor to the modern [[speech balloon]] containing his words.

The Bois Protat{{'}}s name comes from the [[Mâcon]]nais printer Jules Protat who acquired the block after its discovery in 1898 near [[La Ferté Abbey]] in [[Saône-et-Loire]], France, where it was wedged under a stone floor.  Because of such poor preservation, only a quarter of the block has survived, and only one side was able to withstand making prints at the time of discovery.  It is kept in the Department of Prints and Photographs at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], the National Library of France in Paris.

==Description==

A {{convert|600|*|230|*|25|mm|in|0|adj=on}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bouchot|1y=1902|1p=37|2a1=Blum|2y=1940|2p=70}} fragment remains of the Bois Protat, a [[Juglans|walnut]] [[Woodblock printing|woodblock]] engraved on both sides for printing on cloth or paper.{{sfn|Blum|1940|p=70}}  One side is a fragment of a [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] scene.  Part of the cross with the left arm of Christ is visible; to the right two Roman soldiers and a [[centurion]] stand speaking.  A phylactery, or [[speech scroll]], emanates from the centurion's mouth and contains the Latin text, "{{lang|la|Vere filius Dei erat iste}}" ("This was really the son of God"), as written in the [[Vulgate]] translation of Matthew {{Bibleref2-nb|Mt|27:54|4}}.  On the reverse side remains a kneeling angel, probably part of an [[Annunciation]] scene.{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|p=41}}

Judging from the Crucifixion fragment, coming from a very commonly depicted scene, it is thought that only a quarter to a third of the original block remains.  The surface of the complete scene is believed to have been about {{convert|100|x|60|cm|in}}, which is larger than contemporary paper sizes,{{efn|14th-century paper sizes attained lengths of up to 40–42cm at the largest; it was not until the 15th century that paper sizes sufficient for printing something the size of the Bois Protat became readily available.{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|p=42}} }} indicating it may have been intended for printing on cloth,{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|pp=41–42}} as was already common with patterns for clothing textiles.  It is usually thought that it was intended for printing cloth [[altar frontal]]s or hangings.{{sfn|Hind|1927|p=251}}  It is rare for such a block to be carved with images on both sides,{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|p=37}} and was likely not intended to be printed using a [[Printing press|press]], as that would have defaced one side.{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|p=4}}

==Background==

[[Relief printing]], in the form of woodblocks, originated in China.  The earliest examples were printed on cloth; paper prints followed the invention of paper {{circa|105&amp;nbsp;CE}}.  Most printed images were religious Buddhist scenes,{{sfn|White|2002|pp=32–33}} and the method was also the method used for texts of all sorts.

The Bois Protat is the earliest surviving example of the 14th-century arrival of woodblock printing in Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Ross|1y=2009|1p=2||2a1=White|2y=2002|2p=33}}  The technology did not become widespread until the 15th century, when paper became readily available.  Prints tended to be religious; they were more affordable to most people than devotional paintings, and often illustrated religious books.  Playing cards and other secular prints were also popular.  From the mid-15th century woodcuts were combined with [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s moveable type; particularly in Germany, woodcuts appeared by master artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], and the form enjoyed a high level of artistry.{{sfn|White|2002|p=33}}

==History==

The Bois Protat was discovered in 1898{{sfn|Parshall|Schoch|2005|p=8}} in France in a corner of masonry in a house in [[Laives, Saône-et-Loire|Laives]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Saône-et-Loire]], which had been a dependency of the [[La Ferté Abbey|Abbey of La Ferté]] until the abbey was destroyed in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|pp=111–112}}  The board suffered from pressure and humidity,{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|p=37}} as it was wedged under pavement.{{sfn|Cardon|1999|p=347}}

After its discovery the block was purchased by [[Mâcon]]nais printer and collector Jules Protat (1852–1906), and came to be called {{lang|fr|le bois Protat}} ("the Protat block").{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|p=vii}}  Jules Protat made some test prints on [[India paper|China paper]], one of which he exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 World's Fair]] in Paris.  The block is not in a state to withstand repeated printings, as three-quarters of the original has been lost to damage from humidity and insects; the reverse especially has not held up well,{{sfn|Bouchot|1902|p=40}} and is not in a condition suitable for making impressions.{{sfn|Ross|2009|p=3}}  The curator of prints at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]] [[Henri Bouchot]] published a study on the block in 1902 called {{lang|fr|Un ancêtre de la gravure sur bois}} ("An Ancestor of Wood Engraving").{{sfn|Durrieu|1917|p=254}}  Though some contested his conclusions, Bouchot dated the work to the 14th century based on technical details such as the style of art, the [[Uncial script]] of the centurion's speech, and the costumes and weapons of the centurion and soldiers.{{sfn|Blum|1940|p=70}}  No historical impressions (prints) made from the block are known, but other early woodcuts have been attributed to the same artist.{{sfn|Hind|1927|p=251}}

For some time the Bois Protat remained in Protat's family before it was entrusted to Bouchot.{{sfn|Parshall|Schoch|2005|p=22}}  In 2001 it was donated to the National Library of France.{{sfn|Roux|2013|pp=50, 131}}

The twelve volume '''''Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum''''' is the primary reference work for the study of British satirical prints of the 18th and 19th century.  Most of the content  of the catalogue is now available through the [[British Museum]]'s on-line database.

==Description==
The ''BM Satires'' &lt;ref name="DorothyGeorge"&gt; {{cite book|last1=George| first1=M Dorothy |title=Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum |publisher=The British Museum| date=1870-1954| location=London| url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofprint07brituoft/catalogueofprint07brituoft_djvu.tx}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises twelve volumes compiled between 1870 and 1954 and provides a [[catalogue raisonné]] of the 17,000 odd satirical prints assembled in the 19th century by [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins,]]&lt;Ref name="hawkins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Hawkins (British Museum Biographical details)| url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=51568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeper of Antiquities in the [[British Museum]] from his own and other collections.

It includes works by all the leading artists and makers of satirical prints of the period, as well as lesser known and anonymous designers. Notable artists represented include:   [[Henry Alken]], [[Samuel Alken]], [[William Austin (caricaturist)|William Austin]], [[James Bretherton (artist)|James Bretherton]], [[Charles Bretherton]], [[Henry William Bunbury]],  [[Frederick George Byron]],  [[John Cawse]],  [[John Collett (artist)| John Collet]], [[Thomas Colley]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Isaac Cruikshank]],  [[Robert Cruikshank]], [[Matthew Darly]],  [[William Dickinson (engraver)|William Dickinson]],  [[Robert Dighton]], [[John Dighton]], [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]], [[William Elmes]], [[Francis Jukes]], [[James Gillray]], [[Henry Heath (artist)|Henry Heath]], [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)| John Leech]], [[Lewis Marks]],  [[Richard Newton (caricaturist)|Richard Newton]], [[Piercy Roberts]],  [[Thomas Rowlandson]],  [[F.Sansom]], [[James Sayers]],  [[John Raphael Smith]], [[C.Starck]],  [[Edward Topham]],  [[Henry Wigstead]],  [[Samuel de Wilde]], [[Charles Williams (caricaturist)|Charles Williams]], and  [[George Moutard Woodward |George "Moutard" Woodward]]. Some works by foreign printmakers are also included.

The catalogue allocates a unique identifier to each print which is widely used as a bibliographic reference to specific caricatures in books about caricatures and in sales catalogues. The identifiers are one to five digit numbers, allocated in sequential order of listing within the whole sequence of volumes, each volume covering a monotonically increasing range of numbers. For example; '''BM Satires 10101''' refers to a print listed in Volume VIII (which covers the range 9693 to 11703) that was published in September 1803, titled ''My Ass in a Band Box''. For each print, the catalogue provides a title, publisher, designer and creator if known, image description, lettering and inscriptions, dimensions,  bibliographic references,  and explanatory notes about the historical context and personages and printmaking technique (e.g. [[etching]], [[aquatint]], [[stipple]], hand-coloured, etc.).   The prints are for the most part in historical order of date of publication, though some appear out of chronological order  in  addenda that appear in later volumes. Within each year, Political and Social satire is arranged separately and sequentially.

There is a prefatory essay to each volume by the editor giving a  historical synopsis of printmaking, artists, publishers and events through the period covered by the volume;  including [[Rudolph Ackermann]], [[Bowles &amp; Carver]], [[Thomas Cornell (publisher) | Thomas Cornell]], [[Elizabeth D'Archeray]], [[John Fairburn]],  [[Samuel William Fores]],  [[William Holland (publisher)| William Holland]], [[Hannah Humphrey]], [[ William_Humphrey (engraver)| William Humphrey]], [[Elizabeth Jackson (publisher) |Elizabeth Jackson]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[Thomas Maclean (publisher) | Thomas Maclean]], [[John Raphael Smith]], [[Susan Vivares]] and many others.

==History==
The first five volume of the catalogue were compiled under [[Frederic George Stephens]] between 1870 and 1883, with the assistance of Edward Hawkins, Keeper of Antiquities for the [[British Museum]]. The last seven volumes were the magnum opus of [[Mary Dorothy George]] the distinguished historian of British satire.  In 2008&amp;ndash;12, as part of the British Museum's program to digitalise its collections, all the volumes were scanned and used to form the basis of the entries for the satirical prints in the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx British Museum on-line catalogue].  Digital images are now available for most of the prints.

==Limitations==
The BM Satires does not include prints acquired since the publication of the printed version of the catalogue (i.e. up until 1954). The British Museum online catalogue includes additional entries for more recent acquisitions.   The printed volumes include only a few images, mostly in the introductory essays.

'''Chaim Goodman-Strauss''' (born June 22,1967 in Austin TX) is an American mathematician who works in [[convex geometry]], especially [[aperiodic tiling]]. He is on the faculty of the [[University of Arkansas]] and is a co-author with [[John H. Conway]] of ''The Symmetries of Things'', a comprehensive book surveying the mathematical theory of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plus.maths.org/content/symmetries-things Review of ''The symmetries of things''], by Phil Wilson, [[Plus Magazine]], December 1, 2008:  "The book presents a whole new way of looking at patterns. The methods have been worked out so exhaustively, and the trails opened up in the book have been followed so extensively, that you almost can't believe that such a huge body of knowledge could have lain dormant for so long!"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Goodman-Strauss received both his B.S. (1988) and Ph.D. (1994) in mathematics from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name=collegeboard&gt;[https://www.collegeboard.org/node/12446 Chaim Goodman-Strauss] The College Board&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral advisor was [[John Edwin Luecke]].&lt;ref name="nodak"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=13187|title=Chaim Goodman-Strauss - The Mathematics Genealogy Project|website=genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty at the [[University of Arkansas, Fayetteville]] (UA) in 1994 and served as departmental chair from 2008 to 2015. He held visiting positions at the  [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] and at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=collegeboard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrationofmind.org/?project=chaim-goodman-strauss Gathering for Gardner] Celebration of Mind Presenter&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1995 he did research at [[The Geometry Center]], a mathematics research and education center at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he investigated aperiodic tilings of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/about/people/home/strauss.html Chaim Goodman-Strauss: Activities at the Geometry Center] University Of Minnesota&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman-Strauss has been fascinated by patterns and mathematical paradoxes for as long as he can remember. He attended a lecture about the mathematician [[Georg Cantor]] when he was 17 and says, "I was already doomed to be a mathematician, but that lecture sealed my fate."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/the-shape-of-everyday-things/ The Shape of Everyday Things]'' by Melissa Lutz Blouin. Research News, Spring 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He became a mathematics writer and popularizer. From 2004 to 2012, in conjunction with [[KUAF|KUAF 91.3 FM]], the University of Arkansas [[NPR]] affiliate, he presented ”The Math Factor", a podcast website dealing with recreational mathematics.&lt;ref name=factor&gt;[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/about/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] July 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He is an admirer of [[Martin Gardner]] and is on the Math &amp; Science Advisory Council of [[Gathering 4 Gardner]], an organization that celebrates the legacy of the famed mathematics popularizer and [[Scientific American]] columnist,&lt;ref name=g4g&gt;[http://www.gathering4gardner.org/about/ About The G4G Foundation] Gathering 4 Gardner&lt;/ref&gt; and is particularly active in the associated [[Celebration of Mind]] events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrationofmind.org/project/chaim-goodman-strauss Presenter: Chaim Goodman-Strauss] Celebration of Mind&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrationofmind.org/archives/1357 Doubly Marked Robinson Tiles] Celebration of Mind&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical artist==
In 2008 Goodman-Strauss teamed up with [[J. H. Conway]] and [[Heidi Burgiel]] to write ''The Symmetries of Things'', an exhaustive and reader accessible overview of the mathematical theory of patterns. He produced hundreds of full-color images for this book using software that he developed for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathimagery/thumbnails.php?album=17 Chaim Goodman-Strauss :: Symmetries] AMS:  Mathematical Imagery&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mathematical Association of America said, "The first thing one notices when one picks up a copy … is that it is a beautiful book … filled with gorgeous color pictures … many of which were generated by Goodman-Strauss. Unlike some books which add in illustrations to keep the reader's attention, the pictures are genuinely essential to the topic of this book."&lt;ref name=glass&gt;[https://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/the-symmetries-of-things Review of ''The symmetries of things''], by Darren Glass, [[The Mathematical Association of America]], July 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He also creates large-scale sculptures inspired by mathematics, and some of these have been featured at Gathering 4 Gardner conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] Pictures from the Gathering&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Crouse Library for Publishing Arts''' contains a comprehensive collection of books, periodicals, reports, and other materials on the bookselling and publishing industries.  Scholars have called it "an important [collection] that aids our understanding of the book trade as a profession."

Prior to  1989, much of the collection was housed in the Graduate Library of the City University of New York.  Currently, the collection is housed at the [[New York Center for Independent Publishing]], which is, itself, a part of the venerable General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York.

The Library's holdings include approximately 3,000 volumes on all aspects of the industry. Contained in the collection are published works (many out-of-print) on such topics as bookselling; book design and production; trade, scholarly and children's book publishing; 
author/publisher relations; [[book collecting]]; censorship; and a wealth of biographies of luminaries of the book trade.

The Library was endowed by [[William H. Crouse]], a successful technical writer for General Motors and McGraw-Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/06/books/publishing-a-gold-mine-for-technical-writers.html|title=PUBLISHING: A GOLD MINE FOR TECHNICAL WRITERS|last=Mcdowell|first=Edwin|date=1983-05-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elyn Zimmerman''' (born 1945) is an [[United States|American]] sculptor known for her emphasis on large scale, site specific projects and [[environmental art]].&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, John. "Earthworks and Beyond". Abbeville Press. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these works, Zimmerman has exhibited drawings and photographs since graduating with an MFA in painting and photography at  [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1972. Her teachers included [[Robert Heinecken|Robert Heineken]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].

In the mid 1970s Zimmerman created a number of temporary, site-specific installations for museum and gallery exhibitions. Some of these projects were presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Hudson River Museum, NY; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; and the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, DC.

Zimmerman's permanent sculpture works, beginning in the 1980s, range from studio pieces and private commissions, to large scale projects for civic, university and corporate sites.

She was most recently awarded the 2016 Isamu Noguchi Award alongside [[Tadao Ando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/12/02/tadao-ando-and-elyn-zimmerman-win-the-2016-isamu-noguchi-award/ |title=Tadao Ando and Elyn Zimmerman Win the 2016 Isamu Noguchi Award |publisher=ARTnews |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Zimmerman's career as a sculptor began when she returned to California after a trip to India in 1977 where she was profoundly inspired by the archeological sites she visited.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Tom et al. "Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018: 9-17, 24, 45, 169-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hummer, Tracey. “The Stone Interviews: Interview with Elyn Zimmerman.” Sculpture Magazine. May–June. 1997: PAGES. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This trip precipitated her interest in doing outdoor projects and to work with stone.  Upon her return she was invited to do temporary outdoor works at venues such as Artpark, Lewiston, NY; 1980 Winter Olympics,&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Kay. "Expulsion from the Garden: Environmental Sculpture at the Winter Olympics". ArtForum. February, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Placid, NY; Laguna Gloria Art Museum, Austin, TX, and other spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Tom et al. "Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018: 11, 24-30, 45, 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; As she has written, the ability to experiment with new materials and to learn while creating these temporary projects was invaluable and gave her confidence to create the permanent commissions that came later.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Tom et al. "Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

These permanent projects, beginning in 1980, are recognized for their use of stone, water, (reflecting pools, fountains) and landscape elements. Included among these large scale, public commissions is a fountain to memorialize the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City;&lt;ref&gt;Emory, David. "World Trade Center Artworks Destroyed". Art In America, January, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the design of the sculpture garden at the Birmingham Museum of Art, Alabama; a fountain and seating area for AT&amp;T headquarters in New Jersey; and the plaza design at the National Geographic headquarters in Washington, DC featuring a large pool surrounded by polished and natural cleft granite boulders.&lt;ref&gt;Gopnik, Adam. "Marabar". Arts Magazine. October, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Tom et al. "Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early influences ===
During her undergraduate years at UCLA, Zimmerman took classes in the fine arts program while completing a BA in perceptual psychology. It was her knowledge in this discipline and her interest in contemporary art that led her to start working for Jim Turrell and Robert Irwin, doing research for their joint project for the Art and Technology exhibition at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Tom et al.

Working as an independent student with Robert Heineken in photography and Richard Diebenkorn&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Elyn. "What Diebenkorn and Matisse Taught Me About the Hard Work of Making Art." Open Art, Ed. Sarah Cantania. San Francisco: Zócalo Public Square, 2016. http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org. Web. 11 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; in painting, she was accepted into the MFA program in 1968 and graduated with an MFA in 1972.

In the 1960s and 1970s Los Angeles was home for many art communities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/books/review/rebels-in-paradise-the-los-angeles-art-scene-and-the-1960s-by-hunter-drohojowska-philp-book-review.html|title=Rebels In Paradise - The Los Angeles Art Scene and the 1960s - By Hunter Drohojowska-Philp - Book Review|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as quality art colleges: [[Chouinard Art Institute]], Otis Parsons Art Institute, [[California Institute of the Arts]], and the art departments at UCLA and USC.

To compensate for the scarcity of art museums interested in contemporary art and the lack of art galleries, save for well-known [[Ferus Gallery]] founded by Walter Hopps, there were alternative art exhibition spaces, such as L.A.C.E and LAICA. In 1962 [[Artforum|ArtForum]] was founded in San Francisco; the Feminist Art Movement began in 1971 with roots at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]; LACMA initiated the first museum exhibition of Art &amp;Technology, and what came to be called the LA Light and Space Movement was generated, making use of unconventional venues to exhibit artist's projects.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Tom et al. "Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018: 9-17, 23, 45, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kienholz, Lyn. "L.A. Rising: SoCal Artists Before 1980". Getty Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmerman's work in graduate school was influenced by this rich environment as well as by the young architect she lived with during those years. He had been in the peace corps and traveled through India, Nepal and Central Asia. The images and cultural influences he shared when they met fueled her desire to travel and investigate the world herself.  Together they traveled throughout the American southwest and to Mexico to see Native American and Pre-Columbian archeological sites, as well as visit the progressive modern architecture.

Between her undergraduate and graduate years Zimmerman worked in a diverse number of positions. She was a part-time studio assistant for several artists until she was hired to work at [[Columbia Records]] in Hollywood as assistant to the head designer in the art department.  She left that job when an offer came from the [[Charles and Ray Eames]] office in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] to be the assistant to the house photographer and to run their darkroom.

=== Later influences ===
Zimmerman and [[Kirk Varnedoe]] began a correspondence in 1975 after he wrote an enthusiastic article about the drawing and photographic piece she exhibited in the 1974 [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Varnedoe, “Site Lines: Recent Work by Elyn Zimmerman” Arts Magazine, vol. 52 (December 1978), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; She was in NYC in 1976 to install a project at PS1&lt;ref&gt;Varnedoe, Kirk. "Artifact or Fact Art: Transparent Problems in Photography". Arts Magazine, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; when they met for coffee, from that point on engaging in a long distance relationship. In 1977 Zimmerman moved to New York City where she and Varnedoe shared a loft in the newly named ''[[Tribeca]]'' neighborhood.  They married in 1983.  He was a professor of art history at NYU's Institute of Fine Art and she taught studio classes at SUNY Purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Tom et al. "Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018: 171-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Varnedoe's deep knowledge of western art history and his widely celebrated talent to convey this information to students, colleagues and friends enriched Zimmerman's understanding of and appreciation for these traditions.  On the other hand, her studies of oriental art history, her residency in Japan, and travels to India and China became new interests of his.

In 1979, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] started a new program called Art in Public Places.&lt;ref&gt;"Elyn Zimmerman." U.S. Commission of Fine Arts: Past Commission Members. U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2008. Web. 11 April 2018. https://www.cfa.gov/about-cfa/who-we-are/elyn-zimmerman.&lt;/ref&gt; Projects using government funds were required to use a percentage of the funds for artworks specific to the project at hand.  Zimmerman was awarded one of the first of these projects in 1979, for Fort Lincoln Park in Washington, DC.  Although the project was never realized, it began her relationship with Cold Spring Granite Company in Cold Spring, MN. This would become her major source of stone materials for over 30 years.

When the [[National Geographic Society]] selected [[David Childs]] of SOM to design their new headquarters in Washington, DC his office sought out artists who worked with stone.&lt;ref&gt;Gopnik, Adam. "Marabar". Arts Magazine. October, 1984."&lt;/ref&gt; This became Zimmerman's first substantial commission, reinforcing her desire to pursue this type of artwork and to learn more about all the aspects of creating outdoor public projects including: construction methods; landscape requirements; sustainable building practices and materials sources. It was after spending considerable time at stone quarries that she became interested in also making smaller more intimate stone sculptures.

The [[national flag|national]] '''flag of Greece''', popularly referred to as the "sky-blue - white" or the "blue-white" ({{lang-el|Γαλανόλευκη or Κυανόλευκη}}), officially recognised by [[Greece]] as one of its [[national symbols]], is based on nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white. There is a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross; the cross symbolises [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity, the established religion of the Greek people of Greece and Cyprus. The [[blazon]] of the flag is ''Azure, four bars Argent; on a canton of the field a Greek cross throughout of the second.'' The official flag ratio is 2:3.&lt;ref name=presidency&gt;[http://www.presidency.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=6&amp;lang=en ''The Flag'', from the site of the Presidency of the Hellenic Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; The shade of blue used in the flag has varied throughout its history, from light blue to dark blue, the latter being increasingly used since the late 1960s. It was officially adopted by the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]] on 13 January 1822.

According to popular tradition, the nine stripes represent the nine [[syllable]]s of the phrase "[[Eleftheria i thanatos|Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος]]" ("Freedom or Death"), the five blue stripes for the syllables "Ελευθερία" and the four white stripes "ή Θάνατος".&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; The nine stripes are also said to represent the letters of the word "freedom" (Greek: ελευθερία).&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; There is also a different theory, that the nine stripes symbolise the nine [[Muses]], the goddesses of art and civilisation (nine has traditionally been one of the numbers of reference for the Greeks).&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;Alexander-Michael Hadjilyra: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070402084632/http://www.army.gr/n/g/publications/articles/GreekFlag0/GreekFlag1/ Η καθιέρωση της ελληνικής σημαίας ("The adoption of the Greek flag")], Hellenic Army General Staff, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Blue and white have been interpreted as symbolising the colours of the famed Greek sky and sea.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flag Bulletin, Volumes 15–17'', Flag Research Center, 1976, p. 63: "Greeks wanted this color for their flag because they have always looked at the blue sky and the blue ocean."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|List of Greek flags}}
The origins of today's national flag with its cross-and-stripe pattern are a matter of debate. Every part of it, including the blue and white colors, the cross, as well as the stripe arrangement can be connected to very old historical elements;&lt;ref name="LS" &gt;L. S. Skartsis, ''[https://www.academia.edu/32481895/Origin_and_Evolution_of_the_Greek_Flag Origin and Evolution of the Greek Flag]'', Athens 2017    {{ISBN|978-960-571-242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is difficult to establish "continuity", especially as there is no record of the exact reasoning behind its official adoption in early 1822.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

It has been suggested by some Greek historians that the current flag derived from an older design, the virtually identical flag of the powerful [[Crete|Cretan]] [[Kallergis family]]. This flag was based on their coat of arms, whose pattern is supposed to be derived from the standards of their claimed ancestor, Byzantine Emperor [[Nicephorus II Phocas]] (963–969 AD).  This pattern (according to not easily verifiable descriptions) included nine stripes of alternating blue and white, as well as a cross, assumed to be placed on the upper left.&lt;ref name="Zapheiriou" &gt;N. Zapheiriou, ''Η Ελληνική Σημαία από τους αρχαίους χρόνους μέχρι σήμερα (The Greek Flag from Antiquity to Present)'', Eleftheri Skepsis, Athens 1995 (reprint of original 1947 publication)  {{ISBN|960-7199-60-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of alternating blue and white - or silver - stripes on (several centuries-old) Kallergis' coats of arms is [http://kallergides.blogspot.gr/p/blog-page_18.html well documented], no depiction of the above described pattern (with the nine stripes and the cross) survives.

The stripe-pattern of the Greek flag is visibly similar to that used (though with different colors) in several other flags that have appeared over the centuries, most notably that of the [[British East India Company]]'s [[British East India Company#Flags|pre-1707 flag]] or the [[flag of the United States]]. 

===Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire===
[[File:Byzantine imperial flag, 14th century, square.svg|thumb|150px|left|This design, from the 14th century during the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan dynasty]], is the only attested flag of the [[Byzantine Empire]].]]
Flags as they are known today did not exist in antiquity. Instead, a variety of emblems and symbols (''semeion'', pl. ''semeia'') were used to denote each state and were for example painted on the [[aspis|hoplite shields]]. The closest analogue to a modern flag were the ''[[vexillum]]''-like banners used by ancient Greek armies, such as the so-called ''phoinikis'', a cloth of deep red, suspended from the top of a staff or spear. It is not known to have carried any device or decoration though.

The Byzantines, like the Romans before them, used a variety of flags and banners, primarily to denote different military units. These were generally square or rectangular, with a number of streamers attached.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice (emperor)|Emperor Maurice]], ''[[Strategikon of Maurice|Strategikon]]'', II.14&lt;/ref&gt; Most prominent among the early Byzantine flags was the ''[[labarum]]''. In the surviving pictorial sources of the middle and later Empire, primarily the illustrated [[Skylitzes Chronicle]], the predominating colours are red and blue in horizontal stripes, with a cross often placed in the centre of the flag. Other common symbols, prominently featuring on [[sigillography|seals]], were depictions of [[Christ]], the [[Virgin Mary]] and saints, but these represent personal rather than family or state symbols. Western European-style [[heraldry]] was largely unknown until the last centuries of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=472, 999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no mention of any "state" flag until the mid-14th century, when a Spanish atlas, the ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento|Conosçimiento de todos los reynos]]'' depicts the flag of "the Empire of Constantinople" combining the red-on-white Cross of St George with the "tetragrammatic cross" of the ruling house of the [[Palaiologoi]], featuring the four [[beta (letter)|beta]]s or ''pyrekvola'' ("fire-steels") on the flag quarters representing the imperial motto Βασιλεύς Βασιλέων Βασιλεύων Βασιλευόντων ("King of Kings Reigning over those who Rule").&lt;ref name=heraldica&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/byzantin.htm Byzantine Heraldry, from ''Heraldica.org'']&lt;/ref&gt; The tetragrammatic cross flag, as it appears in quarters II and III in this design, is well documented. In the same Spanish atlas this "plain" tetragrammatic cross flag is [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gr_byz.html#con presented as] (among other places in the Empire) "the Flag of [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]]" and "the real Greece and Empire of the Greeks (la vera Grecia e el imperio de los griegos)". The (quartered) arrangement that includes the Cross of St. George is documented only in the Spanish atlas, and most probably combines the arms of Genoa (which had occupied Galata) with those of the Byzantine Empire, and was most probably flown only in Constantinople.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;  [[Pseudo-Kodinos]] records the use of the "tetragrammatic cross" on the banner (''phlamoulon'') borne by imperial [[Byzantine navy|naval vessels]], while the ''[[megas doux]]'' displayed an image of the emperor on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=472–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman period===
[[File:Graeco-Ottoman banner.png|200px|thumb|The merchant vessel ''Panagia tis Ydras'', built 1793, flying the Graeco-Ottoman flag.]]
[[File:Agios Nikolaos and Poseidon.jpg|200px|thumb|''Agios Nikolaos'' (1797) and ''Poseidon'' (1815), belonging to the Anargyros brothers from [[Spetses]], flying variants of the [[Russian flag]]]]
During the Ottoman rule several unofficial flags were used by Greeks, usually employing the Byzantine [[double-headed eagle]] (see below), the cross, depictions of saints and various mottoes.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; The Christian Greek [[sipahi]] cavalry employed by the Ottoman Sultan were allowed to use their own, clearly Christian flag, when within [[Epirus]] and the [[Peloponnese]]. It featured the classic blue cross on a white field with the picture of [[Saint George|St. George]] slaying the dragon,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} and was used from 1431 until 1639, when this privilege was greatly limited by the Sultan.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Similar flags were used by other local leaders. The closest to a Greek "national" flag during Ottoman rule was the so-called "Graeco-Ottoman flag" (Γραικοθωμανική παντιέρα), a civil ensign Greek Orthodox merchants (better: merchants from the Greek-dominated Orthodox ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'') were allowed to fly on their ships, combining stripes with red (for the Ottoman Empire) and blue (for Orthodoxy) colours. After the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]], Greek-owned merchant ships could also fly the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]].

During the [[Orlov Revolt|uprising of 1769]] the historic blue cross on white field was used again by key military leaders who used it all the way to the [[Greek Revolution|revolution of 1821]].  It became the most popular Revolution flag, and it was argued that it should become the national flag. The "reverse" arrangement, white cross on a blue field, also appeared as Greek flag during the uprisings. This design had apparently been used earlier as well, as a local symbol (a similar 16th or 17th century flag has been [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gr_ottom.html#sou found] near [[Chania]]).

A military leader, [[Giannis Stathas|Yiannis Stathas]], used a flag with white cross on blue on his ship since 1800. The first flag featuring the design eventually adopted was created and hoisted in the [[Evangelistria Monastery, Skiathos|Evangelistria monastery]] in [[Skiathos]] in 1807. Several prominent military leaders (including [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] and [[Andreas Miaoulis]]) had gathered there for consultation concerning an uprising, and they were sworn to this flag by the local bishop.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Prior and during the early days of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1829), a large variety of flags was designed, proposed and used by various [[Greek Enlightenment|Greek intellectuals]] in Western Europe, local leaders, chieftains and regional councils. Aside from the cross, many of these flags featured saints, the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] (symbolising the rebirth of the Greek nation), mottoes such as "Freedom or Death" (Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος) or the [[fasces]]-like emblems of the ''[[Philiki Etaireia]]'', the secret society that organised the uprising.

Because the European monarchies, allied in the so-called "[[Concert of Europe]]", were suspicious towards national or social revolutionary movements such as the ''Etaireia'', the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus|First Greek National Assembly]], convening in January 1822, took steps to disassociate itself from the ''Etaireia''{{'}}s legacy and portray nascent Greece as a "conventional", ordered nation-state.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; As such not only were the regional councils abolished in favour of a central administration, but it was decided to abolish all revolutionary flags and adopt a universal national flag. The reasons why the particular arrangement (white cross on blue) was selected, instead of the more popular blue cross on a white field, remain unknown.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt;

On 15 March 1822, the Provisional Government, by Decree Nr. 540, laid down the exact pattern: white cross on blue (plain) for the land flag; nine alternate-coloured stripes with the white cross on a blue field in the canton for the naval ensign; and blue with a blue cross on a white field in the canton for the civil ensign (merchant flag).&lt;ref name=presidency/&gt;&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; On 30 June 1828, by decree of the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the civil ensign was discontinued, and the cross-and-stripes naval ensign became the national ensign, worn by both naval and merchant ships.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; This design became immediately very popular with Greeks and in practice was often used simultaneously with the national (plain cross) flag.

On 7 February 1828 the Greek flag was internationally recognised for the first time by receiving an official salutation from British, French, and Russian forces in [[Nafplio]], then the capital of Greece.&lt;ref name="MEE"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ἑλλάς - Ἑλληνισμὸς |url=http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/php/pdf_pager.php?filename=%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fanemi-portal%2Fmetadata%2Fa%2Ff%2Fb%2Fattached-metadata-01-0002588%2F279838_10.pdf&amp;rec=%2Fmetadata%2Fa%2Ff%2Fb%2Fmetadata-01-0002588.tkl&amp;do=279838_10.pdf&amp;width=662&amp;height=963&amp;pagestart=1&amp;maxpage=1104&amp;lang=en&amp;pageno=1&amp;pagenotop=1&amp;pagenobottom=262 |work=Μεγάλη Ἐλληνικὴ Ἐγκυκλοπαιδεῖα |volume=10 |location=Athens |publisher=Pyrsos Co.

===Historical evolution===
[[image:Specifications for the Flag of Greece (1833).png|thumb|The first official specifications for the war flag or naval ensign, published 3 June 1833.]]

After the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]] in 1832, the new king, [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], added the royal [[Coat of Arms]] (a shield in his ancestral [[:File:Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg|Bavarian pattern]] topped by a crown) in the centre of the cross for military flags (both land and sea versions).&lt;ref name=presidency/&gt; The decree dated 4 (16) April 1833 provided for various maritime flags such as the war flag or naval ensign (set at 18:25), pennant, royal standard (set at 7:10) and civil ensign (i.e. the naval ensign without coat of arms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wG-pNmgvR9663dtvSoClrL8Iqk9pJn1S_jtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6hq6ZkZV96FIHRj4KF2eAQU6pex3eEyRyAtkKMn8GThQtzZta2lztro. |title=Περί της Πολεμικής και Εμπορικής Σημαίας του Βασιλείου |trans-title=Regarding the Naval and Commercial Flag of the Kingdom |author=Government of Greece |date=3 June 1833 |work=Government Gazette |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal decree dated 28 August 1858 provided for details on the construction and dimensions concerning the flags described in the 1833 decree and other flags. After Otto's abdication in 1862, the royal coat of arms was removed.

In 1863, the 17-year old Danish prince William was selected as Greece's new king, taking on the name [[George I of Greece|George I]]. A royal decree dated 28 December 1863 introduced crowns into the various flags in place of the coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;royal decree dated 28 December 1863. [http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wEAK2kq_ZCTwHdtvSoClrL8zhQSQP9tRnopCCmqt4mgGEHlbmahCJFQEmRQwePEviF8EeCoaT0MAKztT3Sb63xk3VkL3PiCQ3TmKpPQrAvPZQfu8Gq1RKKQmyoZK8o4WQPyqD8Tm5-gGp6p-90qkEjIiPRjFvgWiF1-jSMp3DjaoQ.. Gazette 5/1864, 3-2-1864, pages 16-17]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arrangements were made for the royal flags, which featured the coat of arms of the House of [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]] on a square version of the national flag. A square version of the land flag with St. George in the centre was adopted on 9 April 1864 as the [[Hellenic Army|Army]]'s [[Colors, standards and guidons|colours]].&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wEAK2kq_ZCTwHdtvSoClrL89jIOERdkaTXtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6qSYtMQEkEHLwnFqmgJSA5UkHEKavWyL4FoKqSe4BlOTSpEWYhszF8P8UqWb_zFijGEKYZW5D6cHE0jxwiaE_B3VjI95Ckucxi5zOQRDDluu Gazette 16/1864, 25-4-1864, p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; The exact shape and usage of the flags was determined by Royal Decree on 26 September 1867.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wEg7sqjUkXhkHdtvSoClrL8rhVGUJriOULtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6qSYtMQEkEHLwnFqmgJSA5UkHEKavWyL4FoKqSe4BlOTSpEWYhszF8P8UqWb_zFijB2CD49C6oOTf0c1KpUdpIBmx7O5mCsosB2RnMH1Gsqc Gazette 61/1867, 19-10-1867, pages 700-701]&lt;/ref&gt; By a new Royal Decree, on 31 May 1914, the various flags of Greece and its military were further regulated. By this decree, the flag with the crown was adopted for use as a [[state flag]] by ministries, embassies and civil services, while the sea flag (without the crown) was allowed for use by private citizens.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt;

On 25 March 1924, with the establishment of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]], the crowns were removed from all flags.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; On 20 February 1930, the national flag's proportions were established at a 2:3 ratio, with the arms of the cross being "one fifth of the flag's width". The land version of the national flag was to be used by ministries, embassies, and in general by all civil and military services, while the sea flag was to be used by naval and merchant vessels, consulates and private citizens. On 10 October 1935, [[Georgios Kondylis]] declared that the monarchy had been restored. By decree of 7 November 1935, the 31 May 1914 decree was restored.&lt;ref name="1935 Flags Restoration Decree"&gt;[http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wFO_KkoXZFLcndtvSoClrL8c6_D4wm7uet5MXD0LzQTLWPU9yLzB8V68knBzLCmTXKaO6fpVZ6Lx9hLslJUqeiQDXcWtx2XOBuUCmKPaHy46nmatzZ4drAC3R56ovwa0E8. ΦΕΚ 541/1935, dated 12.11.1935, page 2656]&lt;/ref&gt; Thereby, the crown was restored on the various flags.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; The crown was again removed by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|military dictatorship]] in 1967, following the aborted counter-coup and subsequent self-exile of King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] on 13 December. The sea flag was established as the sole national flag in 1969, using a very dark shade of blue, and on 18 August 1970, the flag ratio was changed to 7:12.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt;

After the [[metapolitefsi|restoration of democracy]] in August 1974, the land flag was restored for a while (per Law 48/1975 and Presidential Decree 515/1975, on effect on 7 June 1975) until 1978.&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt;

=== Theories regarding the blue and white colours ===
[[image:Greek flag-Santorini.png|200px|thumb|It is widely believed that the colours of the Greek flag come from the blue of the sky and the white of the waves.]]

Several Greek researchers&lt;ref name="Zapheiriou"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tzouras"&gt;V. Tzouras, ''Η Ελληνική Σημαία, Μελέτη Πρωτότυπος Ιστορική (The Greek Flag, Original Historic Study)'', A. Lantzas, Kerkyra 1909&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kokkoni"&gt;E. Kokkoni and G. Tsiveriotis, ''Ελληνικές Σημαίες, Σήματα-Εμβλήματα (Greek Flags, Signs and Emblems)'', Athens 1997 {{ISBN|960-7795-01-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to establish a continuity of usage and significance of the blue and white colours, throughout Greek history.

Usages cited include the pattern of blue and white formations included on the shield of [[Achilles]],&lt;ref name="Tzouras"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; the apparent connection of blue with goddess [[Athena]], some of [[Alexander the Great]]'s army banners,&lt;ref name="Zapheiriou"/&gt; possible blue and white flags used during [[Byzantine]] times,&lt;ref name="Tzouras"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; supposed coats of arms of imperial dynasties and noble families, uniforms, emperors' clothes, patriarchs' thrones etc.,&lt;ref name="Zapheiriou"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kokkoni"/&gt; 15th century versions of the Byzantine Imperial Emblems &lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; and, of course, cases of usage during the Ottoman rule and the Greek revolution.

On the other hand, the [[Great Greek Encyclopedia]] notes in its 1934 entry on the Greek flag that "very many things have been said for the causes which lead to this specification for the Greek flag, but without historical merit".&lt;ref name="MEE"/&gt;

[[image:Flag of Greece (parade).svg|thumb|The flag as used on parade]]
In 1978 the sea flag was adopted as the sole national flag, with a 2:3 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Law 851/21-12-1978 ''On the national Flag, War Flags and the Distinguishing Flag of the President of the Republic'', Gazette issue A-233/1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The flag is used on both land and sea is also the war and civil ensign, replacing all other designs surviving until that time. No other designs and badges can be shown on the flag. To date, no specification of the exact shade of the blue colour of the flag has been issued. Consequently, in practice hues may vary from very light to very dark. The Greek Flag Day is on 27 October.

The old land flag is still flown at the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in Athens, site of the National Historical Museum, and can still be seen displayed unofficially by private citizens.

===Protocol===
[[File:Greece Cyprus flags cross finials Agioi Anargyroi Pafos.jpg|thumb|Flags of Greece and Cyprus being flown on flagpoles with  cross finials in front of Agioi Anargyroi Church, Pafos]]
The use of the Greek flag is regulated by Law 851.&lt;ref name="Law 851"&gt;[http://old.law.uoa.gr/crime-research/simaia.pdf Law 851 (in Greek)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120102653/http://old.law.uoa.gr/crime-research/simaia.pdf |date=2013-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the law states that:
*When displayed at the Presidential Palace, the [[Hellenic Parliament]], the ministries, embassies and consulates of [[Greece]], schools, military camps, and public and private ships as well as the navy, the flag must:
:#Fly from 8am until sunset,
:#Be displayed on a white mast topped with a white cross on top of a white sphere,
:#Not be torn or damaged in any way. If the flag is damaged, it should be burned in a respectful manner.
*The flag can be displayed by civilians on days specified by the ministry of internal affairs, as well as in sporting events and other occasions of the sort.
*When displayed vertically, the canton must be on the left side of the flag from the point of view of the spectator.
*The flag should never be:
:#Defaced by means of writing or superimposing any kind of image or symbol upon it,
:#Used to cover a statue. In that case, cloth in the national colours must be used,
:#Hung from windows or balconies without the use of a mast,
:#Used for commercial purposes,
:#Used as a logo for any corporation or organization, even at different proportions.
:#When placed on top of a coffin, the canton must always be on the right of the person's head.

===Colours===
The government has not specified exactly ''which'' shade of blue should be used for the flag, and as such flags with many varying shades exist. In the most recent legislation regarding the national flag, the colours mentioned are:

{{Quote box
 |quote  = The National Flag of Greece is cyan and white, it is made up of nine (9) stripes equal in width, of which five (5) are cyan and four (4) are white so that the upper and lower stripes are cyan and the others inbetween are white.
 |source = '''Law 851/1978''', ''Regarding the National Flag'', Article 1, Clause 1
 |quoted = 1
 |width  = 400px
 |align  = center
|qalign = justify
}}
Because of the use of the word 'cyan' ({{lang-el|κυανός}}, ''{{lang|el-Latn|Kyanos}}''), which can also mean 'blue' in [[Greek language|Greek]], the exact shade of blue remains ambiguous. Although it implies the use of a light shade of blue, such as on the [[flag of the United Nations]], the colours of the Greek flag tend to be darker, especially during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|dictatorship]] and in recent years, with the exception of the years of the rule of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]], when a very light shade of blue was used. Consequently, the shade of blue is largely left to the flagmakers to decide, as shown in the table below.

===Flag days===
[[image:Porosoxiday.jpg|200px|thumb|[[No Day]] decorations in [[Poros]].]]
Law 851/1978 sets the general outline for when the specific days on which the flag should be raised. Raising the flag on national or local public holidays is mandatory for everyone, from 8am until sunset.&lt;ref name="Law 851" /&gt; For national holidays, this applies country-wide, but on local ones it only applies to those areas where the said holiday is being celebrated.&lt;ref name="Law 851" /&gt; Additionally, the flag may also be flown on days of national mourning, [[half-mast]]. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Greece)|Minister of the Interior]] has the authority to proclaim flag days if they are not already proclaimed, and proclaiming regional flag days is vested with the elected head of each [[regional units of Greece|regional unit]] (formerly [[Prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]).&lt;ref name="Law 851" /&gt;

==Military flags==

=== Army and Air Force War Flag ===
The War flag (equivalent to regimental colours) of the Army and the Air Force is of square shape, with a white cross on blue background. On the centre of the cross the image of Saint George is shown on Army war flags and the image of [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Michael]] is shown on Air Force war flags.&lt;ref name=presidency/&gt;

In the Army war flags are normally carried by infantry, tank and special forces regiments and battalions, by the [[Hellenic Military Academy|Evelpidon Military Academy]], the Non-Commissioned Officers Academy and the [[Presidential Guard (Greece)|Presidential Guard]] when in battle or in parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O. Zotiadis|title=Decorations of War Flags ({{lang-el|Τιμητικές διακρίσεις πολεμικών σημαιών}})|journal=Military Review| date=January 2001 |publisher=Hellenic Army General Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, flying a war flag in battle is unlikely with current warfare tactics.

===Naval and civil ensigns===
The current naval and civil [[ensign]]s are identical to the national flag.

The simple ''white cross on blue field'' pattern is also used as the Navy's [[naval jack|jack]] and as the base pattern for naval rank flags. These flags are described in Chapter 21 (articles 2101–30) of the Naval Regulations. A jack is also flown by larger vessels of the Hellenic Coast Guard.

Units of Naval or Coast Guard personnel in parade fly the war ensign in place of the war flag.&lt;ref name="War_flags"&gt;Presidential Decree 348 /17-4-1980, ''On the war flags of the Armed Forces and the Gendarmerie Corps'', [http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wHTYtwQ1DmBJndtvSoClrL8qch8ztD7IMbtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6hq6ZkZV96FIX4AjUZfxaUytXlEZB1FlApTYXFK63-HTZeR-sgyCNgw.

In the past a war flag was assigned to the former semi-military [[Greek Gendarmerie|Hellenic Gendarmerie]], which was later merged with [[Cities Police]] to form the current [[Hellenic Police]]. The flag was similar to the Army war flag but showing [[Agape, Chionia, and Irene|Saint Irene]] in place of Saint George.&lt;ref name="War_flags"/&gt;

Since the Fire Service and the Hellenic Police are considered civilian agencies, they are not assigned war flags. They use the National Flag instead.&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Decree 991/7-10-1980, ''Specification of the size of the National Flag born by the Coast Guard, Cities Police and Fire Service and the length of its staff'', Gazette issue A-247/1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Identical rules were applied to the former Cities Police. However, recently the Police Academy has been assigned a war flag, and they paraded for the first titme with this flag on Independence Day, March 25, 2011. The flag is similar to the Army war flag, with the image of St George replaced with that of [[Artemius|Artemius of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?Id=5074&amp;Itemid=52 Σχολή Αξιωματικών Ελληνικής Αστυνομίας]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flag of the Head of State==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
Throughout the history of [[Greece]], various [[List of heads of state of Greece|heads of state]] have used different flags. The designs differ according to the historical era they were used in and in accordance with the political scene in [[Greece]] at the time. The first flag to be used by a [[List of heads of state of Greece|head of state of Greece]] was that of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto of Greece]].

Following the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]] in 1832, the 17-year old Bavarian prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] was selected as king for the newfound monarchy. A royal decree dated 4 (16) April 1833 prescribed a number of maritime flags, including the royal standard. This flag, set at a 7:10 ratio, was a variant of the Greek white-cross-on-blue and featured the ancestral coat of arms of the [[Wittelsbach dynasty]] at its centre. The construction and dimensions of this flag was further described by a decree dated 28 August 1858, which also changed the proportions of the flag from 7:10 to 3:2. Following Otto's abdication in 1862, the Wittelsbach coat of arms would subsequently be removed.

In 1863, the 17-year old Danish prince William was selected as Greece's new king, taking on the name [[George I of Greece|George I]]. A royal decree dated 28 December 1863 prescribed that the king's standard would retain the same dimensions and basic design of the previous flag. At the flag's centre, the royal coat of arms of the new dynasty ([[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]]) would feature. By a new royal decree of 3 June 1914, the distinguishing flags to be utilised by the various members of the royal family were described. The king's flag was defined as being square in shape and, as in previous flags, featured the coat of arms of the king on a Greek white-cross-on-blue. As the king at the time, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], was made a [[Stratarchis|field marshal]] the previous year, the coat of arms on his flag featured a heraldic representation of the [[Marshal's baton]] in twos, crossed behind his coat of arms.

With the establishment of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] in 1924, the king's flag was made redundant. In 1930, a presidential decree described the president's flag as being a square version of the usual cross flag, devoid of any distinguishing markings.

On 10 October 1935, [[Georgios Kondylis]] declared that the monarchy had been restored and the 3 June 1914 decree was restored by decree of 7 November 1935. This flag, and the flags of other members of the royal family, was replaced the following year with new designs. Unlike previous designs, all flags now featured the coat of arms of the dynasty at its centre and would be distinguished by the number of crowns present at each of the four corners of the flags: The flag of the king featured a crown on each of the corners of the flag. This was the last design of a royal standard to be adopted prior to the eventual formal abolition of the monarchy in 1973.

The president's flag is currently prescribed by Presidential Decree 274/1979.&lt;ref&gt;published in [http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wGrY_r85_PxvndtvSoClrL8I8z79QigGevtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6hq6ZkZV96FIfIVzV77K9VrmI-B8II7sEq0wVwZop3WjWeAjIakbj2s.

==Double-headed eagle==
{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Palaeologoi eagle.jpg|thumb|The double-headed eagle was the symbol of the [[Palaiologoi]] dynasty.]]
One of the most recognisable (other than the cross) and beloved Greek symbols, the [[double-headed eagle]], is not a part of the modern Greek flag or coat of arms (although it is officially used by the Greek Army, the [[Church of Greece]], the [[Cypriot National Guard]] and the [[Church of Cyprus]], and was incorporated in the Greek coat of arms in 1926 &lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;). One suggested explanation {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is that, upon independence, an effort was made for political — and international relations — reasons to limit expressions implying efforts to recreate the Byzantine Empire. Yet another theory{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is that this symbol was only connected with a particular period of Greek history (Byzantine) and a particular form of rule (imperial). More recent research {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} has justified this view, connecting this symbol only to personal and dynastic emblems of Byzantine Emperors.

Some Greek sources have attempted to establish links with ancient symbols: the eagle was a common design representing power in ancient city-states, while there was an implication of a "dual-eagle" concept in the tale that Zeus left two eagles fly east and west from the ends of the world, eventually meeting in Delphi, thus proving it to be the centre of the earth. However, there is virtually no doubt that its origin is a blend of Roman and Eastern influences. Indeed, the early Byzantine Empire inherited the Roman eagle as an imperial symbol. During his reign, Emperor [[Isaac I Comnenus]] (1057&amp;ndash;59) modified it as double-headed, influenced by traditions about such a beast in his native [[Paphlagonia]] in Asia Minor (in turn reflecting possibly much older local myths). Many modifications followed in flag details, often combined with the cross. After the recapture of Constantinople by the Byzantine Greeks in 1261, two crowns were added (over each head) representing — according to the most prevalent theory — the newly recaptured capital and the intermediate "capital" of the [[empire of Nicaea]].  There has been some confusion about the exact use of this symbol by the Byzantines; it appears that, at least originally, it was more a "dynastic" and not a "state" symbol (a term not fully applicable at the time, anyway), and for this reason, the colours connected with it were clearly the colours of "imperial power", i.e., red and yellow/gold.

After the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] nonetheless, the double-headed eagle remained a strong symbol of reference for the Greeks. Most characteristically, the Orthodox Church continues to use the double-headed eagle extensively as a decorative motif, and has also adopted a black eagle on yellow/gold background as its official flag.

After the Ottoman conquest, however, this symbol also found its way to a "new Constantinople" (or [[Third Rome]]), i.e. [[Moscow]].  Russia, deeply influenced by the Byzantine Empire, saw herself as its heir and adopted the double-headed eagle as its imperial symbol. It was also adopted by the Serbs, the Montenegrins, the Albanians and a number of Western rulers, most notably in Germany and Austria.

The '''flag of the [[City of London]]''' is based on the [[flag of England]], having a centred [[red]] [[St George's Cross]] on a [[white]] background, with the red [[sword]] in the upper hoist [[Flag terminology|canton]] (the top left quarter). The sword is believed to represent the sword that beheaded [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] who is the [[patron saint]] of the city. The tip of the sword always points upwards; therefore, when the flag is held on its side as a banner, the sword would be printed to face hoist and would be located on the left as it is hanging down (see [[#Usage|below]]).

This flag does not represent [[Greater London]] (which does not have its own flag, aside from the banner of the arms of the former [[Greater London Council]]), only the historical [[City of London]] which covers approximately {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. All references in this article relate to that city, not Greater London, unless specified.

==Symbolism and history==
[[File:Coat of Arms of The City of London.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms|Arms]] of the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of the City of London]]: ''Argent, a cross gules in the first quarter a sword in pale point upwards of the last''; [[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]]: ''Two dragons with wings elevated and addorsed argent on each wing a cross gules''; [[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]]: ''On a dragon's wing displayed [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] a cross gules''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca19.htm&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The flag is a [[banner of arms]], derived from [[Coat of arms of the City of London|the city's coat of arms]] with the sword symbolising the sword that beheaded [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] who is the [[patron saint]] of the city. Saint Paul has featured as a symbol of the city since about the 13th century. His full figure representation was rapidly replaced with his symbolic representation of the sword.&lt;ref name="COL"/&gt;

Some believe the sword is a [[dagger]] that commemorates the dagger of Sir [[William Walworth]], former [[Lord Mayor of London]], which killed [[Wat Tyler]], leader of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], in 1381. A  verse at [[Fishmongers' Hall]] may explain the relationship:
:
"Brave Walworth, Knight, lord mayor that slew&lt;br /&gt;
Rebellious Tyler in his alarmes;&lt;br /&gt;
The king therefore did give him in lieu&lt;br /&gt;
The dagger to the city armes.

However this is believed to be a fable, with the sword on the arms being used several months before the killing of Wat Tyler (Tyler being stabbed in June, and the Arms being designed in April&lt;ref name="COL"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040302214758/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/leisure_heritage/libraries_archives_museums_galleries/clro/pdf/cityarms.PDF  The City Arms], City of London Corporation, hosted by webarchive&lt;/ref&gt;).

The earliest mention of the city's coat of arms was on 17 April 1381 when the old seal was deemed "ill-befitting the honour of the City" and a replacement commissioned by Walworth. Both Saint Paul and [[Saint Thomas Becket]] featured in the previous design and were carried over to the new one similar to the modern design.&lt;ref name="COL"/&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Flag of the City of London banner.png|thumb|150px|Flag shown when displayed as banner]]
[[File:London, Tower Bridge - coat of arms and flags - geograph.org.uk - 560793.jpg|left|thumb|Flag flying on Tower Bridge]]
The flag flies from various buildings in the city such as the formal buildings of [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] (the seat of power in the city) and [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], the [[official residence]] of the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (the Lord Mayor has a variant of the flag, defaced with his coat of arms).

It can also be seen on sites outside the city that are administered by the [[City of London Corporation]] (the governing body) such as on [[Tower Bridge]], the Animal Reception Centre at [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Hampstead Heath]]. It can also be seen on certain landmarks, such as the bridges maintained by the [[Bridge House Estates]].

The flag is used on the [[One pound (British coin)|one pound coin]] design of 2010.

New Zealand's '''Fortune Theatre''' lays claim to being the world's southernmost professional theatre company and is the sole professional theatre group in [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunedinentertainment.co.nz/fortunetheatre FortuneTheatre – DunedinEnternatinment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525014345/http://dunedinentertainment.co.nz/fortunetheatre |date=25 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a regular host of both local and touring shows.

The Fortune Theatre building is registered as a category I historic place by [[Heritage New Zealand]], which recognises its historic and architectural significance.&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture| url=http://www.fortunetheatre.co.nz/historical_information/architecture | publisher=Fortune Theatre  | accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513200514/http://fortunetheatre.co.nz/historical_information/architecture |archivedate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the corner of [[Moray Place, Dunedin|Moray Place]] and Upper Stuart Street, in the heart of the southern city of Dunedin.

Financial difficulties in 2000 threatened the theatre with closure, and forced the sale of the building to the [[Dunedin City Council]]. The council currently leases the building back to the Fortune Theatre Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunedin's sole theatre in danger|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3610988|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=11 April 2008|date=17 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2003|title=A look at the multi-million dollar contribution of City Property|journal=City Talk|pages=9|url=http://www.cityofdunedin.com/city/?MIvalObj=citytalk_december2003_preservh&amp;MItypeObj=application/pdf&amp;ext=.pdf|accessdate= 11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre announced its closure on 1 May 2018, again citing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/fortune-theatre-closes|title=Fortune Theatre closes|date=1 May 2018|work=Otago Daily Times Online News|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
The Fortune Theatre company was co-founded by David Carnegie, Alex Gilchrist, Murray Hutchinson and Huntly Elliot. The company has been operational since 1973 and from 1974, was initially located in the 105-seat Otago Cine Club [[theatrette]] at the rear of the Athenaeum building of the Octagon. However, after hiring full-time acting staff in 1977, it was decided that the venue was too small to continue to be viable. Since 1978, the Fortune Theatre has been located in the former Trinity Methodist Church which was opened in 1870 and is close to the city's centre, [[The Octagon, Dunedin|The Octagon]].&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

== Education ==
The Fortune Theatre provides a range of options for schools such as tours around the theatre, and opportunities to talk to the cast and crew of a production.

It also offers education workshops which are show-specific. The workshops are designed to link to a range of subjects in the New Zealand Curriculum, including [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] achievement standards in subjects such as Drama at NCEA levels 1–3.

In addition, the Fortune Theatre hosts a drama ambassador programme to engage students with the theatre by offering opportunities to attend rehearsals as well as complimentary tickets to the shows with the condition recipients review each production. This programme began in 2005 with 19 schools in the [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] region areas of New Zealand. Each school can nominate one or two students per term to be their "Drama Ambassador".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortunetheatre.co.nz/education Education – FortuneTheatre.co.nz]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Larnach – Castle of Lies"==
In 1994, the Fortune Theatre performed a play about the tragedies of [[William Larnach]]'s family, titled "Larnach – Castle of Lies", before 100 invited guests in the ballroom of [[Larnach Castle]].&lt;ref name=play&gt;{{cite web | title=Larnach Castle at Tvnz.co.nz | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411424/597703 | publisher=One News | date=July 2005 | accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was a night to remember. As the guests arrived a terrible storm blew up from nowhere. The smoke from the fires blew back down the chimneys so that you couldn't see – and your eyes hurt. Hail crashed on the iron roof so that you couldn't hear. Doors mysteriously opened by themselves and it got very cold. In the play – just as Larnach shot himself there was a blinding white light. Afterwards at supper people were talking about the lightning strike as Larnach held the gun to his head. I said `Oh no that was stage effects.' We asked the stage manager. He said `It was none of our doing, it was lightning.' I think that Larnach was present that night. He didn't like the play."&lt;br&gt;
:-- Margeret Barker (Co-owner of Larnch Castle)&lt;ref name=play /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Building architecture ==
The Trinity Methodist Church was designed by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[R. A. Lawson]] and made out of the local materials trachyandesite and [[Oamaru]] stone. The former church is an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and contains a "Rose" [[stained glass]] window which is located at the back of what is now the theatre's main stage.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

== ''Ghost Hunt'' ==
In 2005, the theatre was featured on ''[[Ghost Hunt (NZ TV series)|Ghost Hunt]]'', a New Zealand television show, as it is claimed that the theatre is haunted. Not long after the Fortune Theatre moved into the old church, tales spread of "sinister voices" being heard offstage and well-secured lights falling from the lighting grid. A phantom audience member has also been reported by theatregoers on numerous occasions. Reports continued to come from a variety of reliable sources until the claimed hauntings of the Fortune Theatre became a part of Dunedin folklore.

The Ghost Hunt investigation team visited the theatre and were shown a picture that is claimed to show the ghost of a young woman gliding through a wall of the [[foyer]], below a Gothic window. During the investigation team's visit, they were also able to talk to people who had worked at the theatre and claim to have had [[paranormal]] experiences in the building:

A [[lighting technician]] claimed that he was all alone setting up on stage one day when he "glimpsed a person" over his shoulder on the edge of the stage and thought that "they were reading through some lines, as an actor would" but knew no cast members were around at the time. He turned the stage lights on and "suddenly they were gone".

A man who ran the box office claimed to have had two "disconcerting" experiences. The first experience involved a "young boy sitting in the corner". He initially "thought nothing of it" but the "realisation struck" him that the theatre was closed. He "turned back around, but he'd disappeared." The second experience involved a girl he claims he noticed when he "looked up to the back corner of the audience seating, near where the soundman usually sits" after he heard "a strange noise in the theatre" on one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Ghost Hunt: True New Zealand Ghost Stories {{ISBN|0-7900-1012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery Bruegel.jpg|thumb|270px|''[[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Bruegel)|Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery]]'', [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], 1565, {{convert|24| x |34|cm|abbr=on}}]]
[[File:Del sarto Battesimo della gente.jpg|thumb|270px|''Battesimo della gente'', one of [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s gray and brown grisaille [[fresco]]es in the Chiostro dello Scalzo, [[Florence]] (1511-26).]]

A '''grisaille''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|aɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|eɪ|l}}; {{lang-fr|gris}} {{IPA-fr|ɡʁizaj|}} 'grey') is a [[painting]] executed entirely in shades of grey or of another neutral greyish colour.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'', 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly used in large decorative schemes in imitation of sculpture. Many grisailles include a slightly wider colour range, like the [[Andrea del Sarto]] fresco illustrated. Paintings executed in brown are referred to as [[brunaille]], and paintings executed in green are called [[verdaille]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grisaille may be executed for its own sake, as [[underpainting]] for an [[oil painting]] (in preparation for glazing layers of colour over it), or as a [[Physical model|model]] for an [[engraver]] to work from. "Rubens and his school sometimes use monochrome techniques in sketching compositions for engravers."&lt;ref&gt;'''Oxford Companion to Art.''' Ed. Harold Osborne; Clarendon Press. Oxford, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Full colouring of a subject makes many more demands of an artist, and working in grisaille was often chosen as being quicker and cheaper, although the effect was sometimes deliberately chosen for aesthetic reasons. Grisaille paintings resemble the [[drawing]]s, normally in monochrome, that artists from the Renaissance on were trained to produce; like drawings they can also betray the hand of a less talented assistant more easily than a fully coloured painting.

==History==
[[File:Hans Memling 016.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Hans Memling]] wing, with [[donor portrait]] in colour below grisaille Madonna imitating sculpture.]]
[[Giotto]] used grisaille in the lower registers of his frescoes in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], and [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and their successors painted grisaille figures on the outsides of the wings of [[triptych]]s, including the [[Ghent Altarpiece]]. Originally these were the sides on display for most of the time, as the doors were normally kept closed except on feast days or at the (paid) request of tourists. However today these images are often invisible in museums when the tryptych is displayed open and flat against a wall. In these cases imitation of sculpture was intended; sculpture was still more expensive than a painting even by a top master.

[[Illuminated manuscript]]s had often been produced in pen and [[watercolour|wash]] with a very limited colour range, and many artists such as [[Jean Pucelle]] and [[Matthew Paris]] specialised in such work, which had been especially common in England since [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] times. Renaissance artists such as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]] often used grisaille as a classicising effect, either in imitation of the effect of a classical [[sculpture]]d relief, or of [[Ancient Roman art|Roman painting]].

In the Low Countries a continuous tradition of grisaille paintings can be traced from [[Early Netherlandish painting]] to [[Martin Heemskerck]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] (''[[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Bruegel)|Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery]]'') and [[Hendrik Goltzius]], and through the copious output of [[Adriaen van de Venne]], to the circle of [[Rembrandt]], and [[Jan van Goyen]].

The ceiling [[fresco]]es of the [[Sistine Chapel]] have portions of the design in grisaille, as does the lower part of the great staircase decoration by [[Antonio Verrio]] at [[Hampton Court]].

=== Modern examples ===

Grisaille, while less widespread in the 20th Century, continues as an artistic technique. [[Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso's]] painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' is one contemporary example.

[[Hugo Bastidas]] is a contemporary American painter known for black and white paintings that imitate the effect of grisaille and often resemble black and white photographs.&lt;ref name = carvalho&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Carvalho|first1=Denise|title=Hugo Bastidas at Nohra Haime|magazine=Art in America|date=April 2008|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastidas’ paintings frequently reference architecture, water, vegetation and art history, and reflect his concern about [[The Human Condition|the human condition]], [[globalization]], and their effect on the Earth’s well-being.&lt;ref name = gallerybio&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.nohrahaimegallery.com/hugo-bastidas.html|publisher=Nohra Haime Gallery|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to New York from a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] in his native Ecuador in the early 1990s, Bastidas began using a restricted color palette of black and white.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt; His medium- and large-scale paintings allude to black-and-white photography, and feature contrasting zones of high and low detail.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawson|first1=Jessica|title=Without Hue: A Rainbow of Grays|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/12/14/without-hue-a-rainbow-of-grays/23de1b30-cba4-4f12-bb05-bd11f9fda6ac/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making thousands of marks with a size No. 1 hog's bristle brush on linen primed with rabbit-skin glue, Bastidas achieves a high level of image definition.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bardier|first1=Laura|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=http://www.artealdia.com/International/Contents/Reviews/Hugo_Bastidas|publisher=Arte Al Dia|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also works in digital photography, which informs his subject matter without rendering a [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.mattmuseum.org/exhibition/hugo-bastidas/|publisher=Mattatuck Museum|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
With the 20th century's emphasis on direct (''[[alla prima]]'') painting, the grisaille technique lost favour with artists of the period. This historic method is still incorporated into the curriculum of some private [[studio|ateliers]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, at The Contemporary Realist Academy, in Memphis, Tennessee, The Ryder Studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Ecole Albert Defois in France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In enamel and stained glass==
[[File:Magi Herod MNMA Cl23532.jpg|thumb|140px|Grisaille stained glass (15th century)]]
The term is also applied to monochrome painting in other media such as [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], where an effect similar to a [[relief]] in silver may be intended. It is common in [[stained glass]], where the need for sections in different colours was thereby greatly reduced. Portions of a window may be done in grisaille — using, for example, [[silver stain]] or vitreous paint — while other sections are done in coloured glass.

'''Henry Charles Andrews''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1794 – 1830), was an English botanist, botanical artist and engraver.

He lived in [[Knightsbridge]], and was married to Anne Kennedy,&lt;ref name=heathers/&gt; the daughter of [[Lee and Kennedy|John Kennedy]] of [[Hammersmith]], a nurseryman who assisted Andrews in the descriptions of the plants he illustrated.

He was an accomplished and unusual botanical artist, in that he was not only the artist but also the engraver, colourist, and publisher of his books in an era when most artists were only employed to draw plates. The ''Botanist's Repository'' was his first publication; issued serially in London in ten volumes between 1797 and 1812, the ''Repository'' at a half-crown an issue, provided affordable images of plants to the growing population of amateur gardeners in Britain. This was the first serious rival to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew]] publication, ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''. Perhaps not surprisingly, [[William Hemsley (botanist)|W. Botting Hemsley]], a botanist who was employed by Kew, was critical of the quality of Andrews' 664 coloured plates in the ''Botanist's Repository'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The drawing is usually fairly good, though not equal to some of this artist's later work... There is no pretense of giving any analysis of the flowers, but they themselves are often inexact and generally inadequate to be of any use botantically. The descriptive part is also unequal, and synonymy altogether excluded. Nevertheless, the ''Repository'' was in one sense superior to the ''Botanical Magazine'' of that date, because the majority of the plants figured were of recent introduction."&lt;ref&gt;Hemsley, 1906. in ''A New and Complete Index to the Botanical Magazine'', "The history of the Botanical Magazine", p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Andrews' major work is considered to be his ''Coloured Engravings of Heaths'', published in four volumes between 1794 and 1830.&lt;ref name=heathers/&gt; It focused on the many species of the genus ''[[Erica]]'' that were introduced to Great Britain from South Africa in the early and middle 19th century, leading to what has been called an "''Erica'' mania" in British horticulture.&lt;ref name=bibliodyssey/&gt;&lt;ref name=antiquariaat/&gt;

According to a contemporary announcement, Andrews also taught drawing from nature and etching to private students.&lt;ref name=heathers/&gt;

[[File:Madrid Ejercito del Aire.jpg|250px|thumb|Spanish Air Force headquarters of Neo-Herrerian style]]

The '''Herrerian style''' ({{lang-es|estilo herreriano}} or ''arquitectura herreriana'') of [[architecture]] was developed in [[Spain]] during the last third of the 16th century under the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1556-1598), and continued in force in the 17th century, but transformed by the [[Baroque]] current of the time. It corresponds to the third and final stage of the [[Spanish Renaissance]] architecture, which evolved into a progressive purification ornamental, from the initial [[plateresque]] to classical [[Purism (architecture)|purism]] of the second third of the 16th century and total nudity decorative that introduced the Herrerian style.

It originated with the construction of the [[El Escorial|Monastery of El Escorial]] ([[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]], [[Community of Madrid]]) and, more specifically, with the reorganization of the project made by [[Cantabria]]n architect [[Juan de Herrera]] (1530-1597), after the death of [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] (1515-1567), author of the first design.

Its main representatives are the mentioned Herrera, who the style owes its name, and [[Francisco de Mora]] (1553-1610), disciple of the anterior and architect of the [[Lerma Ducal Palace|Ducal Palace of Lerma]] ([[Lerma, Burgos|Lerma]], [[Province of Burgos]]), other key works of Herrerian architecture.

== Features ==

The Herrerian architecture, or Herrerian style is characterized by its [[Geometry|geometric]] rigor, the mathematical relation between the various architectural features, the clean volumes, the dominance of the wall over the span and the almost total absence of decoration, which is why in time was called '''desornamentaded style'''. Is also known as '''escorial style''', referring to the building that serves as best example for the architectural style.

The Herrerian buildings are noted for its severe horizontality, achieved through the balance of forms, preferably cubic, which are arranged symmetrically in the structure. Usually have wooden roofs covered with [[slate]] in the exterior and side towers, tipped with pointed toes pyramidal spire, which introduce an element of verticality, while helping to reinforce the sense of grandeur and elevation.

At other cases, not looking both the horizontal and the bulkiness, which is reached through the geometrical design of the various architectural elements. This is the case of the model used in the construction of parish churches, with great facades, quadrangular towers and heavy [[buttress]]es.

It is, in most cases, works of great size, imposing in its environment and impress with its austere and monumental air.

In regard to decorative applications, these reduce the use of basic geometric shapes such as [[sphere]]s and [[pyramid]]s. From a [[Sociology|sociological]] standpoint, this sobriety is a response to [[Protestantism]], in line with the guidelines set by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563).

== Historical development ==

The Herrerian style was the official architecture of the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]]s, from the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. The sociopolitical impact meant the construction of the [[El Escorial|Monastery of El Escorial]] (1563-1584) facilitated its expansion. To this contributed also the fact that [[Juan de Herrera]] was appointed in 1579 Inspector of Monuments of the Crown.

The style spread through first in the [[comarcas of Madrid]] of the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]], located within the catchment area of the Monastery of El Escorial, through two ways: works directly funded by the Royal Family and those promoted by the Guadarraman municipalities.

The first category covers infrastructure such as the [[Puente Nuevo (Galapagar)|Puente Nuevo]], in [[Galapagar]], and buildings for private use by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], as the Casa Veleta, also in the same town, and the [[Real Aposento de Torrelodones]], both disappeared. Were built for comfort the movements of the King from [[Madrid]] to the [[Real Sitio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial y El Escorial|Real Sitio de El Escorial]].

In [[El Escorial, Madrid|El Escorial Town]], the Crown encouraged the development of various urban planning and the construction of the [[Iglesia de San Bernabé (El Escorial)|Church of San Bernabé]], by Francisco de Mora, one of the contributors to Herrera in the works of the Royal Monastery.

The Royal Family also approved the granting of benefits to those municipalities to proceed with the renovation of its main public and religious buildings. The result of this measure is the currently Herrerian aspect of the parish churches of [[Valdemorillo]] and [[Navalagamella]], both of [[medieval]] origin.

The Herrerian style quickly spread throughout [[Spain]] and [[Americas|America]]. Some representative works are the [[Cathedral of Valladolid]] and the [[Puente de Segovia (Madrid)|Puente de Segovia]] ([[Madrid]]), both designed by [[Juan de Herrera]]; the church of the [[Monasterio de Uclés]] ([[Uclés]], Cuenca Province), by [[Francisco de Mora]]; the [[Church of San Sebastián (Villacastín)|Church of San Sebastián]] ([[Villacastín]], Segovia Province), attributed to [[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]]; the [[Colegiata de San Luis]] ([[Villagarcía de Campos]], Valladolid Province), by the same author; and the [[College of Our Lady of Antigua]] ([[Monforte de Lemos]], Lugo Province) by Simón de Monasterio.

Special mention deserves the [[Ducal Palace of Lerma|Ducal Palace]] of Lerma (Burgos Province), by [[Francisco de Mora]] that began in 1601. Led to the adoption of the emerging Herrerian style  by the emerging [[Baroque]] trends of the time and the establishment of a palatial architecture model, which was repeated throughout the 17th century.

Most civic buildings erected in [[Madrid]] during the reign of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] continued the architectural guidelines of that palace. This is the case of the [[Palace of the Councils, Madrid|Palacio de los Concejos]], the [[Santa Cruz Palace, Madrid|Palacio de Santa Cruz]] and the [[Plaza de la Villa|Casa de la Villa]], all of baroque bill, but with notable Herrerian reminiscent.

The influence of Herrerian style is also visible in the expansion that, separately, had its distinctive spire pyramidal or "madrilian spire", with slate roofs. This item was adopted by many constructions after to 16th and 17th century, mainly in the bell towers and [[dome]]s of the churches, and in many civil constructions.

The 18th and 19th century meant the decline of this architectural movement. In the 20th century came to pick up, during the [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship of Francisco Franco]]. The Plaza de la Moncloa, in [[Madrid]], chaired by [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]] headquarters, among many large constructions of the time, symbolizes the resurgence of Herrerian architecture.

'''[[Italy|Italian]] [[Contemporary art]]''' refers to painting and sculpture in Italy from the early 20th century onwards.

==Futurism==
{{Main|Futurism}}
The founder and most influential personality of Futurism was the Italian writer [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], who launched the movement in his ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' in 1909.

The Futurists expressed a loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. They admired [[speed]], [[technology]], youth and [[violence]], the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over [[nature]], and they were passionate nationalists. 
The Futurists practised in every medium of art, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[fashion]], [[textiles]], [[literature]], music, [[architecture]] and even [[Futurist meals|gastronomy]].

The leading painters of the movement were [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]] and [[Gino Severini]]. They advocated a "universal dynamism," which was to be directly represented in painting. At first they used the techniques of [[Divisionism]], breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes,  later adopting the methods of [[Cubism]].  In 1912, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas.

Advocates of war as "the world's best hygiene," Marinetti, Boccioni, and Sant'Elia all volunteered to fight during World War One. The unofficial end of the first wave of Futurism (also known as the Heroic Years) was in 1916 - the same year Boccioni died in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/5708-guggenheim-museum-presents-unprecedented-survey-of-italian-futurism-opening-in-february |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429052622/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/5708-guggenheim-museum-presents-unprecedented-survey-of-italian-futurism-opening-in-february |archivedate=2015-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Marinetti revived the movement, seeking to make Futurism the official state art of [[Fascism|Fascist]] Italy.  The main expression of Futurism in painting in the 1930s and early 1940s was Aeropainting (''[[aeropittura]]''), launched in a manifesto of 1929, ''Perspectives of Flight'', signed by [[Benedetta Cappa]], [[Fortunato Depero]], [[Gerardo Dottori]], [[Fillìa]], Marinetti, [[Enrico Prampolini]], Somenzi and Tato. The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters,&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;[http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html Osborn, Bob, ''Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090815/http://www.simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |date=2010-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered aeroplanes and [[aerial landscape art|aerial landscape]] as new subject matter. 
 
Futurism had depended so much on its energetic promotion by Marinetti that his death in 1944 brought the movement to an end.  Its association with Italian Fascism meant that most of its artists were shunned in the post-war years, but it has received scholarly attention in recent decades and a major exhibition was launched to coincide with the centenary in 2009. In 2014, the Solomon R. Guggenheim held a major Futurist retrospective featuring over 300 Futurist pieces spanning all media they worked in.

==Novecento Italiano==
{{Main|Novecento Italiano}}
[[Novecento Italiano]] was an Italian artistic movement founded in [[Milan]] in 1922 by [[Anselmo Bucci]] (1887–1955), [[Leonardo Dudreville]], [[Achille Funi]], [[Gian Emilio Malerba]], [[Piero Marussig]], [[Ubaldo Oppi]] and [[Mario Sironi]].  Motivated by a post-war “[[Return to order|call to order]]”, they were brought together by Lino Pesaro, a gallery owner interested in modern art, and [[Margherita Sarfatti]], a writer and art critic who worked on Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini’s]] newspaper, ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]''.  Sarfatti was also Mussolini’s mistress.

The movement was officially launched in 1923 at an exhibition in Milan, with Mussolini as one of the speakers.  After being represented at the [[Venice Biennale]] of 1924, the group split and was reformed.  The new Novecento Italiano staged its first group exhibition in Milan in 1926.

Several of the artists were [[First World War|war]] veterans; Sarfatti had lost a son in the war.  The group wished to take on the Italian establishment and create an art associated with the rhetoric of [[Fascism]].  The artists supported the Fascist regime and their work became associated with the state propaganda department, although Mussolini reprimanded Sarfatti for using his name and the name of Fascism to promote Novecento.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=735492 Saviona Mane, "The Jewish mother of Fascism", ''Haaretz'', 6 July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The name of the movement (which means 1900s) was a deliberate reference to Italian art in the 15th and 16th centuries.  The group rejected European avant garde art and wished to revive the tradition of large format history painting in the [[Classicism|classical]] manner.  It lacked a precise artistic programme and included artists of different styles and temperament, for example, [[Carlo Carrà|Carrà]] and [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marini]].  It aimed to promote a renewed yet traditional Italian art.  Sironi said, “if we look at the painters of the second half of the 19th century, we find that only the revolutionary were great and that the greatest were the most revolutionary”; the artists of Novecento Italiano “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it”.

==Metaphysical art==

{{Main|Metaphysical art}}
Metaphysical art ({{lang-it|Pittura metafisica}}) is the name of an Italian [[art movement]], created by [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Carlo Carrà]]. Their dream-like paintings of squares typical of idealized Italian cities, as well as apparently casual [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposition]]s of objects, represented a visionary world which engaged most immediately with the [[unconscious mind]], beyond physical reality, hence the name. The metaphysical movement provided significant impetus for the development of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].

==Classical modernism of the 20th century==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Italian sculptors and painters joined the rest of Western Europe in the revitalization of a simpler, more vigorous, less sentimental Classical tradition, that was applied in liturgical as well as decorative and political settings.  The leading sculptors included: Libero Andreotti, [[Arturo Martini]], [[Giacomo Manzù]], Nicola Neonato, Pietro Guida, Marcello Mascherini.

==Arte povera==
{{Main|Arte povera}}
The term [[Arte Povera]] was introduced in [[Italy]] during the period of upheaval at the end of the 1960s, when artists were taking a [[Political radicalism|radical]] stance. Artists began attacking the values of established institutions of government, industry, and culture, and even questioning whether art as the private expression of the individual still had an ethical reason to exist. Italian art critic [[Germano Celant]] organized two exhibitions in 1967 and 1968, followed by an influential book called ''Arte Povera'', promoting the notion of a revolutionary art, free of convention, the power of structure, and the market place. Although Celant attempted to encompass the radical elements of the entire international scene, the term properly centered on a group of Italian artists who attacked the corporate mentality with an art of unconventional materials and style.

The most wide-ranging public collection of works from the Arte Povera movement is at the [[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein]].

==Transavantgarde==
[[Transavantgarde]] is the Italian version of [[Neo-expressionism]], an art movement that swept through Italy, and the rest of Western Europe, in the late 1970s and 1980s.  The term ''transavantgarde'' was coined by the Italian art critic, [[Achille Bonito Oliva]], and literally means ''beyond the [[avant-garde]]''.  This art movement rejected [[conceptual art]], reintroducing emotion―especially joy―back into painting and sculpture.  The artists revived [[figurative art]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].  The principal transavantgarde artists were [[Sandro Chia]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Enzo Cucchi]], [[Nicola de Maria]], [[Mimmo Paladino]] and [[Remo Salvadori]].

==Interior design==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SofaDueFoglie.png|thumb|right|200px|The ”Due Foglie” sofa, by [[Gio Ponti]]]] --&gt;
Italian interior design in the 20th century was particularly well-known and grew to the heights of class and sophistication.  At first, in the early 20th century, Italian furniture designers struggled to create an equal balance between classical elegance and modern creativity, and at first, Italian interior design in the 1910s and 1920s was very similar to that of French art deco styles, using exotic materials and creating sumptuous furniture. However, Italian art deco reached its pinnacle under [[Gio Ponti]], who made his designs sophisticated, elegant, stylish and refined, but also modern, exotic and creative. In 1926, a new style of furnishing emerged in Italy, known as ''"Razionalismo"'', or ''"Rationalism"''. The most successful and famous of the Rationalists were the Gruppo 7, led by [[Luigi Figini]], [[Gino Pollini]] and [[Giuseppe Terragni]]. There styles used tubular steel and was known as being more plain and simple, and almost Fascist in style after c. 1934. After [[World War II]], however, was the period in which Italy had a true ''avant-garde'' in interior design. With the fall of Fascism, rise of Socialism and the 1946 RIMA exhibition, Italian talents in interior decorating were made evident, and with the [[Italian economic miracle]], Italy saw a growth in industrial production and also mass-made furniture. Yet, the 1960s and 1970s saw Italian interior design reach its pinnacle of stylishness, and by that point, with Pop and post-modern interiors, the phrases ''"Bel Designo"'' and ''"Linea Italiana"'' entered the vocabulary of furniture design.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2005) p.486&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==

[[Image:composizione 59 Accatino.jpg|thumb|right|200px|”Composizione”, 1959, Enrico Accatino]]
[[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] began painting on mirrors in 1962, connecting painting with the constantly changing realities in which the work finds itself. In the later 1960s he began bringing together rags with casts of omnipresent classical statuary of Italy to break down the hierarchies of "art" and common things. An art of impoverished materials is certainly one aspect of the definition of ''Arte Povera''. In his 1967 ''Muretto di straci'' (''Rag Wall'') Pistoletto makes an exotic and opulent tapestry wrapping common bricks in discarded scraps of fabric.

Artists such as [[Jannis Kounellis]] and [[Mario Merz]] attempted to make the experience of art more immediately real while also more closely connecting the individual to nature.

The leading sculptors from 1930-40 to 2000 included [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marino Marini]], Emilio Greco, [[Pino Pascali]], [[Mario Ceroli]], Giovanni e Arnaldo Pomodoro, [[Umberto Mastroianni]], Ettore Colla.

The leading painters from 1930-40 to 2000 included [[Alberto Savinio]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Alberto Magnelli]], [[Felice Casorati]], [[Roberto Melli]], [[Corrado Cagli]], [[Gianfilippo Usellini]], [[Pietro Annigoni]], [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Giovanni Capogrossi]], [[Enrico Accatino]], [[Antonio Donghi]], [[Oreste Carpi]], [[Fausto Pirandello]], [[Afro Basaldella]], [[Alberto Burri]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Franco Nonnis]], [[Domenico Gnoli (artist)|Domenico Gnoli]], [[Valerio Adami]], [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Emilio Tadini]], [[Salvatore Provino]], [[Mino Argento]].

A new breed of contemporary Italian artist such as [[Gaspare Manos]] are developing a more global language that draws on a vast international personal experience of life and culture stretching over several continents and many decades of travel.  Such artist think locally and act globally, like [[Rabarama]] who has been the first Italian sculptor to collaborate with the [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabarama and Cirque du Soleil ([https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/11/idUSnHUGgsDfra+1c8+ONE20130311 Reuters])&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent in Spain for example is the painter [[Miquel Barceló]].

'''Kailashnath Mahadev Statue''' ({{lang-ne|कैलाशनाथ महादेव}}) is the world's tallest [[Shiva]] statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author= |date=2010-06-12 |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/nepal-president-to-inaugurate-world-s-tallest-shiva-statue_633492.html |title=Nepal President to inaugurate 'world's tallest' Shiva statue |publisher=Zee News Website |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krs1&gt;{{cite web| date=2010-06-13 |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2010/06/13/top-story/worlds-tallest-shiva-statute-ready/316265|title=World’s ‘tallest’ Shiva statue ready | publisher=Ekantipur Website |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is situated in Sanga, on the border of the [[Bhaktapur District|Bhaktapur]] and [[Kavrepalanchok District|Kavrepalanchwok]] districts in [[Nepal]], about 20&amp;nbsp;km from [[Kathmandu]].

The statue is 143 feet (43.5&amp;nbsp;m) in height, and was made using copper, zinc, concrete, and steel. According to the [[List of statues by height]], Kailashnath Mahadev is the world's fortieth-tallest statue, four places after the [[Statue of Liberty]].

==Design and construction==
Designed to resemble images of the Hindu god, [[Lord Shiva]], and seen as a marvel of Nepalese engineering, the statue's construction began in 2003 and was completed in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was constructed mainly by Kamal Jain and "Hilltake", a company Jain established in Nepal in 1992 which deals with products such as water tanks. Nepalese engineers were involved in the construction along with one experienced Indian engineer specializing in the design and construction of large structures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The statue's foundation is about 100 feet deep, which was necessary to anchor the structure into the ridge. Due to the threat of potential landslides, structures were also built for ground stabilization.

== Tourism ==
About 5,000 visitors come to the statue on a weekday, and a significantly larger number visit on weekends, national holidays, and Hindu festivals.

Due to the number of visitors the statue has contributed to the religious tourism in Nepal, both locally and internationally, raised the economic activity of the local community, and has made an impact in the development of nearby villages.

'''Evangeline Estelle Gazina''' (c.1837&lt;ref name=Culme&gt;Culme, John. [http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20040821home.html Kate Santley], ''Footlight Notes'', No. 361, 14 August 2004, accessed 7 September 2012; and [http://www.remainstobeseen.com/item.php?item_no=2431 "Kate Santley by Sarony Cabinet Card"], ''Remains to Be Seen'', accessed 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; – 18 January 1923), better known under her stage name, '''Kate Santley''', was a German-born actress, singer and comedian.  After spending her childhood in the US, she came to England in 1861, where she had a successful career, later also becoming a theatre manager.

==Early life==
Santley's parents emigrated from Germany to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she was educated. At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, she came to England as a practising musician, but soon afterwards went on the stage as "Eva Stella", later becoming "Kate Santley".&lt;ref&gt;"Death of Kate Santley. Memories of Opera Bouffe and Burlesque", ''[[The Times]]'', 19 January 1933, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical theatre career==
Santley made a name in the 1860s in British [[music hall]]s and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] [[pantomime]]s.  Early in her career, she was popular for singing the song "The Bell goes a-ringing for Sarah."  At the [[Oxford Music Hall]], she had appeared with [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], who later married [[Carl Rosa]].  Santley was slim and pretty and became much photographed for visiting cards, postcards and advertising.  Early in her career, she played in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''St. George and the Dragon''.

[[Image:Kate Santley as Princess Toto.jpg|left|frame|as ''[[Princess Toto]]'']]
In 1871–72, she visited the US, where she appeared on Broadway, including in a revival of the hit 1866 musical, ''[[The Black Crook]]''.  Returning to London in 1872, she appeared in the London production of ''The Black Crook'' at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], where, the next year, she also starred in the title role in Burnand's English version of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Belle Hélène]]''.  Later in 1873, she sang Cunegonde in ''Le roi Carotte''.  In 1874, she played Haidee in [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Don Juan'', then in ''La Jolie Parfumeuse'', followed by the title role in ''[[Whittington (opera)|Whittington]]'', by Offenbach.&lt;ref&gt;Perdoni, Leon A. [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra/Prog3.htm "An Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square Programme for 1873"]. Arthur Lloyd, 2005, accessed 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, she played Wilhelmina in ''The Jolly Waterman'' at the [[Opera Comique]] and then created the title character in (and produced) ''[[Princess Toto]]'', a [[comic opera]] by [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Frederic Clay]].  Thereafter, Clay wrote numerous songs (such as her popular hit, "Nobody knows as I know") and other operas for Santley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossmith|first=George|year=1888|title=A Society Clown: Reminiscences|location=Bristol/London|publisher=Arrowsmith}} Chapter 8 [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/grossmith/gg08.html Available online here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Santley produced and starred in ''Dipunacy'', which was a popular [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''Diplomacy''.  1879, at the [[Royalty Theatre]], Santley played in ''La Marjolaine'' and starred in (and produced) ''Little Cinderella'' and in the hit ''[[Tita in Thibet]]'' by [[Frank Desprez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText/20021130.html "Kate Santley and Company at the Royalty Theatre" (review of ''Tita'')]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, she played in the Drury Lane pantomime ''Mother Goose (and the Enchanted Beauty)'' with [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]], the popular music hall comedian.  In 1884, Santley played in ''La Cosaque'' at the Royalty, and in 1886, she hired [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] as musical director for the tour of her musical ''Vetah''.  In 1887, she played the title role in ''Indiana'' at the Grand Theatre, [[Islington]], and then on tour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RA4oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA160 "The Only Jones"], ''Judy, or the London Serio-comic Journal'', Volume 41, 5 October 1887, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre management==
[[File:Indiana - Weir Collection.jpg|thumb|Santley in ''Indiana'' at [[Royal Lyceum Theatre]], Edinburgh]]
In 1876, Santley managed [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s revival of their one-act hit ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]].  [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] joined forces with Santley in January 1877 at the Royalty to present ''Lischen and Fritzen'', Offenbach's ''Orpheus in the Underworld'' and ''Happy Hampstead'' by Carte (under the pseudonym Mark Lynne) and his secretary, [[Frank Desprez]].
In 1877, Santley became the manager of the Royalty Theatre, an association lasting some thirty years.  She later seems to have acquired the head lease.&lt;ref name=british-history&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41093 ''The Pitt Estate in Dean Street – The Royalty Theatre''] ''[[Survey of London]]: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho'' (1966), pp. 215–21 (British History Online), accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1877, the First Chief Officer of the [[London Fire Brigade]] strongly recommended to the Metropolitan Board of Works the immediate closure of the theatre.  Santley, however, had it reconstructed to designs of architect Thomas Verity, whose plans, providing improved means of egress, were approved in 1882.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

Many of the productions at the Royalty were opera-bouffes adapted from the French.  M. L. Mayer, formerly of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French. The Coquelins and other luminaries of the [[Comédie-Française]] appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognised home of the Parisian drama.'  There was further reconstruction of the theatre in 1883, and Santley was praised for the theatre's renovations then and in the later 1905 renovation.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; The opening of [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and of new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] and the [[Apollo Theatre]], drew audiences away from the little Royalty theatre in Dean Street, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering.  This led to her providing an occasional home for the [[Independent Theatre Society]], who produced plays on a subscription-only basis – hence evading the censorship of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The London première's of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (on 13 March 1891) and [[Émile Zola]]'s ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' (on 9 October 1891), led to a storm of protest, with some critics calling for the withdrawal of Santley's licence.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s first play, ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', premièred for the Society at the theatre on 9 December 1892.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; When the theatre finally had a great success, with [[Brandon Thomas]]'s play, ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'', its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

In 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was [[Arthur Bourchier]], and the theatre underwent another renovation.  He produced, among other plays, ''The Chili Widow'', an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights.  In 1899, the first production of the [[Incorporated Stage Society]] took place with the first performance of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]''.  In 1900–01 [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre.  Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by [[W. B. Yeats]] and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of [[John Millington Synge|Synge]]'s first play, ''The Shadow of the Glen''.  In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

==Personal==
Santley married Lieutenant Colonel Lockhart Mure Hartley Kennedy in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/search.pl?start=1901&amp;end=1901&amp;sq=4&amp;eq=4&amp;type=Marriages&amp;vol=5c&amp;pgno=1115&amp;db=bmd_1460362145&amp;jsexec=1&amp;mono=0&amp;v=MTQ2MTE0NDk1MDo0NzI2NWU4ZTI4NTk3MDdmMDI5YjljYmEyY2EwYzUxMzcwNTNmYzNl&amp;searchdef=db%3Dbmd_1460362145%26given%3DLockhart%26type%3DMarriages%26surname%3DKennedy%26sq%3D1%26eq%3D4&amp;action=Find "Evangeline Estella G.

She claimed that she was born in 1843, but like many actresses, her actual birthday was likely earlier, and some sources date her birth to 1837.&lt;ref name=Culme/&gt;

The tradition of '''[[Korea]]n jade carving''' dates back to [[neolithic]] finds along the [[Namgang]] river basin in [[Gyeongju]]. Jade rings and accessories were worn by the higher classes of society, especially women, from the [[three kingdoms]] period and reached their peak in the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty, the golden age of jadework. Korean jadework often includes [[buddhist]] motifs, [[cicada]]s, and peanut-shaped good luck talismans on the small scale, as well as larger-scale architectural pieces.

==Contemporary jade masters==

Amongst the most famous is [[Jang Ju-won]] who has been designated Important Intangible cultural heritage No. 100. Jang is known for his refinement, and largely self-taught has recovered jadework for future generations.

==Local Markets==

In the local markets there now exists a wide variety of jade carvings and jewelry available for purchase.  These items are much less costly than their Chinese counterparts.

The '''Malvern Wells War Memorial''' is located on Wells Road in the village of [[Malvern Wells]] near [[Great Malvern]] in Worcestershire. The memorial marks the deaths of local individuals who died fighting in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. It was dedicated in June 1920 by [[Lieutenant Colonel W R Chichester]] in the aftermath of the First World War. A a further inscription was later added to mark the Second World War. The memorial is a tall thin [[Portland stone]] octagonal pillar topped by a sculpture of a [[pelican]] [[Attitude (heraldry)#Vulning / In her Piety|vulning herself]], a heraldic and [[Pelican#Christianity|Christian symbol of sacrifice]].&lt;ref name="MalPC"&gt;Malvern Wells Parish Council: War Memorial [http://www.malvernwells-pc.gov.uk/parish-council/parish-assets/35-malvern-wells-war-memorial Malvern Wells Parish Council], accessdate: January 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IWM"&gt;War Memorial: Malvern Wells (WMR-32991): [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/32991 War Memorial: Malvern Wells (WMR-8111)], accessdate: January 2, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Millicent Franks''' (6 October 1886 [[Durban]] - 11 February 1961 [[Winchester]]) was a South African botanical illustrator. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.s2a3.org.za/bio/Biograph_final.php?serial=980&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 15, in November 1901, she took up the position of botanical artist and assistant to [[John Medley Wood]] at the Natal Herbarium in Durban, and when [[Frieda Lauth]] left the herbarium in 1903, Franks was appointed as chief botanical artist. 

She produced most of the illustrations for volumes 3 to 6 of Wood's 'Natal Plants', also providing several illustrations for [[Rudolf Marloth]]'s 'Flora of South Africa' (1913-1932). She collected and pressed some 370 plant specimens from [[Van Reenen]], [[Camperdown, KwaZulu-Natal|Camperdown]] and Durban, and these ended up at the Natal Herbarium and the National Herbarium in Pretoria. {{botanist|Franks|border=0|inline=1}}

Franks moved to England in November 1914, working for three months at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]] on illustrations for Wood's 'Natal Plants'. The following year she married Howard Flanders. She spent the last years of her life in [[Petersfield]], where she was also buried. &lt;ref&gt;'Botanical Exploration in Southern Africa' - Gunn &amp; Codd&lt;/ref&gt;

She is commemorated in the species ''[[Sisyranthus franksiae]]'', ''[[Celtis mildbraedii|Celtis franksiae]]'', ''[[Brachystelma franksiae]]'' and ''[[Euphorbia franksiae]]'', all named by [[N.E. Brown]], and ''[[Phacelurus franksae|Ischaemum franksae]]'', named by John Medley Wood.

A '''multi-instrumentalist''' is a [[musician]] who plays two or more [[musical instrument]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multi-Instrumentalist|url=http://mw2.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/multi-instrumentalist|publisher=Merriam-Webster|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308053633/http://mw2.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/multi-instrumentalist|archivedate=2012-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a professional level of proficiency. 

Also known as '''[[woodwind doubler|doubling]]''', the practice allows greater ensemble flexibility and more efficient employment of musicians, where a particular instrument may be employed only briefly or sporadically during a performance. Doubling is not uncommon in [[orchestra]] (e.g., [[flute|flutists]] who double on [[piccolo]]) and jazz ([[saxophone]]/flute players); [[double bass]] players might also perform on [[electric bass]]. In [[music theatre]], a [[pit orchestra]]'s reed players might be required to perform on multiple instruments. Church [[piano]] players are often expected to play the church's [[pipe organ]] or [[Hammond organ]] as well. 

In [[popular music]] it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be proficient on instruments not from the same family, for instance to play both guitar and keyboards. Many [[bluegrass music]]ians are multi-instrumentalists. Some [[American Federation of Musicians|musicians' unions or associations]] specify a higher rate of [[Wage|pay]] for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.

==Early music==
The European [[Alta Capella|''Piffari'', ''Stadtpfeifer'' and ''Waits'']] were multi-instrumentalists, who played [[trumpet]], [[sackbut]], [[shawm]], [[cornett]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and string-instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Riemann Musiklexikon 1967: Art. ''Stadtpfeifer''&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians with an education of a ''Stadtpfeifer'' were [[Gottfried Reiche]],&lt;ref name="Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart"&gt;Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Joachim Quantz]],&lt;ref name="Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart"/&gt; Johann Christof Pezel and [[Sigmund Theophil Staden]].&lt;ref name="Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart"/&gt; Also many European church musicians of the 17th and 18th centuries were multi-instrumentalists, who played several instruments. [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] for example played violin, viola da gamba, recorder, flauto traverso, oboe, shawm, sackbut and double bass.&lt;ref&gt;Telemann: Singen ist das Fundament zur Music in allen Dingen; Ed. Werner Rackwitz; Reclam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
Some famous classical composer-performers could play multiple instruments at a high level, such as [[Mozart]], who was a virtuoso on the keyboard and violin. Music written for [[symphony orchestra]] usually calls for a [[percussion]] section featuring a number of musicians who might each play a variety of different instruments during a performance. Orchestras will also often, but not always, call for several members of the [[woodwind]] section to be multi-instrumentalists. This is sometimes referred to as doubling. Typically, for example, one [[flute]] player in the orchestra will switch to playing the [[piccolo]] or [[alto flute]] when called to by the score. Similarly, [[clarinet]] players may double on [[bass clarinet]], [[oboe]] players on [[cor anglais]], and [[bassoon]] players on [[contrabassoon]]. [[Trumpet]] players may switch to [[piccolo trumpet]] for certain Baroque literature, and first [[trombone]] players may switch to [[types of trombone|alto trombone]]. [[organ (music)|Organ]] players are also commonly expected to master the [[harpsichord]] as well. Doubling elsewhere in the orchestra is rare. With [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s, woodwind players are expected to play a large number of woodwind instruments.

==Jazz, modern, and contemporary music==
[[File:Colin Dyall 76th birthday 2015.JPG|thumb|A multi-instrumentalist (father of [[Sharon Dyall|Sharon]] and [[Karl Dyall]]) surrounded by his instruments.]]
In the [[Swing music|swing]] era of [[big band]] music, woodwind players were often expected to play multiple woodwind instruments;  saxophonists might be offered gigs where they were also required to play clarinet, for example. 

The different types of [[saxophone]] use similar designs, varying mainly only in size (and therefore pitch), meaning that once a player has learned to play one it is relatively easy for them to translate the skills into another. As a result, many jazz saxophone players have made careers playing several different instruments, such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Wayne Shorter]], both of whom have frequently used both tenor and soprano saxophones. To a lesser extent this is also the case across the range of [[woodwind]] instruments: Jazz [[flute]] players often play other instruments as well, such as [[Eric Dolphy]] and [[Herbie Mann]], both of whom frequently played flute and saxophone; Dolphy also recorded on [[bass clarinet]]. In the early years of jazz, when the genre was still linked to the [[marching band]] genre, many double-bass players doubled on [[tuba]]. 

From the 1950s onwards and particularly since the development of [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] in the late 1960s, many double-bass players doubled on [[electric bass]], e.g. [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[John Patitucci]]. 

Some jazz instrumentalists whose main instrument is a horn or bass also play [[jazz piano]], because piano is an excellent instrument for composing and arranging, and for developing greater harmonic knowledge. 

Many famous jazz musicians, including [[James Morrison (musician)|James Morrison]], [[Don Burrows]], and [[Brian Landrus]], are multi-instrumentalists.

==Rock and pop music==

In [[popular music]] styles, many musicians and songwriters are multi-instrumentalists. Songwriters often play both piano, a key instrument for arranging and composing, and popular pop or rock instruments such as guitar. A backing band member who doubles will be instructed by the bandleader when to switch instruments (e.g., from bass to [[Hammond organ]]). When playing live, most multi-instrumentalists will concentrate on their main instrument and/or vocals, and hire or recruit backing musicians (or use a [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]) to play the other instruments, thus benefiting from [[economies of scope]].

===Examples=== &lt;!-- either provide refs, or this will be deleted:
One of the pioneers of [[multitrack recording]] of all of the instruments by one performer (one instrument at a time) was [[Mike Oldfield]] on his [[LP record|LP]] ''[[Tubular Bells]]'', where he played organ, guitar, [[honky-tonk piano]], bass, [[glockenspiel]], the tubular bells, and more. --&gt;

Some musicians have pushed the limits of human musical skill on different instruments. British entertainer [[Roy Castle]] once set a world record by playing the same tune on 43 different instruments in four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/southport-news/southport-southport-news/2010/02/19/participants-urged-to-sign-up-for-race-for-roy-to-raise-funds-for-the-roy-castle-fund-101022-25864157/ | author=Moreton, Nick | title=Sign up for Race for Roy to raise funds for the Roy Castle Fund | work=Southport Visiter | date=February 19, 2010 | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Newcombe]], frontman for [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], has claimed to be able to play 80 different instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mndaily.com/2009/03/26/best-comeback-ever | author=Power, Ian | title=Best Comeback Ever? | work=Minnesota Daily | date=March 26, 2009 | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- either provide refs, or this will be deleted:
[[Brian Jones]] of [[the Rolling Stones]] was one of the first well-known pop musicians to be a prolific multi-instrumentalist,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} popularizing diverse instrumentation in [[rock music]] and promoting an important influence on multi-instrumentalists, [[world music]]. Jones also played the majority of the instruments on the soundtrack to the 1967 West German film ''[[A Degree of Murder]]''. [[John Lennon]] of [[The Beatles]] played guitar, bass and keyboards, while [[Paul McCartney]] could play guitar, bass, keyboards and drums. The band's guitarist, [[George Harrison]] could play the guitar, sitar, keyboards and bass, and their drummer, [[Ringo Starr]] played drums and other percussion instruments as well as keyboards. [[Stevie Wonder]] is known to be skilled in several instruments; on his 1972 hit "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" he played all instruments except horns and guitar. [[Todd Rundgren]] wrote, played, sang, engineered, and produced the landmark album ''[[Something/Anything?]]'' in 1972. Rundgren's overall talent, eclecticism, and body of work between the late 1960s and late 1970s would have a profound impact on [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. [[Paul McCartney]] performed the entire ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'' album by himself, all instruments and voices (except a few backing vocals done by his first wife [[Linda McCartney]]).

[[John Fogerty]] played all of the instruments on his first three solo albums: ''[[John Fogerty (album)|John Fogerty]]'', ''[[Blue Ridge Rangers]]'', and ''[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]''. [[Dave Grohl]] did the same on [[Foo Fighters]]' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]], as well as playing guitar and the vast majority of the drum parts for the [[Foo Fighters]]' second studio album, [[The Colour And The Shape]].

Both halves of Scottish pop and folk-rock duo [[Gallagher and Lyle]] are accomplished multi-instrumentalists. Benny Gallagher is proficient on acoustic guitar, piano/keyboards, bass guitar, accordion, mandolin, ocarina and harmonica, sometimes using the latter instrument on a harness. Graham Lyle is a skilled lead, slide and acoustic guitarist, mandolinist and banjoist, and has also been known to play violin, harmonica and drums on disc.

Bassist [[Geddy Lee]] is one half of the songwriting team for the band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. He has stated that although he plays [[bass guitar|bass]] in the band, melodic instruments like the [[piano]], [[synthesizer]] and [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] are his preferred instruments when writing songs.

Some lesser known multi-instrumentalists include [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and [[Jimmy Page]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Jon Foreman]] of the rock band [[Switchfoot]], singer/songwriter/producer [[Bruno Mars]], [[Richard Wright (musician)|Rick Wright]] of [[Pink Floyd]], [[will.i.am]] of [[The Black Eyed Peas]], French singer [[Sébastien Tellier]], [[AJ McLean]] of [[Backstreet Boys]] fame, actor [[Hugh Laurie]], singer-songwriter [[Rozalind MacPhail]], and [[Serj Tankian]] of the music group [[System of a Down]].

One of the most notorious examples of multi-instrumentalist members in a rock band is [[Gentle Giant]]. All musicians who participated in the group played at least three different instruments. The three Shulman brothers (the founders) played about 23 instruments, whilst [[Kerry Minnear]] alone handled about 13.
--&gt;

== Bluegrass ==

In [[bluegrass music]], it is very common for musicians to be skilled on a number of different instruments, including guitar, banjo, fiddle and upright bass.

Bourriaud defined the approach as "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p.113&lt;/ref&gt; The artist can be more accurately viewed as the "catalyst" in relational art, rather than being at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origin of the term==
{{Main article|Traffic (art exhibition)}}
One of the first attempts to analyze and categorize art from the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of relational art&lt;ref&gt;As a term, "relational art" has become accepted over "relational aesthetics" by the art world and Bourriaud himself as indicated by the 2002 exhibition ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'' at [[San Francisco Art Institute]], curated by Bourriaud.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by Nicolas Bourriaud in 1998 in his book ''Esthétique relationnelle'' (''Relational Aesthetics'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1996, in the catalogue for the exhibition ''[[Traffic (art exhibition)|Traffic]]'' curated by Bourriaud at [[CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Bennett. "Public Relations: Nicolas Bourriaud Interview."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Traffic'' included the artists that Bourriaud would continue to refer to throughout the 1990s, such as [[Henry Bond]], [[Vanessa Beecroft]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Liam Gillick]], Christine Hill, [[Carsten Höller]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Miltos Manetas]], [[Jorge Pardo (artist)|Jorge Pardo]], [[Philippe Parreno]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]]. The exhibition took its title and inspiration from Jacques Tati's film ''[[Trafic]]''(1971), in which Tati's protagonist is a Parisian automobile designer preparing a new model for an international auto show. In a ''denoument'' that became a fundamental relational aesthetics strategy, particularly for Tiravanija, Tati's entire film is about the designer's journey to the auto show at which he arrives just in time for the show to close.&lt;ref name="Bishop pp.54-55"&gt;Bishop, Claire. "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Relational Aesthetics'', pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Traffic, Catalogue Capc Bordeaux'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mutualart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Article/TRAFFIC-CONTROL/FBC1A92B4838F138|title=TRAFFIC CONTROL|author=|date=|website=www.mutualart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Relational aesthetics''===
Bourriaud wishes to approach art in a way that ceases "to take shelter behind Sixties art history",&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p.7&lt;/ref&gt; and instead seeks to offer different criteria by which to analyse the often opaque and open-ended works of art of the 1990s. To achieve this, Bourriaud imports the language of the 1990s [[internet]] boom, using terminology such as [[user-friendliness]], [[interactivity]] and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself).&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2002 book ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', Bourriaud describes ''Relational Aesthetics'' as works that take as their point of departure the changing mental space opened by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, Caroline Schneider and Jeanine Herman. ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relational Art===
Bourriaud explores the notion of relational aesthetics through examples of what he calls relational art. According to Bourriaud, relational art encompasses "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space." The artwork creates a social environment in which people come together to participate in a shared activity. Bourriaud claims "the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever scale chosen by the artist."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stam, the head of new media and film studies at [[New York University]], coined a term for the shared activity group: witnessing publics. Witnessing publics are "that loose collection of individuals, constituted by and through the media, acting as observers of injustices that might otherwise go unreported or unanswered." The meaning of relational art is created when arts perception is altered while leaving the original artifact intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Keywords in Subversive Film / Media Aesthetics| last = Stam| first = Robert| publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| year = 2015| isbn = 1118340612| location = |page = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In relational art, the audience is envisaged as a community. Rather than the artwork being an encounter between a viewer and an object, relational art produces encounters between people. Through these encounters, meaning is elaborated ''collectively'', rather than in the space of individual consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writer and director [[Ben Lewis (writer)|Ben Lewis]] has suggested that relational art is the new "ism", in analogue with "ism"s of earlier periods such as [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]] and [[cubism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/art-safari1.shtml |title=BBC iPlayer - BBC Four |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", published in 2004 in ''[[October (journal)|October]]'', [[Claire Bishop]] describes the aesthetic of [[Palais de Tokyo]] as a "laboratory", the "curatorial modus operandi" of art produced in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop writes, "An effect of this insistent promotion of these ideas as artists-as-designer, function over contemplation, and open-endedness over aesthetic resolution is often ultimately to enhance the status of the curator, who gains credit for stage-managing the overall laboratory experience. As [[Hal Foster]] warned in the mid-1990s, 'the institution may overshadow the work that it otherwise highlights: it becomes the spectacle, it collects the cultural capital, and the director-curator becomes the star.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop identifies Bourriaud's book as an important first step in identifying tendencies in the art of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; but also writes in the same essay that such work “seems to derive from a creative misreading of [[poststructuralist]] theory: rather than the interpretations of a work of art being open to continual reassessment, the work of art itself is argued to be in perpetual flux.”&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop also asks, "if relational art produces human relations, then the next logical question to ask is what ''types'' of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She continues that "the relations set up by relational aesthetics are not intrinsically [[democracy|democratic]], as Bourriaud suggests, since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of [[subjectivity]] as whole and of community as immanent togetherness."&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Traffic Control", published one year later in ''[[Artforum]]'', artist and critic Joe Scanlan goes one step further in ascribing to relational aesthetics a palpable peer pressure. Scanlan writes, "Firsthand experience has convinced me that relational aesthetics has more to do with peer pressure than collective action or egalitarianism, which would suggest that one of the best ways to control human behavior is to practice relational aesthetics."

==Exhibitions==
In 2002, Bourriaud curated an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'', "an exploration of the interactive works of a new generation of artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/i1_a/2003_02_25_i1_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Nicolas Bourriaud and Karen Moss |website=Stretcher.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibited artists included [[Angela Bulloch]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], [[Jens Haaning]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Gillian Wearing]] and [[Andrea Zittel]]. Critic Chris Cobb suggests that Bourriaud's "snapshot" of 1990s art is a confirmation of the term (and idea) of relational art, while illustrating "different forms of social interaction as art that deal fundamentally with issues regarding public and private space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb |first=Chris |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/r3_a/2002_11_13_r3_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Touch - Relational Art from the 1990’s to Now |website=Stretcher.org |date=2002-12-14 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector organized an exhibition with most of the artists associated with Relational Aesthetics, but the term itself was shelved in favor of calling the show ''Theanyspacewhatever''. The exhibition included stalwarts Bulloch, Gillick, Gonzalez-Foerster, Höller, Huyghe, and Tiravanija, along with loosely affiliated artists Maurizio Cattelan, Douglas Gordon, Jorge Pardo, and Andrea Zittel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/anyspace/exhibition.html|title=theanyspacewhatever|author=|date=|website=web.guggenheim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">A '''rigger''' is one who works on ropes, booms, lifts, hoists and the like for a stage production, film, or television show.

The term "rigger" originally referred to a person who attended to the [[rigging]] of a sailing ship.  In the age of sail, trading followed seasonal patterns with ships leaving port at set times of the year to make the most of winds.  When not at sea sailors would seek employment ashore.  Their skill with ropes and booms found use in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgarena.com/archives/interviews/jeremie/jeremie.html cgarena.com, Interview with Jeremie Passerin - Rigging Supervisor at Blur Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original canvas backdrops used in the theatre moved with ropes and pulleys, being developed from techniques used for [[sail]]s.  It is from these roots that modern [[fly system]]s emerged.  This also gave rise to the tradition in British theatres of never [[Whistling#Superstition|whistling on stage]] as the riggers would use the same whistled instructions on stage as they did aboard ship. A misplaced whistle could be taken as an instruction to the riggers to change the set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.animationmentor.com/why-a-great-rigger-is-an-animators-best-friend/  animationmentor.com Why a Great Rigger is an Animator’s Best Friend, By: Ozgur Aydogdu] &lt;/ref&gt;

The term rigger is still used for people backstage in [[theatre]]s, the [[road crew]] for a live [[concert]], [[convention (meeting)|convention]]s and [[trade show]]s, and by extension to similar jobs such as those who are responsible for fastening chain motors (like [[CM Lodestar]]) by wire rope to the structural steel of a building.&lt;ref&gt;Uva's Rigging Guide for Studio and Location, By Michael Uva, Sabrina Uva&lt;/ref&gt;

With the birth of the [[film]] industry, just as stage actors adapted their techniques to the new medium so did those back stage. The complexity of the new environment giving rise to specializations such as those in the film industry who rig scaffolding for film sets and camera rigs; also termed as a standby rigger if they are on site and 'on call' all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfilm.com/Crew_Position_Glossary.aspx?dirElementId=bc0af813426943ffa06192f9e3a74e9f nmfilm.com, Glossary of Industry Job Positions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wire riggers==
In the theater and [[film industry]], a '''wire rigger''' is a worker in the [[special effects]]/stunts [[film crew]] who "flies" [[actor]]s.  They are responsible for rigging special harnesses to attached wires which in turn are run through a series of "blocks" ([[pulley]]s) to a control area where a wire rigger raises, lowers or traverses an actor wearing the harness.  Wire riggers also rig up rails along which travels a "skate" from which the wire is attached.  Many plays and feature films (e.g. [[Peter Pan]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Superman]]) use this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodstuntcoordinator.com/blog-post/stunt-wire-rigging/ hollywoodstuntcoordinator.com, Wire riggers]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Loves Martyr TP 1601.png|thumb|Title page of ''Loves Martyr'' (1601), printed by [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]]]]
'''Robert Chester''' (flourished 1601) is the mysterious author of the poem ''Love's Martyr'' which was published in 1601 as the main poem in a collection which also included much shorter poems by [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[George Chapman]] and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], along with the anonymous "Vatum Chorus" and "Ignoto".

Despite attempts to identify Chester no information has ever emerged to indicate with any certainty who he was. Currently all that is known of Chester is his name, the long poem he published, and a few unpublished verses. The poem's meaning is deeply obscure. Even the authenticity of the date on the title page has been questioned. It is also not known why Shakespeare and so many other distinguished poets supplemented the publication of such an obscure person with their own works.

==Identity==
The only clue to Chester's identity is the fact that his poem was dedicated to [[John Salusbury (poet)|Sir John Salusbury]] of [[Lleweni Hall]], Denbighshire, in Wales. Sir John was a member of the powerful [[Salusbury family]] of Wales. It may have been published to celebrate his knighthood in June 1601.&lt;ref&gt;John Finnis and Patrick Martin, "Another turn for the Turtle", ''The Times'', 18 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even this date has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Gililov, "For Whom the Bell Tolled: A New Dating for Shakespeare's The Phoenix and the Turtle and the Identification of its Protagonists", Aleksandr Tikhonovich Parfenov, Joseph G. Price (eds) ''Russian Essays on Shakespeare and His Contemporaries'', University of Delaware Press, 1998, pp.146–185. Cf. [https://academic.oup.com/nq/article-abstract/53/1/71/1091818/The-Phoenix-and-the-Turtle-Was-Published-in-1601?redirectedFrom=fulltext Boris Borukhov, ” 'The Phoenix and the Turtle' Was Published in 1601", ''Notes &amp; Queries'', 2006, Vol. 53 Issue 1, pp. 71–72].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878 Chester was identified with a man of that name from [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]], Cambridgeshire, by Alexander Grosart, who produced the first modern edition of the poem. However, in 1913, Carleton Brown argued that Chester must have been closely associated with Salusbury in Denbighshire. Also, Chester's verse suggests that he was a servant of Salusbury's, rather than a social equal as was the Robert Chester from Royston. Brown discovered a manuscript poem entitled ''A Winter's Garland'', written by Chester, in the Salisbury family archives. Another poem, welcoming Salusbury home from London, compares Chester's own crude "hoarse-throat raven's song" to the "court beautifying poets" he would have heard in London. Brown concluded that Chester was a local employee of Salusbury's who probably worked in his household. In 2009, Boris Borukhov, comparing the signatures of the poet and the Robert Chester from Royston, demonstrated that they were two different people.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Borukhov, "Was the Author of Love's Martyr Chester of Royston?", ''Notes &amp; Queries'', 2009, Vol. 56 Issue 1, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Chester's description of himself as a "British" poet, rather than "English" one, his particular interest in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s account of [[King Arthur]], as well as his links to Salusbury, strongly suggest that he was Welsh.&lt;ref name = "pott"&gt;Lois Potter, ''The Life of William Shakespeare: A Critical Biography'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p.268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Moore Smith, review of "Poems by Sir John Salusbury and Robert Chester" by Carleton Brown, ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 9, No. 4, Oct. 1914, pp. 533–536&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no documentation beyond this has been found to identify Chester. [[E. A. J. Honigmann]] argues that Chester was probably Salusbury's local chaplain or secretary, and that he and his patron shared a taste for "mystical verse" which contained obscure acrostic puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. J. Honigmann, ''Shakespeare: The Lost Years'', Manchester University Press, 1998, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Salusbury himself was a poet. A previous collection of verse, ''Sinetes Passions'' (1597) by [[Robert Parry (poet)|Robert Parry]] had included a supplement containing acrostic verse, possibly written by Salusbury.

==The poem==

===Title===
The full title of Chester's book explains the content:

:''Love's Martyr: or Rosalins Complaint. Allegorically shadowing the truth of Loue, in the constant Fate of the Phoenix and Turtle. A Poeme enterlaced with much varietie and raritie; now first translated out of the venerable Italian Torquato Caeliano, by Robert Chester. With the true legend of famous King Arthur the last of the nine Worthies, being the first Essay of a new Brytish Poet: collected out of diuerse Authenticall Records. To these are added some new compositions of seuerall moderne Writers whose names are subscribed to their seuerall workes, vpon the first subiect viz. the Phoenix and Turtle.

The Italian poet "Torquato Caeliano" is as mysterious as Robert Chester himself. No original Italian work from which the poem is supposed to have been translated has ever been identified, nor is Caeliano a known Italian poet. It has been argued that Chester made up Caeliano to conceal the personal significance of the poem's allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte D'Evelyn, "Sources of the Arthur Story in Chester's 'loves martyr'", ''The Journal of English and Germanic Philology'', Vol. 14, No. 1, Jan. 1915, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is probably a combination of the names of the real poets [[Torquato Tasso]] and [[Livio Celiano]].&lt;ref name = "pott"/&gt;

Another mystery is the alternative title "Rosalins Complaint", since there is no reference to anyone called "Rosalin" in the poem. The name may be derived from [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Shepherd's Calendar]]''. Possibly this too had a private meaning that would have been understood by Chester and his circle.&lt;ref name = "pott"/&gt;

The "turtle" in the title is the [[European Turtle Dove|turtledove]], not the [[Turtle|shelled reptile]].

===Publication===
The poem was published by [[Edward Blount]] and printed by [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]]. It was not entered in the [[Stationers' Register]]. Only three copies of the original edition are known to have survived, though two are partial texts. Another copy appears to be from the same edition but has a different title page. This announces the poem as "The Anuals of the great Brittaine", going on to describe it as an "excellent Monument wherein may be seene all the antiquities of this Kingdom to the satisfaction of both Universities, or any other place stirred with Emulation of long continuance. Excellently figured out in a worthy poem". This page is dated 1611, and said to be published by [[Matthew Lownes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVHLvkAVmXAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=%22The+Anuals+of+the+great+Brittaine%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AYin9-DHw-&amp;sig=7V8_rcVS3LwH0RbE4WcjcMoLUqI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RguTU7O4I8S47QbLsIG4BA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Anuals%20of%20the%20great%20Brittaine%22&amp;f=false The Shakespeare Game].

===Content===
[[File:Phoenix detail from Aberdeen Bestiary.jpg|thumb|A dying-and-reborn phoenix, depicted in the [[Aberdeen Bestiary]]]]
Chester prefaced his poem with a short dedication addressed to the Phoenix and Turtledove, traditional emblems of perfection and devoted love, respectively:

:Phoenix of beautie, beauteous, Bird of any
:To thee I do entitle all my labour,
:More precious in mine eye by far then many
:That feedst all earthly sences with thy savour:
:Accept my home-writ praises of thy loue,
:And kind acceptance of thy Turtle-doue

The poem is a long allegory, incorporating the story of [[King Arthur]], in which the relationship between the birds is explored, and its symbolism articulated.

It begins with the personification of Nature observing that the magnificently beautiful Phoenix is apparently about to die without an heir. The physical description given of the Phoenix is as a human female rather than a bird. Nature visits the Classical gods and pleads with Jupiter to find a way to give the Phoenix a child. Jupiter says that she must bring the Phoenix to the "isle of [[Paphos]]" to meet the Turtledove whose lover has apparently died. The Turtledove is guarding the fire of Prometheus. Jupiter gives Nature a magical "balm" to anoint the Tutledove, which will make him fall in love with the Phoenix. On the trip she tells the story of King Arthur, gives an account of ancient British kings and gives Brythonic (Welsh) etymologies for British towns. There follows a long description of the flora and fauna of Paphos, explaining the nature and uses of the various plants and animals.

At the island, the Phoenix and the Turtledove fall in love, apparently without the aid of the balm. But first the Turtledove asks the Phoenix to forgive him for some unspecified wrong. They then agree to die together in a self-sacrificing fire, building an altar to Apollo, the patron of poetry. As they are consumed, the Phoenix laments the death of the Turtledove. A watching pelican observes the Phoenix's own death and describes a new and even more beautiful Phoenix emerging in glory from the flames.

The narrative is followed by a series of [[acrostic]] love poems entitled "Cantos to the fair Phoenix made by Paphian Dove". Each line of the verses begins with each letter of the alphabet in sequence. These are supposed to have been written by the Turtledove to the Phoenix, implying a long and complex relationship. They are followed by other separate love poems idealising spiritual devotion to the Phoenix. It is not clear whether these poems are written by Chester, who signed his name to the end of the narrative section. [[William Empson]] stated that they displayed the "very recognisable facility and ingenuity" of Sir John Salusbury's poetry, published in Parry's 1597 book.&lt;ref&gt;William Empson, ''Essays on Shakespeare'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p27.&lt;/ref&gt;

After these are the poems by Shakespeare and the others, which comment on the symbolism. In addition to the named poets, there are poems attributed to "Vatum Chorus" (chorus of poets) and "Ignoto" (anonymous). The poems are introduced by Vatum Chorus and Ignoto, followed by Shakespeare's ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'', which states that the birds died "leaving no posterity" due to their "married chastity". John Marston then seems to reply to Shakespeare's "moving epicedium", by referring to the couple's "glorious issue": the new Phoenix born from the flames. Chapman adds more detail on the relationship, saying that the Phoenix provided every variety of life to the Turtle, "She was to him the Analysed World of pleasure, / Her firmness cloth'd him in variety". Jonson ends with an idealisation of the Phoenix, whose judgement shines as "Clear as a naked Vestal, / Closed in an orb of Crystal."

===Interpretations===
[[File:ElixabethPhoenixJewel.jpg|left|thumb|Elizabeth's Phoenix jewel from the ''Phoenix portrait'' by [[Nicholas Hilliard]]]]

There have been many attempts to interpret the symbolism of the poem, though the most common one is that the Phoenix represents [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who used the Phoenix as her symbol. The "isle of Paphos" is thus her realm of England, the history of which is given in such detail. The Turtledove has been said to be the dedicatee of the poem, Sir John Salusbury. Critics [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] and Henry Woudhuysen argue that the recent [[Essex Rebellion]] against the queen is referred to in several passages, and state that Salusbury stands for the loyalty of the people as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan-Jones and Woudhuyson, Shakespeare's Poems, Arden Shakespeare, Cengage Learning EMEA, 2007, p.421ff&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Salusbury's cousin sided with the rebels may be linked to the contrition that the Turtledove has to show. The "glorious issue" would thus be the prosperity and stability of the kingdom, to be passed on to Elizabeth's heir, [[James VI of Scotland]]. However, the degree of intimacy between the lovers, albeit chaste, has been used to argue against this view, as has the fact that both the Phoenix and Turtle die, though Salusbury and the Queen were still very much alive in 1601.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Bednarz, Shakespeare and the Truth of Love: The Mystery of 'The Phoenix and Turtle', Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view, first expressed by Carleton Brown, is that the poem celebrated the marriage of Salusbury and his wife Ursula Stanley, the illegitimate daughter of [[Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby]]. Brown argued that it was written after the birth of their first child.&lt;ref name = "jogn"&gt;John Klause, "The Phoenix and the Turtle in its Time", in Gwynne Blakemore Evans (ed), ''In the Company of Shakespeare: Essays on English Renaissance Literature'', Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2002, p.207.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been criticised on the grounds that the poem emphasises the chastity of the couple, nor is it clear why Ursula and John would have to die to produce a child. Indeed they were both alive in 1601, having by then had nine more children since their first daughter.&lt;ref name = "jogn"/&gt;

Other commentators have suggested esoteric symbolism, or politically dangerous messages, hidden in deliberately obscure allegory, such as support for Catholic martyrs such as [[Anne Line]], or for [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Essex]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Times Literary Supplement, 18 April 2003, p.12-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Phoenix and the Turtle: Shakespeare's Poem and Chester's Loues Martyr" by William H. Matchett; reviewed by Thomas P. Harrison, Modern Philology, Vol. 64, No. 2 (Nov. 1966), pp. 155–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

His true talent was discovered by [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] who brought Sadequain into the limelight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Begum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah]], ''Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy: a biography'', Oxford University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-19-577414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TNI/&gt; He also spent some time in Paris augmenting his skills.&lt;ref&gt;Partha Mitter, Indian Art, Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-19-284221-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadequain received much praise for his [[calligraphic]] style, which is widely considered iconic by many critics of South Asian art.&lt;ref name=DailyTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/4174/calligraphy-maestro-sadequains-birthday-goes-unnoticed/|title=Calligraphy maestro Sadequain's birthday goes unnoticed|author=Arsalan Haider|date=1 July 2017|publisher=Daily Times (newspaper)|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calligraphy ===
Sadequain was part of a broader Islamic art movement that emerged independently across North Africa and parts of Asia in the 1950s and known as the ''[[Jordanian art#Hurufiyah Art_Movement|hurufiyah art movement]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; Hurufiyah refers to the attempt by artists to combine traditional art forms, notably calligraphy as a graphic element within a contemporary artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; Hurufiyah artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead searched for a new visual languages that reflected their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully transformed calligraphy into a modern aesthetic, which was both contemporary and indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Sadeqain's work, only a few painters had experimented with the medium in [[Pakistan]]. Sadequain is a pioneer of the style, bringing calligraphy into a mainstream art form, and influencing subsequent generations of Pakistani artists.

Salahi carried the script with a flourish in all directions, giving it the 'power of space, vigor and volume'.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Hamid Akhund, Farida Munavarjahan Said and Zohra Yusuf (ed.), Sadequain: The Holy Sinner, Mohatta Palace Museum, [[Karachi]]. {{ISBN|969-8100-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadequain painted classical literature from the poetic verses of [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] and Faiz. He belonged to the school of thought which enriched [[Realism (arts)|realism]] with [[lyricism]]. His work was essentially linear. He also illustrated French Nobel Prize–winning writer [[Albert Camus]], [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]], and [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz|Faiz]]. Thousand of the drawings he executed, were given away to his admirers. He wrote and published hundreds of quartets.

Sadequain was the most prolific painter in the period following the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. He was constantly at work and he worked on large scale. He repeatedly stated that he was not interested in decorating drawing rooms of rich and powerful. He worked on large murals for public buildings, symbolic of the collective labour of humanity, and his work was mostly donated to the public.

Sadequain in his own words was primarily a painter of figures with allegorical significance.

=== Murals ===

[[File:Roof of Frere Hall.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ceiling of [[Frere Hall]]]]
Sadequain was a social commentator. His [[murals]] depict man's endless quest to discover and develop the potentialities that lie within him. His murals are densely filled and tightly packed with images to render adequately the lofty subject. As a master [[muralist]] some of his works adorn the halls of:
* The [[State Bank of Pakistan]] (100 x 12&amp;nbsp;ft)&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;
* The Power House at the [[Mangla Dam]] (170 x 23&amp;nbsp;ft)
* [[Lahore Museum]], [[Lahore]]&lt;ref name="LahoreMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/434064/sadequain-mural-long-process-of-restoration-begins/|title=Sadequain mural: Long process of restoration begins|author= Sonia Malik|date= 10 September 2012|publisher=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aligarh Muslim University]] (70 x 12&amp;nbsp;ft)
* [[Banaras Hindu University]] (70 x 12&amp;nbsp;ft) and
* [[Geological Society of India|Geological Institute of India]] (70 x 25&amp;nbsp;ft)
* [[Frere Hall]] [[Karachi]]
* Powerhouse at [[Abu Dhabi]]
* [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University Library]]

His monumental murals, in excess of thirty-five, adorn the halls of State Bank, Frere Hall Karachi; Lahore Museum; Punjab University; Mangla Dam; Aligarh Muslim University; Banaras Hindu University; Indian Institute of Geological Sciences; Islamic Institute in Delhi, and Abu Dhabi Power House, among others. His paintings and calligraphies in the building of Islamic Institute in Delhi alone cover more than seven thousand square feet. Sadequain painted his earliest murals at Jinnah Hospital and PIA headquarters in 1950s. These murals have disappeared and their fate is unknown.

In 1961 he painted the huge mural (62'X10') in the Head Office of the State Bank of Pakistan at Karachi, titled "Treasures of Time," in which he showed the intellectual advance of man from the times of Socrates to that of lqbal and Einstein. It is a linear creation that shows a pageant of intellectuals and thinkers of the Greek era, mathematicians and chemists of the Middle East, the scholars of the European Renaissance, and the 20th-century laureates. This large mural has endured transportation from the State Bank to Mohatta Palace (for the exhibition The Holy Sinner), and back to State Bank and has deep scars to prove the ordeal.

Sadequain painted the ceiling of the Lahore museum entrance hall, depicting Evolution of Mankind, and additional nine large panels of calligraphies for the Islamic Gallery. The ceiling spans approximately 100 x {{convert|35|ft|m}}. The Panjab government has recently allocated money for the restoration of the mural.&lt;ref name="LahoreMuseum" /&gt;

Punjab University houses the mural "Quest of Knowledge" in its library. The mural appropriately depicts the academic theme commensurate with the institution of learning where it is housed. Young men and women are shown holding high the key to learning that unleashes riches in their lives. The mural is mounted high up against the ceiling of the main library and appears to be in good condition.

The mural in the Punjab Library (adjacent to Lahore Museum) is mounted in the library hall located on the main floor. All four sections of the mural have been disassembled and dismounted because of the damage to the building due to water seepage.

The ceiling of the [[Frere Hall]], Karachi displays in bold, the words, ''Arz-o-Samawat'' (Earth and the Heavens) bears a historical significance, since it represents the last piece of work by Sadequain. He died before he could complete it.&lt;ref name=TNI2/&gt; Before he started painting the stupendous mural on the ceiling he dedicated it to the citizens of the great city of Karachi. The mural is for the citizens to cherish and it should be treated as a national treasure. However, because of the security conditions the citizens are deprived of entry in Frere Hall and the impressive historical building along with the Mural lie in desperate need of care. The bright colours Sadequain used in the mural to depict the Earth and the Heavens are fading away because of the environmental conditions. The large mural is painted on dozens of individual panels that are put together like the pieces of a puzzle. Several of the panels are detached and hang down under their own weight. It is only a matter of time before the panels start falling apart.

The mural titled "Saga of Labor" by Sadequain at Mangla Dam is a glowing tribute to the working men and women of all times and places who form the backbone of any society. The mural hangs in the powerhouse of Mangla Dam and so far endured the harsh environmental conditions of the huge enclosure that also houses gigantic electric turbines.

Banaras Hindu University houses one large mural. It is kept in good condition because of care provided to it by the authorities.

In addition to the murals mentioned above, Sadequain did many others, perhaps in the neighbourhood of over thirty-five in all. However, whereabouts of several of them are not certain. For example, one mural was done for the Naval Headquarters, but cannot be located. There was one done for the PIA's office in Paris, which does not exist at that location. There were murals dedicated to the War of 1965 that cannot be traced.

Sadequain painted thousands of paintings, drawings, and murals in his lifetime. He hardly ever sold his work and mostly gave it away; sometimes his work was simply taken, and sometimes even stolen. In his lifetime there were two galleries named after him by the authorities, but they no longer exist.

===Speaker of truth===

In an interview he said, "People ask why I don't paint flowers, butterflies and landscapes? I tell them that I seek the truth and I am after reality. I am not inspired by someone posing against the backdrop of roses in a vase or pink curtains. What inspires me is a person who has gone hungry for hours and is struggling for survival. The expression that lights his face at the end of the day when he has finally found some scraps, that is what touches me. I am a painter of the expression of reality."{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Self-proclaimed "[[Faqir]]," Sadequain was outside society's worldly greed or hypocrisy and called himself "speaker of truth."

Best known for his calligraphies, Sadequain painted abstracts, drawings, and sketches on thousands of canvases, volumes of paper, and multitudes of other conventional and unconventional materials.

===Renaissance of Islamic calligraphy===
Sadequain was responsible for the renaissance of [[Islamic calligraphy]] in Pakistan. He was one of the greatest calligraphers of Pakistan and helped transform the art of calligraphy into serious expressionist paintings. He claimed that his transformation into a calligrapher was manifested by divine inspiration. He did not follow the established tradition and created his own style of script.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; His alphabets exude motion, mood, and paint vivid pictures of the message of the words of [[Quran]]. Sadequain claimed that many of his paintings, especially after the seventies, had been based on calligraphic forms to portray images of cities, buildings, forests, men, and women.

In [[Pakistan]], the art of calligraphy was relegated to a second-class status until Sadequain adapted this medium in the late nineteen sixties. Until then a few painters experimented with the medium but it remained just that, an experiment. After Sadequain transformed the art of calligraphy into a mainstream art form, most of the known Pakistani artists have followed Sadequain and calligraphic art now dominates the art scene.

===True artist===
In nineteen sixties Sadequain was invited by the French authorities to illustrate the award-winning novel "The Stranger" by French writer [[Albert Camus]]. Sadequain also illustrated on canvas the poetry of [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] and Faiz as homage to their place in classical literature. Sadequain wrote thousands of quartets, which address a common theme of social and cultural dogmas and published them.

A special word is warranted about the large murals Sadequain painted, which are spread all over the subcontinent. His murals depict man's struggle, his achievements and persistent thirst to discover his endless potential. His murals are full of activity, ideas, and they read like an unfolding story about their particular theme.

One of his most powerful works is the gigantic mural measuring 200×30 feet for the Power House of [[Mangla Dam]]. He completed it in an incredible period of three months during which he worked day and night. Aptly so, the mural is titled "The Saga of Labor," The mural, one of the largest in the world portrays the history of mankind. Its pays homage to its characters, which are exclusively labourers and worker, facing and struggling against the powerful elements of nature.

Sadequain was a social commentator. He crafted his message on canvas by the aid of powerful symbols and rich colours. Characteristically he would address particular situations through a series of paintings, which would follow a common theme and yet maintain their individuality. His symbols transformed with time as he adapted to the changing conditions.

===His works===
[[File:Sketch, Frere Hall.JPG|thumb|Sketch Sadequain with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, by Sadequain, on display at Frere Hall]]
During the 1960s he stayed in interior [[Sindh]], in areas surrounded by desert, where nothing could grow except cactus which would break through the rugged sandy ground. The sight of the wild cactus growing in scorching heat and surviving the harshest of conditions left a lasting impression on Sadequain. He adapted this symbol to depict labour, struggle, and persistence against natural elements of resistance and triumph of hard work.

Sadequain sketched numerous drawings titled Cobweb Series, Crow Series, Christ Series, Hope Series, and Sun Series during the sixties, which were commentaries on prevailing social and cultural conditions. Sadequain saw cobwebs engulfing our society rendering it speechless and motionless. The Crow Series projected men as timid worshippers of scarecrows because they have lost self-respect and spirituality. Crows however are not intimidated and gang up on humanity in flocks and pick on lifeless humans. In the Christ Series Sadequain showed the crime being committed in front of the Christ while he was still alive on the Cross.

Contrary to man's images portrayed in Cobweb or Crow Series of drawings, Sadequain glorified the hard work and labour of ordinary workingmen by showing them struggling with primitive tools during the stone age, developing agricultural land, discovering scientific breakthroughs, and exploring the universe. He sometimes used Kufic script to form human images and carried that theme through vast canvases. One of the representative works of this genre is titled "The Last Supper," which was awarded the prestigious Binnale de Paris award in France. Sadequain was awarded first prize in National Exhibition of [[Pakistan]] in the early sixties. He was bestowed with several awards and medals in [[Pakistan]] as well as foreign counties. But he seldom attended the award ceremonies neither accepted the award money.

Sadequain had a commanding knowledge of literature. He wrote thousands of "Rubaiyats," which he published in several books. These verses have been adjudged unique and critically acclaimed by literary elite. Like his paintings, the verses also address the topics of human nature, virtues and weaknesses of society.

During his life Sadequain exhibited his works on all continents. His exhibitions in foreign countries were sponsored at State levels and were attended by large audiences from all walks of life. A "faqir" at heart he gave away most of his paintings to friends and foes, and painted gigantic murals in public buildings at no cost. He declared the giveaways as gifts to the citizens of the cities where the public buildings were situated.

Sadequain has been covered in the print and electronic media extensively such as the TV series "Mojeeza-e-Fun" which highlighted his work in a masterful documentary. "The Holy Sinner" is a book published in 2003, cataloguing a number of his paintings, which were exhibited at [[Mohatta Palace]], [[Karachi]] during the same year. The massive book is one of the largest and heaviest ever published in [[Pakistan]] and it also has a collection of articles about Sadequain published previously in magazines and papers over the course of years.

===Reverence===

The mammoth book "[[The Holy Sinner]]: Sadequain",&lt;ref name="Holy"&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/134395/karachi-sadequain-the-holy-sinner-launched KARACHI: Sadequain: The Holy Sinner launched] DAWN (newspaper), Published 10 August 2003, Retrieved 9 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; is a tribute and celebration of this Pakistani artist's vitality, innovation, restless fervor and immense amount of energy. This book launched as the third stage of a monumental project with the same title is possibly the largest art project in the sub-continent to pay tribute to a single artist under the aegis of Mohatta Palace Museum. The first stage of the project was an exhibition of paintings of Sadequain under the same title and the second stage of the project; a black and white catalogue of Sadequain's work was launched last year. The fourth stage of the project will consist of four documentaries; both in [[Urdu]] and English language and one special feature film would be produced about the internationally recognised artist.&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;

The book of about 700 pages, weighing 12&amp;nbsp;kg, includes the reproduction of some 400 of Sadequain's creations, supported by an anthology of critical commentaries by the artist's contemporaries and journalists including renowned artistic figures and critics. It contains essays on the great artist and plates of his paintings and sketches. The sections in the book consist of Photographic Essay, Critical Approaches, Recollections, Reproductions, Catalogue, Pictures at an Exhibition, Rubaiyat, Photo Epilogue, Afterward, Life and Works. The book is largest monograph in the region compiled and produced to pay unprecedented tribute to a single artist, setting a new trend for paying tributes to artists in South Asia.

Some of the themes of the paintings in the book are 'A stranger in paradise', 'Endless purgatory', 'Rhapsody in Blue', 'Wheel in fire', 'A long day', 'Of human bondage' also included in bold form the poetic verses of [[Ghalib]], [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] and Faiz.

The book is primarily based on the famous exhibition of paintings of Sadequain titled, ''The Holy Sinner: Sadequain'' which ended about a year ago and was by far the largest-attended and longest-running exhibition in the history of Pakistani art. [[Salima Hashmi]], daughter of the late poet [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]] and [[Hameed Haroon]], proprietor of Dawn Publications were the co-curators of the groundbreaking exhibition. The exhibition, featuring more than 200 non-calligraphic works of the [[Amroha]]-born artist, was held at [[Mohatta Palace]] Museum and it remained open for approximately one year.&lt;ref name="Holy"/&gt;

The exhibition was attended by more than 90,000 art lovers at a cost of Rs 100 each who saw rare paintings and murals by Sadequain whose commercial worth, at a low estimate, was more than Rs 500&amp;nbsp;million.

Sadequain was an untraditional and self-made, self-taught painter and calligrapher who created a mysterious and mystic environment with his bold and uninhibited use of media and lines had a cult-like following in his own lifetime. His unique style, whether pertaining to his paintings or calligraphy, was widely referred to as "Khat-e-Sadequain" primarily evolved during his stay at a [[Karachi]] seaside desert called [[Gadani]]. The Holy Sinner: Sadequain contains over 400 of his series of drawings, paintings, and murals, each representing a different phase of his career and depicting his unique strokes, style, and color schemes. It was at Gadani that Sadequain observed the wild growth of cactus in the scorching heat of desert where water was scarce and conditions were harshest. Yet the cactus grew tall, shooting upwards in defiance of all odds. The powerful symbol of defiant cactus transcends throughout Sadequain’s work and creates a lasting impression on the observer.

The exhibition was a rare opportunity for the viewers because Sadequain, who became a virtual household word for his calligraphic works did not exhibit his abstract paintings during the last days of his life and of course the large number of murals that he painted were dedicated to specific locations only. [[Hameed Haroon]] described very aptly as follows: "Sadequain's symbols are part-calligraphic strokes, part-sacred standards or alams that first emerged in the eighth century as the symbols of the armies of Shi'ite Islam, perhaps most visible as representations of allegorical virtue in the annual Moharram ritual following the [[Battle of Karbala|Karbala massacre]]; part Sufic tributes to the son-in-law of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], the martyred Ali, whose horned alif in the Kufic script provokes a militancy of sentiment and a plea for transformation based, ironically enough, on the fundamentals of early Islam."

The paintings in the exhibition were loaned by virtually who is who of the Pakistani elite. In his lifetime Sadequain hardly ever sold his paintings to individuals. As an ironic twist of circumstances he is perhaps the only artist with the distinction that his work is openly copied and sold for handsome profits by his imitators. Recently two news stories were printed in local papers, which testify, in the most unconventional manner, to the great stature of Sadequain. Both news stories were related to burglars, one in which a house belonging to one of the prominent artists in [[Karachi]] was broken in and the thieves got away with jewellery and other petty items, and the other incident involved the house of a well to do citizen where the stolen items included only the paintings by Sadequain.

The book, The Holy Sinner: Sadequain, includes drawings series titled, Cacti series, the Sun series, Exposition series, Cobweb series, etc. A word about the Cobweb series is appropriate because it was created during the turbulent times of 1960s and the drawings depict men and women, even the building structures immobilised by cobwebs as though in decay and transgressing instead of marching on the rocky road to the peaks of perfection.

The paintings in The Holy Sinner: Sadequain, represent various themes such as man’s struggle against natural odds, mother and child, still life figures from the early life of the artist and many others. The centerpiece of the book is its treatment of the famous mural by Sadequain commissioned for the State Bank of Pakistan. The mural titled “The Treasures of Time” depicts evolution of mankind and traces the history of great scholars, philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, poets, and writers. It is said that the mural became a turning point in the intellectual development of Sadequain. Hameed Haroon noted that from this onwards, his intellectual force entered the world of Ovid, the romance of Alexander and the Amroha-spun tales of ancient Greece and Rome, leading to a unique fusion in Pakistan's art history.

===Lost paintings===

In his lifetime two art galleries were established by the official authorities, one in Islamabad called Gallery Sadequain, which was located in Block F and the second one in the [[Frere Hall]] [[Karachi]], also called Gallery Sadequain. After he died, the [[Islamabad]] gallery was disassembled and some two hundred paintings were unaccounted for and the Frere Hall gallery is closed for all practical purposes because of the security reasons. Forty calligraphic panels on marble slabs measuring {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} x 5&amp;nbsp;ft each have disappeared.

At the time of his death at OMI Clinic in Karachi, his attendant was present when Sadequain took his last breath at 2:00&amp;nbsp;am. The attendant did not inform the doctors of Sadequain's death and instead took off for Frere Hall where Sadequain had been working on the ceiling. The attendant loaded as many paintings as he could in a Suzuki van, took them to a safe house and then returned to the hospital to inform the doctors. The stolen paintings are resurfacing for sale at regular frequency.

PIA owned Mid Way House hotel had a big Sadequain's painting at entrance and lot of other artwork by renowned Pakistani artists. After the sale of the hotel, all that art treasure is not on display or submitted to any art gallery.

== Death ==
Sadeqain died on 10 February 1987 at [[Karachi]], Pakistan at the age of 63. He is buried in [[Sakhi Hassan]] graveyard in Karachi.&lt;ref name=TNI2/&gt;

:''This article refers to the [[Sefer (Hebrew)|Torah book]]. For the second [[Rebbe]] of the Sochatchov Hasidic dynasty, see [[Shmuel Bornsztain, second Sochatchover Rebbe|Shmuel Bornsztain]].''
'''''Shem Mishmuel''''' ({{lang-he|שם משמואל}}) is a nine-volume collection of homiletical teachings on the [[Torah]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s delivered by Rabbi [[Shmuel Bornsztain, second Sochatchover Rebbe|Shmuel Bornsztain]], the second [[Sochatchov (Hasidic dynasty)|Sochatchover]] [[Rebbe]], between the years 1910-1926.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/sochaczew/so628.html |last=Landau |first=Jerrold |title=The Admor Rabbi Shmuel of Holy Blessed Memory |date=9 July 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2011 |publisher=jewishgen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major work in Hasidic thought, it synthesizes the Hasidism of [[Pshischa]] and [[Kotzk]] in the style of Sochatchov,&lt;ref name="Landau" /&gt; and is frequently cited in Torah ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiurim]]'' (lectures) and articles to this day.

Bornsztain became known as the ''Shem Mishmuel'' after the title of this work, which was published posthumously.

==Title ==
The title comes from the [[Mishnah]] on ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 12:3, which describes the [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|prohibition]] against writing on [[Shabbat]]. The Mishnah teaches that if a [[Jews|Jew]] wishes to write a whole name like Shimon (שמעון) or Shmuel (שמואל), but writes only the first two letters of these names, ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]]'' (ש) and ''[[mem]]'' (מ), he still transgresses the prohibition&amp;mdash;for ''shin'' and ''mem'' spell a shorter name, ''shem'' (שם) (which literally means "name"). Bornsztain's choice of the Mishnaic expression ''shem miShimon o miShmuel'' (''Shem'' from Shimon or from Shmuel) for his title reflects the classical rabbinic [[word play|play on words]] combining a rabbinic teaching with the author's own name.&lt;ref name="Bel"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-fj-sKboVBoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=belovski+shem+mishmuel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9wkuTYuwK8rR4gbRt7DlCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=introduction&amp;f=false  |title=Shem Mishmuel: Selections on the weekly parashah and festivals |last=Belovski |first=Rabbi Zvi |pages=xix-xxi |isbn=1-56871-141-7 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Targum Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and structure==
The first eight volumes of ''Shem Mishmuel'' cover lessons on each of the ''[[parasha|parshiyot]]'' (weekly Torah readings). In traditional Hasidic style, they are not printed according to the sequence of the ''parshiyot'', but in the order in which the Rebbe delivered these lessons to his followers. The ninth volume deals exclusively with the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]].&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt;

In addition to displaying a thorough familiarity with [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], [[Kabbalah]], and other classic Jewish sources, Bornsztain presents many of the ideas of his father, Rabbi [[Avrohom Bornsztain]], the first Sochatchover Rebbe, who was known as the ''Avnei Nezer'' after the title of his major work.&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/tetzaveh.html |title=R' Avraham Bornstein z"l |date=February 2002 |accessdate=12 January 2011 |work=Hamaayan &amp;ndash; The Torah Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volume on the Pesach Haggadah was published first by Bornsztain's son and successor, Rabbi [[Dovid Bornsztain]], the third Sochatchover Rebbe, in [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]] in 1927. Rabbi Dovid published the rest of the volumes between 1927 and 1932, with funding provided by Rabbi David Parshinowski.&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt; Bornsztain's other son, Rabbi [[Chanoch Henoch Bornsztain]], who had [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel in 1924&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdp9btWGWQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=where+heaven+touches+earth+rossoff&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wlPpTI3LFo74sgbcuvW_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20burnstein&amp;f=false |title=Where Heaven Touches Earth |last=Rossoff |first=Dovid |year=1998 |isbn=0-87306-879-3 |page=471 |publisher=Guardian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the fourth Sochatchover Rebbe after Rabbi David's death in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Growise, Yisroel Alter.

'''''Shibui''''' (渋い) (adjective), '''''shibumi''''' (渋み) (noun), or '''''shibusa''''' (渋さ) (noun) are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words which refer to a particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive [[beauty]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. Mazhar Hussain|author2=Robert Wilkinson|title=The Pursuit of Comparative Aesthetics: An Interface Between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Wez4pgWp3AC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5345-5|pages=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Japanese aesthetics]] terms, such as ''[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]'' and ''[[wabi-sabi]]'', ''shibui'' can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=De Garis|title=We Japanese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUm0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-18367-6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shibusa is an enriched, subdued appearance or experience of intrinsically fine quality with economy of form, line, and effort, producing a timeless tranquility.  Shibusa includes the following essential qualities: 
* Shibui objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity.  
* This balance of simplicity and complexity ensures that one does not tire of a shibui object but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years.&lt;ref name="Lim2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunamita Lim|title=Japanese Style: Designing with Nature's Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsWemDyPlE4C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-4236-0092-3|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.&lt;ref name="Lebra1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Takie Sugiyama Lebra|title=Japanese Patterns of Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWG07rhiyUMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1976|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0460-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colors of shibusa are "muddy" colors.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"/&gt; For example, in interior decorating and painting, gray is added to primary colors to create a silvery effect that ties the different colors together into a coordinated scheme.  Depending upon how much gray is added, shibui colors range from pastels to dark. Occasionally, a patch of brighter color is added as a highlight.

[[File:Shibusa modesty wiki.jpg|thumb|right|"Shibusa Modesty" iron glaze vase, Dorothy Bearnson, 1988.]]
Shibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi.  Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. 

The seven elements of shibusa are simplicity, implicity, modesty, naturalness, everydayness, imperfection, and silence.  They are adapted from the concepts authored by Dr. Soetsu Yanagi (1898–1961), aesthetician and museum curator, published in the Japanese magazine ''Kogei'' between 1930–1940. The aristocratic simplicity of shibusa is the refined expression of the essence of elements in an aesthetic experience producing quietude. Spare elegance is evident in darkling serenity with a hint of sparkle.  Implicity allows depth of feeling to be visible through spare surface design thereby manifesting the invisible core that offers new meanings with each encounter.  The person of shibui modesty exalts excellence via taking time to learn, watch, read, understand, develop, think, and merges into understatement and silence concerning oneself.  Naturalness conveys spontaneity in unforced growth.  Shibusa freedom is maintained in healthy roughness of texture and irregular asymmetrical form wherein the center lies beyond all particular things, in infinity. Everydayness raises ordinary things to a place of honor, void of all artificial and unnecessary properties, thus imparting spiritual joy—for today is more auspicious than tomorrow.  Everydayness provides a framework, a tradition for an artist's oeuvre to be a unit not a process.  Hiroshi Mizuo argues that the best examples of shibusa are found in the crafts, ordinary objects made for everyday use. They tend to be more spontaneous and healthy than many of the fine arts.  Imperfection is illustrated in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s gothic novel, ''The Marble Faun''.  The chapter "An Aesthetic Company" mentions some ragged and ill-conditioned antique drawings and their attributions and virtues.

Imperfection in shibusa Sōetsu Yanagi in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' refers to as "beauty with inner implications".  Creation here means making a piece that will lead the viewer to draw beauty from it for oneself.  Shibui beauty in Tea Ceremony is in the artistry of the viewer.

Shibusa's sanctuary of silence is non-dualism—the resolution of opposites. Its foundation is intuition coupled with faith and beauty revealing phases of truth and the worship and reverence for life.

In [[James A. Michener]]'s book ''[[Iberia (book)|Iberia]]'' the adjective 'shibui' is referenced as follows: "The Japanese have a word which summarizes all the best in Japanese life, yet it has no explanation and cannot be translated. It is the word ''shibui'', and the best approximation to its meaning is 'acerbic good taste.'" The author Trevanian (the nom de plume of Dr. Rodney William Whitaker) wrote in his 1979 best-selling
novel ''[[Shibumi (novel)|Shibumi]]'', "Shibumi has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances." In the [[business fable]] ''[[The Shibumi Strategy]]'', the author, [[Matthew E. May]], wrote that shibumi "has come to denote those things that exhibit in paradox and all at once the very best of everything and nothing: Elegant simplicity. Effortless effectiveness. Understated excellence. Beautiful imperfection."
  
Shibui, a registration or 'felt sense' of evolving perfection.  What is being registered is the 'Life' behind the qualities of any experience.  A 'felt sense' of qualities, such as, quiet beauty with intelligence, love, light, and joy.  These qualities can be more easily registered when quietly viewing simple, natural everyday phenomenon or objects, such as a sunrise or a simple piece of pottery.  Shibui can sometimes be more easily registered by two people in a meditative state (quiet in their emotions and their minds) while viewing the same phenomenon or object. For example, when viewing the same sunset or piece of art, subconsciously, both people register the qualities of the 'Life' or implicity underlying the experience or object; this registration of the underlying 'Life' precipitates into the conscious as registering something 'extraordinary' in the everyday 'ordinary'.  If you both register, then looking into the other person's eyes, you understand that you both shared the same phenomenon, a 'knowing' of the underlying 'Life', or at least the qualities of that underlying 'Life'.  The qualities registered can seem paradoxical. Complex experiences or objects seem simple; perfection is found in imperfection.  All objects and experiences, both everyday and extraordinary, can have a beauty, a quiet purposeful intent, a cool 'matter of fact' underlying joy.

Potters, musicians, painters, bonsai and other artists often work to bring in 'Shibui-like' qualities into their art.  A few go behind these qualities to bring the underlying 'Life' into their art.  Expert singers, actors, potters, and artists of all other sorts were often said to be ''shibui''; their expertise caused them to do things beautifully without making them excessive or gaudy. Today, sometimes baseball players are even said to be ''shibui'' when they contribute to the overall success of the team without doing anything to make themselves stand out individually. The apparent effortlessness displayed by athletes such as tennis player Roger Federer and hockey great Wayne Gretzky are examples of shibumi in personal performance. Shibui, and its underlying 'Life', is found in all art and in everything around us—including ourselves.  Taking the path to understand and experience Shibui, is a step towards understanding and consciously registering the 'Life' underlying all.

==History of the term==
[[File:Diospyros kaki Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|An almost ripe ''Shibui'', the fruit of ''[[Diospyros kaki]]'']]
Originating in the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573) as ''shibushi'', the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe [[persimmon]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"/&gt; ''Shibui'' maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'.

However, by the beginnings of the [[Edo period]] (1615–1868), the term had gradually begun to refer to a pleasing aesthetic. The people of Edo expressed their tastes in using this term to refer to anything from song to fashion to craftsmanship that was beautiful by being understated, or by being precisely what it was meant to be and not elaborated upon. Essentially, the aesthetic ideal of ''shibumi'' seeks out events, performances, people or objects that are beautiful in a direct and simple way, without being flashy.

Soetsu Yanagi work as translated by Bernard Leach in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' discusses shibumi.

The concept of ''shibusa'' was introduced to the West in August and September, 1960, in publications of the American magazine ''[[House Beautiful]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19765">'''Sociological Art''' is an artistic movement and approach to [[aesthetics]] that emerged in France in the early 1970s and became the basis for the Sociological Art Collective formed by [[:fr:Hervé Fischer|Hervé Fischer]], [[Fred Forest]], and [http://www.jeanpaulthenot.fr/ Jean-Paul Thénot] in 1974.

==From 1968 to 1974==

As early as 1968, art critics [[Pierre Restany]] and [[François Pluchart]] used the term “sociological art” to refer to socially engaged and less commercial practices among a diverse set of artists, including body artists [[Gina Pane]] and [[Michel Journiac]], Spanish-born video artist Joan Rabascall, Hervé Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thenot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forneris|first=Jean|title=arTitudes de François Pluchart: une revue internationale|year=1979|publisher=Galerie d'art contemporain des musées de Nice|location=Nice|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 1973, François Pluchart initiated a debate between Journiac, Pane, Fischer, and Thenot, which was published as “Ten Questions on Sociological Art” (“Dix questions sur l’art sociologique”) in the art magazine artTitudes, which he had founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pluchart|first=François|title=Dix questions sur l'art sociologique|journal=arTitudes|date=March 1974|issue=6/8|pages=4–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of sociological art might also be traced through the independent practices of Fischer, Forest, and Thenot who would later form the Sociological Art Collective. These practices must themselves be put into dialogue with broad international artistic tendencies towards social engagement and the social sciences, evident, for instance, in the work of [[Stephen Willats]] and [[Hans Haacke]], exhibitions such as Art into Society, Society into Art (Institute of Contemporary Art, London, 1974), and the intellectual histories of social art history and sociology of art.

In the mid-1960s, Forest (born 1933, Algeria) began a series of actions using of audiovisual and communication technologies to challenge conventional artistic media and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lassignardie|first=Isabelle|title=Fred Forest: Catalogue Raisonné (1963-2008)|year=2010|publisher=Université de Picardie/Amiens|location=Amiens|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/51/52/32/PDF/These_Fred_Forest_-_Commentaire.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of many works are available at [http://webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/actions/actions_en.htm Webnetmuseum] He projected slides onto his paintings (''Tableau Ecran'', 1963), initiated community events in impoverished neighborhoods (''Family Portrait'', 1967), and used video to engage social spaces ("Mur d’Arles'' and ''Cabine Telephonique", 1967).  In the early 1970s, his utilization of the press and video as tools of social engagement and political provocation expanded. In January 1972, Forest began his "Space Media" project by placing a blank rectangle in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and inviting readers to fill it in and mail it to him. For an exhibition entitled “Archeology of the Present” (“Archeologie du present”) at the Galerie Germain, Paris, in May 1972, Forest took the street where the gallery was located, Rue Guénegaud, as a topic, creating a video circuit displaying the street in the gallery and the gallery in the windows facing the street and collecting trash from the street to show in the gallery. Pierre Restany carried out short interviews with passersby for an episode of “Forum des Arts", aired on May 13, 1973. In June 1973, with the collaboration of the philosopher Vilem Flusser and sociologist Philippe Butaud, Forest set up a video studio in a community of retirees to launch a video exchange in the south of France ("Video Troisieme Age", 1973). On the occasion of the XII Bienal de São Paulo in October 1973, he effectuated a series of events, including a version of Space Media, a sociological walk, and a procession through the city center with participants holding white placards ("Blancs evanhit la ville"), all of which were provocations in the face of the established military dictatorship. Always highly critical of those in power, committed to participatory art, and deeply engaged with new communication technologies, Forest would continue these pursuits after joining the collective in October 1974.

Hervé Fischer (born 1941, France) was a student of sociology and taught the sociology of communication and culture at the Sorbonne beginning in the early 1970s. Initially involved with [[:fr:Supports/Surfaces|“Support/Surface,”]] Fischer did a series of “Essuie-mains” paintings with handprints on cloth rolls as a means of deconstructing the medium of painting. He also began various campaigns, grouped under the title “Hygiene de l’art,” to eradicate art of traditional mores and media, and even invited artists to send him their works, which he tore up and displayed in small plastic bags (“La déchirure des oeuvres d’art”). Around 1974, his projects shifted away from the medium of painting toward more marginal and popular visual idioms, such as stamps and street signs, and into performances in the social realm.

Jean-Paul Thenot (born 1943, France) was trained as a psychotherapist, a profession he continued while producing art. Around 1969, he began creating artworks, beginning with his “Interventions in the Street,” which consisted of a series of scaled sculptures of everyday objects, such as mousetraps, set up in public space. Around 1970, he moved away from producing objects into largely textual and conceptual works, such as his “Constats d’existence,” typed pages of commentary on contemporary artists that were mailed to various figures in the art world. In 1972, he began conducting interactive surveys about art and perception. In response to the infamous, state-sponsored “Expo 72” (“Douze ans de l’art contemporain en France”), he carried out a large survey inviting respondents to select the most representative French artists and then declared the person whose submitted list was closest to the averaged, final list the honorary curator of a public exhibition opening that May.

The three artists met at openings and events in the early 1970s and were part of a global trend in artistic practice toward more conceptual and less skill-based art that was intentionally anti-commercial. In France, the events of May and June 1968 had irrevocably changed how many artists conceived of their work. While each artist brought areas of expertise—Forest’s interest in new media, Fischer’s theoretical grounding, and Thenot’s inquiry-based research—a commitment to engage the public, to oppose traditional and commercially-driven art, and to affect social change united the three artists.

==From 1974 to 1980==

In the summer of 1974, Journiac organized a series of meetings at his apartment on [[Île Saint-Louis]] in Paris to discuss the initiation of an artist movement engaged with critical and sociological realities. The meetings brought together artists such as Gina Pane, Bertrand Lavier, Thierry Agullo, Joan Rabscall, Jocelyne Hervé, Sonso, Hervé Fischer, Jean-Paul Thenot as well as art critics François Pluchart and Bernard Teyssedre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galland|first=Blaise|title=Art sociologique, Méthode pour une sociologie esthétique|year=1986|publisher=Georg|location=Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was from these meetings that the impulse to form the Sociological Art Collective emerges, and on October 10, 1974, the Sociological Art Collective was officially declared with the publication in newspaper ''Le Monde'' of its first manifesto, signed by Hervé Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thénot. From this date onwards, these artists would alternate between practices claiming this lineage and their own personal practices. Concretely speaking, the collective published a number of texts, including [http://webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/textes_critiques/textes_divers/2manifeste_art_socio_en.htm#text three manifestos]; organized and effectuated a series of projects, including four group exhibitions and large-scale urban interventions; and founded the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative.

Their activity instantiates an early moment in the history of what would be called in the mid-1990s relational art or socially-engaged art but also connected with a number of artistic tendencies of the 1970s, such as conceptual art, performance art, and institutional critique. For example, the Collective’s two-week intervention in the southern French town of Perpignan in July 1976, entitled "Study and Animation of Perpignan" began with a study of the conditions and needs of neighborhoods in Perpignan by a thirty-person, interdisciplinary team and then led to dozens of direct interventions, which included pop-up exhibitions, screenings, interviews, parties, and a multi-neighborhood photograph swap, all aimed to, as the press release notes, “bring together different neighborhoods [. . .], which although geographically close remain distant at the level of social communication.”  After setting out four principles—critique, communication, intervention, and pedagogy—the group proposes sociological art as means to overcome the divide between “a quasi-scientific approach to the environment and a lived connection established among individuals [. . .] and the studied environment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fred Forest Archive, Inathèque |author2=Collectif d'art sociologique|title=Communique, Enquete Animation à Perpignan Par le Collectif|date=September 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project and related texts indicate three key aspects that broadly characterized sociological art.  First, artistic labor included activities such as organizing, writing, research, and teaching. The expansion of traditional artistic skills to integrate intellectual and white-collar skills related to the broader transition from an industrial economy to service and [[information economy]]. Second, projects developed in dialogue with specific sites and their associated audiences. Whether focused on a town or a particular community, sociological art aimed to increase awareness about social conditions of existence through exchange with sites and humans. Third, sociological art was usually time-based and ephemeral and funded primarily by grants, personal finances, and commissions. The remaining material, therefore, consists largely of documentation rather than “rarified” art objects bought, sold, and collected.

For six years, the Collective carried out a handful of collaborative sociological art projects, participated in colloquia and exhibition, generated a community of collaborators, and provided support for independent work. Interlocutors included [[Henri Lefebvre]], [[Edgar Morin]], [[Vilem Flusser]], [[Jean Duvignaud]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Kristine Stiles]], and numerous artists, including [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] of the [[Artist Placement Group]], [[Stephen Willats]], and [[Ken Friedman]]. Tensions developed among Fischer, Forest, and Thenot, and in 1980, Forest and Thenot published an ad in ''Art Press'' selling the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative, which was located in Fischer’s apartment, and wrote a tract declaring the end of the Collective.

==Theory==

Sociological Art aimed to develop a critical analysis of art and society through interventionist artistic practices and associated writing that drew on the methods and theories of sociology. It envisioned art in terms of interaction, animation, pedagogy, and the creation of structures of exchange, provocation, and disruption of conventional social behaviors with a view to denouncing all and any forms of conditioning. As summarized by Fred Forest: “The practical aim of Sociological Art is to provide the necessary conditions of existence for various devices that frame a given efficient and effective questioning or investigation, thereby establishing the optimal conditions for a situation of [[intersubjectivity]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url= http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/fr/expo-retr-fredforest/textes_critiques/text_critiques_fr.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}''L'art sociologique a pour objet pratique de réunir les conditions necessaires à la mise en oeuvre de " dispositifs" de nature diverses, à partir desquels une fonction de questionnement et d'interrogation pourra être développée efficacement en vue d'établir les conditions optimum d'une situation intersubjective.''
.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological Art was a politically engaged response to an art world that was perceived as being out of touch both with the technologies and the society of its time. This stance was in strict opposition to reigning modernist and formalist dogmas that privileged medium specificity and authorial intention.

Various theoretical influences can be traced through sociological art. In a classical examine of [[Situationist]] [[détournement]], Sociological Art aimed to draw attention to the channels of power and mass communication it was aiming to undermine. It called upon derision, simulacrum and participation in order to explode or alter a certain reality structured by the social codes of the time. Considering how ideology structured society related to contemporaneous analyses in French critical theory, such as Louis [[Althusser]]’s idea of [[Ideological State Apparatus]] as well as [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]’s writing on power. At the same time, sub-disciplines within the social sciences emerged to study art and culture, including the [[sociology of art]] and [[visual anthropology]], and applied novel method and theories to draw attention to art’s socio-economic frames.

==Beyond==

Following the dissipation of the Sociological Art Collective, its founders retained certain sociological tenets in their later work and pursuits. Fischer continued work with the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative and carried out large-scale urban interventions. He then moved to Montreal, where he worked as a curator of new media, and in 2010, he has a large retrospective exhibition in Céret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nouvelle Nature,  Hervé Fischer: regard rétrospectif et vision contemporaine|year=2010|publisher=Musée d'art moderne of Céret|location=Céret}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forest launched his subsequent theory of Communication aesthetics and continued his work as a teacher and artist, becoming an important early theorist and practitioners of net and internet art. In 2007, Forest had a retrospective exhibition at Slought Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Society: The Work of Fred Forest|url=http://www.slought.org/content/11348/|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thenot focused on the therapeutique potential of art and video in his work as a psychotherapist. In 2010, he had an exhibition, called an "Intervention d'art sociologique" at Galerie Flux in Liege that included a [http://fluxnews.skyrock.com/2933461241-L-art-sociologique-en-reactivation-Entretien-entre-Jean-Paul-Thenot-et.html video interview] with the artist. All three continued to write prodigiously and have recently exhibited their artwork again. Though relatively unknown today, Sociological Art is thoroughly emblematic of the historical upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s in France and Europe generally and prefigures many of the most prominent trends in art since the mid-1990s.

[[File:Summer evening at Skagen - P.S. Krøyer - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Peder Severin Krøyer|P.S. Krøyer]]: ''Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore'', 1892]] 

'''''Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore''''' ({{lang-da|Sommeraften ved Skagen. Kunstnerens hustru med hund ved strandkanten}}) is an 1892 painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer|P.S. Krøyer]], one of the best known of the artistic community known as the [[Skagen Painters]]. The work shows Marie Krøyer, the artist's wife, standing on the beach at [[Skagen]] with their dog Rap at her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own family life, gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), who was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there permanently after marrying [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851–1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in [[Hornbæk]] on the north coast of [[Zealand]] and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light, particularly in his beach scenes, and painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer?highlight=p.s.%20kr%C3%B8yer|title=P.S. Krøyer|work=Den Store Danske |language=Danish|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Marie Krøyer née Triepcke came from a well-to-do German family living in Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after training privately she went to Paris to continue her studies. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Krøyer who immediately fell madly in love with her. Although he was 16 years her senior, the couple married that summer. In 1891, they settled in Skagen, giving Krøyer ample opportunity to paint portraits of Marie, both indoors and especially on the beach. The summers Krøyer spent together with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him, especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself, often quoting [[Keats]]' "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn|Beauty is truth, truth beauty]]".&lt;ref name="Svanholm2004"&gt;Svanholm, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result of the periods of mental illness Krøyer experienced from 1900, the marriage fell apart. In 1912, she married the Swedish composer [[Hugo Alfvén]] who had also been taken by her beauty. It is believed Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Krøyer whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/546/|title=Marie Krøyer (1867&amp;ndash;1940)|author=Lise Svanholm|work=Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=3784&amp;wsektion=alle|title=Marie Krøyer|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate=9 September 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The work is oil on canvas and it measures {{convert|206|x|123|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="sm2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-art-works/ps-kroeyer/sum/|title=P.S. Krøyer: Summer evening at Skagen &amp;ndash; 1892|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Krøyer is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under the light of the setting sun.&lt;ref name="Svanholm2004"/&gt; The painting is one of the works in which Krøyer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called "[[Blue hour|l'heure bleue]]" (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a blue tint over the landscape. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Although Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, the horizon rises above her head, so her radiance is emphasized by comparison with the muted, nearly monochrome background.&lt;ref name="harmony1"&gt;Annette Johansen in ''Harmony in Blue'' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The painting was exhibited in 1893 in ''[[Den Frie Udstilling]]'' (The Free Exhibition). Reviews were mixed; [[Carl Hartmann (sculptor)|Carl Hartmann]] writing in the conservative ''[[Nationaltidende]]'' thought the painting beautiful and stated that it was "so fine that it ... throws an ennobling light on the whole collection",&lt;ref name="harmony2"&gt;Mette Bøgh Jensen in ''Harmony in Blue'' p.67&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Johannes Jørgensen]] in ''[[Politiken]]'' claimed that the viewer quickly tired of the picture as the figure of Marie was "incapable of awakening any mood", the colour was in places "distinctly unpleasant" and the dog, Rap, was "an ugly and unpleasant animal to behold".&lt;ref name="harmony2" /&gt; 
Critics at the [[Salon du Champ-de-Mars]] in 1894 were generally enthusiastic over Krøyer's use of colour and were struck and intrigued by the flatness of the composition.&lt;ref name="harmony2" /&gt; 
French critics who saw the picture at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume]] in Paris in 1928 compared it to the [[Impressionist]] works of [[Paul-Albert Besnard]], in particular his portrait of Madame Roger Jourdain, though at least one opined that the comparison showed the "victorious influence" of the French school.&lt;ref name="harmony1"/&gt;

==Provenance==
After the exhibition at ''Den Frie Udstilling'' in 1893, it was exhibited at a Munich exhibition in the summer of the same year, and then sold to a German art lover directly from the exhibition. Krøyer had mixed feelings about the sale as he would have preferred to have kept the portrait for a Danish museum, but was pleased that his painting had drawn so much appreciation at the German exhibition that he had not only had enthusiastic reviews but was able to sell it for 1000 kroner more than he would have been able to achieve in Denmark. Although Krøyer no longer owned the painting he was still allowed to exhibit it at the Salon du Champ-de-Mars in 1894. In 1900, he received a letter from the original German purchaser, a banker called Steinbart, informing him that he would like to offer it for sale; Krøyer talked to [[Heinrich Hirschsprung]] who arranged for [[J.C. Jacobsen]] to acquire it for the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] in early 1902.&lt;ref name="harmony1"/&gt; In 1937 it was lodged at [[Skagens Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisVaerk.do?vaerkId=263431|title=Sommeraften ved Skagen, kunstnerens hustru med hund ved strandkanten|trans-title=Summer Evening at Skagen, the Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore|publisher=Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon|accessdate=8 September 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Terror Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white [[magazine]] published by [[EC Comics]] in late 1955 and early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated blocks of text with several illustrations per page.

The first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955, but the second issue was the last. A third issue existed but was not printed by EC. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and the line was cancelled when EC's distributor went bankrupt.

''Terror Illustrated'' was edited by [[Al Feldstein]]. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of the title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to the stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and [[Alfred E. Neuman]]. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by publisher [[William Gaines]]. This included "The Basket" and "The Gorilla's Paw" in the first issue and "Horror in the Freak Tent" and "Reflection of Death" in #2. Other contributing writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications) and John Larner.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Russ. ''Complete EC Library: Terror Illustrated''. Gemstone, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Featured illustrators included [[Reed Crandall]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Graham Ingels]], [[Johnny Craig]], [[Charles Sultan]] and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]].

In 2006 ''Terror Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines by publisher Russ Cochran (with [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in hardbound volumes as the final part of his ''Complete EC Library''. The reprint volume included the previously unpublished third issue of ''Terror Illustrated''.

'''''Three of the Players''''' is a [[1953 in art|1953]] painting by Australian artist [[John Brack]]. The painting depicts three [[Australian rules football]]ers from the [[Collingwood Football Club]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Warwick|title=Retrogram pic special: Footy stars as works of art|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/retrogram-pic-special-footy-stars-as-works-of-art/story-fni5f22o-1226878126454|accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Herald Sun|publisher=News Limited|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players are thought by some to be [[Lou Richards]], [[Jack Regan]] and [[Phonse Kyne]]. However, Brack's widow, Helen, was of the opinion that they are not recognisable individuals but "stereotyped characters".&lt;ref name="Boland"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boland|first1=Michaela|title=Collingwood opts to pass up on painting|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/collingwood-opts-to-pass-up-on-painting/story-fn59niix-1225909100311|accessdate=24 May 2016|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tokion''''' was a Japanese-based magazine covering art, fashion, music and film first published in Japan in 1996, followed by [[United States]], UK, and [[Hong Kong]] editions. The magazine's makers also produced the annual Creativity Now Conference, a weekend-long seminar of panel discussions with speakers from across the creative spectrum.

== History ==
The magazine was started in 1996 by Lucas Badtke-Berkow and Adam Glickman, two American [[expatriates]] living in Japan, as a cultural bridge between [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=neoj&gt;{{cite news|title=On the New Japanese Tokion|url=http://neojaponisme.com/2006/09/18/on-the-new-japanese-tokion/|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=Neo Japonisme|date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, ''Tokion'' opened an American office in [[Los Angeles]]. In 2000 it moved into a retail space/office in [[New York City]], while maintaining a retail space/office in Tokyo. While in New York, the magazine's focus shifted from Japanese-influenced content to street culture aesthetics and then to a more global arts magazine featuring interviews with recognized artists such as  [[Lou Reed]], [[Richard Prince]], [[James Brown]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Roger Corman]], [[Ed Ruscha]] and [[Jeff Koons]], while continuing to cover up-and-coming artists such as [[Harmony Korine]], [[Miranda July]], [[Cory Arcangel]] and Simone Shubuck.

In 2002, Badtke-Berkow sold his share in the magazine to Glickman. Badtke-Berkow began publishing Papersky and Mammoth magazines in Japan, while Glickman began publishing Japanese and US editions. In 2005, the Japanese edition was sold to Infas Publishing Company. In 2006, the American edition was sold to independent publisher Larry Rosenblum. In 2009, ''Tokion'' and Creativity Now were sold out of foreclosure to Donald Hellinger, president of Nylon Holding, Inc.. In 2010 the magazine was renamed ''Factory'' in the US.&lt;ref name=neoj /&gt;

The '''VFX creative director''' is a position common in [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, and [[computer game]]s using a large amount of [[visual effects]].

For movies which are fully or partly [[computer-generated imagery|computer generated]], a VFX creative director works closely with the [[film director|director]]. On smaller VFX-intensive productions such as [[music video]]s or some [[television commercial]]s, a VFX creative director may also assume the responsibilities of the director. They are charged with making creative and aesthetic choices for visual effects. Although the role is generally more creative in nature, most VFX creative directors have a technical background and may exert a strong practical hand in production.

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of a VFX creative director are very much like those of an [[art director]], [[production designer]], or [[chief creative officer]], though with a particular focus on the computer-generated imagery of their projects. They are primarily responsible for directing and supervising the creative and technical execution of visual effects sequences, from concept to completion, including:
* [[Set extension]]s and matte painting
* [[Chroma key|Bluescreen]]ing
* [[Computer animation|Digital animation]]
* Digital effects
* [[Compositing]]

The VFX creative director may delegate responsibilities to [[visual effects supervisor]]s, visual effects editors, film [[compositing|compositors]], [[rotoscoping|rotoscope artists]], [[matte painting|matte painters]], and [[3D computer graphics|3D animators]].

VFX creative directors may therefore have input on various aspects of production, including:
* Story development and [[storyboarding]]
* Blocking, staging, locations
* Advising the director on actor movement
* [[Cinematography]]
* [[Costume]], [[makeup]], and [[Film prop|props]], particularly when there are [[special effects]] considerations

==Educational requirements==
As with much of the film industry, merit is awarded on the quality of work produced and not on academic qualifications. Bachelor's or master's degrees in film and television, digital media, design, or animation may be beneficial. There are a suite of skills and conditions that predispose an individual to successful operation as a VFX creative director:
* Experience from at least 5–10 years in the industry
* An understanding of the production process from concept to completion
* A deep familiarity with post-production pipelines, techniques, and software
* A strong balance of both creative and practical / technical skills
* Excellent communication and people-management skills
* Ability to guide and lead a team to extract their best work according to a predefined vision
* A strong grasp of all aspects of film theory

{{GreekWarfareArt}}
Warfare was a common occurrence in Greece from the [[Neolithic Greece|Neolithic Period]] through its conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] and until its conquest by the [[Roman Empire]]. Because of this, warfare was a typical theme in many pieces of [[ancient Greek art]]. Many works of art, like the [[Doryphoros]] or the [[chryselephantine]] statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], used military objects in their composition, and many others, like the [[Chigi vase]], had warfare as their main subject. Ancient Greek art is an important aspect of not just the history of art, but the history of warfare as well, due to its frequent spot on many works of ancient Greek art. As each different period in Greek history occurred, more and more types of art formed, as well as differing depictions of warfare.

== Bronze Age ==
In [[Minoan art]], warfare is not explicitly shown, but rather different interpretations were made that could tie into warfare. For example, [[bull leaping]] was an activity Minoan men did and the struggle between man and bull could be a depiction of warfare.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molloy|first=Barry|date=2012|title=Martial Minoans? War As Social Process, Practice and Event in Bronze Age Crete|jstor=41721880|journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens|volume=107|pages=87–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaic period ==

[[File:Attica, cratere di euphronios, 500-470 ac. ca. 02.JPG|thumb|left|The Arezzo 1465 Vase]]
During the Archaic Period, depictions of warfare in Greek Art held importance in status markings, and also provide insight as to the trading markets during this era. For example, the Arezzo 1465 vase, an Attic volute krater attributed to Euphronios in the Late Archaic Era, depicts an amazonomachy, and was found in the Etruria region, indicating the expanse of the trade networks. Warfare as a status symbol further solidifies a reasoning behind this trade, since any art with warfare depictions on it thereby becomes a sort of luxury item sought after by those wishing to elevate their own status because aspects and physical areas of Greek society tended to extol military prestige and virtue. .Proving oneself in battle distinguished one from the others and brought glory(klèos) to their families;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gwar/hd_gwar.htm|title=Warfare in Ancient Greece {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently owning any art depicting warfare displayed one's wealth and elite status.
 
[[File:Detail from the Chigi-vase.jpg|thumb|Hoplite Warfare on the Chigi Vase]]
During the Archaic period many artists began to depict the hoplite formation in art. Representations of the hoplite phalanx give historians a look into how the Greeks used this style of warfare in battle. Hoplites can be identified by their spear and their shield as well as their position next to other soldiers. One of the most popular representations of the hoplite phalanx is in the Chigi Vase. The hoplite formation is portrayed on many different types of pottery such as the Dinos, the Krater, and the Alabastron; and it many different styles such as black figure and white ground.

During the Archaic period there are pieces of artwork that depict the aulos player. One of the most prominent pieces show how the aulos player helped keep the hoplite soldiers in step by playing them into battle. With the help of the [[Aulos|aulete]], they were able to keep their shields close together to prevent the opposing phalanx from penetrating their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit, Jeffrey M. “Reading the Chigi Vase.” ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens'', vol. 71, no. 1, 2002, pp. 1–22. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3182058.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Neer, at the temple of Hera "the Archaic votives are masculine and martial: helmets and 'smiting figurines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical period ==

[[File:Terracotta calyx-krater (bowl for mixing wine and water) MET DP116942.jpg|thumb|Calyx-Krater by the Painter of the Berlin Hydra]]
The Classical Period involved many scenes relating and alluding to the Persian wars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ŞAHİN, Reyhan. 2017. "Representations of Mythological War Scenes n Attic Figure Pottery and Approaches in Research." ''Social Sciences Review Of The Faculty Of Sciences &amp; Letters University Of Uludag / Fen Edebiyat Fakültesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi'' 19, no. 32: 259-285. ''Academic Search Complete'', EBSCO ''host'' (accessed November 28, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This allusion can include some of the numerous depictions of mythical battle scenes such as amazonomachies, gigantomachies, and centauromachies during the period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such themes and mythological scenes can be seen in depictions like the one on the [[Calyx-Krater by the painter of the Berlin Hydria depicting an Amazonomachy]], or the [[Gigantomachy by the Suessula Painter]].

The first quarter of the Classical Period involved a lot of warfare, including the Persian Wars. Many Greek cities were sacked by the Persians during the second Persian War, taking a toll on several city-states. Themistoclean Walls were built quickly following the Greek victory of the Second Persian Wars, using destroyed sculptures and buildings to construct them. These re-purposed stones used in the building of Themistoclean walls is known as spolia. The Classical Period was also a time of Athenian control over Greece, powerwise, but also military wise and Athenian pottery was the most popular and well-spread over Greece.

[[File:Hellenistic-mediaeval tower Achinos.jpg|thumb|left|Hellenistic tower from Achinos, Phthiotis]]

== Hellenistic Period ==
Aside from a build up of architecture, other aspects of Greek culture, such as grave markers, were also becoming monumental. A majority of sculpture during this period was more grand and celebrated triumph and the power of the Greeks as a whole community or civilization.

Additionally, military monuments dedicated to the gods continued to remain prominent in Hellenistic culture. One such monument is the [[Neorion at Samothrace]], a monumentalized ship dedication within the [[Samothrace temple complex|Sanctuary of the Great Gods]] at the Greek island of [[Samothrace]]. Such architectural monuments demonstrate the continued importance of religiosity in art regarding warfare, even in a sanctuary concerned with larger mystery cults unrelated to war. This is a continued theme reflected in threads from the depiction of myth in the Archaic and Classical Periods, to the bull-leaping of the Minoans in the Bronze Age, which is considered potentially both religious and militaristic in nature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Troy-ancient-city-Turkey|title=Troy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander the Great rose to prominence by winning the war which saw the end of the Persian Empire.  Paintings and sculptures depicting battles and participants in the war were common in this period.
