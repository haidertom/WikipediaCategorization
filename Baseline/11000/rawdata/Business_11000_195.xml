      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2259">"'''Actually existing capitalism'''" or "'''really existing capitalism'''" is an ironic term used by critics of [[neoliberalism]] and [[capitalism]], used to claim that many economies purportedly practicing capitalism (an economic system characterized by a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[free market]] system) actually have significant state intervention and partnerships between private industry and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, Sean. ''Marxism and Human Nature''. Routledge. 1998. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saree Makdisi, Cesare Casarino, Rebecca E. Karl. ''Marxism Beyond Marxism''. Routledge, 1996. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[mixed economy]] is also used to describe economies with these attributes. The term seeks to point out discrepancy between capitalism as normally defined and what is labelled as capitalism in practice, and to claim that capitalism as defined is not desirable, pointing to the use of regulation in avoiding economic problems such as acute [[commodities]] fluctuations, financial market crashes, [[Monopoly|monopolies]], and extensive environmental damage. 

== Capitalism defined ==
Capitalism is defined as an economic system with the following attributes:
* Informed consumers making rational decisions regarding their purchases
* Perfect competition, which results in (1) easy entry and access to the marketplace; and (2) long run profits and surpluses not being possible, although short term booms may be.

=== Technical problems with capitalism in practice ===
Critics of capitalism as in the above definition hold that perfect competition is only theoretical, and that any economy that claims to be capitalist is actually some other type of economic system, i.e. only has some capitalist features. Further, current understandings of economics would need to incorporate this impossibility of such capitalism, no longer using the definition of capitalism as a starting point with which to analyze an economy. In this sense, the term can be understood as a critique of the methods of the economics discipline generally, and specifically of the [[Austrian School]] or the [[Chicago school of economics]].

==Investment Focus==
Tahir helped the Dhabi Group to evolve from a family office engaged in primarily passive investments into a vehicle that acted as a lead investor for a consortium of investors known as the Abu Dhabi Group.  The key focus areas became banking, telecommunications and real estate.

The Group understood the risks of investing in emerging and frontier markets, including corrupt government officials and corruption in general,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C10%5C29%5Cstory_29-10-2008_pg7_38{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergingmarkets.org/Article/2690718/World-Bank-initiates-anti-corruption-network.html|title=World Bank initiates anti-corruption network – Emerging Markets|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however were able to manage the risks inherent with this investment approach by approaching each target market as a portfolio investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=140302&amp;Cat=2&amp;dt=10/19/2008|title=Bank Alfalah in good health Abu Dhabi Group to invest up to $5 bn in Pakistan|date=11 October 2008|work=The News International, Pakistan|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tahir was the first to promote and encourage this approach: to be a portfolio investor in a market whereby the country can benefit from inward foreign direct investment that directly helps to create jobs as well as to help attract new investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/535705 |title=Abu Dhabi Group to start mobile phone company |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129050828/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/535705 |archivedate=29 January 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This longer-term partnership defined the access and readiness of countries to encourage investment groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moungalla.info/2009/09/17/bashir-tahir-la-societe-warid-congo-ne-sera-pas-concedee |title=男女無料登録OK！出会い系サイト一覧 |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111184728/http://www.moungalla.info/2009/09/17/bashir-tahir-la-societe-warid-congo-ne-sera-pas-concedee/ |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could provide a source of multi-sector investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balancingact-africa.com/news/en/issue-no-335/telecoms/dhabi-group-to-inves/en|title=DHABI GROUP TO INVEST $150-200M IN WIMAX MOBILE COMPANY IN UGANDA - balancingact-africa.com|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and help reduce volatilities through such long-term partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/business/13-Oct-2010/Abu-Dhabi-Groups--investment-in-Pakistan|title=Abu Dhabi Group's investment in Pakistan|work=The Nation|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''business record''' is a [[document]] (hard copy or digital) that records a business dealing. Business records include meeting [[minutes]], [[memoranda]], [[employment contract]]s, and [[:Category:Accounting source documents|accounting source documents]].

It must be retrievable at a later date so that the business dealings can be accurately reviewed as required. Since business is dependent upon confidence and trust, not only must the record be accurate and easily retrieved, the processes surrounding its creation and retrieval must be perceived by customers and the business community to consistently deliver a full and accurate record with no gaps or additions.

Most business records have specified [[retention period]]s based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies.  This is important because in many countries (including the United States) many documents ''may'' be required by law to be disclosed to [[Government agency|government regulatory agencies]] or to the general public.  Likewise, they ''may'' be [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] if the business is [[Lawsuit|sued]].  Under the [[business records exception]] in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], certain types of business records, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in court despite containing [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]].

'''Jean-Jacques Dessalines Michel Cincinnatus Leconte''' was [[List of heads of state of Haiti|President of Haiti]] from 15 August 1911 until his death on 8 August 1912.&lt;ref name='Douglas'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The American Occupation of Haiti I |journal=Political Science Quarterly|date=June 1927|first=Paul H.|last=Douglas|volume=42|issue=2|pages=232|doi=10.2307/2142787}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-01-13--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was a great-grandson of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]]—a leader of the Haitian Revolution and the first ruler of an independent Haiti—and was an uncle of [[Joseph Laroche]], the only black passenger to perish on the {{RMS|Titanic}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Carmeleau, ''Jean Price-Mars and Haiti'' (Three Continents Press, 1981), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dantès Bellegarde]], ''Histoire de du peuple haïtien, 1492–1952'' (Held, 1953), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Ebony' /&gt;

==Political career==

Leconte, a lawyer by trade, had served as minister of the interior under President [[Pierre Nord Alexis]]. He was forced into exile in [[Jamaica]] after a 1908 revolt deposed Alexis and gave [[François C. Antoine Simon]] the presidency.&lt;ref name='Ferris' /&gt;

Returning from exile in 1911, Leconte gathered a large military force.&lt;ref name='Chisholm'&gt;{{cite book|last = Chisholm|first = Hugh|title = The Britannica year book|publisher = The Encyclopædia Britannica Company|year = 1913|pages = 1086|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d0bOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1086&amp;dq=%22Cincinnatus+Leconte%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cincinnatus%20Leconte%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading the revolution that ousted President Simon and brought Leconte back to [[Port-au-Prince]] in triumph on 7 August 1911, Leconte was unanimously elected president of Haiti by Congress on 14 August with a seven-year term.&lt;ref name='Chisholm'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leconte in Haiti's Capital; Revolutionary Leader Takes Possession of National Palace|date=1911-08-08|url =https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/08/08/104873360.pdf|work =The New York Times|pages =4|accessdate = 2010-01-13 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt; His salary was set at $24,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Horace Greeley, ''The Tribune Almanac and Political Register'' (The Tribune Association, 1912), p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon attaining the presidency he instituted a number of reforms: paving streets, increasing teacher pay, installing telephone lines, and decreasing the size of the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Democracy and Human Rights in Haiti|journal=World Policy Reports|first=Andrew|last=Reading|pages=13|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/globalrights/carib/2004-Haiti.pdf|accessdate=2010-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101003753/http://www.worldpolicy.org/globalrights/carib/2004-Haiti.pdf|archivedate=2007-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' argued in August 1912 that it was "generally admitted" that Leconte's administration was "the ablest and the cleanest government Haiti has had in forty years."&lt;ref name='Ferris'&gt;{{cite book|last = Ferris|first = William Henry|authorlink = William Henry Ferris|title = The African Abroad,: Or, His Evolution in Western Civilization, Tracing His Development Under Caucasian Milieu, V. 2|publisher = The Tuttle, Morehouse &amp; Taylor press|year = 1913|pages = 624–625|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pCYbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA624&amp;dq=%22Cincinnatus+Leconte%22&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cincinnatus%20Leconte%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zora Neale Hurston]], writing in the 1930s after extensive research in Haiti, pointed out that Leconte was "credited with beginning numerous reforms and generally taking positive steps."&lt;ref name='Hurston'&gt;{{cite book|last = Hurston|first = Zora Neale|authorlink = Zora Neale Hurston|title = Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|year = 1990|location = New York, New York|page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leconte pursued a discriminatory policy toward the [[Lebanese Haitians|local Syrian population]] ([[Christian emigration#Lebanon|Christian migrants]] from [[Ottoman Syria]]), an already persecuted minority group which one historian described as constituting the "opening wedge of the American economic conquest of Haiti in the early 1900s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Race, Nationality, and Trade in the Caribbean: The Syrians in Haiti, 1903–1934 |journal=The International History Review|date=October 1981|first=Brenda Gayle|last=Plummer|volume=3|issue=4|pages=517–518|doi=10.1080/07075332.1981.9640260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-01-13--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1905 the Syrian population of Haiti was estimated to be 15,000.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to ascending to the presidency, he had promised to rid Haiti of its Syrian population. In 1912 Leconte's foreign minister released a statement stating that it was "necessary to protect nationals against the disloyal competition of the Easterner whose nationality is uncertain."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Arthur and J. Michael Dash, ''A Haiti Anthology: Libète'' (Markus Wiener Publishers, 1999), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Caribbean Societies'', Volume 2 (University of London, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, 1985), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; A 1903 law (aimed specifically at Syrians) limiting the immigration levels and commercial activities of foreigners was revived, and the harassment of Syrians that had been prevalent in the first few years of the 1900s was resumed. The Leconte administration did, however, continue to process claims made by Syrians who had been persecuted by the government of Nord Alexis.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, pp. 522–23, 533.&lt;/ref&gt; When Leconte died suddenly in 1912, a number of Syrians celebrated his passing and were imprisoned as a result, while others were deported. His Syrian policy would be continued by his successor [[Tancrède Auguste]].&lt;ref name="Plummer 536"&gt;Plummer, p. 536.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Despite being elected to a seven-year term, Leconte's time in office was short lived. On 8 August 1912, a violent explosion destroyed the [[National Palace (Haiti)|National Palace]], killing the president and several hundred soldiers.&lt;ref name="Plummer 536"/&gt;&lt;ref name='DannerNYT'&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Danner|title=To Haiti, With Love and Squalor|date=1991-08-11|url =https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/11/books/to-haiti-with-love-and-squalor.html|work =The New York Times|accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''[[Associated Press]]'' report at the time noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So great was the force of the explosion, that a number of small cannon, fragments of iron and shell were thrown long distances in all directions, and many of the palace attendants were killed. Every house in the city was shaken violently and the entire population, greatly alarmed, rushed into the street.&lt;ref name='Ferris' /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1912 account of the explosion in ''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'' reported that an "accidental ignition of ammunition stores caused the death of General Cincinnatus Leconte,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Record of Political Events |journal=Political Science Quarterly|date=December 1912|first=Carlton H.|last=Hayes|author2=Edward M. Sait|volume=27|issue=4|pages=752|doi=10.2307/2141264}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-01-13--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while a 1927 article in the same journal deemed his death an "assassination."&lt;ref name='Douglas'/&gt; Oral histories circulating in Haiti—some of which were chronicled by Hurston in the 1930s in her book ''Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica''—differed significantly from most written accounts. As Hurston explained, "The history books all say Cincinnatus Leconte died in the explosion that destroyed the palace, but the people do not tell it that way. Not one person, high or low, ever told me that Leconte was killed by the explosion. It is generally accepted that the destruction of the palace was to cover up the fact that the President was already dead by violence." According to Hurston there were "many reasons given for the alleged assassination", but the main actors in the supposed plot were men who "were ambitious and stood to gain political power...by the death of President Leconte."&lt;ref&gt;Hurston, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just several months before Leconte died, his nephew, [[Joseph Philippe Lemercier Laroche]], had been one of over [[Passengers of the RMS Titanic|2,200 passengers]] and crew on board the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'' for its maiden voyage. While Laroche's wife and daughters survived the sinking of the ocean liner, Laroche himself, the only man of [[African descent]] on board the ship, perished in the disaster.&lt;ref name='Ebony'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_8_55/ai_62685041/ |title=What Happened To The Only Black Family On The Titanic |accessdate=2010-01-13 |last=Hughes |first=Zondra |date=June 2000 |work=Ebony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contract Lifecycle Management''' (CLM) is the proactive, methodical management of a [[contract]] from initiation through award, compliance and renewal. Implementing CLM can lead to significant improvements in cost savings and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Benefits of Contract Lifecycle Management/CLM|url=http://www.villanovau.com/contract-lifecycle-management-benefits/|publisher=Villanova University|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding and [[contract management software|automating CLM]] can also limit organizational liability and increase compliance with legal requirements.

The key steps in the Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Contract Lifecycle Management/CLM?|url=http://exari.com/contract-lifecycle-management.html|publisher=Exari Systems|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) '''[[Automatic identification and data capture|Capture]]:''' Step #1 for most people is to get all of their existing paper contracts in a central visible place. If you have no clear idea what contracts you have, then you have no idea what your potential risk exposure is.  The next step is to capture the data from the contracts.

2) '''[[Records management|Track]]:''' Once you know where all your contracts are, the next step is to track any important data so you don’t miss any milestone. This affects both old contracts and newly signed contracts.

3) '''Author:''' With tracking in place, the focus can shift to accelerating the new contract creation process. The “authoring” process is about setting up contract templates and clause libraries to empower business users and legal users, respectively, to create new contracts in a fast but controlled fashion.

4) '''Create:''' [[Contract creation]] has two tracks. First, empowering business users with [[self-service]], wizard-based creation using intelligent templates pre-approved by legal.  Second, making life easier for legal when drafting complex deals on your own paper, or reviewing and “patching” contracts negotiated on other people’s paper.

5) '''Approve:'''  Companies need an approval [[workflow]] process to ensure that risky contracts are reviewed and approved by the right person. Some risks need to be approved by legal, some by management, some by special departments like credit, etc. Ideally, safe deals are pre-approved.

6) '''Negotiate:''' The needs of the typical negotiator include: a checklist of issues for each type of deal;  a way of marking up the paper to highlight how it’s different from the original or the last draft; and a way of capturing and flagging those differences (if possible).

7) '''[[Digital signature|Sign]]:''' When the contract is final and agreed it needs to be signed by all relevant people, and the signed copies need to be stored. Someone also needs to validate that the final signed version was not modified in any way after execution copies were sent out.

8) '''Analyze:'''  [[Business|Enterprises]] with 100+ contracts need to analyze those contracts for potential risks, rights &amp; obligations. Executives, [[Legal &amp; Risk]] need scanned reports to manage common risks, and ad hoc reports for unexpected scenarios. “Fingertip access” to contract terms and data allows people to react quickly to new scenarios and deal with time-sensitive risks.

==Information==
The Copy Exactly! methodology focuses on matching the manufacturing site to the development site. Matching occurs at all levels for physical inputs and statistically-matched responses (outputs). This process enables continuous matching over time by using coordinated changes, audits, [[process control system]]s, and joint Fab management structures{{clarify|date=October 2013}}. Physical inputs such as equipment configuration, chemical purity, facilities, and equipment hookups derive from the same specifications. In-line processes or equipment monitors that predict product performance, yield, or reliability must match at all levels.

[[A123 Systems]], a US company that makes [[lithium-ion batteries]], has recently repatriated its manufacturing operations after years of producing in South Korea and China. To facilitate the move, the company also used a “copy exactly” strategy. South Korean operations were replicated on a larger scale in the United States with the help of a team of South Korean engineers who were familiar with the production process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8107">Integration is a political and economic agreement among countries that gives preference to member countries to the agreement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; General integration can be achieved in three different approachable ways: through the  [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), bilateral integration, and [[regional integration]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Daniels, John D., Lee H. Radebaugh, and Daniel P Sullivan. International Business: Environment and Operations. NJ: Prentice Hall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In bilateral integration, only two countries economically cooperate with one another, whereas in regional integration, several countries within the same geographic distance become joint to form organizations such as the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Indeed, factors of mobility like capital, technology and labour are indicating strategies for cross-national integration along with those mentioned above.

==The World Trade Organization==

The WTO is one of the most effective trade agreements among nations. The WTO replaced the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1995 and has 125 member nations.currently 153 member are part of WTO. Many believe GATT initiated rampant liberalization in trade in 1947 and its move contributed to the expansion of trade all over the world by eliminating tariff and quotas. Moreover, WTO continued GATT's principle with more multilateral forum, which enables governments to settle agreements or to dispute them regarding trade.
 
Rapid growth of trade among nations has forced the agreement to be acknowledged as a fundamental basis for the member nations to follow certain rules and regulations as the signatories of the agreement. As a result, WTO expanded its mission to include trade in services, investments, intellectual property, sanitary measures, plant health, agriculture, and textiles, as well as technical baariers to trade.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"&gt;Daniels, J., Radebaugh, L., Sullivan, D. (2007). International Business: environment and operations, 11th edition. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-186942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The European Union (EU)==

The largest and most comprehensive regional economic group is the [[European Union|EU]]. It began as a [[free trade agreement]] with the goal to become a customs union and to integrate in other ways. The formation of the [[European Parliament]] and the establishment of a [[Euro]] the common currency make EU the most ambitious in comparison to other regional trade groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It progressed from being the European Economic Community (EEC) to the [[European Community]] (EC) to finally the European Union. Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland who decided not to leave [[European Free Trade Area]] are linked together with the EU as a customs union.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; The EU comprises 28 countries, including 12 countries from mostly Central and Eastern Europe that joined since 2004. The EU abolished trade barriers on intra-zonal trade, instituted a [[common external tariff]], created a common currency, the euro.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

The implications of the EU for corporate strategy are: 
* Companies need to determine where to produce products.
* Companies need to determine what their entry strategy will be.
* Companies need to balance the commonness of the EU with national differences.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

==North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)==

[[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] is designed to eliminate [[tariff]] barriers and liberalize investment opportunities and trade in services. NAFTA includes [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]], where went into effect in 1994. The United States and Canada historically have had various forms of mutual economic cooperation. They signed the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] effective January 1, 1989, which eliminated all tariffs on bilateral trade by January 1, 1998. In February 1991, Mexico approached the United States to establish a free trade agreement. The formal negotiations that began in June 1991 included Canada. The resulting North American Free Trade Agreement became effective on January 1, 1994.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

The main provisions in NAFTA are:

* the harmonization of trade rules,
* the liberalization of restrictions on services and foreign investment,
* the enforcement of intellectual property rights,
* a dispute settlement process,
* regional labour laws and standards, and
* strengthened environmental standards.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

==Regional economic integration in the Americas==

There are six major regional economic groups in the Americas and they can be further divided into [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. The major reason for these different groups in Central and South America entering into collaboration was market size.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; The [[Caribbean Community and Common Market]] (CARICOM) and the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM) are both found in [[Central America]].  The two major blocs in [[South America]] are the [[Andean Community]] (CAN) and the [[Southern Common Market]] (MERCOSUR) which is the major trade group. MERCOSUR comprises Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It generates 75 percent of South America’s GDP and this makes MERCOSUR the fourth largest trading bloc in the world after the EU, NAFTA, and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN).&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; 

Since August 23, 2008, there exists another integration initiative, the [[Union of South American Nations]] (''UNASUR''). It includes all independent states of South America with about 400 Million people and intends to create a level of integration similar to the European Union by 2025.

==Regional economic integration in Asia==

Regional economic integration has not been as successful in [[Asia]] as in the EU or NAFTA because most Asian countries have relied on U.S. and European markets for their exports.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; The [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), formed in 1967, consisted of the following countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] (AFTA), formed officially in 1993, was for the purpose of cutting tariffs on inter-regional trade to a maximum of 5% by 2008.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;  ASEAN is the third largest free trade agreement in the world after the EU and NAFTA and above MERCOSUR. The [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), founded in 1989, was to promote multilateral economic cooperation in trade and investment in the Pacific Rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apecsec.org.sg/apec/about_apec.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105426/http://www.apecsec.org.sg./apec/about_apec.html |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; APEC is composed of 21 countries that border the Pacific Rim; progress toward free trade is hampered by size and geographic distance between member countries and the lack of a treaty.

==Regional economic integration in Africa==

There are several regional trade groups in [[Africa]] that are registered with the WTO, including:
* the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC)
* the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA)
* the [[Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa]]
* the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU)&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

Created in 2002 by 53 African nations, the [[African Union]] took the place of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU). The OAU was established in 1963 and focuses its energy and resources on political issues in Africa (notably colonialism and racism) and the pursuit of market liberalization and economic growth in Africa.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

The '''Devonshire Initiative''' (DI) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] forum for leading international development [[NGO]]s and mining companies to come together in response to the emerging social agenda surrounding mining and community development issues.  The DI was founded on the belief that the Canadian mining and NGO presence in emerging markets can be a force for positive change.  The group came into being on March 5, 2007 at an initial workshop conducted at the [[University of Toronto]] on cross-sector partnerships, which featured a case study of the [[Kimberley Process]] on Conflict Diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inmetmining.com/sustainability/industryinvolvement/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

The DI has held over a dozen formal workshops and incubated one on-the-ground pilot in Honduras.

The ultimate objective of the Devonshire Initiative (DI) is improved social and community development outcomes wherever Canadian mining companies operate overseas. One avenue to that goal is through deeper collaboration with on-the-ground, development NGOs, leveraging the many decades of experience these organizations have in developing countries.  However, the sectors have traditionally operated independently, both at head office and in-country, and there are very few points of contact currently in existence between them.  The result is that companies are unable to harness the expertise of NGOs in development; and NGOs miss the opportunity to steer private sector development in a more socially sensitive and equitable way.  In Canada, there is currently no iterative, long-term venue to build relationships, trust and partnerships between these two groups.  The Devonshire Initiative (DI) is intended to begin to fill that gap.

The DI sees industry/NGO collaboration as a means to an end, with four specific areas of value added for the DI:

#Enhancing in-country capacity to allow communities, regions and countries to more visibly realize the benefits of Canadian mining investments;
#Providing concrete examples of operationalizing the industry’s CSR initiatives and policies, in order to enhance positive impact of the industry;
#Enhancing Canadian engagement with, and understanding of, the issues of international development.  This domestic engagement includes policymakers as well as the general public; and,
#Improved ability to influence corporate practices and leverage strategic partnerships for policy influence and advocacy.

== Work plan ==

The Devonshire Initiative's work is proceeding along two mutually reinforcing tracks:  first, systematically identifying and working to minimize the structural obstacles to international development NGO/mining industry collaboration.  These include, for instance, risk, resource imbalance and a lack of understanding of each other’s "business."  The second track proceeds to the substantive work of testing the underlying hypothesis of the Devonshire Initiative: that collaborative problem solving will yield significantly better results on the ground in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.embassymag.ca/page/view/.2007.october.31.mining&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer term the DI's objective will be to use a collective, credible voice to influence Canadian and global policy and practice on international development. There are opportunities in the policy arena to harness the DI’s influence on Canadian and global funding decisions, development priorities, and CSR initiatives.

The work plan from 2010 forward focuses on five activity areas:

#Networking and Capacity building - Events are aimed at enhancing the relationships, trust building and sharing best practices that are necessary for effective collaboration;
#Communications – Improving internal and external communications among the membership and to relevant audiences;
#Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination. The DI is positioning itself as a platform to disseminate information about existing case studies, initiatives, research projects, etc.;
#Joint projects, innovation and knowledge creation. Over next 12 months, the DI will provide feedback and input on a pending World Vision proposal to CIDA aimed at improved cross-sector collaboration between NGOs and the industry to reduce potential for conflict, enhance community and local authority capacity for sustainable, long-term development; and,
#Policy engagement and public engagement, with a variety of external stakeholders, including government, industry players, other NGOs, Canadian publics.

== Structure ==

The DI is headed by a part-time director, funded from annual financial commitments made by the industry participants. The director reports to a steering committee made up of 6 members: 3 from the NGO members and 3 from industry members.

The DI was initially organized by Marketa Evans, who served as the founding director until the fall of 2009. Subsequent directors were Alanna Rondi (October 2009-April 2010; June 2011-Oct 2012; January 2014 – present) and Edward Thomas (interim coordinator; April 2010-March 2011; October 2012–December 2013).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.international.gc.ca/canadexport/articles/91126i.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard John''' "'''Dick'''" '''Hubbard''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZM|size=85%}} (born 18 November 1946) is a New Zealand businessman and politician, founder and principal of [[Hubbard Foods]] in [[Auckland]], and [[Mayor of Auckland City]] from 2004 to 2007. His management of Hubbard Foods gained some prominence for its participation in and promotion of [[socially responsible]] business perspectives. Hubbard also spent a few years managing the Food Processing Factory in [[Niue]], processing mainly lime, passionfruit and papaya.

Hubbard founded New Zealand Businesses for Social Responsibility (BSR) (now the [[Sustainable Business Network]]) and became Chairman of the New Zealand [[National Park]]s &amp; Conservation Foundation. He has been a supporter of [[Outward Bound]] in New Zealand. He was elected Mayor of Auckland City on 9 October 2004, succeeding [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]], who in turn succeeded Hubbard as mayor on 13 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10469691|title=Banks ousts Hubbard |last=Orsman|first=Bernard|date=13 October 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Paeroa]] on 18 December 1946, Hubbard is the son of Colin Hubbard and Margaret Hubbard (née Syme). He was educated at [[Paeroa College]] from 1960 to 1964, and then studied at [[Massey University]] from 1965 to 1969, graduating with a Bachelor of Technology (Food).&lt;ref name="Whos who"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=Alister |title=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa 2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Alister Taylor Publishers |location=Auckland |issn=1172-9813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 Hubbard married Diana Reader, and the couple went on to have two children,&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt; including the transgender weightlifter [[Laurel Hubbard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cleaver |first1=Dylan|title=Transgender woman makes NZ weightlifting team |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11811451 |accessdate=24 March 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayoral term==
Hubbard was elected as part of a broad swing to the centre-left in the 2004 Auckland City local government elections, predicated on concerns about the style of the previous Mayor, and proposals to construct a major new multi-laned road through the city's relatively affluent eastern suburbs. Although formally independent, Hubbard's support on Auckland's council was derived from the centre-left leaning [[City Vision (Auckland, New Zealand political ticket)|City Vision]], Labour, and [[Action Hobson]] tickets.

===Re-election bid, 2007===

Hubbard was defeated by [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] in the [[Auckland City mayoral election, 2007|2007 local body elections]], by a margin of 10,000 votes. Hubbard won 35,314 of the votes compared to Bank's 45,387 votes in an election marked by low voter turn-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/news/notices/200710/20/n01.asp |title=Declaration of result o-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017135612/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/news/notices/200710/20/n01.asp |archivedate=17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Hubbard was conferred an honorary [[Doctor of Science]] degree by Massey University in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honorary graduates |url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/calendar/officers-and-staff-of-the-university/honorary-graduates.cfm |publisher=Massey University |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2001 New Year Honours]] he was appointed an [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to business and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/node/388 | title=New Year honours list 2001 |date=30 December 2000 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was defined by [[David Teece]], Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen, in their 1997 paper ''Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management'', as "the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments".&lt;ref name="Teece et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last2 = Pisano|first2 = Gary|last3 = Shuen|first3 = Amy|date = August 1997|title = Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7%3C509::AID-SMJ882%3E3.0.CO;2-Z/epdf|journal = [[Strategic Management Journal]]|volume = 18|issue = 7|pages = 509–533|last1 = Teece|first1 = David|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used in the plural form, '''dynamic capabilities''', emphasizing that the ability to react adequately and timely to external changes requires a combination of multiple capabilities.

== Overview ==
The phrase "dynamic capabilities" was introduced in a working paper by [[David Teece]], [[Gary Pisano]], and Amy Shuen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teece |first1=David |last2=Pisano |first2=Gary |last3=Shuen |first3=Amy |title=Firm Capabilities, Resources, and the Concept of Strategy |date=1990 |publisher=Center for Research on Management |location=University of California, Berkeley |edition=CCC Working Paper 90–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;The final, peer-reviewed version was published in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teece |first1=David J. |last2=Pisano |first2=Gary |last3=Shuen |first3=Amy |title=Dynamic capabilities and strategic management |journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=August 1997 |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=509–533 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7%3C509::AID-SMJ882%3E3.0.CO;2-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of dynamic capabilities is similar in some ways to the previously existing concept of operational capabilities; the latter pertains to the current operations of an organization, whereas the former, by contrast, refers to an organization's capacity to efficiently and responsively change these operations and develop its resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helfat|first1=Constance E. |last2=Finkelstein |first2=Sydney |last3=Mitchell |first3=Will |last4=Peteraf |first4=Margaret |last5=Singh |first5=Harbir |last6=Teece |first6=David |last7=Winter |first7=Sidney G. |title=Dynamic Capabilities: Understanding Strategic Change in Organizations |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405182065 |url= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=u0Tuh5vixLkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22Dynamic+Capabilities:+Understanding+strategic+change+in+organizations |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main assumption of this framework is that an organization's basic competencies should be used to create short-term competitive positions that can be developed into longer-term competitive advantage. Nelson and Winter, in their 1982 book ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'', link the growth of the concept of dynamic capabilities to the [[resource-based view]] of the firm and  the concept of "routines" in evolutionary theories of organization.&lt;ref name="Nelson1982"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard R. |last=Nelson |title=An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change |year=1982 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-27228-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douma and Scheuder describe it as a bridge between the economics-based strategy literature and evolutionary approaches to organizations.&lt;ref name="DoumaSchreuder2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douma |first1=Sytse |authorlink1=Sytse Douma |last2=Schreuder |first2=Hein |authorlink2=Hein Schreuder |title=Economic Approaches to Organizations |edition=Third |year=2002 |publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall |isbn=9780273651994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resource-based view of the firm emphasizes sustainable competitive advantage; the dynamic capabilities view, on the other hand, focuses more on the issue of competitive survival in response to rapidly changing contemporary business conditions.  Strategy scholars Gregory Ludwig and Jon Pemberton, in one of the few empirical studies on the topic, called for clarification of the specific processes of dynamic capability building in particular industries to make the concept more useful to senior managers who set directions for their firms.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2011 pp.215-236"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ludwig|first1=Gregory |last2=Pemberton |first2=Jon |title=A managerial perspective of dynamic capabilities in emerging markets: The case of the Russian steel industry |journal=Journal for East European Management Studies |issn=0949-6181 |year=2011 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=215–236 |jstor= 23281688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic capabilities theory concerns the development of strategies for senior managers of successful companies to adapt to radical discontinuous change, while maintaining minimum capability standards to ensure competitive survival.  For example, industries which have traditionally relied on a specific manufacturing process can't always change this process on short notice when a new technology arrives; when this happens, managers need to adapt their own routines to make the most of their existing resources while simultaneously planning for future process changes  as the resources depreciate.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2011 pp.215-236"/&gt;

The New Dynamic Capabilities framework, posed by Amy Shuen in her analysis of Web 2.0, focuses on the firm's ability to quickly orchestrate and reconfigure externally sourced competences,ranging from Apple, Google Android, IBM Linux developer ecosystems to crowdsourced, crowdfunded open innovations such as the Obama08 mobile app—while leveraging internal resources such as platforms, know-how, user communities and digital, social and mobile networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shuen |first1=Amy |last2=Sieber |first2=Sandra |title=Orchestrating the New Dynamic Capabilities |journal=IESE Insight Review|date=2009 |issue=3 |pages=58–65 |url= http://www.ieseinsight.com/review/articulo.aspx?doc=5445&amp;seccion=6 |accessdate=7 December 2017 |doi=10.15581/002.art-1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuen |first=Amy |title=Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide: Business thinking and strategies behind successful Web 2.0 implementations |year=2008 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=9780596553753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Dynamic Capabilities framework takes into account digital, information and network economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro |first1=Carl |last2=Varian |first2=Hal R. |title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard Business Review Press |isbn=9780875848631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fall of the transaction costs of involved in using specialized services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williamson |first=Oliver E. |title=Nobel Prize Lecture: Transaction Cost Economics: The Natural Progression |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2009/williamson-lecture.html |website=nobelprize.org |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Cordes-Berszinn, though, more research is needed in order to measure the "capabilities" and to appropriately apply the ideas to practical management situations.&lt;ref name=berszinn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordes-Berszinn|first1=Philip|title=Dynamic Capabilities: How Organisational Structures Affect Knowledge Processes|date=November 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/dynamic-capabilities-philip-cordesberszinn/?K=9781137351272|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
A detailed description of processes and theoretical roots is provided by Arndt, Pierce, and Teece (2017). Teece, Pisano, and Shuen proposed three dynamic capabilities as necessary for an organization to meet new challenges:  the ability of employees to learn quickly and to build new strategic assets; the integration of these new strategic assets, including capability, technology and customer feedback, into company processes; and lastly the transformation or reuse of existing assets which have depreciated.&lt;ref name="Teece et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenhardt and Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Eisenhardt|first1= Kathleen M.|last2= Martin|first2= Jeffrey A.|title=Dynamic capabilities:What are they? |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0266%28200010/11%2921:10/11%3C1105::AID-SMJ133%3E3.0.CO;2-E/abstract |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume= 21 |issue=10/11 |pages=1105–1122 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=October 2000|doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/11&lt;1105::AID-SMJ133&gt;3.0.CO;2-E |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teece refers to successful implementation of these three stages as developing "corporate agility".&lt;ref name="dynamic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teece|first=David J.|title=Explicating Dynamic Capabilities: The Nature and Microfoundations of (Sustainable) Enterprise Performance |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.640/abstract |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume= 28 |issue=13 |pages=1319–1350 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=August 2007 |doi=10.1002/smj.640 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
The first stage, learning, requires employees and managers to reorganize their routines to promote interactions that lead to successful solutions to particular problems, to recognize and avoid dysfunctional activity and  strategic blind spots, and to make appropriate use of alliance and acquisition to bring new strategic assets into the firm from external sources. A practical example of this is provided by Jean-Pierre Jeannet and [[Hein Schreuder]], in their book ''From Coal to Biotech'', which lays out how the Dutch company [[DSM (company)|DSM]] transformed itself twice using 'strategic learning cycles'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeannet |first1=Jean-Pierre |first2=Hein |last2=Schreuder |year=2015 |title=From Coal to Biotech: The transformation of DSM with business school support |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662462980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New assets ===
In his 1988 book ''Managing Quality'', [[David A. Garvin]] states that quality performance depends on organisational routines for gathering and processing information, for linking customer experiences with engineering design choices and for coordinating factories and component suppliers.&lt;ref name="Garvin1988"&gt;{{cite book|first=David A. |last=Garvin |title=Managing Quality: The Strategic and Competitive Edge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-LWY2qgSHwC|year=1988|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-02-911380-6|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly competitive advantage also requires the integration of external activities and technologies through alliances and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahra |first1=Shaker A. |last2=Nielsen |first2=Anders P. |title=Sources of capabilities, integration and technology commercialization |journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=1 May 2002 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=377–398 |doi=10.1002/smj.229 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.229/abstract |issn=1097-0266 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation of existing assets ===
Economists Amit and Schoemaker pointed out in 1993 that success in fast changing markets depends on reconfiguring the firm’s asset structure to accomplish rapid internal and external transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalid |first=Saba |title=Exploring Firm Level Market Knowledge Competence and Its Implications for the Speed and Success of Export Expansion: A Mixed Methodology Study from the Software Industry|date=2009|publisher=University of Vaasa|isbn=9789524762700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afJT6sXTyroC&amp;pg=PA25 |page=25|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firms must develop processes to make changes inexpensively while accomplishing reconfiguration and transformation ahead of the competition. This can be supported by decentralization, local autonomy and strategic alliances.

===Co-specialization ===
Another "dynamic capabilities" concept is co-specialization. For example, the physical assets, human resources and the intellectual property of a company, having developed together over time, are more valuable in combination than separately, and give a firm a sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douma |first1=Sytse |authorlink1=Sytse Douma |last2=Schreuder |first2=Hein |authorlink2=Hein Schreuder |title=Economic Approaches to Organisations |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=9780273735298 |edition=Fifth |url= https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Approaches-Organisations-Sytse-Douma/dp/0273735292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Trade Union Confederation''' ('''ETUC''') is the major trade union organisation representing workers at European level.
European integration has reinforced the EU’s role in economic, employment and social policy throughout the 28 Member States. The ETUC is a European social partner, which means that the European Commission consults it when developing social and economic policies. It also negotiates autonomous agreements and work programmes with European employers. And it coordinates the national and sectoral policies of its affiliates on social and economic matters, particularly in the framework of the EU institutional processes, including European economic governance and the EU Semester

==History==
The ETUC was established in 1973, to coordinate and represent workers and their trade unions at European level, and has grown as more countries have joined the EU. Its membership now goes beyond the 28 Member States.

==Representativeness and Constitution==
At present, the ETUC represents almost 45 million workers across Europe, belonging to 89 national trade union confederations from 39 European countries, and 10 European Industry Federations. Within the ETUC, the Women’s Committee and Youth Committee represent the interests of these two groups of members. 
The ETUC has set up UnionMigrantNet, with a network of trade union contact points in Member States to assist migrants and their families. It cooperates closely with the independent research and training centre, the European Trade Union Institute.
The ETUC coordinates the activities of the 45 IRTUCs (Interregional Trade Union Councils), which organise trade union cooperation across national borders in the EU and defend the right to free movement of workers. 
Other trade union structures operating under the auspices of the ETUC are EUROCADRES (Council of European Professional and Managerial Staff) and FERPA (European Federation of Retired and Older People).
The current ETUC General Secretary, elected in October 2015 on a four-year mandate, is [[Luca Visentini]], from the [[Italian Labour Union|UIL]] trade union in Italy. The President is Rudy de Leeuw, President of the [[FGTB]] in Belgium. The two Deputy General Secretaries are Veronica Nilsson and Peter Scherrer, and the Confederal Secretaries are Liina Carr, Esther Lynch, Montserrat Mir Roca, and Thiébaut Weber. 
The ETUC’s delegate Congress, which takes place every four years, approves and amends the Constitution and elects its leadership team. All policies and activities are agreed by affiliates’ representatives, who maintain their own independence. The 13th Congress took place in Paris on 29 September-2 October 2015.

==Mission and Activities==
The ETUC's mission is to encourage European unity, peace and stability, enabling working people and their families to enjoy full human, civil, social and employment rights and high living standards. To achieve this, it promotes the European social model, combining sustainable economic growth with ever-improving living and working conditions, including full employment, well-functioning social dialogue and industrial relations, social protection, equal opportunities, good quality jobs, social inclusion, and an open and democratic policy-making process that involves citizens fully in the decisions that affect them.
At the 2015 Paris Congress, the ETUC agreed a Manifesto and an Action Programme for the four years until 2019. These documents focus on three objectives:

* A strong economy that serves the people
* Stronger unions for democratic values and democracy at work
* A core of ambitious social standards

'''A strong economy'''

The ETUC works with all the EU governing bodies: Presidency, Council, Commission and Parliament. Its right to represent the interests of European workers in the formulation of EU macroeconomic and employment policy is articulated in the EU Treaty. It takes part in bi-annual Tripartite Social Summits; responds to European Commission proposals; liaises with a cross-party Intergroup of MEPs in the European Parliament; and coordinates trade union participation in a number of advisory bodies, including the tripartite EU agencies for vocational training (CEDEFOP), improvement of living and working conditions (Eurofound), and health and safety (EU-OSHA). It works closely with the Workers’ Group in the Economic and Social Committee.

At the meetings of the Macroeconomic Dialogue (MED), established in 1998, the social partners discuss economic policy with the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Commission. The ETUC wants greater trade union participation in economic governance at both EU and national level.
The ETUC supports public investment, a green economy, fair taxation and quality jobs for all. It opposes precarious work and austerity policies.

'''Stronger unions'''

The ETUC regards collective bargaining and social dialogue, and workplace and industrial democracy as key to innovation, productivity and growth in Europe. It therefore promotes capacity building for trade unions across Europe.
The social dialogue between the ETUC and European employers supplements the national social dialogues in the Member States. The ETUC supports European Works Councils, and workers’ consultation and participation in decision-making.
EU cross-industry social dialogue was formally launched in 1985, with the support of former Commission President Jacques Delors. It has evolved through three stages:
I - (1985-1991) Bipartite activities culminated in the adoption of resolutions, declarations and common opinions, which did not have binding effect. 
II - (1992-1999) An accord between the social partners, signed on 31 October 1991 and subsequently annexed to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty in the form of a Social Protocol, enabled European social partner agreements to have legal force through a Council decision. In 1997, the agreement was written into the Treaty of Amsterdam (Articles 154 and 155 TFEU).
European social dialogue led to the implementation of three framework agreements (parental leave in 1995 - revised in 2009, part-time work in 1997, and fixed-term contracts in 1999) via EU Directives.
III - (1999-2005) In December 2001, the European social partners presented a "common contribution" to the Laeken European Council. In accordance with the 1991 agreement (Art. 155 par 2 TFEU), this moved towards greater independence and autonomy of the social dialogue.
Since 2002, the social partners have concluded autonomous agreements on:
•	telework (2002)
•	work-related stress (2004)
•	harassment and violence at work (2007)
•	inclusive labour markets (2010)
•	a framework of actions for the lifelong development of competencies and qualifications (2002), a framework of actions on gender equality (2005), and a framework of actions on youth employment (2013). 
These are implemented by the social partners themselves at national, regional and enterprise level. The social partners' new Multiannual Work Programme runs until 2017 and foresees an accord on active ageing.
In the field of collective bargaining and wage policy, the ETUC has coordinated affiliates’ activities since 1999. From 2012, the ETUC also started to coordinate trade union participation in EU economic governance and the Semester process. Every year the ETUC updates its priorities and initiatives on industrial relations and wage developments, with a view to improving working and living conditions across Europe, to achieve better wages for all workers, ensure equal treatment, combat inequalities, support capacity building for sound industrial relations and promote collective bargaining in all EU countries.
The ETUC favours a holistic approach to workers’ involvement, including stronger information and consultation rights, board-level participation in European company forms, and support for European Works Councils. The ETUC presses for information and consultation for workers, in particular to anticipate change or company restructuring (to cut job losses), and throughout the subcontracting chain.

'''Ambitious social standards'''

The ETUC is committed to pursuing social progress across the EU – an objective enshrined in the EU Treaty. It therefore calls for high-quality public services and social protection, gender equality, worker mobility, and high health and safety standards, with an end to social dumping and discrimination.
The ETUC defends the European social model as a key factor in promoting not only social justice and cohesion, but also economic growth, productivity and competitiveness in the EU.
When necessary, the ETUC pursues its vision of Social Europe through direct action, such as Euro-demonstrations and campaigns, and works with civil society partners to achieve social justice and progress for workers and their families across Europe. 
The ETUC is recognised by the European Union, by the Council of Europe and by the European Free Trade Association as the only representative cross-sectoral trade union organisation at European level.

'''Future challenges'''

At its Congress in Paris, the ETUC launched a broad discussion on the role and future of trade unionism in Europe, in the face of globalisation and austerity policies affecting society in Europe and the rest of the world.
The discussion has been widened to address the future of the EU, facing challenges like the refugee emergency, Brexit, rising populism and xenophobia, and widespread discontent among citizens and workers about their economic and social conditions.
The ETUC is launching campaigns and actions, including on a fairer, sustainable economic model, quality job creation, just transition and fair trade, higher pay and wage convergence for European workers, better protection for disadvantaged, precarious and self-employed workers, and more democracy at work, in the economy and in EU institutions.

{{Contract law}}
'''Expectation damages''' are [[damages]] recoverable from a [[breach of contract|breach]] of [[contract]] by the non-breaching party. An award of expectation damages protects the injured party's interest in realizing the value of the expectancy that was created by the promise of the other party.

The purpose of expectation damages is to put the non-breaching [[plaintiff|party]] in the position it would have occupied had the contract been fulfilled. Expectation damages can be contrasted to [[reliance damages]] and [[restitution|restitution damages]], which are remedies that address other types of interests of parties involved in [[contract|enforceable promises]].

The default for expectation damages are monetary damages which are subject to limitations or exceptions (see below)

Expectation damages are measured by the diminution in value, coupled with [[consequential damages|consequential]] and [[incidental damages|incidental]] damages.

== Measuring Expectation Damages ==
In expectation damages, the measure of damages is the difference between what was given and what was promised, along with consequential and incidental expenses minus any payments received from the breaching party and any costs saved as a result of the breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1954|litigants=Bellgrove v Eldridge |parallelcite=(1954) 90 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 613 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The proper amount is that which gives the non-breaching party the "benefit of the bargain." However, it is important to note that expectation damages are not punitive; its theoretical purpose is to place the injured, non-breaching party in the same position that they would have occupied had there been full performance of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|56|2013|litigants=Clark v Macourt |parallelcite=(2013) 253 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, it is the amount that makes the injured party indifferent to the breach.

Examples: 
*General contractor accepts an offer from a subcontractor and enters into a contract.  The general contractor breaches / repudiates their contract part way through the subcontractor's performance.  Generally, the subcontractor is entitled to seek an amount equal to the contract price or unrealized value of the promised performance plus costs incurred in preparing or performing under the contract (and costs incidental to the breach e.g., storage costs, restocking fees for returns; penalties or costs for canceling contracts, supply orders etc.) minus any progress payments made by the general contractor and minus costs saved by the breach; can include anticipated profit.
*Neal signs a contract agreeing to buy 10 hours of landscaping services from John's Landscaping for $50 an hour. If Neal breaks the contract and doesn't use any of John's Landscaping's services, expectation damages paid to John's Landscaping would be $500 minus any costs John's Landscaping may have saved, which is the economic loss they suffered. If John's Landscaping breaks the contract, and Neal is forced to hire another service for $60 an hour, expectation (direct) damages paid to Neal would equal $100 ($10 an hour, the difference in price between the original contract and the new contract).

==Potential Exceptions or Limitations ==

* Duty to mitigate - the aggrieved party has a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages. Failure to take such steps can cut off damages which arose from such a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate.  This is a duty of reasonable care thus no duty to take steps which are unreasonably burdensome. Example - buyer breaches contract to purchase produce; seller is expected to mitigate e.g., "cover" under the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code or resale; failure to make reasonable attempts to resell can be a ground to deny damages arising from breach e.g., spoilage.  Breaching party is liable for costs which arise from an effort to take reasonable steps to mitigate.  E.g., party continues to work after being notified of a breach and running up the bill.  (however, this might be reasonable if the aggrieved party reasonably believed they had a better chance of selling a completed product to an alternative buyer).
* Reasonable certainty - must be able to calculate the damages based on reasonably certain facts or comparable situations. Cannot have a calculation based wholly on guesses. In cases of doubt, many jurisdictions have adopted a view that the breaching party should bear the risk of doubt rather than the aggrieved party.
* Foreseeability - Generally, no consequential damages unless they are known or foreseeable.  e.g., No lost profits for third party transactions (e.g., Hadley v. Baxendale case below), holding that Baxendale could only be held liable for losses that were generally foreseeable, or if Hadley had mentioned his special circumstances in advance. The mere fact that a party is sending something to be repaired does not indicate that they would lose profits if it were not delivered on time. The court suggested various other circumstances under which Hadley could have entered into this contract that would not have presented such dire circumstances, and noted that where special circumstances exist, provisions can be made in the contract voluntarily entered into by the parties to impose extra damages for a breach. e.g. [[Hadley v Baxendale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Hadley v Baxendale]] |court=EWHC |division =Exch |year=1854 |num=J70 |paralleicte=[1854] 156 [[English Reports|ER]] 145 |copurtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cost of performance or a proposed measure of damage greatly exceeds market value of full performance ([[Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co.|Peevyhouse v Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co]]) E.g., land owner contract with coal company promised restoration of land after mining complete - coal company refused to comply; court found the cost of restoration (~$30k) grossly exceeded value of the property in unrestored condition ($300 price difference between condition before and after coal mining). However, this case has been widely criticized; 2nd Restatement of the Law criticized it; many courts will not follow this rule thus would decline to award damages based on market value based on view that damages should be awarded based on actual harm to injured party versus hypothetical market value - dependent on jurisdiction)

'''Health Level-7''' or '''HL7''' refers to a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various healthcare providers. These standards focus on the application layer, which is "layer 7" in the [[OSI model]]. The HL7 standards are produced by the [[Health Level Seven International]], an international [[standards organization]], and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as [[ANSI|American National Standards Institute]] and [[ISO|International Organization for Standardization]].

Hospitals and other healthcare provider organizations typically have many different computer systems used for everything from billing records to patient tracking.  All of these systems should communicate with each other (or "interface") when they receive new information, or when they wish to retrieve information, but not all do so.

[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Rodrigues|title=Health Information Systems: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnBJsRtfVbYC&amp;pg=PR39|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60566-988-5|year=2010|page=xxxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] considers the following standards to be its primary standards – those standards that are most commonly used and implemented:&lt;ref name="HL7 Primary Standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Primary Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=1|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Version 2.x Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions
* Version 3 Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions
* [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) – an exchange model for clinical documents, based on HL7 Version 3
* [[Continuity of Care Document]] (CCD) – a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.
* [[Structured Product Labeling]] (SPL) – the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3
* [[Clinical Context Object Workgroup]] (CCOW) – an interoperability specification for the visual integration of user applications
 
Other HL7 standards/methodologies include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/index.cfm?ref=nav|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]] (FHIR) – a draft standard for the exchange of resources  
* [[Arden Syntax]] – a grammar for representing medical conditions and recommendations as a [[Medical logic module|Medical Logic Module]] (MLM)
* Claims Attachments – a Standard Healthcare Attachment to augment another healthcare transaction
* Functional Specification of [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) / [[Personal health record|Personal Health Record]] (PHR) systems – a standardized description of health and medical functions sought for or available in such software applications
* [[Gello Expression Language|GELLO]] – a standard expression language used for clinical decision support

==Primary standards==
HL7's primary standards are those standards that [[Health Level Seven International]] considers to be most commonly used and implemented.&lt;ref name="HL7 Primary Standards"/&gt;

===Version 2 messaging===
The HL7 version 2 standard (also known as Pipehat) has the aim to support hospital workflows. It was originally created in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 FAQs|url=http://www.hl7.org/about/FAQs/index.cfm?ref=nav|publisher=[[HL7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HL7 version 2 defines a series of electronic messages to support administrative, logistical, financial as well as clinical processes. Since 1987 the standard has been updated regularly, resulting in versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8, 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. The v2.x standards are [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] (e.g., a message based on version 2.3 will be understood by an application that supports version 2.6).

HL7 v2.x messages use a non-[[XML]] encoding syntax based on segments ([[Line (text file)|line]]s) and one-character [[delimiter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding HL7 Messages|url=http://www.interfaceware.com/understanding_hl7_messages.html|publisher=iNTERFACEWARE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segments have composites ([[Field (computer science)|field]]s) separated by the composite delimiter. A composite can have sub-composites (components) separated by the sub-composite delimiter, and sub-composites can have sub-sub-composites (subcomponents) separated by the sub-sub-composite delimiter. The default delimiters are [[carriage return]] for the segment separator, vertical bar or pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) for the field separator, caret (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) for the component separator, ampersand (&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;) for the subcomponent separator, and hashtag/pound (#) is the default truncation separator. The tilde (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) is the default repetition separator. Each segment starts with a 3-character string that identifies the segment type. Each segment of the message contains one specific category of information. Every message has &lt;code&gt;MSH&lt;/code&gt; as its first segment, which includes a field that identifies the message type. The message type determines the expected segment types in the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Messages and Descriptions|url=http://healthstandards.com/blog/2007/09/24/hl7-separator-characters/|publisher=Health Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The segment types used in a particular message type are specified by the segment grammar notation used in the HL7 standards.

The following is an example of an admission message.  &lt;code&gt;MSH&lt;/code&gt; is the header segment, &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; the Patient Identity, &lt;code&gt;PV1&lt;/code&gt; is the Patient Visit information, etc. The 2nd field in the &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; segment is the patient's name, in the order, family name, given name, second names (or their initials), suffix, etc. Depending on the HL7 V2.x standard version, more fields are available in the segment for additional patient information.

HL7 v2.x has allowed for the [[interoperability]] between electronic Patient Administration Systems (PAS), Electronic Practice Management (EPM) systems, Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), Dietary, Pharmacy and Billing systems as well as [[Electronic Medical Record]] (EMR) or [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems.  Currently, the HL7 v2.x messaging standard is supported by every major medical information systems vendor in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards Organizations|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/nhii/standards.html|publisher=Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), [[Health and Human Services]] (HHS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 3 messaging===
The HL7 version 3 standard has the aim to support all healthcare workflows. Development of version 3 started around 1995, resulting in an initial standard publication in 2005. The v3 standard, as opposed to version 2, is based on a formal methodology (the HDF) and object-oriented principles.

The Reference Information Model&lt;ref name="RIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Reference Information Model|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/rim.cfm|publisher=[[HL7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RIM) is the cornerstone of the HL7 Version 3 development process and an essential part of the HL7 V3 development methodology. RIM expresses the data content needed in a specific clinical or administrative context and provides an explicit representation of the [[semantic]] and [[lexicon|lexical]] connections that exist between the information carried in the fields of HL7 messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tools &amp; Resources – V3 Modeling &amp; Methodology Tools|url=http://www.hl7.org/participate/toolsandresources.cfm|publisher=[[HL7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HL7 Development Framework - [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/HL7 27931'''

The HL7 Version 3 Development Framework (HDF) is a continuously evolving process that seeks to develop specifications that facilitate interoperability between healthcare systems.  The HL7 RIM, vocabulary specifications, and model-driven process of analysis and design combine to make HL7 Version 3 one methodology for development of consensus-based standards for healthcare information system [[interoperability]].  The HDF is the most current edition of the HL7 V3 development methodology.

The HDF not only documents messaging, but also the processes, tools, actors, rules, and artifacts relevant to development of all HL7 standard specifications. Eventually, the HDF will encompass all of the HL7 standard specifications, including any new standards resulting from analysis of electronic health record architectures and requirements.

HL7 specifications draw upon codes and vocabularies from a variety of sources.  The V3 vocabulary work ensures that the systems implementing HL7 specifications have an unambiguous understanding of the code sources and code value domains they are using.

'''V3 Messaging'''

The HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of Secure Text messages (called ''interactions'') to support all healthcare workflows.

HL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax, as shown in this example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Spronk|editor-first=René|title=HL7 Message examples: version 2 and version 3|url=http://www.ringholm.de/docs/04300_en.htm|work=Ringholm|publisher=Ringholm bv|date=16 November 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2.2.1}}

===Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)===
{{main|Clinical Document Architecture}}

The HL7 [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The CDA Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwa6DDB4jY8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard was jointly published with ISO as ISO/HL7 27932.

===Continuity of Care Document (CCD)===
{{main|Continuity of Care Document}}
CCD is a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.

===Structured Product Labeling (SPL)===
{{main|Structured Product Labeling}}

SPL describes the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3.

===CCOW===
{{main|CCOW}}
[[CCOW]], or "Clinical Context Object Workgroup," is a standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to share user context and patient context in real-time, and at the user-interface level.  CCOW implementations typically require a CCOW vault system to manage user security between applications.

==Other standards and methods==

===Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)===
{{main|Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources}}
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a draft standard from [[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] designed to be easier to implement, more open and more extensible than version 2.x or version 3.  It leverages a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a [[HTTP]]-based [[RESTful]]  protocol, [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] for user interface integration, a choice of [[JSON]] or [[XML]] for data representation, [[OAuth]] for authorization and [[ATOM]] for query results.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news

 | title=Setting Healthcare Interop On Fire
 | work=[[Forbes]]

 | date=2014-03-30
 | accessdate=2014-11-22 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services Aware Interoperability Framework===
{{main|HL7 Services Aware Interoperability Framework}}

The HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency.

SAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach.

SAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of other standards. SAIF is an architecture for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management.

=== Arden syntax ===
{{main|Arden syntax}}
The [[Arden syntax]] is a language for encoding medical knowledge. [[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] adopted and oversees the standard beginning with Arden syntax 2.0. These [[Medical logic module|Medical Logic Modules]] ([[Medical logic module|MLM]]s) are used in the clinical setting as they can contain sufficient knowledge to make single medical decisions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  They can produce alerts, diagnoses, and interpretations along with quality assurance function and administrative support.  An [[Medical logic module|MLM]] must run on a computer that meets the minimum system requirements and has the correct program installed.  Then, the MLM can give advice for when and where it is needed.

===MLLP===
A large portion of HL7 messaging is transported by Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP), also known as Lower Layer Protocol (LLP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLP - Lower Layer Protocol|url=http://www.interfaceware.com/llp.html|publisher=iNTERFACEWARE}}&lt;/ref&gt; For transmitting via TCP/IP, header and trailer characters are added to the message to identify the beginning and ending of the message because TCP/IP is a continuous stream of bytes. Hybrid Lower Layer Protocol (HLLP) is a variation of MLLP that includes a checksum to help verify message integrity. Amongst other software vendors, MLLP is supported by Microsoft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLLP Receive and Send Components|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee409260%28BTS.10%29.aspx|publisher=[[MSDN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oracle Application Server Integration B2B User's Guide, Supported Protocols|url=http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B14099_19/integrate.1012/b19370/supp_protos.htm#BACIFDJG|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cleo (company)|Cleo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Secure Managed File Transfer Protocol is Right for You?|url=https://www.cleo.com/solutions/compare-protocols/|publisher=[[Cleo (company)|Cleo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Captain Homer Washington Hedge''' (Sept 29, 1863, Norwich CT – Sept 10, 1909) was a wealthy advertising executive in New York City. He helped to found both the Automobile Club of America (currently known as the  [[American Automobile Association]]) and the [[Aero Club of America]]. He was an avid [[balloonist]] and competed in the sport of balloon racing.

==Biography==
At the age of 25, in 1888, Hedge joined the First Signal Corp. of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in New York City. He worked out of their recruiting office until 1898. By the end of this period, he had risen to the rank of Captain. He was referred to as "Captain" for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Annual report of the Adjutant-General of the State of New York for the Year 1893 | publisher = James B. Lyon | location = Albany | year = 1894 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-8CgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | accessdate = 2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hedge managed the Manhattan offices of Pettingill &amp; Company, a large New York advertising agency. In April 1904, he purchased the New York offices, and it became the Homer W. Hedge Company. At the time, this was one of the largest advertising agencies in the U.S. Their customers included Equitable Life Insurance, the [[Electric Vehicle Company]], and the [[Remington Arms Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = With Ample Capital | journal= Printers' Ink |year = 1904 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GPI1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8 | accessdate = 2012-03-12 | page = 8 | volume = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 1899, a group of gentlemen auto racers met at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan and founded the [[Automobile Club of America]], an organization that became the [[American Automobile Association]] . At that meeting, Homer W. Hedge was elected secretary, a post he retained for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Automobile Club Formed | date=17 October 1899 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/10/17/117931914.pdf | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Hedge became Founder and first President of the [[Aero Club of America]].

Hedge was the author of a book on ballooning, The American Aeronaut (1907).

'''Horace Cyril Batchelor''' (22 January 1898&amp;nbsp;– 8 January 1977) was an English gambling advertiser. He was best known during the 1950s and 1960s as an advertiser on [[Radio Luxembourg]]. He advertised a way to win money by predicting the results of football matches, sponsoring programmes on the station. His spelling out of [[Keynsham]], a town in western England where he operated, made it famous.

==The "Famous Infra-Draw Method"==
Batchelor sponsored programmes on Radio Luxembourg to promote his "Famous Infra-Draw Method", a system that he claimed increased the chances of winning large sums on the [[football pools]]. Before the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] started in 1994, the "Pools" was the only way to win large sums for a small stake. Listeners were asked to submit their stakes to Batchelor, who then determined how the stake was placed. He was paid only if the bet won. Infra-draw was thus not dependent on his predictive talent for its financial success.&lt;ref name="whirligig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whirligig-tv.co.uk/tv/memories/snippets/snippets16.htm|title=Horace Batchelor's Infra-draw method|publisher=Whirligig Snippets|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising on Radio Luxembourg==
Radio Luxembourg was a music station broadcasting to Britain from Luxembourg as a way to circumvent the BBC's national monopoly and the policy in the United Kingdom of no broadcast advertising. The station played pop music promoted by record companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1223531,00.html|title=The first teenage dream|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertisers were allowed to buy air time in units of 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="whirligig"/&gt; Batchelor's programme usually featured the [[Deep River Boys]], a [[Gospel music|gospel]]/barbershop group seemingly performing live.  He voiced his own advertisements, inviting listeners to write for details of his "Famous Infra-Draw Method for the  Treble Chance" that he promised was able to predict the drawn games on which winnings depended.

The address was always read as "Horace Batchelor, Department One, Keynsham, spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M, Keynsham, Bristol". Batchelor needed to carefully spell [[Keynsham]] out loud for his listeners (and prospective clients), as the town's name is pronounced ''CANE-sham'', and its spelling is not obvious from the way that it is pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gertlushonline.co.uk/horace-batchelor-from-keynsham.html |title=Horace Batchelor of Keynsham |publisher=Gertlush Online |accessdate=2 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725015143/http://www.gertlushonline.co.uk/horace-batchelor-from-keynsham.html |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Batchelor's slow, very deliberate spelling and repeated mentions of Keynsham on his programme led to the town's name becoming something of an in-joke for British people, and was why the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] named an album ''[[Keynsham (album)|Keynsham]]''.  The Bonzos referenced Batchelor on other occasions as well:  Batchelor's voice is imitated at the start of the Bonzos' song "You Done My Brain In", saying "I have personally won over..."; and his is one of the names listed as a spoof band member in ''[[The Intro and the Outro]]'', the opening track on the second side of the album ''[[Gorilla (Bonzo Dog album)|Gorilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/Doing-Keynsham-pools/article-764050-detail/article.html|title=Doing the Keynsham pools|work=Bath Chronicle|publisher=This is Bath|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Batchelor was a watercolour painter of many subjects. His studio was the entertainment room at the side of a detached house, a sparsely furnished, bow-windowed room with cocktail bar and steel shutters. He spent his last years mainly in one small room equipped with a [[chaise longue]] and two televisions, one colour, the other monochrome, rented from [[Granada TV Rental]] at [[Knowle, Bristol]]. His housekeeper communicated with visitors and tradesmen. His son Richard took over the business of results prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of a Electronics engineer.Title: "Life after Bath Tech". Private publication 2001. Online copy of entry at [[City of Bath Technical School]] website archive. Author F.E.Williams.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death in 1977, ''[[The Times]]'' published his [[Will (law)|will]] on 3 March of that year, showing he left just under £150,000.

==Play==
''An Audience with Horace Batchelor'' by playwright Kevin Cattell and starring Roland Oliver played at Tobacco Factory Theatres in July/August 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Theatre-Bristol-Audience-Horace-Batchelor-King/story-19574725-detail/story.html|date=26 July 2013|title=Theatre in Bristol - An Audience with Horace Batchelor: King of Keynsham at The Brewery, North St, Ashton, July 30-August 10|accessdate=16 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525035552/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Theatre-Bristol-Audience-Horace-Batchelor-King/story-19574725-detail/story.html|archivedate=25 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived for the Salisbury Playhouse in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Audience with Horace Batchelor: King of Keynsham|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/salisbury-theatre/shows/an-audience-with-horace-batchelor-king-of-keynsham_30719/|publisher=What's On Stage|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2517">In computing, '''hyperscale''' is the ability of an architecture to scale appropriately as increased demand is added to the system.

Hyperscale computing is necessary in order to build a robust and scalable [[Cloud Computing|cloud]], [[Big Data|big data]], [[MapReduce|map reduce]], or [[Clustered file system|distributed storage]] system and is often associated with the infrastructure required to run large distributed sites such as [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Rich|title=A Hyper-Scale Cloud Data Center, Seen From the Clouds|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/11/06/facebook-lulea-aerial-view/|publisher=Data Center Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Google]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Data Centers|url=https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/gallery/#/|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Microsoft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Expands Its Hyperscale Cloud Footprint|url=http://www.eweek.com/cloud/microsoft-expands-its-hyperscale-cloud-footprint.html|publisher=eweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Furrier|first=John|title=Fusion-io Launched New Hyperscale Flash Product to Scale Data Centers for Enterprises, Not Just Facebook|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/01/17/fusion-io-launched-new-hyperscale-flash-product-to-scale-data-centers-for-enterprises-not-just-facebook/|publisher=Silicon Angle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|title=Definition: Hyperscale Computing|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/hyperscale-computing|publisher=TechTarget}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/data-mgmt|title=Data Management {{!}} Oracle Cloud|website=cloud.oracle.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1484">'''Literary activism''' is a form of protest and critique aimed at [[corporate publishing]] houses and the literary fiction/nonfiction that they publish. The progenitors of literary [[activism]] are the members of the [[Underground Literary Alliance]]. This group of writers is notorious for its protests, which have included making formal complaints against [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] grants given to already-wealthy authors, crashing New York literary readings, and maintaining a website which reports weekly on the perceived [[corruption]] and lack of integrity of the current literary world.

Acts of literary activism can also include editing and bringing out writers' work in online and print journals and through book publishers, reading and reviewing that work, writing essays about it, teaching it, talking it up, urging others to launch journals and indies presses, running reading series, laboring in arts administration, coordination innovative writing conferences, launching local writing groups, posting about authors and texts they love on their blogs or via other social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Olsen|Olsen, Lance]] (2012).

Pancit Canton, the first dry stir-fry pouched noodles in the Philippine market. This was then followed in 1995 by Lucky Me! Supreme in La Paz Batchoy flavor, marketed as the first Filipino dish-flavored no-cook cup noodles, and Lucky Me! Special in 2009, which consists of noodles based on local and international flavors such as [[Lomi]] (egg noodles in seafood flavor), [[Jjamppong]] (spicy Korean noodles), Curly Spaghetti, Baked Mac, and Mac &amp; Cheez.

The '''National LGBT Chamber of Commerce''' (NGLCC) is a U.S. [[not-for-profit]] [[advocacy group]] that aims to expand the economic opportunities and advancement of the [[LGBT]] business community. Its headquarters are in [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  NGLCC is the exclusive certifying body for LGBT-owned businesses known as LGBT Business Enterprises (LGBTBEs), and advocates for LGBT business inclusion in corporate and government [[supplier diversity]] programs. In October 2017, the organization changed its name from the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Chamber of Commerce to National LGBT Chamber of Commerce to better reflect the entire LGBT business community it serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/18/nglcc-changes-name-national-lgbt-chamber-commerce/|title=NGLCC changes name to National LGBT Chamber of Commerce|date=2017-11-18|work=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The NGLCC  was co-founded in 2002 by [[Justin G. Nelson]] and [[Chance Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nglcc.org/who-we-are/nglcc-story|title=NGLCC {{!}} NGLCC Story {{!}} nglcc.org|website=nglcc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson has served as president since the NGLCC was founded, and Mitchell has served as CEO over the same period. The organization celebrated its 15th anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/07/26/nglcc-celebrates-15-years-supporting-lgbt-businesses/|title=NGLCC celebrates 15 years of supporting LGBT businesses|date=2017-07-26|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017.

Their goal was to create an organization that could support LGBT business owners and showcase the diversity of talent in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. NGLCC provides direct links between businesses, corporate partners, government organizations and other community groups that support LGBT economic opportunity.

In early 2004, NGLCC created a best-in-class diversity certification program, making the organization the exclusive national third-party certifying body for LGBT-owned businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/lgbt-certified-suppliers-jump-as-big-companies-seek-new-sources|title=LGBT-Certified Suppliers Jump as Big Companies Seek New Sources|date=2017-01-18|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGLCC has a network of more than 50 local, state, and international affiliate LGBT chambers of commerce,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nglcc.org/affiliate-chambers|title=NGLCC {{!}} Affiliate Chambers {{!}} nglcc.org|website=nglcc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves to represent their economic interests and opportunities.

The NGLCC offices employ approximately 15 full-time staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nglcc.org/who-we-are/founders-and-team-nglcc|title=NGLCC {{!}} Founders and Team NGLCC {{!}} nglcc.org|website=nglcc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NGLCC runs an internship and fellowship program to support operations.

In 2017 NGLCC released its first proprietary data, the ''"[http://www.nglcc.org/report America's LGBT Economy Report]."''  Among the findings reported: a typical LGBT business has been in business, on average, for more than 12 years and that LGBT businesses contribute more than $1.7 trillion to the U.S. economy and have created more than 33,000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2017/01/23/theres-green-in-being-gay-lgbt-businesses-contribute-1-7-trillion-to-the-u-s-economy/|title=There’s green in being gay: LGBT businesses contribute $1.7 trillion to the U.S. economy|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

=== LGBT Business Enterprise (LGBTBE) Certification ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nglcc.org/what-we-do/diversity-inclusion|title=NGLCC {{!}} Diversity &amp; Inclusion  {{!}} nglcc.org|website=www.nglcc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2004, the NGLCC has offered certification to businesses owned by [[LGBT]] people. This certification is intended to help corporate and government procurement teams source from LGBT-owned products and services, also known as [[supplier diversity]]. As of August 2017, NGLCC has certified 983 businesses across the United State. Certification in a multi-step process involving an application and supporting documents, a site visit, and final approval before a national certification committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianhonigman/2015/08/09/certified-lgbt-owned-business/#1b3878fd7297|title=The Benefits And Process Of Becoming A Certified LGBT-Owned Business|last=Honigman|first=Brian|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007 the NGLCC signed a memorandum of understanding with the [[Women's Business Enterprise National Council]] to provide opportunities for dual-certification as both a women-owned, and lesbian, bisexual or transgender-owned, business. In 2011 the [[Human Rights Campaign|Human Rights Campaign (HRC)]] began including active sourcing of LGBT certified businesses as part of the [[Corporate Equality Index]], a national directory of gay-friendly workplaces. In 2017, HRC further expanded the index criteria to require LGBT-inclusion in supplier diversity programs as a stand-alone scored metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nglcc.org/cei|title=NGLCC {{!}} CEI {{!}} nglcc.org|website=www.nglcc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-owned-businesses-now-have-seat-billion-dollar-table-n793571|title=LGBTQ-owned businesses now have a seat at 'Billion Dollar' table|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Billion Dollar Roundtable will now include NGLCC certified LGBTBEs as a category of diverse vendors counted by corporations spending a billion dollars or more on procurement with diversity-owned firms. The Billion Dollar Roundtable was created in 2001 to recognize and celebrate corporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority and woman-owned suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billiondollarroundtable.org|title=Billion Dollar Roundtable - Supplier Diversity|website=Billion Dollar Roundtable - Supplier Diversity|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has previously been held in cities including [[Washington, DC]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Seattle]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] (several times), [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Fort Lauderdale]] and [[Palm Springs]].  Over 1,200 people attended the 15h Anniversary 2017 NGLCC Conference in Las Vegas, NV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/largest-lgbt-community-business-event-kicks-off-in-las-vegas/|title=Largest LGBT community business event kicks off in Las Vegas|date=2017-08-02|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NGLCC-affiliated chambers==
The NGLCC works with more than 50 local, state and international chambers. In 2011, the NGLCC appointed a full-time position to oversee relations with affiliated chambers.&lt;ref&gt;http://nglcc.org/BIZ/community/NewLeadershipforAffiliateRelationsandCCBO&lt;/ref&gt; The move is considered mutually beneficial to both local chambers and the national chamber.

The NGLCC stopped national membership options in 2011, and all membership is now routed through affiliated chambers. Membership of an affiliated chamber infers membership of the NGLCC. Benefits for membership include a waiver of the fee required for supplier diversity certification. NGLCC corporate partners also offer benefits to members of affiliated chambers.&lt;ref&gt;http://nglcc.org/membership/memberoffers&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between affiliated chambers, the NGLCC, and the LGBT business community are overseen by the Affiliate Chamber Council (ACC).

[[File:NGLCC NYSE.jpg|thumb|NGLCC ring [[NYSE]] Closing Bell]]
The NGLCC became the first LGBT organization to ring the [[New York Stock Exchange]] [[Closing Bell]] on June 20, 2005. It rang the bell again on June 5, 2009 and January 10, 2011.

In 2010 the NGLCC began international work [[#International work|(see above)]], eventually developing into NGLCC Global in 2013.

In November 2011 the NGLCC unveiled a new Supplier Innovation Center covering a second floor in the building that houses their offices. The Supplier Innovation Center is designed to facilitate training opportunities and develop best practice for small businesses, and provide a space for local start-ups to operate. The NGLCC is offering scholarships to LGBT business owners in partnership with the [[Tuck School of Business]] at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], to be held at the Supplier Innovation Center.

{{Tort law}}
'''Negligence in employment''' encompasses several causes of action in [[tort law]] that arise where an [[employer]] is held liable for the [[tortious]] acts of an [[employee]] because that employer was [[Negligence|negligent]] in providing the employee with the ability to engage in a particular act. Four basic causes of action may arise from such a scenario: '''negligent hiring''', '''negligent retention''', '''negligent supervision''' and '''negligent training'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Kathryn|last2=Gardner|first2=Susan|title=Looking for Dr. Jekyll but hiring Mr. Hyde: Preventing negligent hiring, supervision, retention, and training|journal=Hospital Topics|date=2000|volume=78|pages=14-22|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00185860009596542?journalCode=vhos20|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=When is an Employer Liable for an Employee's Motor Vehicle Accident|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/car-accidents/employer-liability.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=21 September 2017|date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While negligence in employment may overlap with [[negligent entrustment]] and [[vicarious liability]], the concepts are distinct grounds of liability.

==Negligence==
As with all [[negligence]] claims, the claimant must prove four elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galligan|first1=Thomas C.|title=A Primer on the Patterns of Negligence|journal=Louisiana Law Review|date=1992|volume=53|page=1509|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/louilr53&amp;div=59&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*That the defendant (in this case, the employer) owed them a [[duty of care]];
*That this duty was breached;
*That the claimant was injured as a result of the breach;&lt;ref name=F&amp;J&gt;Feliu &amp; Johnson, ''Negligence in Employment Law'' {{ISBN|1-57018-263-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57018-263-1}} (2002) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Causation (law)]]; [[Causation in English law]]) and
*The injury to the plaintiff was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach.&lt;ref name=F&amp;J/&gt;

In order for such a duty to exist, the injury to the claimant must be "reasonably foreseeable",&lt;ref&gt;see [[Negligence]]; [[Donoghue v Stevenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, for example, that the type of employment must be one in which an unfit employee could cause harm of the type which occurred,&lt;ref name=F&amp;J/&gt; and the claimant is the type of person to whom such harm would be a "reasonably foreseeable consequence".&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[The Wagon Mound (No 2)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negligent hiring==
'''Negligent hiring''' may be found where the employee (the tortfeasor) had a reputation or record that showed his/her propensity to misuse the kind of authority given by the employer, and this record would have been easily discoverable by the employer, had the employer exercised 'due diligence'. For example, a victim of [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace may have a cause of action for negligent hiring on the part of her employer if she can show that the employer was aware of the harasser's termination from a previous position for the same behaviour.

===Negligent hiring preventive measures===
In the sexual harassment example described above, the employer may be held liable for negligent hiring if the harasser had a previous history of harassment. This is because an employer has an obligation to its employees and others who will come in contact with them to provide a safe and productive working environment.

One preventive measure for negligent hiring is to perform a reasonable investigation on potential employees. This may include conducting interviews, verifying work and educational histories, checking references and conducting a [[background check]] on all applicants who have accepted an offer of conditional hire, and if an adverse assessment is found, to deny employment to such an applicant.

Note that simply conducting a criminal background check on an applicant may not be a sufficient investigation. In [[Minnesota]], for example, such a check was determined to be insufficient by the court in ''Ponticas v. K.M.S. Investments,'' 331 N.W.2d 907 ([[Minnesota Supreme Court|Minn.]] 1983). This will not guarantee the employer will not be held liable, but it will show that the employer used a diligent search to screen potential harassers from the workplace, and will assist the employer in demonstrating that it took reasonable care in hiring.
It is important to also note that, in the [[United States]], background checks for job applicants are subject to the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Credit Reporting Act|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2b1fab8de5438fc52f2a326fc6592874&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title16/16CIsubchapF.tpl|website=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an adverse assessment is found in an employment screen, the applicant has the right to dispute the report.

==Negligent retention, supervision, and training==
'''Negligent retention''' occurs where a party failed to remove an employee from a position of authority or responsibility after it became apparent that the employee was in fact misusing that authority or responsibility in a way that posed a danger to others.

Negligent supervision is closely related, as it occurs where a party fails to reasonably monitor or control the actions of an employee. A variation of negligent retention or supervision is negligent training, which arises where the employer's training of the employee fails to prevent the employee from engaging in the acts that injure the claimant, or fails to remediate a pattern of behaviour which leads to an injury. Suits for negligent retention often plead negligent supervision or training as an alternate theory, as the employer who knows of an employee's improper conduct should either terminate that employee, or take steps to penalise that conduct and/or train the employee not to engage in that conduct.

==Related doctrines==

===Negligent entrustment compared===
[[Negligent entrustment]] arises where the entrustor is held liable for [[negligence]] because they negligently provided the entrustee with a dangerous instrument, and the entrusted party caused injury to a third party with that instrument. 
Where such a claim is brought against an [[employer]], the employer will be held liable if the entrustee's record was known, or would have been easily discoverable, to the employer. For example, if a [[bus]] company hires a driver who has a record of reckless driving, of which the company could have learned through a search of publicly available records, the company would be liable for the negligent entrustment of the bus to that driver, should the driver cause an accident.

Negligent entrustment differs from negligent hiring, retention, supervision, and training in two key respects. 
* First, negligent hiring and the related torts require the employment itself of the tortfeasor causing the injury, whereas a party can be held liable for negligent entrustment to any person.
* Second, an employer can be found liable for negligent hiring even without provision of any dangerous instrument to the employee. However, where an employer hires an unqualified person to engage in the use of a dangerous instrumentality, as in the above example with the bus driver, the employer may be liable for '''both''' negligent entrustment and hiring.

===Vicarious liability compared===
[[Vicarious liability]] is a separate theory of liability, which provides that an employer is liable for the torts of an employee under an [[agency (law)|agency]] theory, even if the employer did nothing wrong. The principle is that the acts of an agent of the company are assumed, by law, to be the acts of the company itself, provided the tortfeasor was acting within the course of his employment.

By contrast, each of the above negligence theories requires proof of actual negligence on part of the employer ''before'' the injury occurred, for example when the employee was first hired.

}}'''NextWorth''' is an electronics trade-in and recycling service. Users of the service exchange used electronics for cash or discounts on newer models. NextWorth was founded by business students at [[Babson College]] in 2005. It started as a commission-based service to help businesses setup online auctions for their used items, then changed its business model to focus on electronics trade-ins in 2006. As of late 2012, NextWorth was one of the best-known and largest electronics trade-in and recycling services in the United States, although it handles only a small percentage of total trade-in traffic&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Dominguez|newspaper=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/iphone-4s-new-drops-article-1.1157207|date=September 11, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2013|title=Get the most for your iPhone 4s – before the new one drops}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iPad resales surge over 700%|first=Quentin|last=Fottrell|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ipad-resales-surge-over-700-2012-10-24|publisher=MarketWatch|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
NextWorth was founded by David Chen, Andrew Walsh and Scott Richardson while they were students at [[Babson College]]. The company was selected for Babson College's 2005 Business Hatcheries program, which provides free resources to student-led startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student tech companies selected by Babson hatcheting for fall term|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2005/10/student-tech-companies-selected-by-babson.html?page=all|accessdate=August 13, 2013|date=October 24, 2005|newspaper=Mass High Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; NextWorth Inc. began operations the following year. It was originally a service that helped businesses and non-profits prepare luxury items for online auctions in exchange for a 20-33 percent commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Babson spinout aims to ease online auctioning setup|newspaper=Mass High Tech|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2006/01/babson-spinout-aims-to-ease-online-auctioning.html?page=all|first=Efrain|last=Viscarolasaga|date=January 16, 2006|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2006, NextWorth changed its business model and services to focus on electronics trade-ins.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; In January 2007, NextWorth raised $1.5 million in its first round of funding.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite news|title=New funding, biz plan puts NextWroth in next phase|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2007/04/new-funding-biz-plan-puts-nextworth-in-next.html|newspaper=Mass High Tech|first=Efrain|last=Viscarolasaga|date=April 13, 2007|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pricing ==
NextWorth sets its prices through an algorithm developed by MBA students and a professor at Babson College.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-09-02/whats-hot-used-apple-iphonesbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=What's Hot: Used Apple iPhones: After the iPhone 3G launch, consumers want the original, hackable iPhone, and vendors are springing up to sell them—for a premium|author=Kharif, Olga|publisher=Bloomberg Business|work=Consumer Electronics|date=2008-09-02|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers can obtain better prices by reselling their electronics directly through services like [[eBay]] or [[Craigslist]],&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; but services like NextWorth are more convenient and have predictable pricing.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite news|title=Want to sell your old iPhone?

According to [[About.com]], how fair the seller is in describing the condition of the product "will determine whether your experience with NextWorth is satisfying or not." Some sellers get higher or lower prices than they were originally quoted, depending on how NextWorth's assessment of the product's condition compares to the seller's description.&lt;ref name="thirteen" /&gt;

NextWorth has experienced spikes in trade-in activity from sellers when newer models are announced, such as when the iPad 2 was announced in March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Christina|last=Warren|publisher=Mashable|title=iPad trade-in economy explodes|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/products/2011-03-04-ipad-2-trade-in_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=March 4, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iPad 2 prices fall with next model looming|newspaper=USA Today|first=Roger|last=Yu|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-02-28/ipad-discount/53292722/1|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Next iPad’s Nearly Here: Are You Dumping Your iPad 2?|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/02/29/the-next-ipads-nearly-here-are-you-dumping-your-ipad-2/|newspaper=TIME|first=Matt|last=Peckham|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when the iPhone 5 was announced in September 2012&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=USA Today|title=More iPhone owners looking to sell before possible iPhone 5|first=Roger|last=Yu|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/story/2012-09-09/apple-phone-resale/57691616/1|date=September 11, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 24, 2012|first=Darrell|last=Etherington|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/gadget-swapping-site-sees-1000-spike-in-ipad-trade-in-volume-post-apple-event/|publisher=TechCrunch|title=Gadget-swapping site sees 1,000% spike in iPad trade-in volume post-apple event}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=NBC News|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/where-trade-your-old-iphone-sooner-better-994141|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2013|title=Where to trade in your old iPhone and sooner is better|first=Suzanne|last=Choney}}&lt;/ref&gt; These  announcements also caused the trade-in price of older models to decrease, due to over-supply.&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/08/12/when-is-the-best-time-to-sell-your-old-iphone-probably-right-now/|first=Kevin|last=Fitchard|title=When is the best time to sell your old iPhone?

:''See also [[Oxford Pro Musica Singers]].''

The practical 'One Page Management System' (OPMS) has evolved to enable 'people-at-large' and experts design and implement effective systems of all kinds.

GS Chandy invented ‘One Page Management System’ (OPMS) sometime in 1981-82, based on the seminal contributions to systems science by the late John John N. Warfield - and has been developing it every since.

OPMS springs naturally from Interactive Management (IM), the powerful system methodologies that derive from Professor [[John N. Warfield]]’s “structural approach to system design”.

The application of the method also has been carried forward and codified by other entrepreneurial practitioners in worldwide applications, and an illustration of the scope of penetration of the method has recently been summarized &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harnessingcollectivewisdom.com Harness Collective Wisdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alexander Christakis]], a long-standing collaborator of Dr. [[John N. Warfield]].

Interactive Management consists of tools to:
* Help users 'generate ideas' – through systematically developed methods of brainstorming;
* ‘Structure’ (or organize) ideas generated as needed for effective resolution of problems identified.

OPMS now enables all of the above to be done by 'people-at-large' as well as by experts to create and implement truly usable systems of all kinds - individual, organisational or societal.

In brief, OPMS enables individual and group users to:

1.  Choose an appropriate 'Mission' depending on problem-situation confronted;

2.   Identify the issue or problem confronted –  this naturally provides a simple 'Mission statement';

3.  *Integrate* all the good ideas available to tackle the problem or issue at hand – with a view to enable accomplishment of the chosen Mission.  (Integrating 'good ideas' includes getting rid of the bad ideas that are always cluttering up the 'mindspace' – think about it and this will be obvious to you).

That's it!

And that's what the OPMS all about!

Just 'integrating' your available good ideas (AND getting rid of your bad ideas)!!

[Of course, it often is quite a job to decide which are the 'good' ideas and which are the 'bad' ideas – but OPMS helps users arrive at sound decisions, via effective debate between stakeholders to the chosen issue/Mission].

The structuring tools of OPMS  have developed from the powerful 'systems modeling' tools invented by Warfield in a three-decade long study of “complexity in systems and how to enable people to cope with it” - made easy to use for the 'people-at-large'.

These tools are:
* Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM); and
* Field Representation &amp; Profiling Method (FRP).
(Now rendered understandable by any high-school student within a couple of hours, and practically applicable by him/her/them to issues of practical concern within a couple of weeks [at most]).

More information about the OPMS can be sent if desired as attachments to an email message if you'll send an inquiry to gs_chandy_AT_yahoo.com - this information will include:

-- brief description of the OPMS; 
-- 'provenance'; 
-- 'Missions' to which OPMS has been successfully employed (and also some Missions where OPMS has not been successful yet; 
-- a sizable listing of possible Missions); 
-- an illustration of the kind of a systems model (and Interpretive Structural Model [ISM]), which can readily be developed into Action Planning along with all needed subsystems to help accomplish any chosen Mission.

(Limited) guidance can also be provided to help interested users initiate Action Planning on any chosen Mission - and copies of the prototype OPMS software would be freely provided - no fees or charges of any kind whatsoever.

'''''Oil Barons''''' is both a strategy and simulation-type, [[turn-based game]], published by [[Epyx]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]]. It was released for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[MS-DOS]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/oil-barons ''Oil Barons''] from [[MobyGames]] (retrieved on November 12, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the rarest of all Epyx games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=4307 ''Oil Barons''] from [[Home of the Underdogs]] (retrieved on November 12, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oil Barons'' represents an unusual fusion between a [[Personal computer game|computer game]] and a [[board game]], in that it included a game board consisting of a 50 X 40 square grid, as well as numerous individual game tokens, used to denote the significance of various grid locations (which corresponded to various [[terrain]]-specific locations within the game). ''Oil Barons'' was thus much like a numerically complex board game, in which the computer kept track of the numerous variables. The game could be played in any one of several modes, and with from one to eight players. Unfortunately, the fact this game has been out-of-print since the mid-1980s, and thus very few people today have an ''Oil Barons'' game board and tokens (particularly in light of the fact that only a very small number of copies were sold when it was in publication), potentially limits the game's appeal in contemporary times.

On 26 December 2014, the [[Internet Archive]] published the game as a [[DOSBox]] game.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oil_Barons_1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Oil Barons'' received mixed reviews. Although it was awarded a Certificate of Merit in the category of "1984 Best Multi-Player Video Game/Computer Game" at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} ''[[Ahoy!]]'' criticized the pace of the game, noting that each player had to "sit at the computer for several minutes. Other players can use this time to strategize, but things can get pretty slow. ''Oil Barons'', for all its complexity, may not keep you entertained while you are waiting".&lt;ref name="herring198409"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_09_1984-09_Ion_International_US#page/n33/mode/2upst | title=Oil Barons | work=Ahoy! | date=September 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Herring, Richard | pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir James Reginald Conyers''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (3 September 1879 – 26 July 1948), known as '''Reggie Conyers''' during his early life, was a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] lawyer, politician, and [[cricket]]er. Born in [[Pembroke Parish]], Bermuda, Conyers was a keen member of the Hamilton Cricket Club, and toured the United States with the club in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/17/Hamilton_Cricket_Club_in_United_States_of_America_1905.html Hamilton Cricket Club in United States of America 1905] – CricketArchive.

In the final match of the tour, against [[Jamaica cricket team|Jamaica]] at [[Melbourne Park, Kingston|Melbourne Park]], Conyers scored 149 runs opening Philadelphia's batting, his highest [[first-class cricket|first-class]] score and only first-class [[Century (cricket)|century]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7777.html Jamaica v Gentlemen of Philadelphia], Gentlemen of Philadelphia in Jamaica 1908/09 – CricketArchive.

After the conclusion of the [[First World War]], Conyers established a law firm based in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], and in 1928 merged his firm with that of Nicholas Dill and James Pearman, forming the law firm of [[Conyers Dill &amp; Pearman]]. Conyers was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34238|date=1 January 1936|page=13|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[knight bachelor]] in 1944, for "services to Bermuda".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36544|date=8 June 1944|page=2566|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] from the 1930s, and served for a period of time as [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Bermuda|Speaker]].

'''Renato de Albuquerque''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[civil engineer]] and [[entrepreneur]] in the [[construction]] and [[real state]] businesses. He was the founder of a pioneering construction firm, [[Albuquerque &amp; Takaoka]] in 1951 together with his fellow [[architect]] and friend [[Yojiro Takaoka]].

==Political career==
===Cabinet Minister===
He joined the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] of [[Jun'ichirō Koizumi]] in 2003 as Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications. On 31 October 2005, he became Minister for Foreign Affairs. There has been some speculation that his position in the Cabinet was due to his membership in the Kōno Group, an LDP caucus led by pro-Chinese lawmaker [[Yōhei Kōno]]: by appointing Asō as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Koizumi may have been attempting to "rein in" Kōno's statements critical of Japanese foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hideo Hamada, [http://www.janjan.jp/kokkai_watch/0511/0511014602/1.php?PHPSESSID=f82b662b2b519ee16fdaf8d6dc44f89b "The Diet Now: Containment and Division"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Janjan.jp, 1 November 2005. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidate for the LDP Leadership===
Asō was one of the final candidates to replace Koizumi as prime minister in 2006, but lost the internal party election to [[Shinzō Abe]] by a wide margin. Both Abe and Asō are conservative on foreign policy issues and have taken confrontational stances towards some [[East Asia]]n nations, particularly [[North Korea]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[People's Republic of China]]. Abe was considered a more "moderate" politician than the more "hard-line" Asō, and led Asō in opinion polling within Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cominganarchy.com/archives/2005/11/01/hardline-hawk-or-unapologetic-bigot "Hardline Hawk or Unapologetic Bigot?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117130310/http://www.cominganarchy.com/archives/2005/11/01/hardline-hawk-or-unapologetic-bigot/ |date=17 January 2006 }}, ''Coming Anarchy'', 1 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Asō's views on multilateralism are suggested in a 2006 speech, "Arc of Freedom and Prosperity: Japan's Expanding Diplomatic Horizons".&lt;ref&gt;Calder, Kent E. and Francis Fukuyama.

Asō acknowledged that he would most likely lose to Fukuda, but said that he wanted to run so that there would be an open election, saying that otherwise LDP would face criticism for making its choice "through back-room deals".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/16/asia/AS-POL-Japan-Politics.php "Former FM Aso acknowledges probable defeat in Japan's leadership race"], from The Associated Press on ''International Herald Tribune'', 16 September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013093732/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/16/asia/AS-POL-Japan-Politics.php |date=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election, 2007|President election]], held on 23 September, Fukuda defeated Asō, receiving 330 votes against 197 votes for Asō.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voanews.com/english/2007-09-23-voa5.cfm "Fukuda Chosen to Replace Abe as Japan's Prime Minister"], ''VOANews.com'', 23 September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820033055/http://voanews.com/english/2007-09-23-voa5.cfm |date=20 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120525183219/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20070923dy01.htm "Fukuda wins LDP race / Will follow in footsteps of father as prime minister"], ''The Daily Yomiuri'', 23 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2008, Fukuda appointed Asō as Secretary-General of LDP, a move that solidified Asō's position as the number two man in the party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20081016032320/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080802TDY01303.htm "Fukuda overhauls Cabinet / LDP executive shakeup also elevates Aso to party No. 2"], The Yomiuri Shimbun, 2 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime Minister of Japan===
Unexpectedly on 1 September 2008, Fukuda announced his resignation as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2008/09/01/20080901p2a00m0na020000c.html "Fukuda announces resignation as prime minister of Japan"]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}, ''The Mainichi Daily News'', The Mainichi, 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Five LDP members including Asō ran for new party President to succeed Fukuda. On 21 September, one day before votes of Diet party members, Asō reportedly told a crowd of supporters outside Tokyo: "The greatest concern right now is the economy." "America is facing a financial crisis ... we must not allow that to bring us down as well."&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;Joseph Coleman, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hlQO-kyvIEyrc0I90V5l0LFN7JTwD93BK79G0 "Japan ruling party turns to brash Aso"], The Associated Press, 22 September 2008. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally on 22 September, Asō did win. He was elected as President of LDP with 351 of 525 votes (217 from 384 Diet party members, 134 from 47 prefecture branches); [[Kaoru Yosano]], [[Yuriko Koike]], [[Nobuteru Ishihara]], [[Shigeru Ishiba]] got 66, 46, 37, 25 votes respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/jimin/ayumi/index.html "党のあゆみ・総裁選挙"], Liberal Democratic Party. {{ja icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029003431/http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/jimin/ayumi/index.html |date=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/select/opinion/closeup/news/20080923ddn003010032000c.html クローズアップ２００８：自民新総裁に麻生氏　総選挙へ切り札] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924135013/http://mainichi.jp/select/opinion/closeup/news/20080923ddn003010032000c.html |date=24 September 2008 }}, ''毎日新聞'': Osaka – Evening edition, The Mainichi, 23 September 2008. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chosen&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqszq8agglGSFXJ4S7Nv0OsSe1_A "Conservative Aso chosen as Japan PM"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925103044/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqszq8agglGSFXJ4S7Nv0OsSe1_A |date=25 September 2008 }}, AFP, 22 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later on 24 September, Asō was designated by the Diet as Prime Minister, and was formally appointed to the office by the Emperor on that night. In the House of Representatives (lower house), he garnered 337 out of 478 votes cast; in the [[House of Councillors]] (upper house), [[Ichirō Ozawa]], President&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpj.or.jp/english/about_us/index.html "About us"], The Democratic Party of Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan, was named through two times of ballots.&lt;ref name="PM_designation@Mainichi"&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20080924p2a00m0na013000c.html "LDP President Aso elected prime minister"], ''The Mainichi Daily News'', [[Mainichi Shimbun|The Mainichi Newspapers]], 24 September 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924185205/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20080924p2a00m0na013000c.html |date=24 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM_designationKNI"&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/5TH+LD%3A+Aso+elected+Japan's+prime+minister,+to+form+Cabinet.-a0186684851 5TH LD: Aso elected Japan's prime minister, to form Cabinet], [[Kyodo News International]] (September 24, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Because no agreement was reached at a joint committee of both Houses, the resolution of the House of Representatives became the resolution of the Diet, as is stipulated in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="PM_designationKNI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html "The Constitution of Japan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214104438/http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html |date=14 December 2013 }}.

Later on the same day as his election as Prime Minister, Asō personally announced his new Cabinet (this is normally done by the [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]]). His Cabinet was markedly different from the preceding Cabinet under Fukuda. Five of its members had never previously served in the Cabinet, and one of them, 34-year-old [[Yūko Obuchi]], was the youngest member of the Cabinet in the post-war era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080925TDY01303.htm "Aso elected premier / Announces Cabinet lineup himself; poll likely on Nov. 2"], The Yomiuri Shimbun, 25 September 2005. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Asō flew to Washington to meet with [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] in February 2009. He was the first foreign leader to visit the Obama White House; however, reports suggested that the new administration was interested less in giving Asō a political boost than in sending a message that Japan continues to be an important ally and partner&lt;ref&gt;Klug, Foster.

===Political Comeback and return to the cabinet===
When Shinzo Abe returned to the Prime Minister's office in 2012, Aso is appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. He is the first former Japanese Prime Minister to subsequently serve as Deputy Prime Minister.

==Controversial statements==

In 2001, as economics minister, he was quoted as saying he wanted to make Japan a country where "rich Jews" would like to live.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|title=Blue eyes, blond hair: that's US problem, says Japanese minister|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=23 March 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,2040957,00.html|accessdate=19 September 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, during the opening ceremony of the Kyushu National Museum which also displays how other Asian cultures have influenced Japanese cultural heritage, he praised Japan for having "one culture, one civilization, one language, and one ethnic group", and stated that it was the only such country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed, [http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=f6f50bd7a1687ece711a7ef721bb6fb8 "Ghosts of Wartime Japan Haunt Koizumi's Cabinet"], ''New America Media'', 3 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a lecture in Nagasaki Prefecture, Asō referred to a Japanese peace initiative on the [[Middle East]], stating, "The Japanese were trusted because they had never been involved in exploitation there, or been involved in fights or fired machine guns. Japan is doing what the Americans can't do. It would probably be no good to have blue eyes and blond hair. Luckily, we Japanese have yellow faces."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

On 21 December 2005, he said China was "a neighbour with one billion people equipped with nuclear bombs and has expanded its military outlays by double digits for 17 years in a row, and it is unclear as to what this is being used for. It is beginning to be a considerable threat".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4551642.stm Japan alarmed by Chinese 'threat']", ''BBC'', 22 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2006, he called for the emperor to visit the controversial [[Yasukuni Shrine|Yasukuni]] shrine.

''[[Mainichi Daily News]]'' reported that on 9 March 2006 he referred to [[Taiwan]] as a "law-abiding country", which drew strong protest from [[Beijing]], which considers the island a part of [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20060309p2a00m0na026000c.html MDN.mainichi-msn.co.jp]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 2008, ''[[Shimbun Akahata|Akahata]]'', the daily newspaper published by [[Japanese Communist Party]] released a compiled list of these and other statements as the front-page article criticizing Asō.&lt;ref name="asogaffe"&gt;[http://www.jcp.or.jp/akahata/aik07/2008-09-23/2008092302_03_0.html "新総裁 麻生氏 発言録"], ''しんぶん赤旗'', Japanese Communist Party, 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This compilation as well as similar lists of blunders have been frequently cited in the Japanese media.

''[[Yahoo! News]]'' reported that he had said on 9 January 2009, "To work is good. It's completely different thinking from the Old Testament."&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo, [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090108/lf_afp/japanpoliticsculturereligionoffbeat_newsmlmmd "World religions can learn from Japan: PM]", ''Yahoo!News'', 9 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While speaking at a meeting of the National Council on Social Security Reform, in 2013, Asō referred to patients suffering from serious illness as "tube persons" and remarked that they should be "allowed to die quickly" if they desired it. "Heaven forbid I should be kept alive if I want to die", he is quoted as saying. "You cannot sleep well when you think it's all paid by the government.

Date Accessed: 2017/10/30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, while campaigning in Sapporo for the general election, Asō said that rising social welfare costs were not solely due to an aging population. He said, "There are many people who are creating the image that (the increasing number of) elderly people is bad, but more problematic is people who don't give birth",. The comment was labeled as insensitive to those who are not able to have children for biological or economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Gaffe-prone Taro Aso puts his foot in it again." China Daily.

Aso caused a stir in June 2018 when he boasted that the large support towards the LDP among voters under 35 in the [[Japanese general election, 2017|2017 general election]] was due to the demographics being illiterate about the news and current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/24/national/politics-diplomacy/aso-says-ldp-garners-support-young-voters-not-read-newspapers-often/ "In media jab, beleaguered Finance Minister Taro Aso ties lack of young newspaper readers to LDP’s ‘popularity’" - [[Kyodo News]] via the [[Japan Times]] - 24 June 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Aso downplayed alleged sexual harassment charges against his ministry’s top bureaucrat by saying that “there is no such thing as a sexual harassment charge”. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/08/national/japanese-protest-taro-asos-sexual-harassment-comments/|title=Taro Aso repeats comment on alleged sexual harassment that sparked nationwide protest one day earlier|date=2018-05-08|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to comment on a formal complaint submitted to his ministry on the alleged sexual harassment, Aso-san’s remarked that his “only thought was that it would have been easier to read if they used a bigger font” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-20/on-sexual-harassment-complaint-japan-s-aso-objects-to-font-size|title=Japanese Official Says Font Size on Sexual Harassment Complaint Was Too Small|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aso Mining POWs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Australian]] [[POW]]s forced to work at the Aso mining company, photographed in August 1945.]]In mid-2008 Asō conceded that his family's coal mine, Aso Mining Company, was alleged to have forced [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to work in the mines in 1945 without pay. Western media reported that 300 prisoners, including 197 Australians, 101 [[United Kingdom|British]], and two [[Netherlands|Dutch]], worked in the mine. Two of the Australians, John Watson and Leslie Edgar George Wilkie, died while working in the Aso mine.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, William, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070529zg.html Aso Mining's POW labor: the evidence]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 10,000 Korean conscripts worked in the mine between 1939 and 1945 under severe, brutal conditions in which many of them died or were injured while receiving little pay.

Acting on a request from [[Yukihisa Fujita]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Ministry]] investigated and announced on 18 December 2008 that Aso Mining had, in fact, used 300 Allied POWs at its mine during World War II. The ministry confirmed that two Australians had died while working at the mine, but declined to release their names or causes of deaths for "privacy reasons".

The Japanese media noted in November 2008 that Asō often mispronounced or incorrectly read [[kanji]] words written in his speeches, even though many of the words are commonly used in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters "[http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=226060 Japan PM Faces Reading Test As Popularity Sags] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201023132/http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=226060 |date=1 February 2009 }}", "Javno", 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Asō spoke of the speaking errors to reporters on 12 November 2008 saying, "Those were just reading errors, just mistakes."&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081114a4.html Aso raises eyebrows with nonwords and wrong words]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Asō's tendency for malapropisms has led comparisons to [[George W. Bush]], and the use of his name, "Tarō" as a schoolyard taunt for unintelligent children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5659941.ece|work=The Times|location=London|title=Bumbling Taro Aso becomes Japans answer to George Bush|date=5 February 2009|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anatomy professor from the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Takeshi Yoro]], speculated that Asō could possibly suffer from [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/200811/g2008112601_all.html 誤読連発の麻生は「読字障害」？ 養老孟司氏が分析]&lt;!-- Dead Link --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonaka incident===
In 2001, Asō, along with [[Hiromu Nonaka]], was among the LDP's chief candidates to succeed [[Yoshirō Mori]] as prime minister of Japan. During a meeting of LDP leaders at which Nonaka was not present, Asō reportedly told the assembled group, "We are not going to let someone from the buraku become the prime minister, are we?" Asō's remark was apparently a reference to Nonaka's [[burakumin]], a social [[minority group]] in Japan, heritage.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;Yamaguchi, Mari, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090125a2.html Discrimination claims die hard in Japan]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 25 January 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonaka subsequently withdrew as a candidate. Asō eventually lost the appointment to [[Jun'ichirō Koizumi]]. Asō's comment about Nonaka's heritage was revealed in 2005. Asō denied that he had made the statement, but [[Hisaoki Kamei]], who was present at the 2001 meeting, stated in January 2009 that he had heard Asō say something, "to that effect". Nonaka said that he would "never forgive" Asō for the comment and went on to state that Asō was a "misery" to Japan.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"/&gt;

==Personal life==

===Fondness for fine dining===
In October 2008, the Japanese media reported that Asō dined-out or drank in restaurants and bars in luxury hotels almost nightly. When asked about it, Asō stated, "I won't change my style. Luckily I have my money and can afford it." Asō added that if he went anywhere else, he would have to be accompanied by security guards which would cause trouble.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "Aso gets riled when quizzed over swanky wining, dining", reported in the ''[[Japan Times]]'', 23 October 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', Asō dined-out or drank at bars 32 times in September 2008, mainly at exclusive hotels. Asō's predecessor, Yasuo Fukuda, dined-out only seven times in his first month in office. Both of the LDP's opposition parties have called Asō's frequent outings inappropriate. Asō's [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]], [[Jun Matsumoto (politician)|Jun Matsumoto]], commented on the issue by saying that Asō's frequent trips to restaurants, "is his lifestyle and philosophy, and I am not in a position to express my opinion. If only there were more appropriate places when considering security issues and not causing trouble for other customers."&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Masami, "Aso defends his high-flying social life," ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 October 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manga fan===
Asō argues that embracing Japanese pop culture can be an important step to cultivating ties with other countries, hoping that manga will act as a bridge to the world.&lt;ref name="bbc2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6991720.stm|title=Manga shares gain on leader hopes|accessdate=22 December 2007|date=12 September 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is referred to as an [[otaku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=「御宅族」行「漫畫外交」受年輕人追捧 ("Otaku"'s "Manga diplomacy" celebrated by youngsters)|newspaper=Wenweipo|date=23 September 2008|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2008/09/23/GJ0809230014.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asō has been a fan of [[manga]] since childhood. He had his family send manga magazines from Japan while he was studying at Stanford University.&lt;ref name="Taro Aso talks about comics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chikuhou.or.jp/aso-taro/newspaper/030702-1.html|title=麻生太郎　コミックを語る (Taro Aso talks about comics)|accessdate=22 December 2007|date=2 July 2003|work=Big Comic Original|publisher=Shogakukan (original publisher), ''Aso Taro Office'' (copy)|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211173718/http://www.chikuhou.or.jp/aso-taro/newspaper/030702-1.html|archivedate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he described reading about 10 or 20 manga magazines every week (making up only part of Asō's voracious reading) and talked about his impression of various manga extemporaneously.&lt;ref name="Taro Aso talks about comics"/&gt; In 2007, as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], he established the [[International Manga Award]] for non-Japanese [[mangaka|manga artists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Manga Award|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/culture/manga/index.html|accessdate=22 July 2007|publisher=The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219112004/http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/culture/manga/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=19 December 2007}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech by Minister for Foreign Affairs Taro Aso at Digital Hollywood University|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/fm/aso/speech0604-2.html|accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Launches International Manga Award|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/10648.html|accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that he was seen reading the manga ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'' in [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]], which earned him the [[sobriquet]] "His Excellency Rozen".&lt;ref&gt;Nakajima, Makoto. (2008).

Asō's candidacy for the position of Japanese Prime Minister actually caused share-value to rise among some manga publishers and companies related to the manga industry.&lt;ref name="bbc2007"/&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Chigai kuginuki.svg|thumb|right|160px|''([[Mon (crest)|Chigai Kuginuki]])'', The [[Mon (badge)|mon]] of the [[Asō clan]]]]
As a Roman Catholic, Asō belongs to the small minority of [[Christianity in Japan|Japanese Christians]], but he has not emphasized his religiosity. Asō is the seventh Christian prime minister of Japan, after [[Takashi Hara]], [[Korekiyo Takahashi]], [[Tetsu Katayama]], [[Ichirō Hatoyama]], [[Masayoshi Ōhira]], and his own grandfather [[Shigeru Yoshida]].&lt;ref name="carrer"&gt;{{it icon}} Carrcer, Stefano.

'''WMGG''' (1470 [[AM broadcasting|AM]], "Noti America 1470 AM ") is a [[Talk radio|talk]] [[radio station]] in the [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay area]] of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Careless |work=Radio World |title=Moves on the Radio Chess Board |url=http://rwonline.com/article/88420 |date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHBO was licensed to serve the community of [[Dunedin, Florida]], and is owned by Genesis Communications.  WMGG recently switched its transmitter facilities to Egypt Lake, FL, a suburb of Tampa, and no longer identifies Dunedin as its target service area.

Prior to June 5, 2009, WMGG was an [[oldies]]/[[adult standards]] music station branded as "Mega 1470".  Prior to December 29, 2008, WMGG was an all-[[sports radio|sports]] station as an [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioink.com/HeadlineEntry.asp?hid=144458&amp;pt=todaysnews Genesis Launches 'Mega Memories' On WHBO/Tampa] - ''[[Radio Ink]]'' (released December 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;    In the late 1960s and 1970s, the station played Top-40/rock "gold" as WCWR.

As a result of Genesis Communications' announced purchase of WMGG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Maggie |last=Manning |work=Tampa Bay Business Journal |title=Genesis Communications to buy powerful Mega radio station |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2008/09/29/daily7.html?surround=lfn&amp;brthrs=1 |date=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the news/talk format of [[WWBA]] now airs at 820 AM, WHBO's sports format moved to WWBA's former frequency, 1040 AM, in October 2008, and simulcasted on 1470 in the short-term. The WHBO calls moved to 1040, with 1470 receiving new calls, WMGG.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allaccess.com/site/netNews/story.php?bs=sk&amp;ng=industryTools&amp;storyID=46593&amp;searchTerm=wwba&amp;from=0&amp;to=19&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, WMGG switched to news/talk, picking up programs formerly on sister station WWBA, which has since changed an all-news format.  WMGG currently has a Spanish-music format.

'''World Kindness Day''' is an [[international observance]] on [[13 November]].  It was introduced in 1998 by the [[World Kindness Movement]], a coalition of nations' kindness [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. It is observed in many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[United Arab Emirates]]. In 2009, [[Singapore]] observed the day for the first time.  [[Italy]] and [[India]] also observed the day. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is fronted by [[David Jamilly]], who co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]]. In 2010 at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the NSW Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. In 2012 At the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon [[Peter Garrett]] provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and [[Life Vest Inside]] In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, [[Marie Bashir]], Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3&amp;4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by [[Orly Wahba]] from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in [[New York City]]. [[Canada]] celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow [[flower]]s were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in [[Slovenia]], organised by volunteering organisation Humanitarcek as part of their project Randomised Kindess.

World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the [[human condition]] which bridges the divides of race religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the [[United Nations]] by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

According to [[Gulf News]], "it is a day that encourages individuals to overlook boundaries, race and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/gulf-news-readers-celebrate-world-kindness-day-1.526824|title=Gulf News readers celebrate World Kindness Day|last=Al Theeb|first=Alia|date=November 13, 2009|work=Gulf News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
