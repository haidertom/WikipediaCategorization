[[File:No. 5, 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[No. 5, 1948]]'', oil on [[fiberboard]], 244 × 122 cm (96 × 48 in), private collection]]

'''Abstract expressionism''' is a post–[[World War II]] [[art movement]] in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editors of Phaidon Press|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put [[New York City]] at the center of the western [[art world]], a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term ''abstract expressionism'' was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Barbara; "Abstract Expressionism", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]

Technically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of "the men in the new movement." Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103&lt;/ref&gt; Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.

The movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190"&gt;Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), "Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting." p. 189–190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000–1): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', "It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&amp;tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[James Rosati]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and sculptors [[Richard Lippold]], Raoul Hague, [[George Rickey]], [[Reuben Nakian]], and even [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and several others&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12"&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&amp;tab=holdings ''New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists''] (New York School Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-0-6}} p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12" /&gt; a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably [[Robert Frank]]—as well.

Although the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.

== Art critics of the post–World War II era ==


{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.
There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.

While New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13&lt;/ref&gt; or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.

In 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin. ''Off the Wall: A Portrait of Robert Rauschenberg'' [Deckle Edge] [Paperback], p. 5. Publisher: Picador; Revised and Updated edition (November 29, 2005) {{ISBN|0-312-42585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240–241, [[University of California Press]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, "Letter to Sidney Janis: — it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangely the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist; [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.

Clement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, "Art and Culture Critical essays", ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", pp.23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.

== History ==

=== World War II and the Post-War period ===

[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941–42]]

During the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[André Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 – 21 February 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called ''Abstract Expressionists''.

==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====

[[File:Gorky-The-Liver.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arshile Gorky]], ''The Liver is the Cock's Comb'' (1944), oil on canvas, 73{{fraction|1|4}} × 98" (186 × 249 cm) [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]. Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: "I met a lot of artists — but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends."&lt;ref&gt;''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by Thomas B. Hess&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref name =dorment&gt;Dorment, Richard.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's protégés was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.



==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====

During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.

The other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''.

Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-CluVdSYL4b5yASbmYCgBg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw|title=George McNeil|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QypuVfDEBtKTyAS66IOQBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCpuVYq4EsuxyASNjoGACA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kootz Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mypuVY-QAdX_yQTHyIOoDw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=New York Modern|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.

==== Action painting ====

Action painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| title = ''The American Action Painters''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.

[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the "action" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.&lt;ref&gt;based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970, NY 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].

Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Painting Number 2 at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an "[[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting ''Number 2'' (1954). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic writing was an important vehicle for action painters [[Franz Kline]] (in his black and white paintings), Jackson Pollock, Mark Tobey and [[Cy Twombly]], who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the [[Collective unconscious]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://arthistoryunstuffed.com/abstract-expressionism-redefining-art-part-one/ Jeanne Willette, abstract expressionism, redefining art, part one]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/abex/hd_abex.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Abstract Expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Robert Motherwell]] in his ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/489403 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79007 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, other action painters, notably [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Joan Mitchell]], and [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], used imagery via either abstract landscape or as expressionistic visions of the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.

[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Miró]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.

Although abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an "all-over" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

Although Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his ''drip'' paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Puraoeksco&amp;sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941–1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Having seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''Mountains and Sea''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].

Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959–1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Fenton1"&gt;Fenton, Terry.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one.

In [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions, like the [[Hard-edge painting]] exemplified by [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], emerged. Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964.

== Abstract expressionism and the Cold War ==

Since the mid-1970s it has been argued by [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the [[CIA]], who saw it as representative of the USA as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the [[socialist realist]] styles prevalent in [[communism|communist]] nations and the dominance of the European art markets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book by [[Frances Stonor Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/CIAcultCW.html |title=Ratical.org |publisher=Ratical.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/43114251?loc=#tabs |title=Worldcatlibraries.org |publisher=Worldcatlibraries.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published in the UK as ''Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War'') details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of [[cultural imperialism]] via the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, "I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of this information (as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it) concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s is flatly false, or at best (contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles) decontextualized.&lt;ref name=kimmelman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294–306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&amp;pg=PA294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'' by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time; and ''Pollock and After'' edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923–2002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapié]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].

However, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni Tàpies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.&lt;ref name="New York and Abstract Expressionism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are therefore often also referred to as '''aeroacoustic analogies'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lighthill | first1 = M.

In general, aeroacoustic [[analogy|analogies]] are derived from the compressible [[Navier–Stokes equations]] (NSE). The [[compressibility|compressible]] NSE are rearranged into various forms of the inhomogeneous acoustic [[wave equation]]. Within these equations, source terms describe the acoustic sources. They consist of pressure and speed fluctuation as well as [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] and force terms.

[[Approximations]] are introduced to make the source terms independent of the acoustic [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. In this way, linearized equations are derived which describe the propagation of the acoustic waves in a homogeneous, resting medium. The latter is excited by the acoustic source terms, which are determined from the turbulent fluctuations. Since the aeroacoustics are described by the equations of classical acoustics, the methods are called aeroacoustic analogies.

The '''[[Michael James Lighthill|Lighthill]] analogy''' considers a free flow, as for example with an engine jet. The nonstationary fluctuations of the stream are represented by a distribution of [[quadrupole]] sources in the same volume.

The '''Curle analogy''' is a formal solution of the Lighthill analogy, which takes hard surfaces into consideration.

The '''[[John Ffowcs Williams|Ffowcs Williams]]–Hawkings analogy''' is valid for aeroacoustic sources in relative motion with respect to a hard surface, as is the case in many technical applications for example in the automotive industry or in air travel. The calculation involves [[quadrupole]], [[dipole]] and [[monopole (mathematics)|monopole]] terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17061">The '''approximate number system''' ('''ANS''') is a cognitive system that supports the estimation of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of a group without relying on language or symbols.  The ANS is credited with the non-symbolic representation of all numbers greater than four, with lesser values being carried out by the [[parallel individuation system]], or object tracking system.&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M.|title=Neurocognitive start-up tools for symbolic number representations|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.008|pages=542–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in early infancy, the ANS allows an individual to detect differences in magnitude between groups.  The precision of the ANS improves throughout childhood development and reaches a final adult level of approximately 15% accuracy, meaning an adult could distinguish 100 items versus 115 items without counting.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sousa|first=David|title=Mind, Brain, and Education: Neuroscience Implications for the Classroom|year=2010|publisher=Solution Tree Press|isbn=9781935249634}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ANS plays a crucial role in development of other numerical abilities, such as the concept of exact number and simple arithmetic.

==History==

===Piaget's theory===
[[Jean Piaget]] was a Swiss [[developmental psychologist]] who devoted much of his life to studying how children learn.  A book summarizing his theories on number cognition, ''The Child's Conception of Number'', was published in 1952.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Piaget's work supported the viewpoint that children do not have a stable representation of number until the age of six or seven.  His theories indicate that mathematical knowledge is slowly gained and during infancy any concept of sets, objects, or calculation is absent.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===Challenging the Piagetian viewpoint===
Piaget's ideas pertaining to the absence of [[Numerical cognition|mathematical cognition]] at birth have been steadily challenged.  The work of [[Rochel Gelman]] and [[C. Randy Gallistel]] among others in the 1970s suggested that preschoolers have intuitive understanding of the quantity of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and its conservation under non cardinality-related changes, expressing surprise when objects disappear without an apparent cause.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===Current theory===
Beginning as infants, people have an innate sense of approximate number that depends on the ratio between sets of objects.&lt;ref name="cantlon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantlon|first=JF|title=Functional Imaging of Numerical Processing in Adults and 4-y-old Children|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2006|volume=4|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040125|pmid=16594732|pmc=1431577|pages=e125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout life the ANS becomes more developed, and people are able to distinguish between groups having smaller differences in magnitude.&lt;ref name="hyde2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=DC|title=Near-infrared spectroscopy shows right parietal specialization for number in pre-verbal infants.|journal=NeuroImage|year=2010|volume=53|issue=2|pages=647–652|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.030|pmid=20561591|pmc=2930081}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio of distinction is defined by [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]], which relates the different intensities of a [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimulus]] that is being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pessoa|first=L|author2=Desimone R.|title=From Humble Neural Beginnings Comes Knowledge of Numbers|journal=Neuron|year=2003|volume=37|issue=1|pages=4–6|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01179-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of the ANS, as the ratio between the magnitudes increases, the ability to discriminate between the two quantities increases.

Today, some theorize that the ANS lays the foundation for higher-level arithmetical concepts.  Research has shown that the same areas of the brain are active during non-symbolic number tasks in infants and both non-symbolic and more sophisticated symbolic number tasks in adults.&lt;ref name="Piazza3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M|title=A magnitude code common to numerosity and number symbols in human intraparietal cortex.|journal=Neuron|year=2007|volume=53|issue=2|pages=293–305|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These results could suggest that the ANS contributes over time to the development of higher-level numerical skills that activate the same part of the brain.

However, longitudinal studies do not necessarily find that non-symbolic abilities predict later symbolic abilities. Conversely, early symbolic number abilities have been found to predict later non-symbolic abilities, not vice versa as predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Symbolic Number Abilities Predict Later Approximate Number System Acuity in Preschool Children|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091839|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-03-17|pmc = 3956743|pmid = 24637785|pages = e91839|volume = 9|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0091839|first = Christophe|last = Mussolin|first2 = Julie|last2 = Nys|first3 = Alain|last3 = Content|first4 = Jacqueline|last4 = Leybaert}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults for example, non-symbolic number abilities do not always explain mathematics achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Non-verbal number acuity correlates with symbolic mathematics achievement: but only in children|journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 1531-5320|pmid = 21898191|pages = 1222–1229|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.3758/s13423-011-0154-1|first = Matthew|last = Inglis|first2 = Nina|last2 = Attridge|first3 = Sophie|last3 = Batchelor|first4 = Camilla|last4 = Gilmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological basis==
Brain imaging studies have identified the [[parietal lobe]] as being a key brain region for numerical cognition.&lt;ref name="Dehaene"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehaene|first=S|title=Three parietal circuits for number processing.|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=2003|volume=20|issue=3|pages=487–506|doi=10.1080/02643290244000239|pmid=20957581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically within this lobe is the [[intraparietal sulcus]] which is "active whenever we think about a number, whether spoken or written, as a word or as an [[Arabic numerals|Arabic digit]], or even when we inspect a set of objects and think about its cardinality".&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  When comparing groups of objects, activation of the intraparietal sulcus is greater when the difference between groups is numerical rather than an alternative factor, such as differences in shape or size.&lt;ref name="cantlon" /&gt;  This indicates that the intraparietal sulcus plays an active role when the ANS is employed to approximate magnitude.

Parietal lobe brain activity seen in adults is also observed during infancy during non-verbal numerical tasks, suggesting that the ANS is present very early in life.&lt;ref name="hyde2" /&gt;     A neuroimaging technique, [[fNIR|functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy]], was performed on infants revealing that the parietal lobe is specialized for number representation before the development of language.&lt;ref name="hyde2" /&gt;     This indicates that numerical cognition may be initially reserved to the right hemisphere of the brain and becomes bilateral through experience and the development of complex number representation.

It has been shown that the intraparietal sulcus is activated independently of the type of task being performed with the number.  The intensity of activation is dependent on the difficulty of the task, with the intraparietal sulcus showing more intense activation when the task is more difficult.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  In addition, studies in monkeys have shown that individual [[neuron]]s can fire preferentially to certain numbers over others.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  For example, a neuron could fire at maximum level every time a group of four objects is seen, but will fire less to a group three or five objects.

==Pathology==

===Damage to intraparietal sulcus===
Damage done to parietal lobe, specifically in the left hemisphere, can produce difficulties in counting and other simple arithmetic.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Damage directly to the intraparietal sulcus has been shown to cause [[acalculia]], a severe disorder in mathematical cognition.&lt;ref name="cantlon" /&gt;  Symptoms vary based the location of damage, but can include the inability to perform simple calculations or to decide that one number is larger than another.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; [[Gerstmann syndrome]], a disease resulting in lesions in the left parietal and [[temporal lobe]]s, results in acalculia symptoms and further confirms the importance of the parietal region in the ANS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashkenazi|first=S|title=Basic Numerical Processing in Left Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS) Acalculia.|journal=Cortex|year=2008|volume=44|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.08.008|pages=439–448|pmid=18387576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental delays===
A syndrome known as [[dyscalculia]] is seen in individuals who have unexpected difficulty understanding numbers and arithmetic despite adequate education and social environments.&lt;ref name="molko"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Molko|first=N|title=Functional and structural alterations of the intraparietal sulcus in a developmental dyscalculia of genetic origin|journal=Neuron|year=2003|volume=40|issue=4|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00670-6|pages=847–858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This syndrome can manifest in several different ways from the inability to assign a quantity to Arabic numerals to difficulty with times tables.  Dyscalculia can result in children falling significantly behind in school, regardless of having normal intelligence levels.

In some instances, such as [[Turner syndrome]], the onset of dyscalculia is genetic.  Morphological studies have revealed abnormal lengths and depths of the right intraparietal sulcus in individuals suffering from Turner syndrome.&lt;ref name="molko" /&gt;  Brain imaging in children exhibiting symptoms of dyscalculia show less [[gray matter]] or less activation in the intraparietal regions stimulated normally during mathematical tasks.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Additionally, impaired ANS acuity has been shown to differentiate children with dyscalculia from their normally-developing peers with low maths achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazzocco|first=M.M.M.|author2=Feigenson, L.|author3=Halberda, J.|title=Impaired Acuity of the Approximate Number System Underlies Mathematical Learning Disability(Dyscalculia)|journal=Child Development|year=2011|volume=82|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01608.x|pages=1224–1237|pmid=21679173|pmc=4411632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further research and theories==

===Impact of the visual cortex===
The intraparietal region relies on several other brain systems to accurately perceive numbers.  When using the ANS we must view the sets of objects in order to evaluate their magnitude.  The [[primary visual cortex]] is responsible for disregarding irrelevant information, such as the size or shape of the objects.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Certain visual cues can sometimes affect how the ANS functions.

Arranging the items differently can alter the effectiveness of the ANS.  One arrangement proven to influence the ANS is visual nesting, or placing the objects within one another.  This configuration affects the ability to distinguish each item and add them together at the same time.  The difficulty results in underestimation of the magnitude present in the set or a longer amount of time needed to perform an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chesney|first=DL|title=Visual Nesting Impacts Approximate Number System Estimation|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|year=2012|volume=74|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another visual representation that affects the ANS is the [[Spatial-numerical association of response codes|spatial-numerical association response code]], or the SNARC effect.  The SNARC effect details the tendency of larger numbers to be responded to faster by the right hand and lower numbers by the left hand, suggesting that the magnitude of a number is linked to a spatial representation.&lt;ref name= "ren"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ren|first=P|title=Size matters: non-numerical magnitude affects the spatial coding of response|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2011|volume=6|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023553|pages=e23553|pmid=21853151|pmc=3154948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dehaene and other researchers believe this effect is caused by the presence of a “mental number line” in which small numbers appear on the left and increase as you move right.&lt;ref name="ren" /&gt;  The SNARC effect indicates that the ANS works more effectively and accurately if the larger set of objects is on the right and the smaller on the left.

===Development and mathematical performance===
Although the ANS is present in infancy before any numerical education, research has shown a link between people's mathematical abilities and the accuracy in which they approximate the magnitude of a set.  This correlation is supported by several studies in which school-aged children's ANS abilities are compared to their mathematical achievements.  At this point the children have received training in other mathematical concepts, such as exact number and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halberda|first=J|title=Individual differences in non-verbal number acuity correlate with maths achievement|journal=Nature|year=2008|volume=455|issue=7213|doi=10.1038/nature07246|pmid=18776888|pages=665–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More surprisingly, ANS precision before any formal education accurately predicts better math performance.  A study involving 3-5 year old children revealed that ANS acuity corresponds to better mathematical cognition while remaining independent of factors that may interfere, such as reading ability and the use of Arabic numerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libertus|first=ME|title=Preschool acuity of the approximate number system correlates with school math ability|journal=Developmental Science|year=2011|volume=14|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01080.x|pages=1292–1300|pmc=3338171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ANS in animals===
{{Main|Number sense in animals}}
Many species of animals exhibit the ability to assess and compare magnitude.  This skill is believed to be a product of the ANS.  Research has revealed this capability in both vertebrate and non-vertebrate animals including birds, mammals, fish, and even insects.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In primates, implications of the ANS have been steadily observed through research.  One study involving lemurs showed that they were able to distinguish groups of objects based only on numerical differences, suggesting that humans and other primates utilize a similar numerical processing mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merritt|first=Dustin|title=Numerical rule-learning in ring-tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta) |journal=Frontiers in Psychology|year=2011|volume=2|issue=23|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study comparing students to guppies, both the fish and students performed the numerical task almost identically.&lt;ref name="agrillo" /&gt;    The ability for the test groups to distinguish large numbers was dependent on the ratio between them, suggesting the ANS was involved.  Such results seen when testing guppies indicate that the ANS may have been evolutionarily passed down through many species.&lt;ref name="agrillo" /&gt;

==Applications in society==

===Implications for the classroom===
Understanding how the ANS affects students' learning could be beneficial for teachers and parents.  The following tactics have been suggested by neuroscientists to utilize the ANS in school:&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;
*Counting or abacus games
*Simple board games
*Computer-based number association games
*Teacher sensitivity and different teaching methods for different learners
Such tools are most helpful in training the number system when the child is at an earlier age.  Children coming from a disadvantaged background with risk of arithmetic problems are especially impressionable by these tactics.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

'''William Thomas Romanowski''' (born April 2, 1966) is a former [[American football]] [[linebacker]]. He played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[San Francisco 49ers]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Denver Broncos]], and [[Oakland Raiders]].

== Early life and education ==
Romanowski was born in [[Vernon, Connecticut|Vernon]], [[Connecticut]]. He graduated from [[Rockville High School (Connecticut)|Rockville High School]] in 1984 and [[Boston College]] in 1988 with academic honors, and was a Scanlan Award recipient.

== NFL career ==
Romanowski went on to a 16-year career in the [[National Football League|NFL]], playing for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (1988–1993), [[Philadelphia Eagles]] (1994–1995), [[Denver Broncos]] (1996–2001), and [[Oakland Raiders]] (2002–2003). After his career, he was listed by [[ESPN]] as the fifth dirtiest player in professional team sports history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dirtiest professional team players|url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/dirtiest/players.html|website = ESPN|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanowski played [[List of most consecutive starts and games played by National Football League players#Consecutive games played|243 consecutive games]] during the 1988-2003 seasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Redskins Blog {{!}} Romanowski: Fletcher Deserves Record|url = http://www.redskins.com/?campaign=was:fanshare:facebook|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; an NFL record  that stood until [[Chris Gardocki]] broke it during the 2006 season, finishing his career with 265, (256 reg. season and 9 playoff games). He won 4 [[Super Bowl]] Championships, and played 5 Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XXIII]], [[Super Bowl XXIV]], [[Super Bowl XXXII]], [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]). 

During his 16-year career, Romanowski compiled 1,105 tackles, 39.5 sacks, 18 forced fumbles, and 18 interceptions, which he returned for a net total of 98 yards and 1 career touchdown. Romanowski was a [[Pro Bowl]] selection twice, in 1996 and 1998, both during his tenure with the Denver Broncos.

=== Altercations ===
Romanowski was involved in numerous altercations with both teammates and opponents. In 1995, while with the Eagles, he was ejected from a game — and subsequently fined $4,500 — for kicking [[Arizona Cardinals]] fullback [[Larry Centers]] in the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Romanowski Hits A Nerve|url = http://articles.courant.com/1998-01-21/sports/9801210666_1_bill-romanowski-cardinals-fullback-larry-centers-head-five-times|website = The Courant|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more incidents occurred during the 1997 season while he played for the Broncos. In the first, he was fined $20,000 after a helmet-to-helmet hit on then-[[Carolina Panthers]] quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] in a preseason game resulting in Collins sustaining a broken jaw.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In the second incident, Romanowski spat in the face of 49ers wide receiver [[J. J. Stokes]] in a regular-season game played in December on a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] in response to Stokes' taunting.&lt;ref name="taipei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2003/12/27/2003085389|title=Bill Romanowski: golden boy of NFL or common ruffian?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two years later, while still with the Broncos, he was fined a total of $42,500 for three illegal hits plus a punch thrown at [[Kansas City Chiefs]] tight end [[Tony Gonzalez]], and was also fined an undisclosed amount for throwing a football at [[Bryan Cox]] of the [[New York Jets]], the ball hitting him in [[groin attack|the crotch area]].&lt;ref name="sfist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfist.com/2007/04/16/why_all_the_bill_romanowski_love.php|title=Why all the Bill Romanowski Love?|work=SFist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522004426/http://www.sfist.com/2007/04/16/why_all_the_bill_romanowski_love.php|archivedate=2007-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marcus Williams incident ====
In 2003, Romanowski attacked and injured one of his teammates, [[Marcus Williams (tight end)|Marcus Williams]], during a scrimmage.  Williams, a backup tight end for the Oakland Raiders, was forced to retire after Romanowski confronted Williams after a play, ripped off his helmet, and crushed his eye socket with a punch.&lt;ref&gt;Injured ex-Raider raises issue of ' 'roid rage' http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1976461&lt;/ref&gt; 

Williams sued for damages of $3.4 million, arguing that Romanowski had been suffering from "[[roid rage]]" when he attacked him. Williams was awarded $340,000 for lost wages and medical expenses by a jury.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Williams awarded $340K in Romanowski trial|url = http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2019325|website = ESPN.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was quoted as saying he and his lawyers "just wanted to prove what was right and wrong about football".&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/03/23/ROMO.TMP&lt;/ref&gt; Williams's attorney said he was very pleased with the verdict.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Racism allegations ====
Romanowski has been accused of being racist at many points during his career and after retirement. Various media critics have pointed to his fines for actions including kicking [[Larry Centers]] in the head in 1995, spitting on San Francisco 49er receiver [[J.J. Stokes]] in 1997, and ripping Eddie George's helmet off in 2002, as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romanowski rages at racist allegations|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=20000817&amp;id=nY9XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QPIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5688,5774562&amp;hl=en|website=www.spokane.net|publisher=The Spokesman-Review|accessdate=8 February 2016|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugly Plays: Most Racist Moments in Sports|url=http://www.bet.com/news/sports/photos/2014/04/most-racist-moments-in-sports.html#!042814-sports-comments-racist-Bill-Romanowski|website=BET|publisher=Black Entertainment Television LLC|accessdate=8 February 2016|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mossman|first1=John|title=Romanowski: 'SI article absolute lie'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&amp;dat=20000817&amp;id=msEjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BdEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1619,1940863&amp;hl=en|accessdate=8 February 2016|work=Moscow-Pulman Daily News|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Associated Press|date=17 Aug 2000|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Romanowski called [[Carolina Panthers]] starting quarterback [[Cam Newton]] "boy" in a tweet after Newton's team lost in [[Super Bowl 50]] and Newton conducted a very brief press interview.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Shaun|title=King: Bill Romanowski was blatantly racist even before he called Cam Newton ‘boy’ in post-Super Bowl tweet|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-bill-romanowski-calling-cam-newton-boy-racist-article-1.2523980|website=New York Daily News|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|accessdate=8 February 2016|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized after he was accused of being racist.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=David|title=Cam Newton showing heartache after Super Bowl loss isn't necessarily a bad thing|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/carolina-panthers/post/_/id/19612/that-cam-newton-showed-his-hurt-after-super-bowl-loss-isnt-necessarily-a-bad-thing|website=ESPN GO|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=8 February 2016|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-NFL career==
Romanowski co-authored an autobiography in 2005 titled ''Romo My Life on the Edge: Living Dreams and Slaying Dragons''. The book became a ''[[New York Times]]'' best selling book in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Adam Schefter - ESPN MediaZone|url = http://espnmediazone.com/us/bios/schefter_adam/|website = ESPN MediaZone|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It chronicles his childhood, college, and his playing times in the NFL. 

He was featured on the cover of the Midway Games title ''[[Blitz: The League]]'' and adds his voice as Bruno Battaglia, a linebacker in the game who wears his 53. He also appears in NCAA Football Series indirectly as LB #53 for the 1984 Boston College Eagles. 

In 2006, he founded [http://www.nutrition53.com/pages/about Nutrition 53], a nutritional supplement company. He is also a minority owner of [[NASCAR]]'s [[Swan Racing]] in 2013. His own company Nutrition53 sponsored the team in 10 races in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/01/31/former-nfl-lb-romanowski-joins-swan-racing.html|title=Former NFL LB Romanowski joins Swan Racing|work=[[NASCAR]]|date=2013-01-31|accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Football ===
In 2008, Romanowski was the defensive coordinator for the Piedmont High School (California) Highlanders Freshman Football team, where his son played.

In January 2009, Romanowski threw his name into the search for [[Mike Shanahan]]'s replacement as the head coach of the [[Denver Broncos]]. Romanowski sent a 30-page [[PowerPoint]] presentation to team owner [[Pat Bowlen]], but was not considered for the job.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Broncos not planning to meet with Romanowski|url = http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3836598|website = ESPN.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The job was ultimately given to [[Josh McDaniels]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===BALCO Scandal===
Romanowski and his wife were investigated for prescription drug fraud, though the charges were later dropped.&lt;ref name="findarticles"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20020222/ai_n10001652|title = FindArticles.com - CBSi|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Records seized by the government belonging to the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]], later discovered to be the source of a designer steroid, indicate that he had used the [[anabolic steroid]] "[[the clear|The Clear]]" and [[testosterone (medication)|synthetic testosterone]] ointment "[[the cream|The Cream]]" provided by BALCO since 2003. Romanowski admitted to staying a step ahead of NFL drug testing policies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clayton: Staying in the game|url = http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2070102&amp;columnist=clayton_john|website = ESPN.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 16, 2005 appearance on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Romanowski admitted to using steroids and human growth hormone that he received from [[Victor Conte]], BALCO owner.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/balco-timeline.htm|title=BALCO investigation timeline - USATODAY.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In media===
Romanowski starred in the remake of ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' as one of the prison guards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Brooker v Police''''' was a case in the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]] that concerned the meaning of "behaves in [a] disorderly manner" under section 4(1)(a) of the Summary Offences Act 1981 in light of s 14 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] which protects freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [1-5].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Majority opinion|majority]] of the Supreme Court overturned the previous test for disorderly behaviour "which found the offence proven where behaviour was so annoying that "right-thinking members of the public" could not be expected to tolerate it"; and set aside Allistair Brooker's [[conviction]] for disorderly behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/centres/nzcpl/publications/nz-journal-of-public-and-international-law/pdfs/volume-11,-issue-1/Geddis.pdf|title = Dissent, the Bill of Rights Act and the Supreme Court|last = Geddis|first = Andres|date = November 2013|journal = New Zealand Journal of Public and international law|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 August 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160309100520/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/centres/nzcpl/publications/nz-journal-of-public-and-international-law/pdfs/volume-11%2C-issue-1/Geddis.pdf|archivedate = 9 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justices McGrath and Thomas in the [[Dissenting opinion|minority]] argued that the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] should be balanced against a citizen's right to [[privacy]] in their own home.  

==Background==
On Tuesday 18 March 2003 at about 9:20am Allistair Brooker went to the home of a [[Greymouth]] Police Constable Fiona Croft, "believing that he had been the subject of harassment over a number of years by the [[New Zealand Police|police]], and by Constable Croft in particular".&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [71].&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooker had decided to stage a [[protest]], and &lt;blockquote&gt;Having tried to contact her at work, he went to her home, knowing that she had been on night duty and was likely to be there. He parked his car on the grass verge outside her front fence, walked onto the property and knocked on the front door. After about three minutes the constable came to the door. He suggested to her that she did not like being woken up, and she told him to “piss off”. He withdrew to the street and began his protest outside her front fence. He had with him a square metre placard on which was written “No more bogus warrants” and which he lent against the fence. He then began playing his guitar and singing in what the trial Judge described as a “relatively” loud voice.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [72].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Constable Croft rang the [[police station]], gave evidence that she was intimidated by the protest and within minutes police officers had arrived at the house.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [73].&lt;/ref&gt; The senior police officer told Brooker he had one minute to leave or "he would be arrested for intimidation".&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [73].&lt;/ref&gt; Brooker put his guitar and placard in his car, parked it on the opposite side of the road, and "returned to the inspector with his hands held out in the form of an invitation to the inspector to [[arrest]] and handcuff him. He was duly arrested for intimidation."&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [74].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[District Courts of New Zealand|District Court]], the judge considered that there was insufficient evidence of intent to intimidate and the charge was amended to one of behaving in a disorderly manner contrary to s 4(1)(a) of the Summary Offences Act 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [75].&lt;/ref&gt; On that count of disorderly behaviour Brooker was found guilty and his appeal to the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] was dismissed.&lt;ref &gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [77]-[78].&lt;/ref&gt; Brookers appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] was also dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [80].&lt;/ref&gt; Brooker appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [86].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments==

===Elias CJ===
The judgment of [[Sian Elias|Chief Justice Elias]] traversed the legal history of section 4(1)(a) of the Summary Offences Act and the approach of other Commonwealth jurisdictions to similar crimes, before observing, &lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that behaviour which is disorderly under s 4 need not be likely to lead to violence because behaviour likely to cause that effect is covered by s 3. What is essential however is that the behaviour is disruptive of public order and is not simply a private affront or annoyance to a person present or to whom the behaviour is directed.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [33].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On that assessment Elias CJ held that Brooker's protest was not disorderly.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [49]-[50].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blanchard J===
[[Peter Blanchard|Justice Blanchard]] also held that Brooker's behaviour was not disorderly noting, "In my view Mr Brooker's question [to a police officer outside Croft's house] "Is it disorderly yet?" was in point. My answer would be in the negative."&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [70].&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to the decision of Elias CJ, Blanchard J observed, &lt;blockquote&gt; [S]omeone should not be convicted of disorderly behaviour unless there has been a substantial disruption of public order in or about a public place, although that disruption does not have to have created or been likely to create a [[breach of the peace]]. Causing annoyance, even considerable annoyance, to citizens does not suffice.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [63].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

===Tipping J===
[[Andrew Tipping|Justice Tipping]] formulated what he saw as the correct test of disorderly behaviour as; &lt;blockquote&gt;Conduct in a qualifying location is disorderly if, as a matter of time, place and circumstance, it causes anxiety or disturbance at a level which is beyond what a reasonable citizen should be expected to bear. Unless that is so, the conduct will not warrant the intervention of the criminal law. If it is so, the public has a legitimate interest in proscribing the behaviour, and thereby protecting citizens from it. In this way public order is protected.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Tipping J noted that Constable Croft was the only person affected by Brooker's protest and that, "His behaviour, viewed objectively, did not in all the circumstances cause [[anxiety]] or disturbance at a level beyond that which a reasonable person in Constable Croft’s shoes should be expected to bear." &lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [96].&lt;/ref&gt;

===McGrath J===
[[John McGrath (judge)|Justice McGrath]], alongside Thomas J, gave one of the two dissenting judgments in the Court's decision. McGrath J focused his judgment on "reconciling the conflicts" between Brooker's right to protest and Constable Croft's right to privacy before stating that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt; Under s 5 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]], all fundamental rights and freedoms may be made subject to such reasonable limits, prescribed by law, as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. In order to be such a limit on the protester’s right of free expression, the offence of disorderly behaviour must be restricted to conduct that amounts to a sufficiently serious and reprehensible interference with the rights of others to warrant the intervention of the criminal law. At that point the protester’s legitimate exercise of freedom of expression ends.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [130].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

McGrath J thought that Brooker's disturbed the constables "enjoyment of tranquility and privacy in her home" and as a result held Brooker's protest "went well beyond what any citizen, [[public official]] or not, should have to tolerate in her home environment."&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [146]. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas J===
[[Ted Thomas (judge)|Justice Thomas]] dissented alongside McGrath J, and his lengthy judgment observes that the meaning of disorderly behaviour is largely indeterminate; that the law should provide the test of the [[reasonable person]]; and should seek to balance all of the rights, values and interests which are in issue in each particular case.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [162]-[164].&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion Thomas J argued strongly against the majority stating, "I would much prefer that both [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and privacy be recognised as fundamental values and, as such, weighed one against the other in a manner designed to afford the greatest protection to both."&lt;ref&gt;''Brooker v Police'' [2007] NZSC 30 at [285].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15595">The '''conjunction fallacy''' (also known as the '''Linda problem''') is a [[formal fallacy]] that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.

==Definition and basic example== 
{{quote box|I am particularly fond of this example [the Linda problem] because I know that the [conjoint] statement is least probable, yet a little [[homunculus]] in my head continues to jump up and down, shouting at me—"but she can’t just be a bank teller; read the description."|[[Stephen J. Gould]]&lt;ref name="Gould (1988)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gould|first=Stephen J.|title=The Streak of Streaks|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1988/aug/18/the-streak-of-streaks/?pagination=false|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=25%|align=right}}

The most often-cited example of this fallacy originated with [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]].&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Kahneman 1982"&gt;Tversky, A. and Kahneman, D. (1982) "Judgments of and by representativeness". In D. Kahneman, P. Slovic &amp; A. Tversky (Eds.), ''Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt; Although the description and person depicted are fictitious, Amos Tversky's secretary at Stanford was named Linda Covington, and he named the famous character in the puzzle after her.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.''

Which is more probable?
# Linda is a bank teller.
# Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority of those asked chose option 2. However, the [[probability]] of two events occurring together (in "[[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone—formally, for two events ''A'' and ''B'' this inequality could be written as &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A \land B) \leq \Pr(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A \land B) \leq \Pr(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, even choosing a very low probability of Linda being a bank teller, say Pr(Linda is a bank teller) = 0.05 and a high probability that she would be a feminist, say Pr(Linda is a feminist) = 0.95, then, assuming [[statistical independence|independence]], Pr(Linda is a bank teller ''and'' Linda is a feminist)&amp;nbsp;= 0.05&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.95 or&amp;nbsp;0.0475, lower than Pr(Linda is a bank teller).

Tversky and Kahneman argue that most people get this problem wrong because they use a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] (an easily calculated) procedure called [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]] to make this kind of judgment: Option 2 seems more "representative" of Linda based on the description of her, even though it is clearly mathematically less likely.&lt;ref name="tk83"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2=Kahneman |first2=Daniel |date=October 1983 |title=Extension versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=293–315 |url=http://content2.apa.org/journals/rev/90/4/293 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223193247/http://content2.apa.org/journals/rev/90/4/293 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other demonstrations, they argued that a specific scenario seemed more likely because of representativeness, but each added detail would actually make the scenario less and less likely. In this way it could be similar to the [[misleading vividness]] or [[slippery slope]] fallacies. More recently Kahneman has argued that the conjunction fallacy is a type of [[extension neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, Daniel. (2000). "Evaluation by moments, past and future". In Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (Eds.). ''Choices, Values and Frames.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint versus separate evaluation==

In some experimental demonstrations, the conjoint option is evaluated separately from its basic option. In other words, one group of participants is asked to rank order the likelihood that Linda is a bank teller, a high school teacher, and several other options, and another group is asked to rank order whether Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement versus the same set of options (without "Linda is a bank teller" as an option). In this type of demonstration, different groups of subjects rank order Linda as a bank teller and active in the feminist movement more highly than Linda as a bank teller.&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt;

Separate evaluation experiments preceded the earliest joint evaluation experiments, and Kahneman and Tversky were surprised when the effect was still observed under joint evaluation.&lt;ref name="tk2011-15"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |title=Thinking, Fast and Slow |chapter=Linda: Less is More |year=2011 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn= |pages=156–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In separate evaluation, the term '''conjunction effect''' may be preferred.&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and [[Ralph Hertwig]] criticized the Linda problem on grounds such as the [[wording effect|wording]] and [[framing effect|framing]]. The question of the Linda problem may violate [[conversational maxim]]s in that people assume that the question obeys the maxim of relevance. Gigerenzer argues that some of the terminology used have [[polysemy|polysemous]] meanings, the alternatives of which he claimed were more "natural". He argues that the meaning of ''probable'' ("what happens frequently") corresponds to the mathematical probability people are supposed to be tested on, but the meanings of ''probable'' ("what is plausible" and "whether there is evidence") do not.&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=Gerd|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky|journal=Psychological Review|date=1996|volume=103|issue=3|pages=592–596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hertwig &amp; Gigerenzer (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertwig|first=Ralph|last2=Gigerenzer|first2=Gerd|title=The 'Conjunction Fallacy' Revisited: How Intelligent Inferences Look Like Reasoning Errors|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|year=1999|volume=12|issue=4|pages=275–305|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0771(199912)12:4&lt;275::aid-bdm323&gt;3.3.co;2-d}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "and" has even been argued to have relevant polysemous meanings.&lt;ref name="Mellers, Hertwig &amp; Kahneman (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mellers|first1=B.|last2=Hertwig|first2=R.|last3=Kahneman|first3=D.|title=Do frequency representations eliminate conjunction effects?

Many variations in wording of the Linda problem were studied by Tversky and Kahneman.&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt; If the first option is changed to obey conversational relevance, i.e., "Linda is a bank teller whether or not she is active in the feminist movement" the effect is decreased, but the majority (57%) of the respondents still commit the conjunction error.  If the probability is changed to frequency format (''see debiasing section below'') the effect is reduced or eliminated. However, studies exist in which indistinguishable conjunction fallacy rates have been observed with stimuli framed in terms of probabilities versus frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite journal|last1=Tentori|first1=Katya|last2=Bonini|first2=Nicolao|last3=Osherson|first3=Daniel|title=The conjunction fallacy: a misunderstanding about conjunction?|journal=Cognitive Science|date=2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=467–477|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2803_8}} Or: {{cite journal|last1=Wedell|first1=Douglas H.|last2=Moro|first2=Rodrigo|title=Testing boundary conditions for the conjunction fallacy: Effects of response mode, conceptual focus, and problem type|journal=Cognition|date=2008|volume=107|issue=1|pages=105–136|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.08.003|pmid=17927971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording criticisms may be less applicable to the conjunction effect in separate evaluation.{{vague|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1996)" /&gt; The "Linda problem" has been studied and criticized more than other types of demonstration of the effect (some described below).&lt;ref name="tk2011-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellers, Hertwig &amp; Kahneman (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahneman &amp; Tversky (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=On the reality of cognitive illusions.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1996|volume=103|issue=3|pages=582–591|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.582|pmid=8759048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an incentivized experimental study, it has been shown that the conjunction fallacy decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109001103|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2009|pages = 147–152|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|first = Jörg|last = Oechssler|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Roider|first3 = Patrick W.|last3 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that the conjunction fallacy becomes less prevalent when subjects are allowed to consult with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the conjunction fallacy in probability judgment: New experimental evidence regarding Linda|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825609001742|journal = Games and Economic Behavior|date = 2010|pages = 551–556|volume = 68|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.geb.2009.09.003|first = Gary|last = Charness|first2 = Edi|last2 = Karni|first3 = Dan|last3 = Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other demonstrations==

Policy experts were asked to rate the probability that the [[Soviet Union]] would invade [[Poland]], and the [[United States]] would break off [[diplomatic relations]], all in the following year. They rated it on average as having a 4% probability of occurring. Another group of experts was asked to rate the probability simply that the United States would break off relations with the Soviet Union in the following year. They gave it an average probability of only 1%.&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt;

In an experiment conducted in 1980, respondents were asked the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose [[Björn Borg]] reaches the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] finals in 1981. Please rank order the following outcomes from most to least likely.
* Borg will win the match
* Borg will lose the first set
* Borg will lose the first set but win the match
* Borg will win the first set but lose the match&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On average, participants rated "Borg will lose the first set but win the match" more likely than "Borg will lose the first set".&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt;

In another experiment, participants were asked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider a regular six-sided die with four green faces and two red faces. The die will be rolled 20 times and the sequence of greens (G) and reds (R) will be recorded. You are asked to select one sequence, from a set of three, and you will win $25 if the sequence you choose appears on successive rolls of the die.

# RGRRR
# GRGRRR
# GRRRRR&lt;/blockquote&gt;

65% of participants chose the second sequence, though option 1 is contained within it and is shorter than the other options. In a version where the $25 bet was only hypothetical the results did not significantly differ. Tversky and Kahneman argued that sequence 2 appears "representative" of a chance sequence&lt;ref name="tk83"/&gt; (compare to the ''[[clustering illusion]]'').

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider another example: 
Which of the following events is most likely to occur within the next year?

1. The United States will withdraw all troops from Iraq.
2. The United States will withdraw all troops from Iraq and bomb North Korean nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The probability of the conjunctions is never greater than that of its conjuncts. Therefore, the first choice is more probable. No matter how unlikely it is that America will withdraw troops within the year from Iraq, it is even less likely they will do so ''and'' bomb nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conjunction Fallacy|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/conjunct.html#Answer|website=fallacyfiles.org|accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debiasing==

Drawing attention to set relationships, using [[frequentism|frequencies]] instead of probabilities and/or thinking [[venn diagram|diagrammatically]] sharply reduce the error in some forms of the conjunction fallacy.&lt;ref name="tk83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hertwig &amp; Gigerenzer (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellers, Hertwig &amp; Kahneman (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1991)" /&gt;

In one experiment the question of the Linda problem was reformulated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 100 persons who fit the description above (that is, Linda’s). How many of them are:&lt;/p&gt;
* Bank tellers?  __ of 100
* Bank tellers and active in the feminist movement?  __ of 100&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas previously 85% of participants gave the wrong answer (bank teller and active in the feminist movement), in experiments done with this questioning none of the participants gave a wrong answer.&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gigerenzer |first=G. |year=1991 |title=How to make cognitive illusions disappear: Beyond ‘heuristics and biases.’ |journal=European Review of Social Psychology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=83–115 |doi=10.1080/14792779143000033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were forced to use a mathematical approach and thus recognised the difference more easily.

However, in some tasks only based on frequencies, not on stories, that used clear logical formulations, conjunction fallacies continued to occur dominantly when the observed pattern of frequencies resembled a conjunction (only few exceptions).&lt;ref name="von Sydow (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Sydow|first=M. |year=2011 |title=The Bayesian Logic of Frequency-Based Conjunction Fallacies. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=119–139 |doi=10.1016/j.jmp.2010.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13805">In the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]], as in the [[Euclidean plane]], each point can be uniquely identified by two [[real number]]s. Several qualitatively different ways of coordinatizing the plane in hyperbolic geometry are used.

This article tries to give an overview of several coordinate systems in use for the two-dimensional hyperbolic plane.

In the descriptions below the constant [[Gaussian curvature]] of the plane is&amp;nbsp;−1. [[Hyperbolic function#Sinh|Sinh]], [[Hyperbolic function#Cosh|cosh]] and [[Hyperbolic function#Tanh|tanh]] are [[hyperbolic functions]].

==Polar coordinate system ==

[[Image:Examples of Polar Coordinates.svg|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees or {{nowrap|(3, 60°)}}. In blue, the point {{nowrap|(4, 210°)}}.]]

The '''polar coordinate system''' is a [[dimension|two-dimensional]] [[coordinate system]] in which each [[point (mathematics)|point]] on a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] is determined by a [[distance]] from a reference point and an [[angle]] from a reference direction.

The reference point (analogous to the origin of a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian system]]) is called the ''pole'', and the [[ray (geometry)|ray]] from the pole in the reference direction is the ''polar axis''. The distance from the pole is called the ''radial coordinate'' or ''radius'', and the angle is called the ''angular coordinate'', or ''polar angle''.

From the hyperbolic law of cosines, we get that the distance between two points given in polar coordinates is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle r_1, \theta_1 \rangle, \langle r_2, \theta_2 \rangle) = \operatorname{arcosh} \, \left( \cosh r_1 \cosh r_2 - \sinh r_1 \sinh r_2 \cos (\theta_2 - \theta_1) \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding metric tensor is: &lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d} s)^2 = (\mathrm{d} r)^2 + \sinh^2 r \, (\mathrm{d} \theta)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The straight lines are described by equations of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \theta_0 \pm \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{ or } \quad \tanh r = \tanh r_0 \sec (\theta - \theta_0) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinates of the nearest point on the line to the pole.

==Quadrant model system==
The [[Poincaré half-plane model]] is closely related to a model of the hyperbolic plane in the quadrant ''Q'' = {(''x,y''): ''x'' &gt; 0, ''y'' &gt; 0}. For such a point the [[geometric mean]] &lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt {x y} &lt;/math&gt; and the [[hyperbolic angle]] &lt;math&gt;u = \ln \sqrt {x/y}&lt;/math&gt; produce a point (''u,v'') in the upper half-plane. The hyperbolic metric in the quadrant depends on the Poincaré half-plane metric. The [[hyperbolic motion|motions]] of the Poincaré model carry over to the quadrant; in particular the left or right shifts of the real axis correspond to [[hyperbolic rotation]]s of the quadrant. Due to the study of ratios in physics and economics where the quadrant is the universe of discourse, its points are said to be located by [[hyperbolic coordinates]].

==Cartesian-style coordinate systems ==

In hyperbolic geometry [[rectangles]] do not exist. The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry is always less than 4 [[right angle]]s (see [[Lambert quadrilateral]]). Also in hyperbolic geometry there are no equidistant lines (see [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]]). This all has influences on the coordinate systems.

There are however different coordinate systems for hyperbolic plane geometry. All are based on choosing a real (non [[ideal point|ideal]]) point (the [[Origin (mathematics)|Origin]]) on a chosen directed line (the ''x''-axis) and after that many choices exist.

===Axial coordinates ===

Axial coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; are found by constructing a ''y''-axis perpendicular to the ''x''-axis through the origin.&lt;ref name="martin analytic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=George E.|title=The foundations of geometry and the non-Euclidean plane|date=1998|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=0387906940|pages=447–450|edition=Corrected 4. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the coordinates are found by dropping perpendiculars from the point onto the ''x'' and ''y''-axes. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular on the ''x''-axis to the origin (regarded as positive on one side and negative on the other); ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular on the ''y''-axis to the origin.

Every point and most [[ideal point]]s have axial coordinates, but not every pair of real numbers corresponds to a point.

If &lt;math&gt; \tanh^2 (x_a) + \tanh^2 (y_a) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; P(x_a , y_a) &lt;/math&gt; is an ideal point.

If &lt;math&gt; \tanh^2 (x_a) + \tanh^2 (y_a) &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; P(x_a , y_a) &lt;/math&gt; is not a point at all.

The distance of a point &lt;math&gt;P(x_a , y_a)&lt;/math&gt; to the ''x''-axis is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {artanh}  \left( \tanh(y_a) \cosh(x_a) \right) &lt;/math&gt;.  To the ''y''-axis it is &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{artanh} \left( \tanh(x_a) \cosh(y_a) \right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The relationship of axial coordinates to polar coordinates (assuming the origin is the pole and that the positive ''x''-axis is the polar axis) is
:&lt;math&gt; x = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\tanh r \cos \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\tanh r \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\sqrt{\tanh^2 x + \tanh^2 y} \, ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = 2 \operatorname {artan} \, \left( \frac{\tanh y}{\tanh x + \sqrt{\tanh^2 x + \tanh^2 y} } \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lobachevsky coordinates===

The Lobachevsky coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; are found by dropping a perpendicular onto the ''x''-axis. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular to the ''x''-axis to the origin (positive on one side and negative on the other, the same as in [[#Axial coordinates|axial coordinates]]).&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt;

''y''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance along the perpendicular of the given point to its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other).

: &lt;math&gt; x_l = x_a \  , \  \tanh(y_l) = \tanh(y_a) \cosh(x_a) \  , \  \tanh(y_a) = \frac{\tanh(y_l)}{\cosh(x_l)} &lt;/math&gt;.

The Lobachevsky coordinates are useful for integration for length of curves&lt;ref name="Smorgorzhevsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smorgorzhevsky|first1=A.S.|title=Lobachevskian  geometry|date=1982|publisher=Mir|location=Moscow|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and area between lines and curves.{{Example needed}}

Lobachevsky coordinates are named after [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] one of the discoverers of [[hyperbolic geometry]].

Construct a Cartesian-like coordinate system as follows. Choose a line (the ''x''-axis) in the hyperbolic plane (with a standardized curvature of -1) and label the points on it by their distance from an origin (''x''=0) point on the ''x''-axis (positive on one side and negative on the other). For any point in the plane, one can define coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' by dropping a perpendicular onto the ''x''-axis. ''x'' will be the label of the foot of the perpendicular. ''y'' will be the distance along the perpendicular of the given point from its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other). Then the distance between two such points will be

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle x_1, y_1 \rangle, \langle x_2, y_2 \rangle) = \operatorname{arcosh} \left( \cosh y_1 \cosh (x_2 - x_1) \cosh y_2 - \sinh y_1 \sinh y_2 \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be derived from the formulas about [[hyperbolic triangle]]s.

The corresponding metric tensor is: &lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d} s)^2 = \cosh^2 y \, (\mathrm{d} x)^2 + (\mathrm{d} y)^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

In this coordinate system, straight lines are either perpendicular to the ''x''-axis (with equation ''x'' = a constant) or described by equations of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \tanh y = A \cosh x + B \sinh x \quad \text{ when } \quad A^2 &lt; 1 + B^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''B'' are real parameters which characterize the straight line.

The relationship of Lobachevsky coordinates to polar coordinates (assuming the origin is the pole and that the positive ''x''-axis is the polar axis) is
:&lt;math&gt; x = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\tanh r \cos \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = \operatorname {arsinh} \, (\sinh r \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \operatorname {arcosh} \, (\cosh x \cosh y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = 2 \operatorname {artan} \, \left( \frac{\sinh y}{\sinh x \cosh y + \sqrt{\cosh^2 x \cosh^2 y - 1} } \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Horocycle-based coordinate system ===

[[File:Horocycle-based coordinate system.svg|thumb|Horocycle-based coordinate system]]

Another coordinate system uses the distance from the point to the [[horocycle]] through the origin centered around &lt;math&gt; \Omega = (0, + \infty )&lt;/math&gt; and the arclength along this horocycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramsay|first1=Arlan|last2=Richtmyer|first2=Robert D.|title=Introduction to hyperbolic geometry|date=1995|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0387943390|pages=97–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Draw the [[horocycle]] ''h''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; through the origin centered at the [[ideal point]] &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; at the end of the ''x''-axis.

From point P draw the line ''p'' asymptotic to the ''x''-axis to the right [[ideal point]] &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the intersection of line ''p'' and horocycle ''h''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;.

The coordinate ''x''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;  is the distance from P to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; – positive if P is between ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;, negative if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is between P and &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;.

The coordinate ''y''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the arclength along horocycle ''h''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; from the origin to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;.

The distance between two points given in these coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle x_1, y_1 \rangle, \langle x_2, y_2 \rangle) = \operatorname{arcosh} ( \cosh (x_2 - x_1) + \tfrac12 (y_2 - y_1)^2 \exp (- x_1 - x_2) ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding metric tensor is: &lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d} s)^2 = (\mathrm{d} x)^2 + \exp (-2 x) \, (\mathrm{d} y)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The straight lines are described by equations of the form ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;a constant or

:&lt;math&gt; x = \tfrac12 \ln ( \exp (2 x_0) - (y - y_0)^2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinates of the point on the line nearest to the ideal point &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. having the largest value of ''x'' on the line).

==Model-based coordinate systems ==

Model-based coordinate systems use one of the [[hyperbolic geometry#models of hyperbolic plane|models of hyperbolic geometry]] and take the Euclidean coordinates inside the model as the hyperbolic coordinates.

===Beltrami coordinates ===

The Beltrami coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the [[Beltrami–Klein model]] of the hyperbolic plane, the ''x''-axis is mapped to the segment {{nowrap|(−1,0) − (1,0)}} and the origin is mapped to the centre of the boundary circle.&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt;

The following equations hold:

: &lt;math&gt; x_b = \tanh (x_a), \  y_b = \tanh(y_a) &lt;/math&gt;

===Poincaré coordinates ===

The Poincaré coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the [[Poincaré disk model]] of the hyperbolic plane,&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt; the ''x''-axis is mapped to the segment {{nowrap|(−1,0) − (1,0)}} and the origin is mapped to the centre of the boundary circle.

The Poincaré coordinates, in terms of the Beltrami coordinates, are:

: &lt;math&gt; x_p = \frac{x_b}{1+\sqrt{1 -x_b^2 - y_b^2 }}, \ \ 
y_p = \frac{y_b}{1+\sqrt{1 -x_b^2 - y_b^2 }} &lt;/math&gt;

===Weierstrass coordinates ===

The Weierstrass coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the [[hyperboloid model]] of the hyperbolic plane, the ''x''-axis is mapped to the (half) [[hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt;(t \ , \ 0 \ , \ \sqrt{t^2+1} ) &lt;/math&gt; and the origin is mapped to the point (0,0,1).&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt;

The point P with axial coordinates (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;) is mapped to

: &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\tanh x_a}{\sqrt{1 -\tanh^2 x_a - \tanh^2 y_a }} \ ,
\ \frac{\tanh y_a}{\sqrt{1 -\tanh^2 x_a - \tanh^2 y_a }} \ ,
\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 -\tanh^2 x_a - \tanh^2 y_a }} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

From [[Gyrovector space#triangle center]]

The study of [[triangle center]]s traditionally is concerned with Euclidean geometry, but triangle centers can also be studied in hyperbolic geometry. Using gyrotrigonometry, expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must ''not'' encapsulate the specification of the anglesum being 180 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajmaa.org/searchroot/files/pdf/v6n1/v6i1p18.pdf Hyperbolic Barycentric Coordinates],

'''Countersignaling''' or '''countersignalling''' is the behavior where agents with the highest level of a given property invest less into proving it than individuals with a medium level of the same property. This concept is primarily useful for analyzing human behavior and thus relevant to economics, sociology and psychology.

==Signals and signaling theory==
Many of the things that people and animals want to know about each other, such as toughness, cooperativeness or fertility, are not directly observable. Instead, observable indicators of these unobservable properties must be used to communicate them to others. These are signals. Signaling theory deals with predicting the level of effort that individuals, the signalers, should invest to communicate their properties to other individuals, the receivers, and how these receivers interpret their signals.

Two conditions have to be fulfilled before signaling theory should be applied. First, there has to be informational asymmetry between the signaler and receiver (I know more about my own level of toughness than you do). Second, the potential for divergence or conflict of interest between the signaler and receiver. Without either of these two conditions, there is no need for signals as the problem is merely one of communication. Once these conditions are fulfilled, signals have to be used by individuals to prove to the other person their underlying hidden property.

Much research is concerned with understanding what signals signalers should send to convince a receiver that they have a certain property, and what signals a receiver should be convinced by. One way of doing this is by putting money on the table just to prove that you can; someone without the property would not be able to do the same. For example, in biology [[peacock]]s expend energy on elaborate plumage that increase their risk of dying. By doing this they demonstrate their genetic fitness, as genetically less fit males can only grow small plumage, while genetically better individuals can grow larger ones. (In [[biology]], this is known as the [[handicap principle]].)

'''Countersignaling''' by contrast, is showing off by not showing off, or by playing humble. For instance, the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' are eager to flaunt their wealth, and often surround themselves with expensive luxury items. Those with old money are more understated, preferring not to waste money on such frivolities.&lt;ref name= "Rand"&gt;Nick Feltovich, Rick Harbaugh and Ted To, [http://kelley.iu.edu/riharbau/cs-randfinal.pdf "Too cool for school? Signalling and Countersignalling"], ''RAND Journal of Economics'', Vol. '''33''', Winter 2002, 630-649&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Conceptually"&gt;Conceptually.org, [https://conceptually.org/concepts/signalling-and-countersignalling/ "What are signalling and countersignalling?"], Date accessed: October 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of different models that deal with this behavior and explain how rational individuals – those interested only in maximising certain utility – would find countersignaling beneficial.

One of these is by Feltovich, Harbaugh and To.&lt;ref name= "Rand"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Signal failure? The economics of understatement. ''The Economist'' May 2003. Covering the same Feltlvich/Harbaugh/To paper.&lt;/ref&gt; They developed a formal model in which receivers of signals judge the senders of signals based not only on what can be inferred from the signal sent, but also on additional information, which is assumed to be helpful but not perfect. For example, senders might be of low, medium, or high quality, and the additional information might be adequate for distinguishing low from high but not necessarily from distinguishing medium from low or high. Under certain circumstances, medium-quality senders will have an incentive to signal (to ensure that they can be distinguished from low-quality ones), but high-quality senders may not—they are not likely to be mistaken for low-quality senders in any case, and signaling behavior may mark them as medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13247">Joachim Bodamer created the term [[prosopagnosia]] in 1947, which is a disorder where individuals have an inability to recognize faces of people.  Individuals with this disorder do not have the ability to overtly recognize faces, but discoveries have been made showing that people with this disorder have the ability to covertly recognize faces.  '''Covert facial recognition''' is the unconscious recognition of familiar faces by people with prosopagnosia.  The individuals who express this phenomenon are unaware that they are recognizing the faces of people they have seen before.&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simon, Stéphane R., Asaid Khateb, Alexandra Darque, François Lazeyras, Eugene Mayer, and Alan J. Pegna | year = 2011 | title =When the Brain Remembers, but the Patient Doesn’t: Converging FMRI and EEG Evidence for Covert Recognition in a Case of Prosopagnosia.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945210001978 | journal = Cortex | volume = 47 | issue =7 | pages = 825–838| doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2010.07.009 | pmid=20850714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of prosopagnosia, congenital and acquired.  Congenital prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize faces without a history of brain damage; while acquired prosopagnosia is caused by damage to the right occipital-temporal region of the brain.  In the 1950s it was theorized that the right cerebral hemisphere was involved in facial recognition and in the 1960s this theory was supported by many experiments.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt;

Although the ability for overt facial recognition is inhibited in patients with prosopagnosia, there have been many studies done which show that some of these individuals may have the ability to recognize familiar faces covertly.  These experiments have used behavioral and physiological measures in order to demonstrate covert facial recognition.  A common physiological measure that is used is the measure of autonomic activity by using skin-conductance responses (SCR) which show a larger response in individuals with prosopagnosia who are shown pictures of familiar faces compared to pictures of unfamiliar faces.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt;

==Theories and reasoning==
Many theories reside in the topic of cognitive facial recognition. First, the theory of contradiction between prosopagnosia and covert recognition. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces but is believed to stem from damage to the ventral route of the [[visual system]]. Whereas covert recognition is shown in people that lost their ability to recognize faces, implying an intact ventral limbic structure projecting to the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name=Bate&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bate, S. |author2=Cook, S.J. | year = 2012 | title =Covert recognition relies on affective valence in developmental prosopagnosia: Evidence from skin conductance response.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945208001159 | journal = Neuropsychology | volume = 26 | issue =6 | pages = 670–674 | doi=10.1037/a0029443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory two states that it cannot be observed in developmental cases of prosopagnosia, which was proposed by Grueter. Developmental prosopagnosia is a severe face processing impairment without brain damage and visual or thinking dysfunction but can sometimes run in families (some indications that there may be a genetic reason for the disorder). This theory is thought to rely on the activation of face representations created during the time of normal processing.&lt;ref name=Farah&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farah, Martha J. |author2=Randall C. O'reilly |author3=Shaun P. Vecera.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 1993 | title =Dissociated Overt and Covert Recognition as an Emergent Property of a Lesioned Neural Network.| url = http://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly/papers/FarahOReillyVecera93_psyrev.pdf| journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue =4 | pages = 571–588 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.4.571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contradicting the last theory, the affective valence in developmental prosopagnosia theory states that individuals may be processing faces on affective dimensions, feelings and emotions, rather than familiarity dimensions, previous occasions and when they met.&lt;ref name=Bate /&gt;

Next is the dual-route models theory, proposed by Bauer, and states covert recognition can be seen in people that endured a time of normal face processing before actually getting the condition. With this, there are two different types of covert recognition: behavioral and physiological. Behavioral covert recognition is measured by reaction time and occurs within a cognitive pathway consisting of face recognition units (FRUs), personality identity units (PINs) and semantic information units. Physiological covert recognition is measured by SCR and is the second route that mediates reactions to familiar faces. This theory can be explained by the disconnection of FRUs or that it may be that the face recognition system is intact but has been disconnected from a higher system enabling their conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Bate /&gt;

The parallel distributing process is a theory that proposes it would be easier to relearn previous known faces rather than to learn new ones. This process has three steps: the distributed information is represented, memory and knowledge for some things are not stored explicitly but are connected between nodes, learning can occur with gradual changes to the connections. Damaged networks are less effective by zeroing the weight of the connection. Each connection is embedded and is still faintly there, making it easier to relearn.&lt;ref name=Eimer&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eimer, M. |author2=A. Gosling |author3=B. Duchaine  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2012 | title =Electrophysiological Markers of Covert Face Recognition in Developmental Prosopagnosia. | url =http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/135/2/542 | journal = Brain | volume = 135 | issue =2| pages = 542–554 | doi=10.1093/brain/awr347 | pmid=22271660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories include one proposed by Bauer, states that neurological routes mediate overt recognition. His theory went with Bruce and Young’s theory that when using these three sequential stages in order, each stage will affect the next with overt mediation. The three stages are familiarity, occupation and name retrieval.&lt;ref name=Young1&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Young, A.W. |author2=Perrett, D.I. | year = 1992 | title =Face Recognition Impairments [and Discussion] | url =http://classic.rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/335/1273/47.short | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 335 | issue =1273 | pages = 47–54 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1992.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
One of the very first studies into the diversion of pathways of overt and covert facial processing was done by Bauer in 1984.&lt;ref name=Young1 /&gt; This study has been the basis for most of the other studies and literature that has been conducted on the topic of prosopagnosia and covert processing. Three other larger studies were performed. [[Event-related potential]] studies were done with 20 subjects who were clear of psychological disorders.  This was a face study using 315 faces and a string of characters. In each trial 30 of the faces were familiar and 90 novel faces were shown. Then, the 315 faces were shown and subjects were asked which were familiar. The faces were shown again from the first trial but without a string of letters. This resulted in higher load results for overt recognition with longer reaction time.  High load tasks led to the ability to recall far fewer faces when the task was performed.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rodriguez, Y.S. |author2=Fuster, J.I. |author3=Leon, M.A.B |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2008 | title =Covert and Overt face processing in healthy subjects: an ERP study. | url =http://www.ijbem.org/volume10/number4/100404.pdf| journal =  International Journal of Bioelectromagnetism | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages = 246–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second study was directly into covert facial recognition in prosopagnosia. In this study faces were taken from a set of 166 faces, hair and background were removed.  In the first task, 36 pictures were shown, half actors and have politicians.  When the face was shown the subject was asked if it was a politician or actor.  Both the control and prosopagnosia patients were able to identify which faces were which therefore reaction time was compared. The second task was to say which of the faces were famous in a set of forty famous and forty non-famous. Prosopagnosia subjects had little ability to make this distinction. Further, the third task also showed forty famous faces but instead of a random string written names were used. The faces remained until one was decided upon to match the name. The covert recognition was only present in two tasks.  This was not on the first task which was meant to prime and lead to the fact that the prime may be the impairment of prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt; SCR tests are often used to test covert facial processing but none of the experiments displayed significant results&lt;ref name=Sosa&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Valdés-Sosa, M. |author2=Bobes, M.

There are several problems that may damage the ability to properly perceive faces, many of these don’t have effects on both the covert and overt recognition of faces. Many of these problems only have an effect on the overt recognition of faces and leave the covert recognition intact.

Prosopagnosia is a disorder which causes the inability to use overt facial recognition.&lt;ref name=Groome&gt;{{cite book |last=Groome |first=David |date=2014 |title=An Introduction to Cognitive Psychology |location=27 Church Road, Hove, East Sussex BN3 2FA |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=126–134|isbn=9781848720923  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While people suffering from prosopagnosia often cannot identify whose face they are looking at they usually show signs of covert recognition. This can be seen in their ability to accurately guess information during forced choice tasks.&lt;ref name=Rivolta&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rivolta, Davide, Romina Palermo, Laura Schmalzl, and [[Max Coltheart]] | year = 2012 | title = Covert Face Recognition in Congenital Prosopagnosia: A Group Study.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211000190 | journal = Cortex | volume = 48 | issue =3 | pages = 344–352 | doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2011.01.005 | pmid=21329915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who are unable to identify faces of people that they know are still able to accurately guess information on the owners of the faces such as their professions and names.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fox, C. |author2=G. Iaria, J. Barton  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2008 | title =Disconnection in Prosopagnosia and Face Processing.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211000190 | journal = Cortex | volume = 44 | issue =8 | pages = 996–1009 | doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how confident of their answers the patients were, they would often give low ratings of confidence despite their high accuracy during the tests.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt; This shows that they are unable to overtly recognize the face but they are still able to recall information on the owners despite the fact that they can’t identify the owner.&lt;ref name=Young2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young, Garry | year = 2009 | title =In What Sense ‘familiar’?

While prosopagnosia patients are unable to overtly recognize faces, patients with [[Capgras delusion]] are unable to covertly recognize faces. People suffering from Capgras delusion are able to properly identify a face, but lack the covert recognition that is normally evoked by a familiar face. Before the delusion set in patients would normally have a sensation of familiarity and have a heightened response to faces that they recognize. Once the delusion has set in the patients no longer feel that the face they are looking at is familiar to them and they can’t access the feelings they normally held for the owner of the face despite the fact that they can properly identify who the face belongs to. This condition causes patients with Capgras delusion to believe that the person has been replaced with a look-alike imposter.&lt;ref name=Young2 /&gt;

'''Defeatism''' is the acceptance of defeat without struggle, often with negative connotations. It can be linked to [[pessimism]] in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defeatism. Retrieved 2014-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The term ''defeatism'' commonly is used in politics as a descriptor for an ideological stance that considers co-operation with the opposition party. In the military context, in wartime, and especially at the front, ''defeatism'' is synonymous with [[treason]].

Under military law, a soldier can be accused of being defeatist if he refuses to fight by voicing doubt of the ideological validity of national policy; thus, existential questions such as “Is the war already lost?” and “Is the fight worth the effort?” are defeatism that connote advocacy of an alternative end-to-the war other than military victory.

During [[World War II]], [[Adolf Hitler]] unexpectedly dismissed many generals for defeatism. During the last year of war, the German [[Volksgerichtshof|people's court]] executed many people accused of defeatist talks or acts and their names were announced weekly in a pink colored poster pasted on billboards around the country.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Koch: ''In the Name of the Volk: Political Justice in Hitler's Germany''. I.B. Tauris, 1997. {{ISBN|1860641741}} pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary defeatism ==
[[Revolutionary defeatism]] is a related idea, made most prominent by [[Vladimir Lenin]], that establishes that the [[proletariat]] cannot win or gain in a capitalist war. Instead, according to Lenin, the true enemy of the proletariat is the imperialist leaders who send their lower classes into battle. Workers would gain more from their own nations’ defeats, he argued, if the war could be turned into civil war and then international revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard (1977) ''Lenin For Beginners'', p. 118.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">A '''direct reference theory''' (also called '''referentialism'''&lt;ref name="Schroeder2006"/&gt; or '''referential realism''')&lt;ref name="Bianchi2012p79"&gt;Andrea Bianchi (2012) ''Two ways of being a (direct) referentialist'', in Joseph Almog, Paolo Leonardi, ''Having in Mind: The Philosophy of Keith Donnellan'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=CnTWQgtTtG0C&amp;pg=PA79 p. 79]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of language]] that claims that the meaning of a word or expression lies in what it points out in the world.&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt; The object denoted by a word is called its [[referent]]. Criticisms of this position are often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref name="Schroeder2006"&gt;Severin Schroeder (2006), ''Wittgenstein'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30]: "This view that the meaning of a word has to be explained in terms of what it stands for, its reference, I shall call referentialism."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, mathematician and philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]] argued against it, and contrasted it with [[mediated reference theory]].&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"&gt;Emery J. Hyslop-Margison, Ayaz Naseem (2007), ''Scientism and Education: Empirical Research as Neo-Liberal Ideology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=F5gveeSYcNQC&amp;pg=PA83 pp. 83–4]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, with his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', Wittgenstein argued against referentialism, famously saying that "the meaning of a word is its use."&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt; Direct reference theory is a position typically associated with [[logical positivism]]&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt; and [[analytical philosophy]]. Logical positivist philosophers in particular have significantly devoted their efforts in countering positions of the like of Wittgenstein's, and they aim at creating a "perfectly descriptive language" purified from [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] and confusions.&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt;

== John Stuart Mill ==
The [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]] was one of the earliest modern advocates of a direct reference theory beginning in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stainton|first=Robert J.|title=Philosophical Perspectives on Language|publisher=Broadview Press|year=1996|pages=61|isbn=978-1-55111-086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[A System of Logic]]'' Mill introduced a distinction between what he called "connotation" and "denotation." Connotation is a relation between a name (singular or general) and one or more attributes. For example, ‘widow’ denotes widows and connotes the attributes of being female, and of having been married to someone now dead. If a name is connotative, it denotes what it denotes in virtue of object or objects having the attributes the name connotes. Connotation thus determines denotation. The same object can, on the other hand, be denoted with several names with different connotations. A name can have connotation but no denotation. Connotation of a name, if it has one, can be taken to be its meaning in Mill.&lt;ref name="Helsinki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/filosofia/s2008/MillFrege.doc|title=John Stuart Mill – Connotation and Denotation|year=2008|publisher=University of Helsinki|accessdate=2009-01-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mill, most individual concrete names are connotative, but some, namely proper names, are not. In other words, proper names do not have meaning. All general terms, on the other hand, are according to Mill connotative. In sum, Mill’s overall picture resembles very much the description theory of reference, though his take on proper names is an exception.&lt;ref name="Helsinki" /&gt;

== Bertrand Russell ==
[[Saul Kripke]], a proponent of direct reference theory, in his ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' dubbed [[mediated reference theory]] the "[[Frege–Russell view]]" and criticized it (see [[#Saul Kripke|below]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke]], ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that [[Bertrand Russell]]'s views on reference theory were the same as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Wettstein, "Frege-Russell Semantics?", ''Dialectica'' '''44'''(1–2), 1990, pp. 113–135, esp. 115: "Russell maintains that when one is acquainted with something, say, a present sense datum or oneself, one can refer to it without the mediation of anything like a Fregean sense. One can refer to it, as we might say, ''directly''."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saul Kripke ==
[[Saul Kripke]] defended direct reference theory when applied to proper names. Kripke claims that proper names do not have any "senses" at all, because senses only offer contingent facts about things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kripke|first=Saul |title=Naming and Necessity|publisher=Basil Blackwell|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] advanced a theory of direct reference for proper names at a symposium in which [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and Kripke were participants: published in ''[[Synthese]]'', 1961 with Discussion in ''Synthese'' 1962. She called directly referring proper names "tags" (see [[tag theory of names]]). Kripke urged such a theory in 1971 and thereafter. He called such directly referring proper names "[[rigid designator]]s".

Kripke articulated this view using the formal apparatus of [[possible worlds]]. The possible worlds thought-experiment first takes the subject, and then tries to imagine the subject in other possible worlds. Taking George W. Bush, for example. First (1) the thought-experiment must state that the name "George W. Bush" is the name used to describe the particular individual man that is typically meant. Then (2), the experimenter must imagine the possible states of affairs that reality could have been - where Bush was not president, or went into a different career, was never born at all, etc. When this is done, it becomes obvious that the phrase "President of the United States in 2004" does not necessarily describe George W. Bush, because it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] in all possible worlds; it only contingently describes him. By contrast, for instance, the word "apple" will always describe the same things across all possible worlds, because of premise (1). So use of the word "apple" to describe apples is true in all possible worlds.

Terms that are true across all possible worlds in this way are called "[[rigid designator]]s".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">In [[United States patent law]], the '''doctrine of inherency''' holds that, under certain circumstances, [[prior art]] may be relied upon not only for what it expressly teaches, but also for what is inherent therein, i.e., what necessarily flows from the express teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2112.html MPEP § 2112]&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[patent]] [[claim (patent)|claim]] to be valid, its subject-matter must be [[novelty (patent)|novel]] and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obvious]]. The claim is anticipated (i.e. will fail because its subject-matter is not novel) if a single [[prior art]] reference, either expressly or inherently, discloses every feature of the claimed invention. The concept of inherency is predicated on the idea that a claim should not pass the test of anticipation merely because a feature of it is undisclosed or unrecognized in the prior art reference. A prior art source may thus still anticipate if an apparently missing element of the claim is inherent in that prior art source.

Procedurally, to rely on the doctrine of inherency, one must provide a basis in fact and/or technical reasoning supporting a determination that an allegedly inherent characteristic necessarily would be present if the teachings of the prior art were followed, even if the inherent feature would not have been recognized.

The fact that a certain result or characteristic may occur or be present in the prior art is not alone sufficient to establish inherency of that result or characteristic. To establish inherency, the evidence must make clear that the missing matter is ''necessarily'' present in the prior art reference.  Inherency may not be established by probabilities or possibilities.

Once the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) establishes that a product referenced in prior art appears to be substantially identical, the burden shifts to the applicant to show a non-obvious difference.

The doctrine of inherency is typically invoked when an [[inventor (patent)|inventor]] tries to obtain a ''product'' patent for a product that had been unintentionally invented earlier ("accidental anticipation").

The [[United States Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Tilghman v. Proctor]]'' that where the first, accidental producer was not aware of the product and did not attempt to produce it, the first production did not bar a patent on the subsequent "invention" of the product. 102 U.S. 707 (1880).

The use of the doctrine of inherency in a determination of obviousness is more complicated because "[t]hat which may be inherent is not necessarily known and that which is unknown cannot be obvious."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170801178 ''Honeywell International Inc. v. Mexichem Amanco Holding,'' 865 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent applicant may use the doctrine of inherency to respond to a rejection for [[Sufficiency_of_disclosure#Written_description_and_possession|lack of an adequate written description]] by showing that the [[patent application]] inherently includes the disclosure that is allegedly lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2163.html MPEP § 2163]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics}}
'''Emergent democracy''' refers to the rise of political structures and behaviors without [[economic planning|central planning]] and by the action of many individual participants, especially when mediated by the Internet. More recently, [[Clay Shirky]] has referred to this as "[[Here Comes Everybody|the power of organizing without organizations]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Shirky
  | first = Clay
  | authorlink = Clay Shirky
  | title = [[Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations]]
  | publisher = The Penguin Press HC
  | page= Subtitle
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 1-59420-153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined to stand in contrast to more traditional forms of democracy, such as [[representational democracy]] and [[direct democracy]]. The phrase draws upon [[emergence]] theory for the idea that the simple actions of individuals can collectively create complex and unpredictable results, as when the behavior of [[termites]] results in large, efficient nests beyond the comprehension of any individual participant.

In the paper that first drew attention to the term,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracyPaper
|title=a "EmergentDemocracyPaper"
|accessdate=March 5, 2007

|date=2003-02-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joi Ito]] expresses a hope that the [[Internet]], as a large and decentralized network, will enable innovative responses by citizens to highly complex problems. From its outset, emergent democracy has been seen arising most clearly among bloggers who, as a decentralized network of writers, can provide a fuller airing and development of ideas than can the relatively limited resources of traditional media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-596-10227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the idea point to instances in which [[blogs|bloggers]] have brought about political change by posting about issues that mainstream media had not paid much attention to. The canonical example of emergent democracy was the December 2002 resignation of [[Trent Lott]] as [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[majority leader]] after bloggers publicized his praising of [[Strom Thurmond]]'s 1948 [[Racial segregation|segregation]]ist campaign for the [[President of the United States|presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillmor, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, pp. 61–66&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Ito had been vocal about issues with Japanese democracy, and had spoken at Davos about how broken he felt Japanese democracy was. "Afterwards, Ms. Ogata, the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me that I should stop ranting as a Japanese and think more about global democracy and global issues," he posted. "These words stuck with me and last year I tried to think about blogs and emergent democracy outside of the Japanese context." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=2004-02-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He organized a group effort to discuss and document the emergent democracy concept, using a term initially coined by [[Ross Mayfield]]. He announced meetings on his weblog, inviting his readers to attend a [[conference call]] that was augmented by [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chat for posting realtime visual cues and backchannel conversation, and a [[wiki]] for gathering notes from the call. This "multimodal" approach was called a "happening" by Ross Mayfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author=Joi Ito
|authorlink=Joi Ito
|date=2003-04-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation resulted in Ito's online article that generated discussions about the potential for weblogs and other [[social software]] tools to influence participation in governance. The discussion and notes were captured in a paper that was placed on a wiki for collaborative editing and enhancement. [[Jon Lebkowsky]] edited the wiki version, and published it as a chapter in the 2005 book ''Extreme Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''fair trade debate''' is a debate around alleged issues with the [[Fairtrade]] brand. The debate surrounds the ethics and alleged economic implications of [[fair trade]]. Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems. One 2015 study in a journal published by the [[MIT Press]] concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as Fair Trade was actually sold on Fair Trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Janvry|first1=Alain|last2=McIntosh|first2=Craig|last3=Sadoulet|first3=Elisabeth|title=Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool?|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2015|volume=97|issue=3|pages=567–573|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00512|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/REST_a_00512|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, P. and L.

== Ethical basis of criticisms==

Although there is evidence to suggest that consumers buy fair trade goods for a variety of reasons, some are willing to pay more for Fairtrade certified products – for example, in the belief that this helps the very poor.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Niemi, N. (2010). "Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers." Journal of Business Ethics , 97:257-270; Trudel, R., &amp; Cotte, J. (2009). Does it pay to be good? MIT Sloan Management Review. , Winter; Arnot, C., Boxall, P., &amp; Cash, S. (2006). Do ethical consumers care about price? A revealed preference analysis of Fair Trade coffee purchases. Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics , 54: 555–565.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the [[Fairtrade]] brand have argued against the system on an ethical basis, stating that the system diverts profits from the poorest farmers, and that the profit is received by corporate firms. It has been argued that this causes "death and destitution".&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite journal|author=Griffiths, P.|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=105|issue=3|pages=357|date=July 2011|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Ethical%20Objections%20to%20Fairtrade%20web.pdf|publisher=www.springerlink.com}} Accessed at [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm Why Fairtrade isn't fair].&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used as evidence to doubt that much of the extra money paid reaches farmers, and that there is reason to believe that Fairtrade harms non-Fairtrade farmers. There are criticisms that false claims made for fair trade and the withholding of relevant information constitute Unfair Trading under EU law. There are also criticisms using many other criteria.&lt;ref name=Many&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) "Half a Cheer for Fair Trade", Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; {{cite journal|author=Griffiths, P.|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=105|issue=3|pages=357|date=July 2011|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Ethical%20Objections%20to%20Fairtrade%20web.pdf|publisher=www.springerlink.com}} Accessed at [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm Why Fairtrade isn't fair]

Fair Trade: Benefits and Drawbacks for Producers. Puente @ Europa - , Año IV, Número 2 - Junio 2006, 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, pro-Fairtrade researcher Alastair Smith claims that while some of these criticisms are grounded in acceptable standards of evidence (and deserve serious attention), others are less well elaborated, and that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alastair|title=A Response to the Adam Smith Report &amp; A New Way to Think About Measuring the Content of the Fair Trade Cup Alastair|journal=Comment and Analysis|year=2008|url=http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/TheFairTradeCupResponsetoAdamSmithD9_1.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a few cases, the criticisms presented are assertions with little or no credible evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alastair|title=Fair Trade, Diversification and Structural Change: Towards a broader theoretical framework of analysis|journal=Oxford Development Studies|year=2008|volume=37|issue=4|pages=457–478|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/6918/|doi=10.1080/13600810903305208}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these claims have themselves been criticized on matters of fact, theory, methodology, use of evidence and incorrect citations.&lt;ref name=Rigour/&gt;{{rp|45–49}}&lt;ref name=Rejoinder&gt;Griffiths, P.: 2011, [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm "Rejoinder: False Statements, Misrepresentation and Distortion in Defending Fairtrade"], Economic Affairs, 103–4.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==What happens to the money==

=== Little money reaches the developing world ===

The evidence available suggests that little of the extra money paid by consumers actually reaches the farmers. [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] does not monitor how much more money retailers charge for Fairtrade goods. Furthermore, retailers almost never sell identical Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade lines side by side, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much reaches the producers in spite of Unfair Trading legislation.&lt;ref name=Directive&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005L0029:EN:HTML Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;   In a very few cases, it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative;&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi&lt;ref&gt;Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N. (2010). “Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers.” Journal of Business Ethics, 97:257-270.&lt;/ref&gt;  found that consumers paid much more for Fairtrade, and that only 11.5% of that reached the exporter. Kilian, Jones, Pratt and Villalobos&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research, 59(3), 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt; talk of US Fairtrade coffee getting $5 per lb extra at retail, of which the exporter would have received only 2%. Mendoza and Bastiaensen&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). "Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias." Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt; calculated that in the UK only 1.6% to 18% of the extra charged for one product line reached the farmer. Critics claim that many counter-examples would be needed to show that these are not typical. Since Fairtrade charges a 1.9% licensing fee at wholesale, the maximum that reaches the developing world, even if traders charge unrealistically low margins, is 50%, and a much smaller amount would reach the target farmers.

=== Less money reaches farmers===

The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur certification and inspection fees, additional marketing costs, costs in meeting the Fairtrade political standards, and possibly costs arising from the monopoly power of the cooperative. Farmers also incur additional production costs on all of their production, even if only a small amount is sold at Fairtrade prices. Over the years, Fairtrade producers have only been able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified, selling the rest without certification at world prices.  While both proponents and opponents of Fairtrade acknowledge this problem,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C. E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt; there are scarce economic studies presenting the actual revenues of Fairtrade cooperatives and how they spend their money. Weber (2006) examined the additional marketing costs of some cooperatives and found, for example, that '.  .  . after six years Oro Verde can cover only 70 percent of its [additional marketing] costs with its current income stream' and that the cooperative needs to double its current annual export volume in order to sustain its management team. At the time they were losing money on their Fairtrade membership.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, J. (2006). Rationing in the Fair Trade Coffee Market: Who enters and How? International colloquium on fair trade and sustainable development. Montreal: Ecole des Sciences de la Gestion, Universite du Quebec.&lt;/ref&gt; FLO figures&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International.: 2010, [http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf Annual Report 2009-2010]. Retrieved May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; show that 40% of the money reaching the developing world is spent on 'business and production', which includes the costs mentioned above as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

There is no evidence that Fairtrade farmers get higher prices on average {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Some anecdotes state farmers are paid more by traders than by Fairtrade cooperatives and some state that they were paid less. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,&lt;ref&gt;See Bowbrick, P, "Are price reporting systems of any use?", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65-69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on Third World market information systems is given at http://www.sim2g.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; and few appreciate the complexity of different price packages. A different price package may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they may pay more or less than traders, depending on the day. Bassett (2009) &lt;ref&gt;Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same [[Monopsony|monopsonistic]] ginneries, which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs of producing Fairtrade. For instance, when Fairtrade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, they earned a higher price per pound but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research, 59(3), 322–330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap? Ecological Economics, 68 3018-3025; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that Fairtrade guarantees a 'fair price' for the producer is not supported by the evidence and although it is possible that Fair Trade may do so on occasions, there is no reason to believe that this is normal.

=== Lack of evidence of impact===
Some critics argue that there have been very few fair trade impact studies. Griffiths (2011)&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; says that very few of the attempts made meet the normal standards for an [[impact evaluation]], such as comparing the before and after situation, having meaningful control groups, allowing for the fact that Fairtrade recruits farmers who are already better off, allowing for the fact that a Fairtrade cooperative receives aid from a dozen other organizations – government departments, aid agencies, donor countries, and NGOs, and allowing for the fact that Fairtrade may harm other farmers. Other serious methodological problems arise in sampling, in comparing prices, and from the fact that the social projects of Fairtrade do not usually aim to produce economic benefits.

Indeed, due to the snapshot nature of research, few studies include how long producers have been involved with fair trade. A further significant problem is that most studies ignore the agency and perspective of producer decision makers, especially the farmers excluded from the Fairtrade system. Capturing such socially constructed benefit, including that of confidence in business relationships, is notoriously difficult to capture in social science research.

An important distinction when discussing Fairtrade is the difference between impact studies and case studies.&lt;ref name=Rigour/&gt;{{rp|40–96}} Case studies are valuable for, among other things, researching specific systems and sub-systems, for constructing models, and for identifying problems. However, the impacts noted cannot be extrapolated generally. For instance, if a hundred dairy farms lose money, this does not mean that all or most dairy farms do. There are a lot of case studies on Fairtrade, but many are erroneously referred to as impact studies.

An unpublished consultancy report prepared for Fairtrade&lt;ref&gt;
Nelson, V., &amp; Pound, B.: 2009, [http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/resources/natural_resources_institute.aspx The Last Ten Years: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature on the Impact of Fairtrade"].&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have found only 33 studies that met their criteria for impact studies (which accept studies that would not be acceptable to the World Bank etc.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Angelucci, M., &amp; Di Maro, V. (2010). Project Evaluation and Spillover Effects. Impact Evaluation Guidelines. Washington, DC: Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-136 (Inter-American Development Bank). Accessed at the [http://www-personal.umich.edu/ U-M Personal World Wide Web server];  Clemens, M. A., &amp; Demombynes, G. (2010). When Does Rigorous Impact Evaluation Make a Difference? The Case of the Millennium Villages. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 5477; Winters, P., Maffioli, A., &amp; Salazar, L. (2011). Introduction to the Special Feature: Evaluating the Impact of Agricultural Projects in Developing Countries. Journal of Agricultural Economics , vol. 62, no. 2, 393–402 {{doi|10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00296.x}}; Winters, P., Salazar, L., &amp; Maffioli, A. (2010).

Washington DC: Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-198. (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; for instance). These included unpublished undergraduate and masters' dissertations, unpublished theses, journalistic articles by employees or members of Fairtrade cooperatives, several reports on the same cooperatives, and one report cited under two different titles. Griffiths (2011) claims that most of these reports had significant methodological weaknesses, and that few, if any, met the normal criteria for impact studies. Further, most of the cases studied were atypical.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

== Inefficient marketing system ==
One reason for low prices is that Fairtrade farmers are forced to sell through a [[Monopsony|monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink calls fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and [[overproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Brink, Lindsey. (2004). [http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf Grounds for Complaint]. URL accessed on September 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes good are over produced and a fair trade product will be sold in a non fair trade market. If consumers find out they will not want to pay the premium for fair trade.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A. (2015). Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool? The review of economics and statistics, 97(3), 567-573&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption===

Low prices may also occur because the Fair Trade marketing system provides more opportunities for corruption than the normal marketing system, and less possibility of, or incentive for, controlling it. Corruption has been noted in false labelling of coffee as Fairtrade by retailers and by packers in the developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, September 8).

== Fairtrade helps the rich==

Fair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries. It is also aimed at richer farmers: in order to join Fairtrade, cooperatives must meet quality and political standards which means their farmers must be relatively skillful, educated and well capitalized, and critics point out that these farmers are, therefore, far from the poorest farmers. The majority of Fairtrade suppliers are in the higher income or middle income developing countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, with relatively few in the poorest countries. Mexico has 70 times the GNP per head of Sierra Leone, and very much larger coffee farms. The minimum wage of agricultural workers in Peru is $3 a day and the average income of Fairtrade farmers in Bolivia was US$900/year, very much higher than normal agricultural incomes in Africa and much of Asia. Again, critics say this is diverting money from the poorest farmers.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

==Fairtrade harms other farmers==

===The overproduction argument===

Critics argue that Fairtrade, but not all other Fair Trade businesses, harm all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on better techniques, both of which will lead to increased output being sold on the global market.

In addition, the Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, and particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists. This argument is often illustrated with the example of Vietnam paying its coffee farmers over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Rigour&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peter|first=Griffiths|title=Lack of rigour in defending Fairtrade: a reply to Alastair Smith|journal=Economic Affairs|volume=31|pages=103–104|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2010.02058.x|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Lack%20of%20rigour%20in%20defending%20fairtrade.pdf|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith (2010) questioned the relevance of the Vietnam example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Fairtrade|title=Lack of Rigour on Defending Fairtrade: Some important clarrifications of a distorting account – a reply to Perter Griffiths|journal=Economic Affairs|year=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=50–53|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2010.02011.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Griffiths published a sharp rejoinder.&lt;ref name=Rejoinder/&gt;

The overproduction argument depends on the assumption that there is a significant increase in prices paid to Fairtrade farmers. The argument falls away if, as Fairtrade Labelling Organization&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International. (2013). [http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html Coffee]. Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International.&lt;/ref&gt; and critics state, farmers do not get a higher price. This is not much of a defence however since saying only one of two serious flaws is possible at any one time still means the system is flawed.

===Counter-argument===
Key principles of fair trade include transparency and capacity building. ([[World Fair Trade Organization|WFTO]] Fair trade principles). Particularly in the developing world, it is very common for small-scale farmers to have only one or two buyers for their commodity products.  Prices thus can be set by the buyers along with quality criteria.  Normally buyers do not provide transparency as to the weighing and grading of product.  Unless the buyers are linked to a quality supply chain (such as a fair trade or organic supply chain), the buyers normally do not provide any capacity building as to how to improve the quality of the product and thus gain a higher price.  Fair trade when practiced well must provide full transparency in terms of pricing, weighing, and quality standards.   Also as the end goal is a superior quality product in all ways, good fair trade organizations provide good capacity building in terms of best production, harvest, and post-harvest practices.  From my personal experience (with Green Net, Thailand) and helping many other farmer groups to develop along this path in the region, it is clear that when one honest and transparent buyer enters the local market, it forces other buyers to be more honest and transparent.  Additionally in communities where farmers talk to each other (regardless of whether one is a member of a fair trade group or not), I have witnessed that there is knowledge transfer.  Thus non-fair trade farmers may and often do improve their production, harvest, and post-harvest practices, yielding a higher quality product, which merits a higher price.  This combined with a freer and more transparent market, thanks to the entry of a buyer (the fair trade buyer), means that non-fair trade farmers now are much more likely to be paid for the quality of their products and at the real market prices.

S. (2002). Fighting the tide: alternative trade organizations in the era of global free trade. World Development, 30(6), 949–958.&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of this, both using what they agree is an unrealistic model.

===Diverting aid from other farmers===
Fairtrade supporters boast of 'The Honeypot Effect' – that cooperatives which become Fairtrade members then attract additional aid from other NGO charities, government and international donors as a result of their membership.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting, K. (2009). Assessing the impact of Fair Trade Coffee: Towards an Integrative Framework. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:127-149. p. 141 ; Murray, D., Raynolds, L., &amp; Taylor, P. (2003). One cup at a time: Poverty alleviation and Fair Trade coffee in Latin America. Colorado State University; Luetchford P (2006). Brokering Fairtrade: relations between coffee producers and Alternative Trade Organizations - a view from Costa Rica' in D. Lewis and D.

Ecological Economics, 68 p. 3024&lt;/ref&gt; Typically there are now six to twelve other donors. Critics point out that this inevitably means that resources are being removed from other, poorer, farmers. It also makes it impossible to argue that any positive or negative changes in the living standards of farmers are due to Fairtrade rather than to one of the other donors.

==Other ethical issues==

===Secretiveness ===

Under EU law (Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) advertising or selling information 'contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.'&lt;ref name=Directive/&gt; Griffiths (2011)&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; points to false claims that Fairtrade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failures to disclose the extra price charged for Fairtrade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-Fairtrade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries, which is, again, a criminal offence.

===Imposing one's politics===

The Fairtrade criteria presuppose a set of political values as to what economic, environmental, and social problems exist and how they are to be solved. Some critics state that it is unethical to bribe developing world producers to act according to political viewpoints that they may not agree with, and the consumers providing the money may not agree with. These critics also state that the unorthodox marketing system imposed, aiming to replace capitalism, may not tie in with the objectives of producers, consumers, importers or retailers.&lt;ref name=Many/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boersma, F. (2009). The urgency and necessity of a different type of market: the perspective of producers organized within the Fair Trade market. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:51-61; Boersma, F. V. (2002). [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/FairTradeResearchGroup Poverty Alleviation through Participation in Fair Trade Coffee Networks: The Case of UCIRI, Oaxaca, Mexico].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Audebrand, L., &amp; Pauchant, T. (2009). Can the Fair Trade Movement enrich Traditional Business Ethics? An Historical Study of its founders in Mexico. Journal of Business Ethics, 87:343-353; Gendron, C., V., B., &amp; Rance, A.

Ethical Value-Added: Fair Trade and the Case of Cafe Fenenino. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:27-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical selling techniques ===

Booth says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of Fairtrade are bullying, misleading and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) "Half a Cheer for Fair Trade", Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Booth, P. (2008). [http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&amp;ID=437 The Economics of Fairtrade: a Christian perspective]. London: Institute of Economic Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Smith, Sally|displayauthors=etal|url=http://projects.nri.org/nret/idswp223.pdf|title=Ethical Trade in African Horticulture: Gender, Rights and Participation|year=2004|isbn=1-85864-833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julie Guthman | year = 2007 | journal = Antipode | title = The Polanyian Way? Voluntary Food Labels as Neoliberal Governance | volume = 39 | number = 3 | pages = 456–478 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00535.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misleading volunteers ===

A lot of people volunteer to work to support Fairtrade. They may do unpaid work for firms, or market Fairtrade in schools, universities, local governments or parliament. Sometimes they do not appreciate that most or all the benefit may go to businesses in rich countries. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, "Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies", Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; report that Day Chocolate "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

===Failure to monitor standards===
There have been complaints that Fairtrade standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes imposing months of additional work for little return.&lt;ref&gt;Utting-Chamorro, K. (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, 15(3, 4); Moberg M (2005). "Fairtrade and Eastern Caribbean Banana Farmers: Rhetoric and Reality in the Anti-Globalization Movement." Human Organization 64:4-16, Cited in Nelson and Pound (2009) p 10; Valkila, J.: 2009, "Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap?" Ecological Economics, 68, p. 3023 Fraser (2009) cited in Griffiths, P. (2012), [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm "Ethical Objections to Fairtrade"], Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 {{DOI|10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0}} Retrieved 2 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been claims that adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor and that enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is very weak, notably by Christian Jacquiau.&lt;ref name=Hamel&gt;{{cite web|author=Hamel, I.|year=2006|title=Fairtrade Firm Accused of Foul Play|publisher=Swiss Info |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232|accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations.&lt;ref name=Hamel/&gt; There is criticism of poor enforcement: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, August 9). 'Fair' coffee workers paid below minimum wage. Financial Times; Weitzman, H. (2006, September 9). 'Ethical-coffee' workers paid below legal minimum. Financial Times.&lt;/ref&gt; some non-Fairtrade coffee is sold as Fairtrade;&lt;ref name=Weitzman&gt;{{cite web |author=Weitzman, H.|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340.html |title= The bitter cost of 'fair trade' coffee |work= FT.com|publisher=Financial Times|date=September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the standards are not very strict in the case of seasonally hired labour in coffee production";&lt;ref&gt;Valkila, J.: 2009, 'Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap?' Ecological Economics, 68, 3018-3025.&lt;/ref&gt; "some fair trade standards are not strictly enforced";&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D.: 2009, 'What do Corporations have to do with Fair Trade? Positive and normative analysis from a value chain perspective', Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 3-26. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and supermarkets may avoid their responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G., Gibbon, J., &amp; Slack, R.: 2006, "The mainstreaming of Fair Trade: a macromarketing perspective",  Journal of Strategic Marketing, 14, 329-352.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name=Weitzman/&gt;

== Trade justice and fair trade==

Segments of the [[trade justice]] movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger impact on disadvantaged producers' lives. [[France|French]] author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce inéquitable''.&lt;ref&gt;Boris, Jean-Pierre. (2005). Commerce inéquitable. Hachette Littératures. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political objections==

There have been largely political criticisms of Fairtrade, both from the left and the right.
Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. [[France|French]] author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce équitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e. partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous trading system. Jacquiau is also a staunch supporter of significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the impact, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquiau, Christian. (2006). Les Coulisses du Commerce Équitable. Éditions Mille et Une Nuits. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine S. Dolan (2008), ''Research in Economic Anthropology'', "Arbitrating risk through moral values: the case of Kenyan fairtrade", volume 28, pp. 271–296&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the criticisms of Fairtrade from the free market approach to economics appear to be linked to right wing political approaches, but this does not mean that their analysis in this particular case is unacceptable to mainstream economists.

'''Frances Power Cobbe''' (4 December 1822 – 5 April 1904) was an Irish writer, social reformer, anti-[[vivisection]] activist, and leading [[women's suffrage]] campaigner. She founded a number of animal advocacy groups, including the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] (NAVS) in 1875, and the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) in 1898, and was a member of the executive council of the London [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]].

She was the author of a number of books and essays, including ''The Intuitive Theory of Morals'' (1855), ''On the Pursuits of Women'' (1863), ''Cities of the Past'' (1864), ''Criminals, Idiots, Women and Minors'' (1869), ''Darwinism in Morals'' (1871), and ''Scientific Spirit of the Age'' (1888).

==Life==
[[File:Frances Power Cobbe's canine companion.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Hajjin was Frances Power Cobbe's canine companion and traveled with her and her partner, Mary Lloyd, to Wales after Cobbe retired]]

Frances was a member of the prominent [[Cobbe family]], descended from Archbishop [[Charles Cobbe]], [[Primate of Ireland]]. She was born in [[Newbridge Estate|Newbridge House]] in the family estate in what is now [[Donabate]], Co. Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cobbe, Frances Power, with [[Blanche Atkinson]] |title=Life of Frances Power Cobbe as told by herself, |year=1904|location=London|publisher=S. Sonnenschein &amp; co|page=74|url=https://archive.org/details/lifefrancespowe02atkigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobbe worked at the [[Red Lodge Museum, Bristol|Red Lodge Reformatory]] and lived with the owner, [[Mary Carpenter]], from 1858 to 1859, but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school and moved out.&lt;ref&gt;Saywell, R J, ''Mary Carpenter of Bristol'', The University of Bristol, 1964 (2001 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

Cobbe formed a relationship with the Welsh sculptor [[Mary Lloyd]] (1819-1896), whom she met in Rome in 1861 and lived with from 1864 until Lloyd's death. That death, in 1896, affected Cobbe badly. Her friend, the writer [[Blanche Atkinson,]] writing, “The sorrow of Miss Lloyd’s death changed the whole aspect of existence for Miss Cobbe. The joy of life had gone. It had been such a friendship as is rarely seen – perfect in love, sympathy, and mutual understand.” &lt;ref&gt; Shopland, Norena 'Frances and Mary' from ''Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales'' Seren Books (2017) &lt;/ref&gt; Around 1891 and in danger of losing their home at [[Hengwrt]], in which Lloyd had inherited a share on the death of her parents, the couple were relieved by a legacy of over £25,000 from the widow of [[Richard Vaughan Yates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Sally|title=Frances Power Cobbe: Victorian Feminist, Journalist, Reformer|year=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|pages=144, 335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAaC5cVOuuoC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are buried together at Saint Illtud Church Cemetery, [[Llanelltyd]], [[Gwynedd]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Sally|title=Frances Power Cobbe: Victorian Feminist, Journalist, Reformer|year=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|pages=139–147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAaC5cVOuuoC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In letters and published writing, Cobbe referred to Lloyd alternately as "husband," wife," and "dear friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFRWylXaAtAC&amp;pg=PA51|title=Between Women: Friendship, Desire, and Marriage in Victorian England |first=Sharon |last=Marcus|publisher= |year= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobbe founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection (SPALV) in 1875, the world's first organisation campaigning against animal experiments, and in 1898 the BUAV, two groups that remain active. She was a member of the executive council of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and writer of editorial columns for London newspapers on [[suffrage]], property rights for women, and opposition to [[vivisection]]. Around 1880, with Louise Twining, she founded Homes for Workhouse Girls.&lt;ref&gt;Yeo, Eileen Janes (1992) Social motherhood and the sexual communion of labour in British Social Science, 1850-1950, ''[[Women's History Review]]'', 1:1, 63-87, DOI:

Cobbe met the Darwin family during 1868. [[Emma Darwin]] liked her, "Miss Cobbe was very agreeable." Frances persuaded [[Charles Darwin]] to read [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Metaphysics of Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Browne, Janet|title=Charles Darwin: The Power of Place|year=2002|publisher=Alfred A.

In [[philosophy]], a '''grouped event'''&lt;ref name="events"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/events/ Events, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; is the experience of two or more events that occur in sequence or concurrently that can be subsequently categorized.

== Description ==
Grouped events can fall into categories depending upon whether the events are causal or acausal (noncausal), and are with or without meaning (significance). Causal&lt;ref name="dict1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/causality definition of causality at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; events are related as the subsequent event(s) are understood to be a consequence of the prior event(s).
Meaning&lt;ref name="dict2"&gt;
[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meaning definition of meaning at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; represents the purpose or significance of something.

Four categories are [[causality]], [[coincidence]], [[serendipity]], and [[synchronicity]].

'''Causality'''&lt;ref name="cause"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-process/ Causation, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; represents causal events grouped without meaning. These are common events.

'''Coincidence'''&lt;ref name="coinc"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/ Coincidence, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; represents acausal events grouped without meaning. These are less common events.

'''Serendipity'''&lt;ref name="seren"&gt;[http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/2/631 Serendipity: Anatomy of the Unsought Finding, Oxford Journals]&lt;/ref&gt; represents causal events grouped by meaning. These are rare events.

'''Synchronicity'''&lt;ref name="synch"&gt;[http://www.carl-jung.net/synchronicity.html What is Sychronicity?, Carl Jung Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; represents acausal events grouped by meaning. These events are unlikely to occur by chance and may represent an outlier effect.

== Examples ==
A '''causality''' example is to strike a cue ball with a pool stick to make it move. The result is expected and has no meaning.

A '''coincidence''' example is two friends from the same town finding each other at the same time in the town's library without any planning. The result is unexpected, yet has no meaning (significance).

A '''serendipity''' example is finding something useful while looking for something else, such as finding the cue ball while looking for the pool stick. The find was caused by the search, and because the find was useful, the event has meaning.

A '''sychronicity''' example is two friends who rarely visit libraries, without any planning, finding each other in a library on one day; and again without any planning, finding each other in a distant library on a later date. Not only is the result unexpected, the friends find the event to have meaning (significance), because of the remote chance of the event.

== Criticisms and interpretations ==
Determinism theory&lt;ref name="deter"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Causal Determinism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; argues against acausal events. However, the idea of causal determinism can neither be argued for nor against based on the scientific knoweldge at this point in time {{dubious|date=May 2016}}.

Causality appears to us to be reasonably objective to determine on the macroscopic scale. (But not on the quantum scale, where random chance prevails.) However, even large-scale physical causality is a somewhat mysterious notion; there is no general theory of causality in physics, and most events in physics are theoretically reversible in time {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. However, the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which states that entropy always increases with time, in any closed system) can be regarded as providing a direction for the "arrow of time" and thus entropy may be related to the physically mysterious notion of causality. (See [[Causality (physics)]].)

Unlike causality, the concept of meaning is purely subjective except in symbol systems such as language/grammar and mathematics - both systems which depend on prior agreement on the arbitrary assignment of specific meanings to specific symbols or symbol groups {{dubious|date=May 2016}}.

The outlier effect can be used to explain events that are unlikely to occur by chance. Littlewood's Law&lt;ref name="littl"&gt;"Littlewoods's Miscellany", edited by B. Bollobás, Cambridge University Press; {{ISBN|0-521-33702-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that individuals can statistically expect a significant event to happen for them at a frequency of about once per month. Littlewood assumes a significant event frequency at one in a million with a duration of one second, and that an individual is alert to significant events for eight hours per day.

== In popular culture ==
The 1993 book, [[The Celestine Prophecy]], by James Redfield encouraged its readers to seek meaning from grouped events. From the book's First Insight: "In each of our lives occurs mysterious coincidences - sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny'.&lt;ref name="celes"&gt;"The Celestine Prophecy", by James Redfield; {{ISBN|0-446-51862-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a 1996 best seller, spent 165 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller list, and has now sold over 20 million copies.

'''Hormonal imprinting''' (HI) is a  phenomenon which takes place at the first encounter between a [[hormone]] and its developing [[hormone receptor|receptor]] in the critical periods of life (in unicellulars during the whole life) and determines the later [[signal transduction]] capacity of the cell. The most important period in [[mammals]] is the [[perinatal]] one, however this system can be imprinted at [[weaning]], at [[puberty]] and in case of continuously dividing cells during the whole life. Faulty imprinting is caused by [[drugs]], environmental [[pollutants]] and other hormone-like molecules  present in excess at the critical periods with lifelong receptorial, morphological, biochemical and behavioral consequences. HI is transmitted to the hundreds of progeny generations in unicellulars and (as proved) to a few generations also in mammals.

The '''Key deer''' (''Odocoileus virginianus clavium'') is an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[deer]] that lives only in the [[Florida Keys]]. It is a subspecies of the [[white-tailed deer]] (''O. virginianus''). It is the smallest North American deer.

==Description==
This deer can be recognized by its characteristic size, smaller than all other white-tailed deer. Adult males (known as bucks) usually weigh {{convert|25|-|34|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and stand about {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder. Adult females (does) usually weigh between {{convert|20|and|29|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and have an average height of {{convert|66|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulders. The deer is a reddish-brown to grey-brown in color. [[Antler]]s are grown by males and shed between February and March and regrown by June. When the antlers are growing, they have a white velvet coating. The species otherwise generally resembles other white-tailed deer in appearance.

==Behavior== 
Key deer easily swim between [[island]]s. Living close to humans, they have little of the natural fear of man shown by most of their larger mainland relatives.  The deer are often found in residents' yards and along roadsides where plants and flowers grow.  This often results in car-to-deer collisions, as the deer are more active (and harder to avoid) at night.  Seeing them at dusk and dawn is not unusual.

Breeding occurs all year, but peaks in October and December. Territorial activity is limited to defending a receptive doe from other bucks. Longevity records are 9 years for males and 7 years for females. Adult females form loose matriarchal groups with one or two generations of offspring, while bucks feed and bed together only outside the breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harley|first=Stephen A. Miller, John P.|title=Zoology|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston [etc.]|isbn=978-0070294110|page=28|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range, habitat, and diet==

The range of the Key deer originally encompassed all of the lower Florida Keys (where standing water pools exist), but is now limited to a stretch of the Florida Keys from about [[Sugarloaf Key]] to [[Bahia Honda Key]]. Key deer use all islands during the [[wet season]] when drinking water is more generally available, retreating to islands with a perennial supply of fresh water in dry months.

Key deer inhabit nearly all [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s within their range, including [[South Florida rocklands#Pine rockland|pine rocklands]], [[South Florida rocklands#Rockland hammock|hardwood hammocks]], [[mangrove]]s, and [[wetland|freshwater wetlands]]. The species feeds on over 150 types of plants, but [[mangroves]] ([[Rhizophora mangle|red]], [[Laguncularia racemosa|white]], and [[Avicennia germinans|black]]) and [[thatch palm]] [[berry|berries]] make up the most important parts of their diets. Pine rockland habitat is important, as well, because it is often the only reliable source of fresh drinking water (Key deer can tolerate drinking only mildly [[brackish]] water). [[Habitat destruction]] due to human encroachment causes many deer to feed on non-native [[ornamental plant]]s.

==History==
The Key deer is a subspecies of white-tailed deer which migrated to the Florida Keys from the mainland over a [[land bridge]] during the [[Wisconsin glaciation]]. The earliest known written reference to Key deer comes from the writings of [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], a Spanish sailor [[shipwreck]]ed in the Florida Keys and captured by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the 1550s.

[[File:Odocoileus virginianus clavium fawn.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A juvenile Key deer is called a fawn.]]
[[File:Truekeydeer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Due to proximity, most Key deer have lost their fear of humans. This, besides habitat loss, is the main reason why they have become endangered.]]

===Endangered status===
Key deer were hunted as a food supply by native tribes, passing sailors, and early settlers. Hunting them was banned in 1939, but widespread [[poaching]] and [[habitat destruction]] caused the subspecies to plummet to near-extinction by the 1950s. The [[National Key Deer Refuge]], a federally administered [[National Wildlife Refuge]] operated by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Wildlife Service]], was established in 1967.

Recent population estimates put the population between 700 and 800, putting it on the list of endangered species. Road kills from drivers on [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|US 1]], which traverses the deer's small range, are also a major threat, averaging between 125 and 150 kills per year, 70% of the annual mortality.

However, the population has made an encouraging rise since 1955, when population estimates ranged as low as 25, and appears to have stabilized in recent years. Still, recent human encroachment into the fragile habitat and the deer's relatively low rate of reproduction point to an uncertain future for the subspecies.

===Screw worm infestation===
In September 2016, a [[Cochliomyia hominivorax|screw worm infestation]] was discovered (the first infestation of its kind in the U.S. since 1982) to be affecting the Key deer population, necessitating the euthanasia of affected animals. The screw worm is a fly larva that enters an open wound of a live animal and eats the flesh of the animal from within, leading to a gruesome death. The female fly mates once in her life, so the infestation can be battled by introducing sterile flies to the population, causing the females to die out without laying fertile eggs. Other steps to battle the outbreak included injecting deer with antiparasitic drugs, fencing off healthy sections of the population, and tracking a portion of deer with radio collars. The pest was declared as eradicated in April 2017. The outbreak killed 135 deer, roughly an eighth of the herd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flkeysnews.com/news/local/article105665836.html|publisher=[[FLKeysNews.com]]|accessdate=2016-11-01|date=2016-10-03|title=Deadly fly larvae infests federally endangered Key deer population, more than 40 are euthanized}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article109139952.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2016-11-01|date=2016-10-19|title=Attack of the flesh-eating screwworm pushes up Key deer death toll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article111624052.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2016-11-01|date=2016-10-31|title=Healthy Key deer may be corralled to save herd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article144158319.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2017-06-23|date=2017-04-12|title=Flesh-eating fly outbreak that infested rare Key deer is over, feds say}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Conservation efforts include the establishment of the National Key Deer Refuge, which consists of about {{convert|8500|acre|km2|abbr=on}} on Big Pine, No Name Key, and several smaller uninhabited islands. Not all of the refuge lands are protected as public lands; despite extensive efforts of the refuge to purchase these private habitat lands for protection in the refuge, about {{convert|5000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} currently remain in private ownership and can potentially be developed. About {{convert|1000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} of this privately developable land is on Big Pine Key and No Name Key, which are the central population areas for the deer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
In 2006, a habitat conservation plan was enacted by Monroe County and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which will limit development in primary habitat and provide for additional habitat purchases over the next 15 years. At the end of this period, however, most of the {{convert|1000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} of privately owned habitat land on Big Pine and No Name Keys will still be open for further development. Thus, while the short term promises some cushion from extinction, the long-term prospects for the deer remain in doubt.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A portion of US Route 1 was also elevated in 2003 to allow the deer to pass safely beneath the roadway, in an attempt to lessen the chance of road kills. However, no decrease in total traffic deaths has been seen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The National Key Deer Refuge encourages people to help keep the Key deer wild by not feeding them.  Feeding acclimates them to humans and vehicles, and makes them more likely to be hit and killed by vehicles.  Also, hanging around people and developed areas in higher than normal densities makes them more susceptible to diseases, dog attacks, and entanglements in human trash, all of which can lead to increased injuries or death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The term and field of study was invented without any scientific support by [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]] (US Army, Ret.) of the Killology Research Group in his 1996 book ''[[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society]]''.&lt;ref name="Wardrip-FruinHarrigan2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wardrip-Fruin|first1=Noah|last2=Harrigan|first2=Pat|title=First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaY9cMnOCUoC&amp;pg=PT102|date=January 2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-23232-6|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteuterWills2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Wills|first2=Deborah|title=At War with Metaphor: Media, Propaganda, and Racism in the War on Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIEFAL2YkrMC&amp;pg=PA64|date=15 July 2009|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3031-5|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The soldier's choice==
Grossman claims in his book ''On Killing'' that soldiers are faced with four options once they have entered into combat.&lt;ref name=grossman&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Grossman | first1 = Dave | authorlink=Dave Grossman (author)  |title = On killing : the psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society | year = 1996 | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-316-33000-8 | pages = 367|oclc= 32312539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
# Fight: as the name implies this is the standard that defines the soldiers role as actively trying to defeat the enemy by use of their training.
# Flight: this option involves the combatant fleeing the engagement.
# Posture: This action involves the soldier falsely showing active participation in combat. In actuality they are not being effective in deterring the enemy from success. This is a major point of concern for commanders as it is difficult to tell the difference between a soldier posturing or fighting.
# Submit: Submission to the enemy during an engagement is a direct act of surrender. In the animal kingdom, this is used by lesser combatants to prevent them from being injured after they can ascertain the triviality of their battle.

==The problem of non- or mis-firing soldiers==
[[S.L.A. Marshall]] did a study on the firing rates of soldiers in World War II. He found that the ratio of rounds fired vs. hits was low; he also noted that the majority of soldiers were not aiming to hit their targets.&lt;ref name=Slam&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Marshall | first1 = S. L. A. (Samuel Lyman Atwood) |authorlink= SLA Marshall| title = Men against fire: the problem of battle command | year = 2000 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | location = Norman, Okla. | isbn = 978-0-8061-3280-8 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a problem for the US military and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]] during World War II. New training implements were developed and hit rates improved. The changes were small, but effective. First, instead of shooting at [[Bullseye (target)|bull's-eye]] type targets, the [[United States Army]] switched to [[Metallic silhouette shooting|silhouette targets]] that mimic an average human. Training also switched from 300 yard slow fire testing to rapid fire testing with different time and distance intervals from 20 to 300 yards. With these two changes, hitting targets became a reaction that was almost automatic.

Some authors have discredited S.L.A. Marshall's book, stating that the book may be more of an idea of what was occurring and not a scientific study of what was happening. Other historians and journalists have outright accused Marshall of fabricating his study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fire Away |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/76997|first=Evan |last=Hunter |authorlink=Evan Hunter|publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor that increased fire and hit rates is the development of camaraderie in training. Soldiers are taught that their actions do not only help or harm themselves, but the whole unit.&lt;ref name=kyle&gt;{{cite book | last = Kyle | first = Chris |authorlink= Chris Kyle| title = [[American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History]] | publisher = W. Morrow | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780062082374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=July 2016}} This recurring theme in recollections collected from war veterans is the idea that they were not fighting for themselves at the time but more concerned for the people to their left and right. This ideology is ancient and was recorded by [[Sun Tzu]] in his book ''[[The Art of War]]'': "If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst."&lt;ref name=Sunzi&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sun Tzu | first1 = 6th century BC | last2 = Minford | first2 = John |author2link= John Minford| title = The Art of War | year = 2006 | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-14-303752-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increase in PTSD since World War II==

{{Tone|section|date=March 2015}}

Some research has been done to say that the increase of [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) in the military is caused by the increase of firing rates.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt; This brings up the classic debate of correlation vs. causation. Many believe that other factors have been influencing PTSD such as decompression time after conflicts, and the lack of moral sovereignty in engagements.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt;

===World War II and Vietnam===

[[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] is viewed by some{{who|date=July 2016}} as a less popular war than World War II. Many people who were sent to fight there thought that there was no reason for the engagement and did not feel a moral obligation to fight. In World War II many felt that they were stopping an evil empire from overtaking the globe. This helped the World War II troops' mettle to be steadfast.{{or|date=July 2016}}

Another problem with PTSD rates after World War II is the fact that there is far less decompression time for the soldiers.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt; During World War II the main way back home was on a boat trip that took weeks. This time was spent with others who had had similar experiences and could understand the problems faced by others.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt; During Vietnam soldiers were sent via draft to one year rotations by plane. When you arrived to your unit it was usually by yourself and you were shunned. This shunning was a result of the senior members being afraid to befriend someone who had a much higher chance of being killed than the experienced combatants. Once your time in country was over you were once again sent back home by yourself. There may have been other veterans with you but they were from a plethora of other units and you did not know them well enough to share the hardships you had seen.

Finally one of the worst displays of environmental stressors was once you made it back home you were demonized by the public and discarded as a human being. Compare that to the treatment World War II veterans received when they came home from the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]] or the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific Theatre]]. Parades were thrown, everyone thanking the soldiers, even the invention of [[V sign|V for Victory]] was made to quickly show military members support. That symbol was changed into the [[Peace sign]] and used to show disapproval of the war in Vietnam just a few years later. These factors among many others caused Vietnam to have the highest postwar depression, suicide, and PTSD rates. To this day many are only now getting the counseling that they need to overcome the mental problems brought upon them from their service in Vietnam.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt;

===Modern engagements===

In engagements in the modern era such as the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] through the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001-2014)|War in Afghanistan]] there is still a problem with a lack of decompression time. The training has improved so you train and deploy with the people you will be fighting with.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Evan | title = Generation kill: Devil Dogs, Iceman, Captain America, and the new face of American war | publisher = Berkeley Caliber | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780425200407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But many times when you reach home you are given time off, and if one is in a reserve unit you most likely go back to work and only see your brothers in arms once a month. This lack of time to debrief and decompress can cause a feeling of isolation that only worsens the effects of PTSD. Grossman states in his book that everyone who experiences combat comes back with PTSD, the only question is to what extent their mind and psyche are damaged and how they cope with it.

==Claims==
Grossman's theory, based on the World War II research of S.L.A. Marshall, is that most of the population deeply resists killing another human. Some veterans and historians have cast doubt on Marshall's research methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Roger J. Spiller]] (Deputy Director of the Combat Studies Institute, US Army [[Command and General Staff College]]) argues in his 1988 article, "S.L.A. Marshall and the Ratio of Fire" (''[[Royal United Services Institute|RUSI]] [[RUSI Journal|Journal]]'', Winter 1988, pages 63–71), that Marshall had not actually conducted the research upon which he based his ratio-of-fire theory. "The 'systematic collection of data' appears to have been an invention."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

This revelation has called into question the authenticity of some of Marshall's other books and has lent academic weight to doubts about his integrity that had been raised in military circles even decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As a result of Marshall's work, modern military training was modified to attempt to override this instinct, by:
* using man-shaped targets instead of bullseye targets in marksmanship practice
* practicing and drilling how soldiers would actually fight
* dispersing responsibility for the killing throughout the group
* displacing responsibility for the killing onto an authority figure, i.e., the commanding officer and the military [[hierarchy]] (See the [[Milgram experiment]])

By the time of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, says Grossman, 90% of U.S. soldiers would fire their weapons at other people.

He also says the act of killing is psychologically traumatic for the killer, even more so than constant danger or witnessing the death of others.

Grossman further argues that [[violence in television]], movies and [[violence in video games|video games]] contributes to real-life violence by a similar process of training and [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]].

In ''On Combat'' (Grossman's sequel to ''On Killing'', based on ten years of additional research and interviews) he addresses the psychology and physiology of human [[aggression]].

The term initially proposed by Liao (2002)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; constitutes a two dimensional model of knowledge inertia which incorporates experience inertia and learning inertia. Later, another dimension—the dimension of [[thinking]] inertia has been added based on the theoretical exploration of the existing concepts of experience inertia and learning inertia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the central problems in knowledge management related to [[organizational learning]] is to deal with “[[inertia]]”. Besides, individuals may also exhibit a natural tendency of inertia when facing problems during utilization of knowledge. Inertia in technical jargon means inactivity or torpor. Inertia in [[organizational learning]] context may be referred to as a slowdown in organizational learning-related activities. In fact, there are many other kinds of organizational inertia; e.g., innovation inertia, workforce inertia, productivity inertia, decision inertia, emotional inertia besides others that have different meanings in their own individual contexts. Some organization theorists have adopted the definition proposed by Liao (2002)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to extend its further use in organizational learning studies.

== Definition ==

Knowledge inertia (KI) may be defined as a [[problem solving]] strategy using old, redundant, stagnant knowledge and past experience without recourse to new knowledge and [[experience]]. Inertia is a concept in physics that is used to explain the state of an object either remaining in stationary or uniform motion. Organizational theorists adopted this concept of inertia and applied it to different contexts which resulted in the emergence of diverse concepts—such as, for example, [[organizational inertia]], consumer inertia, outsourcing inertia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=Michael J.|last2=Kotabe|first2=Masaaki|date=2011-06-01|title=Overcoming Inertia: Drivers of the Outsourcing Process|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024630110000737|journal=Long Range Planning|volume=44|issue=3|pages=160–178|doi=10.1016/j.lrp.2010.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cognitive inertia]]. Some organization theorists{{who|date=November 2018}} have adopted the definition proposed by Liao (2002) to extend its further use in organizational learning studies. Not every instances of knowledge inertia result in gloomy of negative outcome: one study suggested that knowledge inertia could positively affect a firm's product innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Xuemei|last2=Fang|first2=Liangxiu|last3=Zeng|first3=Saixing|last4=Huo|first4=Jiage|date=2016-05-01|title=How does knowledge inertia affect firms product innovation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315004506|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Designing implementable innovative realities|volume=69|issue=5|pages=1615–1620|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The concept ==
Knowledge inertia stems from the use of routine [[problem solving]] procedures that involves the utilization of redundant, stagnant knowledge and past experience without any recourse to new knowledge and thinking processes.  Different methodologies exist for diverse types of knowledge that could be applied to manage knowledge efficiently. Since KI is a component of knowledge management, it is essential to consider the circulation of various knowledge types in avoiding inertia. The theory of KI supposedly studies the extent to which an organization's ability on problem solving is inhibited. Numerous factors could be attributed as enablers or inhibitors of the abilities on problem solving of an individual or an [[organization]]. Knowledge inertia applicable in the context of problem solving, therefore, may require inputs from all these diverse knowledge types, or it may require learning, new thinking, and experience. Emergence of new ideas to supplement the existing knowledge and assimilation of the same could be of help in avoiding the use of stagnant, outdated information while attempting to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Ping|last2=Yang|first2=Xue-wei|date=2013-10-15|title=A Review of Knowledge Inertia:How can we explain the hindrance on individual innovation|url=http://www.atlantis-press.com/php/paper-details.php?id=9351|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 International Academic Workshop on Social Science (IAW-SC-13)|publisher=Atlantis Press|doi=10.2991/iaw-sc.2013.67|isbn=9789078677840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafchehi|first=Parviz|last2=Zamani|first2=Arash|last3=Ebrahimabadi|first3=Farhad|date=2012-09-25|title=A Model of Influential Factors on Knowledge Inertia|url=http://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh?docid=20418752-201209-201508130023-201508130023-386-391|journal=Asian Journal of Business Management|volume=4|issue=4|issn=2041-8752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Technical|date=October 2018}}

In [[mathematical psychology]], a '''knowledge space''' is a [[antimatroid|combinatorial structure]] describing the possible states of knowledge of a human learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Knowledge Spaces|last1=Doignon|first1=J.-P.|last2=Falmagne|first2=J.-Cl.|author2-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1999|isbn = 3-540-64501-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
To form a knowledge space, one models a domain of knowledge as a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of concepts, and a feasible state of knowledge as a [[subset]] of that set containing the concepts known or knowable by some individual. Typically, not all subsets are feasible, due to prerequisite relations among the concepts. The knowledge space is the family of all the feasible subsets. 

Knowledge spaces were introduced in 1985 by [[Jean-Paul Doignon]] and [[Jean-Claude Falmagne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Doignon|first1=J.-P.|last2=Falmagne|first2=J.-Cl.|author2-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|year=1985|title=Spaces for the assessment of knowledge|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|volume=23|issue=2|pages=175–196|doi=10.1016/S0020-7373(85)80031-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and have since been studied by many other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Knowledge Spaces. Applications in Education|last1=Falmagne|first1=J.-Cl.|author1-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|last2=Albert|first2=D.|last3=Doble|first3=C.|last4=Eppstein|first4=D.|author4-link=David Eppstein|last5=Hu|first5=X.|publisher=Springer|year=2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A [http://kst.hockemeyer.at/kst-bib.html bibliography on knowledge spaces] maintained by Cord Hockemeyer contains over 400 publications on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; They also form the basis for two computerized tutoring systems, [http://wundt.kfunigraz.ac.at/rath/ RATH] (defunct now) and [[ALEKS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wundt.uni-graz.at/MathPsych/cda/overview_sokrates.htm Introduction to Knowledge Spaces: Theory and Applications], Christof Körner, Gudrun Wesiak, and Cord Hockemeyer, 1999 and 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to interpret a knowledge space as a special form of a restricted [[latent class model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=About the connection between knowledge structures and latent class models |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |journal=Methodology|volume=1|issue=3|pages=92–102|year=2005|doi=10.1027/1614-2241.1.3.92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Knowledge Space Theory (KST) was motivated by the shortcomings of the psychometric approach to the assessment of competence like [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jean-Paul Doignon, Jean-Claude Falmagne |title=Knowledge Spaces and Learning Spaces |date=2015 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06757.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed with an objective of designing automated procedures which - 
*accurately assess the knowledge of a student, and 
*efficiently provide advices for further study. 
Assessments based on KST are adaptive and can account for possible slips or guesses. KST aims to give a detailed assessment of student's knowledge state as opposed to a numerical mark in traditional assessments. More specifically, the result of a KST based assessment tells two things - 
*''What the student can do'' and 
*''What the student is ready to learn''.

==Basic Concepts==
*'''Knowledge State'''
:It is the complete set of problems that an individual is capable of solving in a particular topic (such as Algebra).
*'''Precedence Relation'''
:It is the parent-child relationship between concepts. It captures the inter-dependency of concepts (prerequisite relationships).
*'''Knowledge Structure'''
:It is the set of all ''feasible'' knowledge states. Because of precedence relations some of the knowledge states are infeasible.
*'''The outer and inner fringes'''
:The unique items between a knowledge state and its immediate successor knowledge state is called the original knowledge state's Outer fringe. It basically tells the items that the student is ready to learn. Conversely, Inner fringe is the items that differentiate a knowledge state from its immediate predecessor. Inner fringe tells the items that the student has already learned.

==Definitions==
Some basic definitions used in the knowledge space approach -
*A tuple &lt;math&gt;(Q, K)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a non-empty set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and a set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of subsets from &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''knowledge structure'' if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; contains the empty set and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.
*A knowledge structure is called a ''knowledge space'' if it is closed under union, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\cup F \in K&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq K &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?hl=ru&amp;lr=&amp;id=q4NWzFqSIvcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=learning+spaces+interdisciplinary+applied+math&amp;ots=kxmWmfjrpN&amp;sig=-40PagY8DQbKwxQGp04kqx72yPU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=learning%20spaces%20interdisciplinary%20applied%20math&amp;f=false|title=Learning Spaces: Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics|last=Falmagne|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Doignon|first2=Jean-Paul|date=2010-09-10|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642010392|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A knowledge space is called a ''quasi-ordinal knowledge space'' if it is in addition closed under intersection, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;S, T \in K&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;S\cap T \in K&lt;/math&gt;. Closure under both unions and intersections gives (''Q'',∪,∩) the structure of a [[distributive lattice]]; [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] for distributive lattices shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all [[preorder|quasiorders]] on Q and the set of all quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces on Q. I.e., each quasi-ordinal knowledge space can be represented by a quasi-order and vice versa.

An important subclass of knowledge spaces, the ''well-graded knowledge spaces'' or ''learning spaces'', can be defined as satisfying two additional mathematical axioms:
# If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are both feasible subsets of concepts, then &lt;math&gt;S\cup T&lt;/math&gt; is also feasible. In educational terms: if it is possible for someone to know all the concepts in ''S'', and someone else to know all the concepts in ''T'', then we can posit the potential existence of a third person who combines the knowledge of both people.
# If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty feasible subset of concepts, then there is some concept ''x'' in ''S'' such that &lt;math&gt;S\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is also feasible. In educational terms: any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning one concept at a time, for a finite set of concepts to be learned.
A set family satisfying these two axioms forms a [[mathematical structure]] known as an [[antimatroid]].

==Construction of knowledge spaces==
In practice, there exist several methods to construct knowledge spaces. The most frequently used method is querying experts. There exist several querying algorithms that allow one or several experts to construct a knowledge space by answering a sequence of simple questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Extracting human expertise for constructing knowledge spaces: An algorithm |last1=Koppen |first1=M. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=37|pages=1–20 |year=1993 |doi=10.1006/jmps.1993.1001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How to build a knowledge space by querying an expert |last1=Koppen |first1=M. |last2=Doignon |first2=J.-P. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=311–331 |year=1990 |doi=10.1016/0022-2496(90)90035-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A simulation study concerning the effect of errors on the establishment of knowledge spaces by querying experts |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |last2=Held |first2=T. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=39|issue=4|pages=376–382 |year=1995|doi=10.1006/jmps.1995.1035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method is to construct the knowledge space by explorative data analysis (for example by [[Item tree analysis]]) from data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Extracting knowledge structures from observed data |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |journal=[[British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology]]|volume= 52|issue=2 |pages=213–224 |year=1999|doi=10.1348/000711099159071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A method for the analysis of hierarchical dependencies between items of a questionnaire |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |journal= Methods of Psychological Research Online|volume=19|pages=43–79  |year=2003|url=http://www.dgps.de/fachgruppen/methoden/mpr-online/issue19/art3/mpr106_04.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A third method is to derive the knowledge space from an analysis of the problem solving processes in the corresponding domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Knowledge Spaces: Theories, Empirical Research, Applications|last1=Albert|first1=D.|last2=Lukas|first2=J.|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Köppen climate classification''' is one of the most widely used [[climate classification]] systems. It was first published by the Russian [[List of climate scientists|climatologist]] [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846-1940) in 1884,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Köppen |first=Wladimir |date=1884 |title=Die Wärmezonen der Erde, nach der Dauer der heissen, gemässigten und kalten Zeit und nach der Wirkung der Wärme auf die organische Welt betrachtet |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/koeppen.htm |trans-title=The thermal zones of the earth according to the duration of hot, moderate and cold periods and to the impact of heat on the organic world) |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |translator1-first=E. |translator1-last=Volken |translator2-first=S |translator2-last=Brönnimann |publication-date=2011 |volume=20 |issue=3|pages=351–360 |via=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/mz/2011/00000020/00000003/art00009|bibcode=2011MetZe..20..351K |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2011/105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubel |first1=F. |last2=Kottek |first2=M |date=2011 |title=Comments on: 'The thermal zones of the Earth' by Wladimir Köppen (1884) |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=361–365  |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/mz/2011/00000020/00000003/art00010|bibcode=2011MetZe..20..361R |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2011/0258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with several later modifications by Köppen, notably in 1918 and 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Köppen |first=Wladimir |year=1918 |title=Klassification der Klimate nach Temperatur, Niederschlag and Jahreslauf |encyclopedia=Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen |volume=64 |pages=193–203, 243–248 |via=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/koeppen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Köppen |first=Wladimir |year=1936 |title=Das geographische System der Klimate |trans-title=The geographic system of climates |section=C |editor1-last=Köppen |editor1-first=Wladimir |editor2-first=Rudolf |editor2-last=Geiger (publisher) |work=Handbuch der Klimatologie |volume=1 |publisher=Borntraeger |location=Berlin |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pdf/Koppen_1936.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the climatologist [[Rudolf Geiger]] (1954, 1961) introduced some changes to the classification system, which is thus sometimes called the '''Köppen–Geiger climate classification system.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=CS1 |last=Geiger |first=Rudolf |date=1954 |title=Klassifikation der Klimate nach W. Köppen |trans-title=Classification of climates after W. Köppen |work=Landolt-Börnstein – Zahlenwerte und Funktionen aus Physik, Chemie, Astronomie, Geophysik und Technik, alte Serie |volume=3 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |pages=603–607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |mode=CS1 |last=Geiger |first=Rudolf |date=1961 |title=Überarbeitete Neuausgabe von Geiger, R.: Köppen-Geiger / Klima der Erde}} (Wandkarte 1:16 Mill.) – Klett-Perthes, Gotha.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Köppen climate classification divides climates into five main climate groups, with each group being divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns. The five main groups are ''A'' (tropical), ''B'' (dry), ''C'' (temperate), ''D'' (continental), and ''E'' (polar). Each group and subgroup is represented by a letter. All climates are assigned a main group (the first letter). All climates except for those in the ''E'' group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup (the second letter). For example, ''Af'' indicates a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups other than those in the ''A'' group, indicated by the third letter for climates in ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'', and the second letter for climates in ''E''. For example, ''Cfb'' indicates an [[oceanic climate]] with warm summers as indicated by the ending ''b''. Climates are classified based on specific criteria unique to each climate type.&lt;ref name="kottek2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottek|first1=Markus|last2=Grieser|first2=Jürgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno|last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|title=World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|date=2006|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–263|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Köppen designed the system based on his experience as a [[Botany|botanist]], so the main climate groups are based on the different variety of vegetation that grows in climates belonging to each group. In addition to identifying climates, the system can be used to analyze ecosystem conditions and identify the main types of vegetation within climates. Due to its link with the [[Flora|plant life]] of a region, the system is useful in predicting future changes in plant life within a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Hylke E. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=Niklaus E. |last3=McVicar |first3=Tim R. |last4=Vergopolan |first4=Noemi |last5=Berg |first5=Alexis |last6=Wood |first6=Eric F. |title=Present and future Köppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution |journal=Scientific Data |date=30 October 2018 |volume=5 |pages=180214 |doi=10.1038/sdata.2018.214 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018214 |language=En |issn=2052-4463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Köppen climate classification system has been further modified, within the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system in the middle 1960s (revised in 1980). The Trewartha system sought to create a more refined middle [[latitude]] climate zone, which was one of the criticisms of the Köppen system (the C climate group was too broad).&lt;ref name="McKnight"&gt;{{cite book|title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation|last1=McKnight|first1=Tom L|last2=Hess|first2=Darrel|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2000|isbn=0-13-020263-0|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|chapter=Climate Zones and Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|200–1}}

The Köppen climate classification scheme divides climates into five main climate groups: ''A'' (tropical), ''B'' (dry), ''C'' (temperate), ''D'' (continental), and ''E'' (polar).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Koppen-climate-classification|title=Koppen climate classification {{!}} climatology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second letter indicates the seasonal precipitation type, while the third letter indicates the level of heat.&lt;ref name=hanschen&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hanschen.org/koppen/ |title=Köppen climate classification |last1=Chen |first1=Hans |last2=Chen |first2=Deliang |authorlink2=Chen Deliang |website=hanschen.org |language=en |access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group A: Tropical (megathermal) climates

This type of climate has every month of the year with an average temperature of {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}} or higher, with significant precipitation.

* ''Af'' = [[Tropical rainforest climate]]; average precipitation of at least {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in every month.
* ''Am'' = [[Tropical monsoon climate]]; driest month (which nearly always occurs at or soon after the "winter" solstice for that side of the equator) with precipitation less than {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, but more than 4% the total annual precipitation.
* ''Aw'' or ''As'' = Tropical wet and dry or [[Tropical savanna climate|savanna]] climate; with the driest month having precipitation less than {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and less than 4% of the total annual precipitation.

'''Group B: Dry (arid and semiarid) climates

This type of climate is defined by little precipitation.

Multiply the average annual temperature in [[Celsius]] by 20, then add
:(a) 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the spring and summer months (April–September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October–March in the Southern), or
:(b) 140 if 30%–70% of the total precipitation is received during the spring and summer, or
:(c) 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is received during the spring and summer.

If the annual precipitation is less than 50% of this threshold, the classification is BW (arid: desert climate); if it is in the range of 50%–100% of the threshold, the classification is BS (semi-arid: steppe climate).

A third letter can be included to indicate temperature. Originally, h signified low-latitude climate (average annual temperature above {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}}) while k signified middle-latitude climate (average annual temperature below 18 °C), but the more common practice today, especially in the United States, is to use h to mean the coldest month has an average temperature above {{convert|0|°C|°F|0}} (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}), with k denoting that at least one month's averages below 0 °C (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}). The n is used to denote a climate characterized by frequent fog.&lt;ref name=Cereceda/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepchile&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122045953/http://www.gep.uchile.cl/Biodiversidad/medio_fisico/clima_01.html |archivedate=22 January 2018 |url=http://www.gep.uchile.cl/Biodiversidad/medio_fisico/clima_01.html |title=CLASIFICACIÓN CLIMÁTICA DE KÖPPEN |publisher=Universidad de Chile |language=Spanish |accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inzunza&gt;{{cite web |last1=Inzunza |first1=Juan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122051833/http://nimbus.com.uy/weather/Cursos/Curso_2006/Textos%20complementarios/Meteorologia%20descriptiva_Inzunza/cap15_Inzunza_Climas%20de%20Chile.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2018 |url=http://nimbus.com.uy/weather/Cursos/Curso_2006/Textos%20complementarios/Meteorologia%20descriptiva_Inzunza/cap15_Inzunza_Climas%20de%20Chile.pdf |title=Capitulo 15.

== Scheme ==

=== Group A: Tropical/megathermal climates ===
[[Tropical climate]]s are characterized by constant high temperatures (at sea level and low elevations); all 12 months of the year have average temperatures of 18 °C (64.4 °F)  or higher. They are subdivided as follows:

==== Tropical rainforest climate ====
{{main article|Tropical rainforest climate}}
All 12 months have an average precipitation of at least {{Convert|60|mm|abbr=on}}. These climates usually occur within 10° latitude of the [[equator]].  This climate is dominated by the [[doldrums]] low-pressure system all year round, so has no natural seasons in terms of thermal and moisture changes.&lt;ref name="McKnight" /&gt;

Some of the places with this climate are indeed uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year (e.g., the northwest [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], from [[Ecuador]] to [[Costa Rica]]; see, for instance, [[Andagoya]], [[Colombia]]), but in many cases, the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest (as at [[Palembang]], [[Indonesia]]) or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain (as at [[Sitiawan]], [[Malaysia]]).

('''Note'''. The term [[season|aseasonal]] refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly (or daily) temperature throughout the year. Annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics, but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone, albeit unrelated to temperature, but to water availability whether as rain, mist, soil, or ground water. Plant response (e. g., [[phenology]]), animal (feeding, migration, reproduction, etc.), and human activities (plant sowing, harvesting, hunting, fishing, etc.) are tuned to this 'seasonality'. Indeed, in tropical South America and Central America, the 'rainy season' (and the 'high water season') is called [[rainy season|''invierno'']] or ''inverno'', though it could occur in the Northern Hemisphere summer; likewise, the 'dry season' (and 'low water season') is called [[dry season|''verano'']] or ''verão'', and can occur in the Northern Hemisphere winter).

==== Tropical monsoon climate ====
{{main article|Tropical monsoon climate}}
This type of climate results from the [[monsoon]] winds which change direction according to the seasons. This climate has a driest month (which nearly always occurs at or soon after the "winter" solstice for that side of the equator) with rainfall less than 60 mm, but more than {{frac|25}} the total annual precipitation.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|208}}

Most places that have this climate are found at the outer margins of the [[tropical]] zone from the low teens to the mid-20s latitudes, but occasionally an inner-tropical location (e.g., [[San Marcos, Antioquia]], [[Colombia]]) also qualifies. Actually, the [[Caribbean sea|Caribbean]] coast, eastward from the [[Gulf of Urabá]] on the [[Colombia]]–[[Panamá]] border to the [[Orinoco River]] delta, on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (about 4,000 km), have long dry periods (the extreme is the ''BSh'' climate (see below), characterised by very low, unreliable precipitation, present, for instance, in extensive areas in the [[:es:Guajira Península|Guajira]], and [[Coro region|Coro]], western [[Venezuela]], the northernmost peninsulas in South America, which receive &lt;300 mm total annual precipitation, practically all in two or three months).

This condition extends to the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Greater Antilles]] forming the circum-Caribbean dry belt. The length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland (southward); at the latitude of the Amazon River—which flows eastward, just south of the [[Equator|equatorial line]]—the climate is ''Af''. East from the [[Andes]], between the dry, arid Caribbean and the ever-wet Amazon are the Orinoco River's [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]] or [[savanna]]s, from where this climate takes its name.

Sometimes ''As'' is used in place of ''Aw'' if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days. This is the case in parts of [[Hawaii]], northwestern Dominican Republic, East Africa, and the Brazilian Northeastern Coast. In most places that have tropical wet and dry climates, however, the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days because of [[rain shadow]] effects during the 'high-sun' part of the year.

=== Group B: Dry (desert and semi-arid) climates ===
{{main article|Desert climate|Semi-arid climate}}
These climates are characterized by actual precipitation less than a threshold value set equal to the [[potential evapotranspiration]].&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|212}} The threshold value (in millimeters) is determined as:

Multiply the average annual temperature in °C by 20, then add (a) 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun half of the year (April through September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October through March in the Southern), or (b) 140 if 30%–70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period, or (c) 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received.

According to the modified Köppen classification system used by modern climatologists, total precipitation in the warmest six months of the year is taken as reference instead of the total precipitation in the high-sun half of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snow.cals.uidaho.edu/Clim_Map/koppen_criteria.htm |author=Critchfield, H.J. |year=1983 |edition=4 |title=Criteria for classification of major climatic types in modified Köppen system |publisher=University of Idaho |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930221104/http://snow.cals.uidaho.edu/Clim_Map/koppen_criteria.htm |archivedate=2009-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the annual precipitation is less than 50% of this threshold, the classification is ''BW'' (arid: [[desert climate]]); if it is in the range of 50%–100% of the threshold, the classification is ''BS'' (semi-arid: [[semi-arid climate|steppe climate]]).

A third letter can be included to indicate temperature. Originally, ''h'' signified low-latitude climate (average annual temperature above 18 °C) while ''k'' signified middle-latitude climate (average annual temperature below 18 °C), but the more common practice today, especially in the United States, is to use ''h'' to mean the coldest month has an average temperature above 0 °C (32 °F) (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}), with ''k'' denoting that at least one month averages below 0 °C.

Desert areas situated along the west coasts of continents at tropical or near-tropical locations are characterized by cooler temperatures than encountered elsewhere at comparable latitudes (due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents) and frequent fog and low clouds, despite the fact that these places rank among the driest on earth in terms of actual precipitation received. This climate is sometimes labelled ''BWn''.&lt;ref name=Cereceda/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepchile/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inzunza/&gt; The ''BSn'' category can be found in foggy coastal steppes.&lt;ref name=Cereceda/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepchile/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inzunza/&gt;

On occasion, a fourth letter is added to indicate if either the winter or summer half of the year is "wetter" than the other half. To qualify, the wettest month must have at least {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} of average precipitation if all 12 months are above 18 °C (64 °F), or {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} if not; plus at least 70% of the total precipitation must be in the same half of the year as the wettest month — but the letter used indicates when the 'dry' season occurs, not the 'wet' one. This would result in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, being reckoned as ''BWhw''; [[Niamey]], Niger, as ''BShw''; [[Alexandria]], Egypt, as ''BWhs''; [[Asbi'ah]], Libya, as ''BShs''; [[Ömnögovi Province]], Mongolia, as ''BWkw''; and [[Xining]], [[Qinghai]], China, as ''BSkw'' (''BWks'' and ''BSks'' do not exist if 0 °C in the coldest month is recognized as the ''h''/''k'' boundary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}) If the standards for neither ''w'' nor ''s'' are met, no fourth letter is added.

=== Group C: Temperate/mesothermal climates ===
{{anchor|Group C}}
{{main article|Temperate climate}}
In the Koppen climate system, temperate climates are defined as having an average temperature above {{convert|0|°C|°F}} (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|1}}, as noted previously) in their coldest month but below {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}}. The average temperature of {{convert|-3|°C|°F|1}} roughly coincides with the equatorward limit of frozen ground and snowcover lasting for a month or more.

The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern—''w'' indicates dry winters (driest winter month average precipitation less than one-tenth wettest summer month average precipitation. ''s'' indicates at least three times as much rain in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer. ''f'' means significant precipitation in all seasons (neither above-mentioned set of conditions fulfilled).&lt;ref name=Beck /&gt;

The third letter indicates the degree of summer heat—''a'' indicates warmest month average temperature above {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}} while  ''b'' indicates warmest month averaging below 22 °C.

==== Mediterranean climates ====
{{main article|Mediterranean climate}}
These climates usually occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mediterranean Climate |author=Melvin R. George |work=UCRangelands |publisher=University of California |accessdate=2015-01-26 |url=http://californiarangeland.ucdavis.edu/Mediterranean_Climate/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235950/http://californiarangeland.ucdavis.edu/Mediterranean_Climate/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring [[fog]] but prevent rain.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|221–3}}

Dry-summer climates sometimes extend to additional areas (sometimes well north,  or south of) typical Mediterranean climates, however the warmest month mean does not reach {{convert|22|C|1}} they are classified as (''Csb'').&lt;ref name=Beck /&gt; Some of these areas would border the [[Oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), except their dry-summer patterns meet Köppen's ''Cs'' minimum thresholds.

Cold-summer Mediterranean climates (''Csc'') exist in high-elevation areas adjacent to coastal ''Csb'' climate areas, where the strong maritime influence prevents the average winter monthly temperature from dropping below 0 °C. This climate is rare and is predominantly found in climate fringes and isolated areas of the Cascades and Andes Mountains, as the dry-summer climate extends further poleward in the Americas than elsewhere.&lt;ref name="McKnight" /&gt; Rare instances of this climate can be found in some coastal locations in the North Atlantic and at high altitudes in Hawaii.

==== Humid subtropical climates====
{{main article|Humid subtropical climate}}
These climates usually occur on the eastern coasts and eastern sides of continents, usually in the high 20s and 30s latitudes. Unlike the dry summer Mediterranean climates, humid subtropical climates have a warm and wet flow from the tropics that creates warm and moist conditions in the summer months. As such, summer (not winter as is the case in Mediterranean climates) is often the wettest season.
 
The flow out of the subtropical highs and the summer monsoon creates a southerly flow from the tropics that brings warm and moist air to the lower east sides of continents. This flow is often what brings the frequent but short-lived summer thundershowers so typical of the more southerly subtropical  climates like the far southern United States, southern China and Japan.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|223–6}}

==== Oceanic climate ====
{{main article|Oceanic climate}}
''Cfb'' climates usually occur in the higher middle latitudes on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 40° and 60°; they are typically situated immediately poleward of the Mediterranean climates, although in Australia and extreme southern Africa this climate is found immediately poleward of temperate climates, and at a somewhat lower latitude. In western Europe, this climate occurs in coastal areas up to 63°N in Norway.
 
These climates are dominated all year round by the polar front, leading to changeable, often overcast weather. Summers are mild due to cool ocean currents, although hotter, stable weather patterns can set in for periods of time, typically longer at the lower latitude range in the northern hemisphere. Winters are milder than other climates in similar latitudes, but usually very cloudy however not always wet. ''Cfb'' climates are also encountered at high elevations in certain subtropical and tropical areas, where the climate would be that of a subtropical/tropical rain forest if not for the altitude. These climates are called "highlands".&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|226–9}}

Subpolar oceanic climates (''Cfc'') occur poleward of or at higher elevations than the maritime temperate climates, and are mostly confined either to narrow coastal strips on the western poleward margins of the continents, or, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, to islands off such coasts. They occur in both hemispheres, most often at latitudes from 60° north and south to 70° north and south.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;

==== Highland climates ====

Dry-winter highland climate (''Cwb'') is a type of climate mainly found in highlands inside the tropics of [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] or central Argentina and areas outside of the tropics (such as in the subtropics). Winters are noticeable and dry, and summers can be very rainy. In the tropics, the rainy season is provoked by the tropical air masses and the dry winters by subtropical high pressure.

'''Examples'''
* [[Da Lat]], [[Vietnam]] (''Cwb'')
* [[Shimla]], [[India]] (''Cwb'')
* [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]] (''Cwb'')
* [[Mokhotlong]], [[Lesotho]] (''Cwb'')

* [[Cusco]], [[Peru]] (''Cwb'')
* [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (''Cwb'' bordering on ''Cwc'')
* [[Salta]], [[Argentina]] (''Cwb'')
Highland climates with uniform rainfall (''Cfb'') are a type of oceanic climate mainly found in highlands of [[Australia]], such as in or around the [[Great Dividing Range]] in the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], and also sparsely in other continents, such as in [[South America]], among others. Unlike a typical ''Cwb'' climate, they tend to have rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. They have characteristics of both the ''Cfb'' and ''Cfa'' climates. Though unlike these climates, they have a high [[diurnal temperature variation]] and low humidity, owing to their inland location and relatively high [[elevation]].

=== Group D: Continental/microthermal climates ===
{{Main article|Continental climate}}
[[File:Odori Park Sapporo Snow Festival 2007.JPG|thumb|right|The snowy city of [[Sapporo]]]]

These climates have an average temperature above 10 °C (50 °F) in their warmest months, and a coldest month average below 0 °C (or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}, as noted previously). These usually occur in the interiors of continents and on their upper east coasts, normally north of 40°N. In the Southern Hemisphere, group D climates are extremely rare due to the smaller land masses in the middle latitudes and the almost complete absence of land at 40–60°S, existing only in some highland locations.

==== Hot summer continental climates ====

{{main article|Hot-summer humid continental climate}}
 
''Dfa'' climates usually occur in the high 30s and low 40s latitudes, with a qualifying average temperature in the warmest month of greater than 22 °C/72 °F. In Europe, these climates tend to be much drier than in North America. In eastern Asia, ''Dwa'' climates extend further south due to the influence of the Siberian high pressure system, which also causes winters there to be dry, and summers can be very wet because of [[monsoon]] circulation. ''Dsa'' exists at higher elevations adjacent to areas with hot summer Mediterranean (''Csa'') climates.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;{{rp|231–2}}

==== Warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates ====
{{main article|Warm-summer humid continental climate}}
''Dfb'' and ''Dwb'' climates are immediately poleward of hot summer continental climates, generally in the high 40s and low 50s latitudes in North America and Asia, and also extending to higher latitudes in central and eastern Europe and Russia, between the maritime temperate and continental subarctic climates, where it extends up to 65 degrees latitude in places.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;

=== Group E: Polar climates ===
In the Köppen climate system, polar climates are defined as the warmest temperature of any month is below 10 °C (50 °F). Polar climates are further divided into two types, tundra climates and icecap climates:

'''[[Tundra]] climate''' (''ET'' and ''ETf''): Warmest month has an average temperature between 0 and 10 °C. These climates occur on the northern edges of the North American and Eurasian land masses (generally north of 70 °N although it may be found farther south depending on local conditions), and on nearby islands. ''ET'' climates are also found on some islands near the Antarctic Convergence, and at high elevations outside the polar regions, above the tree line.

These climates are a colder and more continental variants of tundra. They would have characteristics of the ice cap climate, but still manage to see monthly average temperatures above 0 °C (32 °F):

'''[[Ice cap climate]]''' (''EF''): This climate is dominant in Antarctica and inner Greenland, but also occurs at extremely high altitudes on mountains, above even tundra. Monthly average temperatures never exceed 0 °C (32 °F) ((or {{convert|-3|°C|°F|0}}).

'''Examples'''
* [[Mount Ararat]], Turkey (''EF'')
* [[Grossglockner]], [[Carinthia]], [[Austria]] (''EF'')
* [[Mount Everest]], China/Nepal (''EF'')
* [[Summit Camp]], Greenland (''EF'')
* [[Scott Base]], [[Antarctica]] (''EF'')
* [[Vostok Station]], Antarctica (''EF''), location of the lowest air temperature ever recorded on Earth.
* [[McMurdo Station]], Antarctica (''EF'')
* [[Byrd Station]], Antarctica (''EF'')

Occasionally, a third, lower-case letter is added to ET climates (distinguishing between ETf, ETs, and ETw), if either the summer or winter is clearly drier than the other half of the year. When the option to include this letter is exercised, the same standards that are used for Groups C and D apply, with the additional requirement that the wettest month must have an average of at least 30 mm precipitation (Group E climates can be as dry or even drier than Group B climates based on actual precipitation received, but their rate of evaporation is much lower). Seasonal precipitation letters are almost never attached to EF climates, mainly due to the difficulty in distinguishing between falling and blowing snow, as snow is the sole source of moisture in these climates.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Ecological significance ==
The Köppen climate classification is based on the empirical relationship between climate and vegetation. This classification provides an efficient way to describe climatic conditions defined by temperature and precipitation and their seasonality with a single metric. Because climatic conditions identified by the Köppen classification are ecologically relevant, it has been widely used to map geographic distribution of long term climate and associated ecosystem conditions.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chen |first1=D. |first2=H. W. |last2=Chen| year=2013 | title=Using the Köppen classification to quantify climate variation and change: An example for 1901–2010 | journal=Environmental Development | volume=6 | pages=69–79 |doi=10.1016/j.envdev.2013.03.007 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464513000328}} ''(direct: [http://hanschen.org/uploads/Chen_and_Chen_2013_envdev.pdf Final Revised Paper])''&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using the classification to identify changes in climate and potential changes in vegetation over time.&lt;ref name=hanschen/&gt; The most important ecological significance of the Köppen climate classification is that it helps to predict the dominant vegetation type based on the climatic data and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Critchfield |first1=Howard J |title=General Climatology |date=1983 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-203-0476-5 |pages=154–161 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a [[Nanjing University]] paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' analyzing climate classifications found that between 1950 and 2010, approximately 5.7% of all land area worldwide had moved from wetter and colder classifications to drier and hotter classifications. The authors also found that the change "cannot be explained as natural variations but are driven by anthropogenic factors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Chan, D. and Wu, Q. |title=Significant anthropogenic-induced changes of climate classes since 1950 |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |number=13487 |doi=10.1038/srep13487 |date=2015 |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13487|bibcode=2015NatSR...513487C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trewartha climate classification scheme ==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}
{{Main article|Trewartha climate classification}}
The Trewartha climate classification is a climate classification system published by American geographer Glenn Thomas Trewartha in 1966, and updated in 1980. It is a modified version of the 1899 Köppen system, created to answer some of the deficiencies of the Köppen system. The Trewartha system attempts to redefine the middle latitudes to be closer to vegetation zoning and genetic climate systems. It was considered a more true or "real world" reflection of the global climate.

For example, under the standard Köppen system, in the [[United States]], western [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] are classed into the same climate zone as [[southern California]], even though the two regions have strikingly different weather and vegetation. Under the old Köppen system cool oceanic climates like that of [[London]] or [[Seattle]] were classed in the same zone as hot subtropical cities like [[Savannah, Georgia]] or [[Brisbane, Australia]]. In the United States, locations like [[Colorado]] and [[Iowa]] which have long, severe winter climates where plants are completely dormant, were classed into the same climate zone as [[Louisiana]] or northern [[Florida]] which have mild winters and a green winter landscape.

== Other Köppen climate maps ==
All maps use the ≥0 °C definition for temperate climates and the 18 °C annual mean temperature threshold to distinguish between hot and cold dry climates.&lt;ref name=Beck /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">The [[BBC]]'s '''Lonclass''' ("London Classification") is a subject classification system used internally at the BBC throughout its [[BBC Archives|archives]].&lt;ref name="vardan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vardan|first=Vijaylakshmi|title=Book Review : A Handbook for Media Librarians|journal=Library Management|year=2008|volume=29|issue=8/9|pages=814–819|issn=0143-5124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonclass is derived from the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC), itself a reworking of the earlier [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC). Lonclass dates from the 1960s,&lt;ref name="vardan" /&gt; whereas UDC was created from DDC in the late 19th century. The BBC adaptation of UDC preserves the core features that distinguish UDC from DDC: an emphasis on a compositional semantics that allows new items to be expressed in terms of relationships between known items.

Lonclass and UDC (like DDC) are expressed using codes based on decimal numbers. Unlike DDC, the Lonclass and UDC codes use additional punctuation to express patterns of relationships and re-usable qualifiers. While Lonclass makes a few structural adjustments to the UDC system to support its emphasis on TV and radio content, its main distinction is in the actual set of topics that are recorded within its authority file and within specific BBC catalogue records. Unlike UDC and DDC, which are widely used across the library community, Lonclass has remained a BBC-internal system since its creation in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="vardan" /&gt;
There are 300,000 subject terms in the Lonclass vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, M.; V. Tablan, H. Cunningham, C. Ursu, and
B. Popov. (2005). "Semantically Enhanced Television News through Web and Video Integration." In ''Second European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC’2005)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

For example, a Lonclass or UDC code may represent “Report on the environmental impact of the decline of tin mining in Sweden in the 20th century“. This would be represented as a sequence of numbers and punctuation. The complex code can be broken down into primitives such as "Sweden" or "tin mining" (which itself could be broken down to "Tin" and "Mining").

Some specific BBC Lonclass examples (with explanatory labels):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32678">'''Master Jesus''' is the theosophical concept of [[Jesus]] in [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]] and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]].

==Position in the Hierarchy of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==
The Master Jesus is one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in Theosophy and is one of the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] (also collectively called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]; with white being in reference to the light) in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on Theosophy. The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by [[Alice Bailey]] and was later regarded by students of the "Ascended Master Teachings" as the Master of the [[Seven Rays|Sixth Ray]].&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" until December 31, 1959, when, according to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], [[Lady Master Nada]] fully took on that Office in the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]]. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with [[Koot Hoomi|Kuthumi]], on January 1, 1956, succeeding [[Maitreya]], who took the Office of "Planetary Buddha" and "Cosmic Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K. The Law of Life: Book II Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989; pages 267-272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana: Summit University Press 1986 page 225&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is not accepted by adherents of traditional Theosophy and the followers of Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]]; they believe that the Master Jesus is still the Chohan of the Sixth Ray and that Maitreya is still the World Teacher.

==Previous incarnations==
{{Theosophy}}
According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the [[Prophet]] of the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in order to aid the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magicians]] in the war of the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians that was going on in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] at that time.

According to Alice A. Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as [[Joshua]], the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and [[Joshua the High Priest]] in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922--Lucis Publishing Page 56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings,&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was also incarnated as [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] of the [[coat of many colors]] in the 17th century BC/16th century BC (approximately between 1650 BC and 1550 BC), as well as [[King David]] (who lived c. 1037 BC until around 970 BC), and [[Elisha]] in the 9th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and birth==
It is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that Jesus’ father [[Saint Joseph]] was one of the incarnations of [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], and that his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], upon her [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] became either a [[Deva (New Age)|deva]]&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 253&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[archangel]] and is now the twin flame (celestial wife) of the [[Raphael (archangel)|Archangel Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Mary, Mother of Jesus—Pages  211-217&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, each of the [[Biblical magi|Magi]] who came to visit the baby [[Jesus]] was an incarnation of one of the ascended masters:  [[Saint Caspar|Caspar]], who gave the gift of [[gold]] to Jesus, was an incarnation of [[Djwal Khul]];&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - Page 33&lt;/ref&gt; Balthasar, who gave the gift of [[frankincense]] to Jesus, was an incarnation of [[Kuthumi]];&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 171&lt;/ref&gt; and Melchior, who gave the gift of [[myrrh]] to Jesus, was an incarnation of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities between the ages of twelve and thirty==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, to prepare for his ministry, Jesus first studied at the ''Brotherhood of [[Luxor]]'' (a [[mystery school]] in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]), and then went to India to study under the ''Great Divine Director'', [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], and ''Lord Himalaya'', the [[Manu (Theosophy)|Manu]] of the [[Root race|Fourth Root Race (Atlantean)]].&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from India, while living in [[Iudea|Judea]], Jesus worked as a [[carpenter]]; his father Joseph helped him get work because he was a [[general contractor]].

==Ministry==
The followers of Benjamin Creme and Alice A. Bailey believe in the [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]]/[[Gnostic]] [[Christology]], promulgated by [[C.W. Leadbeater]], which asserts that the powerful being known as the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] overshadowed the Master Jesus during the [[Ministry of Jesus]], such that there were two beings in one body. Maitreya was the [[Christ]] and the Master Jesus was [[Jesus of Nazareth]]; the combination of the two beings functioned as [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--Theosophical Publishing House Page 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 64&lt;/ref&gt; Those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings believe in the existence of the Maitreya; however, they believe that although he encouraged the mission of Jesus, he did not actually overshadow Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark ''Studies of the Human Aura'' Colorado Springs, Colorado: 1975 - Summit University Press (Claimed to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] from [[Kuthumi]]) Page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crucifixion==
Theosophists and those adherent to the ''Ascended Master Teachings'' alike believe that the Master Jesus underwent the fourth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]] (the ''[[crucifixion]]'') at his [[crucifixion]] in [[Jerusalem]]. According to Alice A. Bailey, for most people at the fourth initiation the crucifixion is symbolic as a severe life test of renunciation, but for Jesus it was literal.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 Lucis Publishing Co. Page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrection==
''Ascended Master Teachings'' organizations adhere to the traditional Christian view that Jesus resurrected and ascended with his own physical body. Some with backgrounds in traditional Theosophy, the writings of Alice A. Bailey, and [[Benjamin Creme]] believe that Jesus resurrected from the body that he had when he incarnated as [[Apollonius of Tyana]], although they do believe he ascended on the 3 day—they believe he had a body functioning at the fourth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]] when he ascended and not a fifth level body.

==Activities between the resurrection and the ascension==
Traditional theosophists believe that the Master Jesus and Maitreya souls' separated from each other just after the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] (which for Jesus was only to the fourth and not the fifth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]]) and do not believe that the Master Jesus went to Kashmir; they believe he went directly to Shamballa to be with the Lord of the World, [[Sanat Kumara]], for a time, until he then incarnated again soon after as [[Apollonius of Tyana]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 152&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that when [[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascended]] on the 3rd day after the resurrection, he [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitated]] from [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] to [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"/&gt;

==Day of Pentecost==
In either case, whether he went directly to Shamballa or to Kashmir when he ascended, presumably he [[Teleportation|teleported]] to a location above Judaea briefly ten days later on the 50th day after his resurrection in order to observe from afar the events of the [[Day of Pentecost]] (or possibly he observed these events by [[remote viewing]]). In both traditional Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings it is believed that these events were coordinated by the [[Maha Chohan]], who, it is asserted by both C.W. Leadbeater and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, is the representative of the [[Holy Ghost]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities after the day of Pentecost==
In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that the Master Jesus lived in Kashmir until he was 81, and then, assuming he had been born in 6 BC, in AD 75, he [[Entering heaven alive|ascended]] to [[Shamballa]] to be with the Lord of the World, [[Sanat Kumara]].&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"/&gt;

==Controversy regarding incarnation as Apollonius of Tyana==
{{Main|Apollonius of Tyana}}
[[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], wrote in 1877: "Apollonius, a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth, was, like him, an enthusiastic founder of a new spiritual school. Perhaps less metaphysical and more practical than Jesus, less tender and perfect in his nature, he nevertheless inculcated the same quintessence of spirituality, and the same high moral truths."&lt;ref&gt;Helena P. Blavatsky: ''Isis Unveiled'', vol. 2, New York 1877 (reprinted 1999), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Theosophists such as [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and the teachers of [[Neo-Theosophy]], Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme, have written that the Master Jesus was also incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana after his incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth. It is believed that he attained the fifth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]] (the ''[[resurrection]]'') when he became an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] at the end of his life as Apollonius of Tyana. However, if Apollonius was a contemporary of Jesus as Blavatsky wrote, Jesus could not have reincarnated as him. Benjamin Creme gets around this by claiming that Jesus lived from 24 BC to AD 9 &lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission Vol. I'' London:1986--Share International Foundation Page 382&lt;/ref&gt; (instead of the usual dates given of Jesus' lifetime as being c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33). This means that Jesus ''could'' have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana, since according to Creme, Apollonius lived from AD 16 to c. AD 97.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission Vol. I'' London:1986--Share International Foundation Page 373&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of the possible chronologies of Apollonius of Tyana's life sometimes cited give his life span as being from AD 40 to AD 120,&lt;ref&gt;For the chronology of AD 40--AD 120 see [[Maria Dzielska]]: ''Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History'', Rome 1986, p. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it possible that, even if the usual dates of Jesus' lifetime are accepted (c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33), he ''still'' could have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana.  However, other modern scholarship, more often cited, gives the dates of Appolonius' life span as c. AD 15 to c. AD 100, thus making it problematic, realistically speaking, that Jesus could have incarnated as him.&lt;ref&gt;For the chronology of AD 15--AD 100 see Maria Dzielska: ''Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History'', Rome 1986, pp. 30–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus' incarnation as Apollonius of Tyana is accepted by the followers of traditional Theosophy, of Alice A. Bailey, and of Benjamin Creme, but not by those who are adherent to the ''Ascended Master Teachings'', who believe that the incarnation as Jesus was his last embodiment on Earth.

==Incarnation as Ramanuja==
[[C.W. Leadbeater]] stated that the Master Jesus, after his resurrection in the body of Apollonius of Tyana, incarnated in India as the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] religious reformer [[Ramanuja]], a leading figure within the [[Bhakti movement]] in [[Hinduism]]; thus, by incarnating as Ramanuja, Jesus became an [[Avatar]]. According to Leadbeater, the Master Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja as part of his spiritual work as Master of the Sixth Ray of Love-Devotion (''bhakti'' is the [[Sanskrit]] word for ''devotion'').&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 Theosophical Publishing House Page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

That Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja is believed by many traditional Theosophists, but not by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings.

==Benjamin Crème's views==
According to [[Benjamin Creme]], the Master Jesus visited the [[Americas]] (as well as [[Polynesia]]) not immediately after his resurrection as recounted in the [[Book of Mormon]], but in the late 7th century and early 8th century, after having descended to the continent of America from his dwelling place in Shamballah with Sanat Kumara.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 378&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Mormons]], Creme believes that this visit gave rise to the legend of [[Quetzalcoatl]].

Benjamin Crème asserted that, in the late 1970s, the Master Jesus appeared to [[Spencer W. Kimball]], then [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the [[Washington D.C. Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Creme stated that since 1990 the Master Jesus has been living in secret in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] makes his [[Share International|Emergence]] (the ''Day of Declaration''), Creme asserted, the Master Jesus in his [[Immortality|immortal]] body will assume the [[Papacy|papal throne]] for the next 2,000 years of the [[Age of Aquarius]].

==Master Jesus' retreat==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Jesus has a sumptuous retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above [[Jerusalem]] called the ''Resurrection Temple''.  Often his mother Mary (now married to the Archangel Raphael, as noted above, and serving the Solar Logos with him in the [[solar corona]]) descends to serve with him at the Resurrection Temple doing sacred rituals and answering prayers.&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"/&gt;

==Twin flame==
Ascended Master Teachings groups describe the Master Jesus as having a ''[[twin flame]]'' (celestial spouse) named '''[[Lady Master Magda]]''', one of whose two known incarnations was [[Mary Magdalene]]; the other was [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Lady Master Magda Pages 196-200&lt;/ref&gt;

==John the Beloved==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Ascended Master '''[[John the Beloved]]''', who was Jesus’ best friend during his lifetime, has a retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above [[Arizona]] where he teaches a variety of [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magic]] that involves the mastery of the [[elemental spirits]] governing the realms of earth, air, water, and fire.  It is believed that the Master Jesus often teleports over to John the Beloved's retreat to say hello to his old friend.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 146-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aetherius Society==
In the teachings of the [[Aetherius Society]], headquartered in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]], it is promulgated that since his resurrection, the Master Jesus has been dwelling mostly on the [[Plane (esotericism)|higher planes]] of Venus in order to work with the '''[[Aetherius Society#Founding|Master Aetherius]]''', but when his presence is required, he [[Teleportation|teleports]] to or takes a [[flying saucer]] to Earth as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[[George King (Aetherius Society)|King, George]], (1996) ''Contacts With The Gods From Space'', [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]], The [[Aetherius Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sananda==
The noted Ascended Master Teachings teacher [[Joshua David Stone]] (whose organization, the I AM University, was originally headquartered near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]), began holding his [[Wesak]] [[Mount Shasta]] gatherings in 1996.  Stone had begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]], that the Master Jesus, under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name "Sananda" (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]], flying with [[Pallas Athena]] in their own flying saucer within the [[Ascended master#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series ''The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path''). {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by Commander Ashtar to denote his flying saucer fleet is "The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091021063637/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html "The Ashtar Command", by Joshua David Stone:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Ashtar is originally from a planet called Ashtar, but he moved to Venus thousands of years ago.  It is said that he formed the Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet at the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]] in 1945 and that in the early 1980s, at the behest of [[Sanat Kumara]], Sananda (the Master Jesus) and Pallas Athena took over command of the fleet.  Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings teacher Sheldan Nidle, who resides in the [[gold country]] in the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]], the Earth base of the Ashtar Galactic Command is known as the New Jerusalem or "Shan Chea". It is a square rotating space station with artificial gravity in constant orbit around Earth on the etheric plane, with orbit distances varying from approximately {{convert|500|mi}} to {{convert|1500|mi}}. It is a large space station with a population of thousands of etheric beings. In the center of this square space station is a sphere connected by four tubes to the square outer ring of the space station. This sphere houses the Inn of Heaven, the command headquarters of Sananda, Lady Master Athena, and Ashtar. There is also a smaller round space station called "Schare" or "Share", where the individual flying saucers of the fleet piloted by those at the higher levels of the fleet command hierarchy dock to receive their orders and review their missions. Within the Inn of Heaven is a private retreat for Sananda (the Master Jesus) in addition to his retreat above Jerusalem. The Master Jesus has a landing pad for his flying saucer at his Jerusalem retreat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashtarcommandcrew.net/page/galactic-federation-fleets Ashtar Command Crew website--Galactic Confederation Fleets--Description of the components of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command'' by ''Lady Master Athena'', dictated thru Sheldan Nidle 25 June 2002 and Littlejohn 8 February 1989; also Mike Quinsey, summarizing the early 1980s revelations of Tuella :]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light==
Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]].  She set up her website in 2001.  Like Joshua David Stone and Luis Prada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/ Website of Luis Prada--many people obtain their knowledge of the Ascended Master Teachings through Luis Prada's "Brother Veritus" Website--Prada's teachings are very close to those of Joshua David Stone--Prada is originally from Colombia where he worked as an Electrical Engineer for an oil refinery--he moved to the U.S. in 1985--he worked in Silicon Valley for many years--he set up his website in  1997 and registered the domain in 1998.:]&lt;/ref&gt; Altiery also teaches that Sananda has taken over as the Commander of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet with his co-commandress Pallas Athena and that Ashtar is now second in command.  She also teaches that an alternate name used by Commander Sananda to denote the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002 {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery):]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lorune.com/ World Global Express—Lourene Altieri master link website:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Lourene Altieri has revealed the names of and [[Channeling (mediumistic)|channeled]] information from some of the other prominent beings who she says travel with Commander Sananda, Pallas Athena, Ashtar, and Vrillon on the saucers of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet. These include :-

'''Aleph Nero''', who's the main commander.

'''Aaron Alaje James''', sub-commander of one of the wings of the fleet, working with a human from Earth, known as Miss '''Megan Sebastian''' who is visiting [[Earth]] to raise the consciousness of humanity and uplift the vibrations of Planet Gaia and [[Agartha]]. Also known as '''Megha''' or ''Meg'' from Alcorn, contributing to Stability and Peace over the Planet Om, and the Princess/Prayer Maiden of the Planet Anova.

'''Korton''', captain of the flying saucer, the fleet communications officer in charge of maintaining [[Subspace radio|subspace communications]] for the fleet.

'''Esola''', captain of the flying saucer ''Starship #77''.

'''Merku''', of the planet Alcorn, subcommander of one of the wings of the fleet.

'''Soltec''', captain of the [[geophysics]] science survey flying saucer ''Phoenix''.

'''Voltra''', the "space [[psychologist]]", who monitors the "[[Chakras|vibratory level]] of [[Human race|humanity]]".

'''Kla-La''', "master of [[force]] [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]".

'''Hatonn''', who monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]] and the '''[[Athena|Lady Master Athena]]''', the ''twin flame'' (celestial wife) of the [[Maha Chohan]]; Altieri teaches that the Lady Master Athena often personally accompanies Commander Sananda on board his command flying saucer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the beings described above are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master on Earth]]==
'''Aaron Johnson James''' (sometimes called '''Lancelot)''' is the name given to an extraterrestrial being, a [[Nordic alien]] with whom some number of people claim to have had contact. He might be from the [[Great White Brotherhood]], which is also known as the Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, which is perceived as being a spiritual organization composed of those [[Ascended master#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ascended Masters]] who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but who still maintain an active watch over the habitable worlds. The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] directly concerned with the evolution of our world), [[Ascended master#Cosmic beings on Venus|Beneficent Members from other planets]]. He may be connected to Modern [[Rosicrucianism]] and the [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] Teachings, responsible for the [[New Age]] culture of the [[Age of Aquarius]], and also to the UFO Religion [[Aetherius Society]], whose headquarters is in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, although the 26 November 1977 [[Southern Television broadcast interruption]] must have a connection with his disappearance. Lancelot is currently working with ''Jesus Christ'' and [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] in the [[Master Jesus#Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light|Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light]], Sub-Commander of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet, "working towards raising the consciousness of humanity and uplifting the vibrations of planet Earth", [[Angel#Interaction with angels|Angels]] Teachings, The Master and the Path and is the representative of the Holy Ghost on Earth. Lancelot is said to be an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from the planet called Alcorn, which operates in the fourth sector of the Milky Way Galaxy – Olega, Quadra. He is said to be the crowned Prince of Alcorn, but for some reason he ran away from his [[planet]] and since then he is trespassing on [[earth]] and lives secretly in [[Agartha]]; he is working with the [[celestial beings]] whom [[humans]] worship as [[Gods|God]] on earth. Lancelot has a Nordic/Angelic (human-like) appearance and originates from the system that orbits The Constellation of Pleiades.

==Hatonn and the photon belt==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], the work of '''Hatonn'''
feeding information about events on Earth via subspace relay to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records" is secondary to  Hatonn's primary task (Hatonn is, she states, a Pleiadean), which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between [[Sanat Kumara]] and the [[Pleiadeans]] for the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate through the approaching [[photon belt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the New York Times, Paul Zweig maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;"Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Master Jesus was never one of the "Masters" that Madame Blavatsky claimed to have met. He was added as a "Master" by [[Annie Besant]] and [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in their 1913 book ''[[Man: Whence, How and Whither]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie and Leadbeater, C.W. ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'' Adyar, India:1913 Theosophical Publishing House Page Page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
'''[[Panelology]]'''
* In the 1973 [[underground comics|underground comic book]] titled ''Occult Laff-Parade'', [[cartoonist]] [[Jay Kinney]] drew a [[comic strip]] in which the Master Jesus is portrayed as commanding a [[flying saucer]] fleet orbiting Earth looking for evil-doers. He is shown as being dressed in a [[military uniform]] with a [[crew cut]] and having the title ''Commander Jesus''[http://archives.weirdload.com/art/spacejc2.gif].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weirdload.com/vat-ufo3.html Source of image of Jay Kinney’s depiction of Commander Jesus--"Jay Nelson’s Weird Load--Strange Thoughts for Strange Times":]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Occult Laff-Parade'' San Francisco:1973 The Print Mint-—See 4-page comic strip by Jay Kinney and Ned Sonntag entitled "Bud Tuttle and Commander Jesus". It was a [[satire]] of a series of UFO messages from the Master Jesus that had been allegedly channeled by a woman named Nada Yolanda. [http://www.thenewearth.org/mahtnada.html Nada Yolanda:].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[web comic]] ''Master Jesus'', written by Len Kody and drawn by Steve Bialik, appeared beginning in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nerdcityonline.com/2010/07/25/nerd-city-proudly-presents-len-kodys-master-jesus/ Nerd City web comic "Master Jesus", written by Len Kody and drawn by Steve Bialik:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801075522/http://nerdcityonline.com/2010/07/25/nerd-city-proudly-presents-len-kodys-master-jesus/ |date=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">{{Merge from |Civil courage|discuss=Talk:Moral courage#Proposed merge of Civil courage into Moral courage|date=March 2018 }}
'''Moral courage''' is the [[courage]] to take action for [[morality|moral]] reasons despite the risk of adverse consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6cXR36GYA4C&amp;pg=PA55 |chapter=The Courage To Do The Right Thing  choose between right and wrong|title=The right thing to do: an ethics guide for engeenering students |author=P. Aarne Vesilind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courage is required to take action when one has doubts or fears about the consequences.  Moral courage therefore involves deliberation or careful thought.  [[Reflex action]] or dogmatic [[fanaticism]] do not involve moral courage because such impulsive actions are not based upon moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKS-59iyxwC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=Courage, a philosophical investigation |author=Douglas N. Walton |chapter=Moral Deliberation and Conduct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral courage may also require physical courage when the consequences are [[punishment]] or other bodily peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-BLZ0WVlNIC&amp;pg=PA2 |title=Psychological courage |author=Daniel A. Putman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral courage has been seen as the exemplary [[modernist]] form of courage.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Shippey, ''The Road to Middle Earth'' (1992) pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting approach==
Parenting with the incorporation of moral courage can have an effect on the [[gender roles]] and self-expression of young adolescents. For example, young girls who conform to society's interpretation of women being passive.&lt;ref name="Parenting/Gender Roles"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bronstein|first1=Phyllis|last2=Fox|first2=Barbara J.|last3=Kamon|first3=Jody L.|last4=Knolls|first4=Michelle L.|title=Parenting and Gender as Predictors of Moral Courage in Late Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-007-9182-8|website=Sex Roles|accessdate=17 February 2017|pages=661–74|language=en|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9182-8|date=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the parents and children engage in moral courage from different standpoints. The development of moral courage within parenting looks at not only on the parent's passed down moral values but the children's autonomy on how to perceive and practice their moral values.&lt;ref name="Parenting/Gender Roles" /&gt; Those who incorporate the practice of their morals values into their everyday lives engage in moral courage to protect those values as well.&lt;ref name="LGBT Gender Identity Workplace Moral Courage"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=A. K.|last2=Edwards|first2=K.|title=Allies in the Workplace: Including LGBT in HRD|journal=[[Advances in Developing Human Resources]]|date=5 January 2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=136–49|doi=10.1177/1523422308328500|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1523422308328500|accessdate=28 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this parenting approach with practice of moral courage demonstrates a relationship between how parents morally raise their children and how the children choose to act based on their learned moral values.

==Workplace allies==
In a workplace, LGBT employees can experience behaviors or actions of discriminating nature as well as violent [[hate crime]]s. As sexual and [[gender identity]] minorities, the LGBT employees express a need for [[Lgbt ally|straight or heterosexual allies]] in the workplace to go to as a resource.

A research study was performed using qualitative research methods to analyze the process of how and individuals become LGBT allies.&lt;ref name="Workplace Allies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Ann K.|last2=Edwards|first2=Kathleen|title=Allies in the Workplace: Including LGBT in HRD|journal=Advances in Developing Human Resources|date=1 February 2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=136–49|doi=10.1177/1523422308328500|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1523422308328500|language=en|issn=1523-4223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study mentions how [[human resources development]] play a role in this matter. Human resources development professionals have the responsibility and the power to incorporate what LGBT employees desire in a workplace: inclusion, safety, and equal treatment with heterosexual employees.&lt;ref name="Workplace Allies" /&gt;

Moral courage distinguishes the abilities of a heterosexual LGBT ally and a human resources development professional. While heterosexual LGBT allies, acting on their moral values provide support and stand up for their LGBT colleagues, human resource development professionals and their positions in the workplace translates their values into action which translates into movement for change regarding LGBT discrimination.&lt;ref name="Workplace Allies" /&gt;

Whereas the traditional '''IS-LM''' model deals with economy under [[autarky]] (or a closed economy), the Mundell–Fleming model describes a small open economy. Mundell's paper suggests that the model can be applied to Zurich, Brussels and so on.&lt;ref name="Mundell" /&gt;

The Mundell–Fleming model portrays the short-run relationship between an economy's nominal exchange rate, interest rate, and output (in contrast to the closed-economy '''IS-LM''' model, which focuses only on the relationship between the interest rate and output). The Mundell–Fleming model has been used to argue that an economy cannot simultaneously maintain a [[fixed exchange rate]], [[free movement of capital and payments|free capital movement]], and an independent [[monetary policy]].  This principle is frequently called the "[[impossible trinity]]," "unholy trinity," "irreconcilable trinity," "inconsistent trinity," policy trilemma," or the "Mundell–Fleming [[trilemma]]."

==Basic set up==

===Assumptions===
Basic assumptions of the model are as follows:&lt;ref name="Mundell" /&gt;
* Spot and forward exchange rates are identical, and the existing exchange rates are expected to persist indefinitely.   
* Fixed money [[wage rate]], unemployed resources and constant [[returns to scale]] are assumed. Thus domestic price level is kept constant, and the supply of domestic output is elastic.  
* Taxes and saving increase with income. 
* The balance of trade depends only on income and the exchange rate. 
* [[Capital mobility]] is less than perfect and all securities are perfect substitutes. Only risk neutral investors are in the system. The demand for money therefore depends only on income and the interest rate, and investment depends on the interest rate.    
* The country under consideration is so small that the country can not affect foreign incomes or the world level of interest rates.

===Variables===
This model uses the following variables:
* ''Y'' is [[GDP]]
* ''C'' is [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]
* ''I'' is [[fixed investment|physical investment]]
* ''G'' is [[government spending]] (an [[exogenous variable]])
* ''M'' is the nominal [[money supply]]
* ''P'' is the [[price level]]
* ''i'' is the nominal [[interest rate]]
* ''L'' is liquidity preference (real [[money demand]])
* ''T'' is [[taxes]]
* ''NX'' is [[net exports]]

===Equations===
The Mundell–Fleming model is based on the following equations.

The '''IS''' curve:
:&lt;math&gt;Y=C+I+G+NX \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''NX'' is net [[exports]].

The '''LM''' curve:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{M}{P}=L(i, Y)&lt;/math&gt;
A higher interest rate or a lower income (GDP) level leads to lower money demand.

The '''BoP''' (Balance of Payments) Curve:
:&lt;math&gt;BoP=CA+KA \, &lt;/math&gt;
where '''BoP''' is the [[balance of payments]] surplus, ''CA'' is the [[current account]] surplus, and ''KA'' is the [[capital account]] surplus.

===IS components===
:&lt;math&gt;C=C (Y-T(Y), i-E( \pi )) \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''E''(π) is the expected rate of [[inflation]]. Higher disposable income or a lower real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus expected inflation) leads to higher consumption spending.

:&lt;math&gt;I=I(i-E(\pi), Y_{t-1}) \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt; is GDP in the previous period. Higher lagged income or a lower real interest rate leads to higher investment spending.

:&lt;math&gt;NX=NX (e, Y, Y^*)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''NX'' is [[net exports]], ''e'' is the nominal [[exchange rate]] (the price of foreign currency in terms of units of the domestic currency), ''Y'' is GDP, and ''Y*'' is the combined GDP of countries that are foreign trading partners. Higher domestic income (GDP) leads to more spending on imports and hence lower net exports; higher foreign income leads to higher  spending by foreigners on the country's exports and thus higher net exports. A higher ''e'' leads to higher net exports.

===Balance of payments (BoP) components===
*&lt;math&gt;CA=NX&lt;/math&gt;
**where ''CA'' is the current account and ''NX'' is net exports. That is, the current account is viewed as consisting solely of imports and exports.
*&lt;math&gt;KA=z(i-i^*)+k&lt;/math&gt;
**where &lt;math&gt;i^*&lt;/math&gt; is the foreign interest rate, ''k'' is the exogenous component of financial capital flows, ''z'' is the interest-sensitive component of capital flows, and the derivative of the function ''z'' is the degree of capital mobility (the effect of differences between domestic and foreign interest rates upon capital flows ''KA'').

===Variables determined by the model===
After the subsequent equations are substituted into the first three equations above, one has a system of three equations in three unknowns, two of which are GDP and the domestic interest rate.  Under [[Exchange rate flexibility|flexible exchange rate]]s, the exchange rate is the third [[Endogeny#Economics and finance|endogenous variable]] while '''BoP''' is set equal to zero. In contrast, under [[fixed exchange rate]]s ''e'' is exogenous and the balance of payments surplus is determined by the model.

Under both types of exchange rate regime, the nominal domestic money supply ''M'' is exogenous, but for different reasons. Under flexible exchange rates, the nominal money supply is completely under the control of the central bank. But under fixed exchange rates, the money supply in the short run (at a given point in time) is fixed based on past international money flows, while as the economy evolves over time these international flows cause future points in time to inherit higher or lower (but pre-determined) values of the money supply.

==Mechanics of the model==
The model's workings can be described in terms of an '''IS-LM-BoP''' graph with the domestic interest rate plotted vertically and real GDP plotted horizontally. The '''IS''' curve is downward sloped and the '''LM''' curve is upward sloped, as in the closed economy '''IS-LM''' analysis; the '''BoP''' curve is upward sloped unless there is perfect capital mobility, in which case it is horizontal at the level of the world interest rate.

In this graph, under less than perfect capital mobility the positions of both the '''IS''' curve and the '''BoP''' curve depend on the exchange rate (as discussed below), since the '''IS-LM''' graph is actually a two-dimensional [[cross-section (geometry)|cross-section]] of a three-dimensional space involving all of the interest rate, income, and the exchange rate. However, under perfect capital mobility the '''BoP''' curve is simply horizontal at a level of the domestic interest rate equal to the level of the world interest rate.

===Under a flexible exchange rate regime===
In a system of flexible exchange rates, central banks allow the exchange rate to be determined by market forces alone.

==== Changes in the money supply ====
An increase in money supply shifts the '''LM''' curve to the right. This directly reduces the local interest rate relative to the global interest rate. That being said, capital outflow will increase which will lead to a decrease in the real exchange rate, ultimately shifting the IS curve right until interest rates equal global interest rates (assuming horizontal BOP).  A decrease in the money supply causes the exact opposite process.

==== Changes in government spending ====
An increase in government expenditure shifts the '''IS''' curve to the right. This will mean that domestic interest rates and GDP rise. However, this increase in the interest rates attracts foreign investors wishing to take advantage of the higher rates so they demand the domestic currency therefore it appreciates. The strengthening of the currency will mean it is more expensive for domestic producers to export so net exports will decrease therefore cancelling out the rise in government spending and shifting the '''IS''' curve to the left. Therefore, the rise in government spending will have no effect on the national GDP or interest rate.

==== Changes in the global interest rate ====
An increase in the global interest rate shifts the '''BoP''' curve upward and causes capital flows out of the local economy. This depreciates the local currency and boosts net exports, shifting the '''IS''' curve to the right. Under less than perfect capital mobility, the depreciated exchange rate shifts the '''BoP''' curve somewhat back down.Under perfect capital mobility, the '''BoP''' curve is always horizontal at the level of the world interest rate. When the latter goes up, the '''BoP''' curve shifts upward by the same amount, and stays there. The exchange rate changes enough to shift the '''IS''' curve to the location where it crosses the new '''BoP''' curve at its intersection with the unchanged '''LM''' curve; now the domestic interest rate equals the new level of the global interest rate.

A decrease in the global interest rate causes the reverse to occur.

===Under a fixed exchange rate regime===
In a system of fixed exchange rates, central banks announce an exchange rate (the parity rate) at which they are prepared to buy or sell any amount of domestic currency. Thus net payments flows into or out of the country need not equal zero; the exchange rate ''e'' is exogenously given, while the variable '''BoP''' is endogenous.

Under the fixed exchange rate system, the central bank operates in the [[foreign exchange market]] to maintain a specific exchange rate. If there is pressure to devalue the domestic currency's exchange rate because the supply of domestic currency exceeds its demand in foreign exchange markets, the local authority buys domestic currency with foreign currency to decrease the domestic currency's supply in the foreign exchange market. This keeps the domestic currency's exchange rate at its targeted level. If there is pressure to appreciate the domestic currency's exchange rate because the currency's demand exceeds its supply in the foreign exchange market, the local authority buys foreign currency with domestic currency to increase the domestic currency's supply in the foreign exchange market. Again, this keeps the exchange rate at its targeted level.

==== Changes in the money supply ====
In the very short run the money supply is normally predetermined by the past history of international payments flows. If the central bank is maintaining an exchange rate that is consistent with a balance of payments surplus, over time money will flow into the country and the money supply will rise (and vice versa for a payments deficit). If the central bank were to conduct [[open market operation]]s in the domestic bond market in order to offset these balance-of-payments-induced changes in the money supply — a process called [[sterilization (economics)|sterilization]], it would absorb newly arrived money by decreasing its holdings of domestic bonds (or the opposite if money were flowing out of the country). But under perfect capital mobility, any such sterilization would be met by further offsetting international flows.
==== Changes in government expenditure ====
[[File:Mundell-Fleming example fixed exchange rate.png|thumb|250px|right|An increase in government spending forces the monetary authority to supply the market with local currency to keep the exchange rate unchanged. Shown here is the case of perfect capital mobility, in which the '''BoP''' curve (or, as denoted here, the FE curve) is horizontal.]]
Increased government expenditure shifts the ''IS'' curve to the right. The shift results in an incipient rise in the interest rate, and hence upward pressure on the exchange rate (value of the domestic currency) as foreign funds start to flow in, attracted by the higher interest rate. However, the exchange rate is controlled by the local monetary authority in the framework of a fixed exchange rate system. To maintain the exchange rate and eliminate pressure on it, the monetary authority purchases foreign currency using domestic funds in order to shift the '''LM''' curve to the right. In the end, the interest rate stays the same but the general income in the economy increases. In the '''IS-LM-BoP''' graph, the '''IS''' curve has been shifted exogenously by the fiscal authority, and the '''IS''' and '''BoP''' curves determine the final resting place of the system; the '''LM''' curve merely passively reacts.

The reverse process applies when government expenditure decreases.

==== Changes in the global interest rate ====
To maintain the fixed exchange rate, the central bank must accommodate the capital flows (in or out) which are caused by a change of the global interest rate, in order to offset pressure on the exchange rate.

If the global interest rate increases, shifting the '''BoP''' curve upward, capital flows out to take advantage of the opportunity. This puts pressure on the home currency to depreciate, so the central bank must buy the home currency — that is, sell some of its foreign currency reserves — to accommodate this outflow. The decrease in the money supply resulting from the outflow, shifts the '''LM''' curve to the left until it intersect the '''IS''' and '''BoP''' curves at their intersection. Once again, the '''LM''' curve plays a passive role, and the outcomes are determined by the '''IS-BoP''' interaction.

Under perfect capital mobility, the new '''BoP''' curve will be horizontal at the new world interest rate, so the equilibrium domestic interest rate will equal the world interest rate.

If the global interest rate declines below the domestic rate, the opposite occurs. The '''BoP''' curve shifts down, foreign money flows in and the home currency is pressured to appreciate, so the central bank offsets the pressure by selling domestic currency (equivalently, buying foreign currency). The inflow of money causes the '''LM''' curve to shift to the right, and the domestic interest rate becomes lower (as low as the world interest rate if there is perfect capital mobility).

==Differences from IS-LM==
It is worth noting that some of the results from this model differ from those of the '''IS-LM''' model because of the [[open economy]] assumption. Results for a large open economy, on the other hand, can be consistent with those predicted by the '''IS-LM''' model. The reason is that a large open economy has the characteristics of both an autarky and a small open economy. In particular, it may not face perfect capital mobility, thus allowing internal policy measures to affect the domestic interest rate, and it may be able to sterilize balance-of-payments-induced changes in the money supply (as discussed above).

In the '''IS-LM''' model, the domestic interest rate is a key component in keeping both the money market and the goods market in equilibrium. Under the Mundell–Fleming framework of a small economy facing perfect capital mobility, the domestic interest rate is fixed and equilibrium in both markets can only be maintained by adjustments of the nominal exchange rate or the money supply (by international funds flows).

===Example===
The Mundell–Fleming model applied to a small open economy facing perfect capital mobility, in which the domestic interest rate is exogenously determined by the world interest rate, shows stark differences from the closed economy model.

Consider an exogenous increase in government expenditure. Under the '''IS-LM''' model, the '''IS''' curve shifts upward, with the '''LM''' curve intact, causing the interest rate and output to rise. But for a small open economy with perfect capital mobility and a flexible exchange rate, the domestic interest rate is predetermined by the horizontal '''BoP''' curve, and so by the '''LM''' equation given previously there is exactly one level of output that can make the money market be in equilibrium at that interest rate. Any exogenous changes affecting the '''IS''' curve (such as government spending changes) will be exactly offset by resulting exchange rate changes, and the '''IS''' curve will end up in its original position, still intersecting the '''LM''' and '''BoP''' curves at their intersection point.

The Mundell–Fleming model under a fixed exchange rate regime also has completely different implications from those of the closed economy '''IS-LM''' model. In the closed economy model, if the central bank expands the money supply the '''LM''' curve shifts out, and as a result income goes up and the domestic interest rate goes down. But in the Mundell–Fleming open economy model with perfect capital mobility, monetary policy becomes ineffective. An expansionary monetary policy resulting in an incipient outward shift of the '''LM''' curve would make capital flow out of the economy. The central bank under a fixed exchange rate system would have to instantaneously intervene by selling foreign money in exchange for domestic money to maintain the exchange rate. The accommodated monetary outflows exactly offset the intended rise in the domestic money supply, completely offsetting the tendency of the '''LM''' curve to shift to the right, and the interest rate remains equal to the world rate of interest.

==Criticism==

===Exchange rate expectations===
One of the assumptions of the Mundell–Fleming model is that domestic and foreign securities are perfect substitutes. Provided the world interest rate &lt;math&gt;i^\star &lt;/math&gt; is given, the model predicts the domestic rate will become the same level of the world rate by arbitrage in money markets. However, in reality, the world interest rate is different from the domestic rate. [[Rüdiger Dornbusch]] considered how exchange rate expectations made an effect on the exchange rate.&lt;ref name=dornbusch1976EE&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Dornbusch |title=Exchange Rate Expectations and Monetary Policy |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=231–244 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/0022-1996(76)90001-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the approximate formula:
:&lt;math&gt; i = i^\star + \frac{ e' }{e} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;
and if the elasticity of expectations &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, is less than unity, then we have
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{di}{de} = \sigma - 1 &lt; 0  \quad . &lt;/math&gt;
Since domestic output is &lt;math&gt;y = E (i, y) + T(e, y) &lt;/math&gt;, the differentiation of income with regard to the exchange rate becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d y}{d e} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial i} \frac{di}{de} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{de} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial e} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{de} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{de} = \frac{1}{ 1 - E_{y} - T_{y} } \left(  E_{i} \frac{di}{de} + T_{e} \right) \; . &lt;/math&gt;
The standard IS-LM theory gives us the following basic relations:
:&lt;math&gt; E_{i} &lt; 0 \; , \quad E_{y} = 1-s &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_{e} &gt; 0 \; , \quad T_{y} = - m  &lt; 0    \; . &lt;/math&gt;
Investment and consumption increase as the interest rates decrease, and currency depreciation improves the trade balance.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{de} = \frac{1}{s+m}  \left( E_{i} \frac{di}{de} + T_{e}   \right)  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{de} = \frac{1}{s+m}  \left( E_{i} ( \sigma - 1 ) + T_{e}   \right) \; .  &lt;/math&gt;
Then the total differentiations of trade balance and the demand for money are derived.
:&lt;math&gt; dT = \frac{\partial T}{\partial e} de + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} dy = T_{e} de + T_{y} dy &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; dL = \frac{\partial L}{\partial i} di + \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} dy = L_{i} di + L_{y} dy &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L_{i} &lt; 0 \; , \quad L_{y} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and then, it turns out that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dT}{dL} = \frac{ T_{e} (s+m) + T_{y} ( E_{i} (\sigma -1) + T_{e}  ) }{  L_{i} (\sigma - 1) (s+m) + L_{y} (  E_{i} (\sigma - 1) + T_{e}   ) } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dT}{dL} = \frac{ T_{e} s + T_{y} E_{i} (\sigma -1)  }{  L_{i} (\sigma - 1) (s+m) + L_{y} (  E_{i} (\sigma - 1) + T_{e}   ) }  \; .  &lt;/math&gt;
The denominator is positive, and the numerator is positive or negative. Thus, a monetary expansion, in the short run, does not necessarily improve the trade balance. This result is not compatible with what the Mundell-Fleming predicts.&lt;ref name=dornbusch1976EE /&gt; This is a consequence of introducing exchange rate expectations which the MF theory ignores. Nevertheless, Dornbusch concludes that monetary policy is still effective even if it worsens a trade balance, because a monetary expansion pushes down interest rates and encourages spending. He adds that, in the short run, fiscal policy works because it raises interest rates and the velocity of money.&lt;ref name=dornbusch1976EE /&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Office for Civil Rights''' ('''OCR''') is a sub-agency of the [[U.S. Department of Education]] that is primarily focused on enforcing [[civil rights]] laws prohibiting schools from engaging in discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or membership in patriotic youth organizations.

==Mission==
OCR is one of the largest federal civil rights agencies in the United States, with a staff of approximately 560 attorneys, investigators, and other staff.  The agency can be found in twelve regional offices and in its [[Washington, D.C.]] headquarters.  The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for ensuring compliance by schools that are public entities or recipients of federal education funds with several federal civil rights laws, including:

* [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (in {{USCFR|34|100}}, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/101 101]),
* [[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (in 34 C.F.R. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/106 106]),
* Title II of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (in {{USCFR|28|35}}),
* Section 504 of the [[1973 Rehabilitation Act|Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] (in 34 C.F.R. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/104 104], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/105 105]),
* the [[Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act]] (in 34 C.F.R. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/108 108]), and
* the [[Age Discrimination Act of 1975]] (in 34 C.F.R. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/110 110]).

In the case of [[school bullying]] school districts may violate these civil rights statutes and the Department of Educations's implementing regulations when peer harassment based on race, color, national origin, sex, or disability is sufficiently serious that it creates a hostile environment and such harassment is encouraged, tolerated, not adequately addressed, or ignored by school employees. Under these federal civil rights laws and regulations, students are protected from harassment by school employees, other students, and third parties.&lt;ref name="Letter to a Colleague"/&gt;

==Leadership==
The ''United States Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights'' is the head of the OCR.  The Assistant Secretary is also the primary [[civil rights]] adviser to the [[United States Secretary of Education]].

Former Assistant Secretaries were:
* Cynthia G. Brown (1980)
* [[Clarence Thomas]] (1981–1982)

For example, the school discipline letter has been criticized by Professor Gail Heriot (who sits on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and Alison Somin as both bad policy and beyond the scope of the powers of the Office for Civil Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Heriot &amp; Alison Somin, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3104221 The Department of Education's Obama-Era Initiative on Racial Disparities in School Discipline:  Wrong for Students and Teachers,Wrong on the Law], Texas Journal of Law &amp; Politics (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual violence investigations==
{{main|List of American higher education institutions with open Title IX sexual violence investigations}}
On May 1, 2014, the Office for Civil Rights released a list of higher education institutions with open [[Title IX]] sexual violence investigations.&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce/&gt;  {{As of|2015|3|16}}, nearly 100 colleges and universities were under investigation.&lt;ref name=war/&gt;

This list constitutes the first time the federal government has announced ongoing sexual violence investigations; previously investigations were known only to members of university and college communities.&lt;ref name=Steinhauer/&gt;  When announcing the schools under investigation, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon suggested that "increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue... and foster better public awareness of civil rights."&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce/&gt;

The decision to release the names of universities and colleges under investigation was due to pressure from both the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]] and the [[New Campus Anti-Rape Movement]].&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; Importantly, Lhamon continued, "a college or university's appearance on this list and being the subject of a Title IX investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the college or university is violating or has violated the law."&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce/&gt;

There are critics of the list on both sides of campus anti-rape politics. Andrea Pino, a complainant against [[University of North Carolina|UNC-Chapel Hill]] and co-founder of [[End Rape on Campus]], told the Huffington Post that "announcing an investigation can open survivors to retaliation, and it's important that the OCR also take emphasis on providing survivors an option to opt out of having their investigation announced if it could endanger them, especially in small institutions where anonymity is less of an option."&lt;ref name=Kingkade/&gt; Organizations like FIRE have argued that the OCR list—along with its precursor the [[Dear colleague letter]]—violates the rights to due process for both institutions and individuals.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

On July 2, 2014, the Office for Civil Rights added 12 colleges and universities to its list,&lt;ref name=twelve/&gt; on July 10, 2014 one more was added,&lt;ref name=Lamb/&gt; and four more were named on July 30, 2014.&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

=== Concluded investigations ===
In November 2014, the Office for Civil Rights announced that it had found Princeton University in violation of Title IX. The Office and Princeton reached an agreement on a package of procedural reforms to bring it into compliance including mandatory training, a public awareness and bystander intervention campaign, reexamination of three years of past sexual violence complaints, improved coordination with law enforcement, and expanded documentation of sexual violence on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/princeton-university-found-violation-title-ix-reaches-agreement-us-education-department-address-prevent-sexual-assault-and-harassment-students|title=Princeton University Found in Violation of Title IX, Reaches Agreement with U.S. Education Department to Address, Prevent Sexual Assault and Harassment of Students|date=2014-11-05|work=US Department of Education|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2945">'''Online optimization''' is a field of [[optimization]] theory, more popular in [[computer science]] and [[operations research]], that deals with optimization problems having no or incomplete knowledge of the future (online). These kind of problems are denoted as online problems and are seen as opposed to the classical optimization problems where complete information is assumed (offline). The research on online optimization can be distinguished into online problems where multiple decisions are made sequentially based on a piece-by-piece input and those where a decision is made only once. A famous online problem where a decision is made only once is the [[Ski rental problem]]. In general, the output of an [[online algorithm]] is compared to the solution of a corresponding offline algorithm which is necessarily always optimal and knows the entire input in advance (competitive analysis).

In many situations, present decisions (for example, resources allocation) must be made with incomplete knowledge of the future or distributional assumptions on the future are not reliable. In such cases, online optimization&lt;ref&gt;Jaillet, Patrick, and Michael R. Wagner. Online Optimization. Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  can be used, which is different from other approaches such as [[robust optimization]], [[stochastic optimization]] and Markov decision processes.

== Online problems ==
A problem exemplifying the concepts of online algorithms is the [[Canadian traveller problem]]. The goal of this problem is to minimize the cost of reaching a target in a weighted graph where some of the edges are unreliable and may have been removed from the graph. However, that an edge has been removed (''failed'') is only revealed to ''the traveller'' when she/he reaches one of the edge's endpoints. The worst case for this problem is simply that all of the unreliable edges fail and the problem reduces to the usual [[shortest path problem]]. An alternative analysis of the problem can be made with the help of competitive analysis. For this method of analysis, the offline algorithm knows in advance which edges will fail and the goal is to minimize the ratio between the online and offline algorithms' performance. This problem is [[PSPACE-complete]].

There are many formal problems that offer more than one ''online algorithm'' as solution:
* [[K-server problem]]
* [[Job shop scheduling|Job shop scheduling problem]]
* [[List update problem]]
* [[Bandit problem]]
* [[Secretary problem]]
* [[Search games]]
* [[Ski rental problem]]
* [[Linear search problem]]
* Portfolio selection problem&lt;ref name=doc16&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dochow|first1=Robert|title=Online Algorithms for the Portfolio Selection Problem|date=2016|publisher=Springer Gabler|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783658135270|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orthogenesis''', also known as '''orthogenetic evolution''', '''progressive evolution''', '''evolutionary progress''', or '''progressionism''', is the biological [[hypothesis]] that [[organism]]s have an innate tendency to [[evolution|evolve]] in a definite direction [[teleology|towards some goal (teleology)]] due to some internal mechanism or "driving force".{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pages=268–270}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |date=1988 |title=Toward a New Philosophy of Biology: Observations of an Evolutionist |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=499 |isbn=0-674-89666-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} According to the theory, the [[largest-scale trends in evolution]] have an absolute goal such as [[Evolution of biological complexity|increasing biological complexity]]. Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Teilhard de Chardin|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and [[Henri Bergson]].

The term ''orthogenesis'' was introduced by [[Wilhelm Haacke]] in 1893 and popularized by [[Theodor Eimer]] five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of [[natural selection]] as the organizing mechanism in [[evolution]] for a rectilinear model of directed evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ulett, Mark A. |date=2014 |title=Making the case for orthogenesis: The popularization of definitely directed evolution (1890–1926) |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |volume=45 |pages=124–132 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], in which [[genetics]] was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other [[alternatives to Darwinism]] were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared. The evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] made the term effectively taboo in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1948, by stating that it implied "some supernatural force".{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}&lt;ref name=Mayr1948&gt;Letter from [[Ernst Mayr]] to R. H. Flower, ''Evolution'' papers, 23 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The American paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with [[vitalism]] by describing it as "the mysterious inner force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |date=1953 |title=Life of the Past: An Introduction to Paleontology |publisher=Yale University Press |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern supporters include [[E. O. Wilson]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]], while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.

The philosopher of biology [[Michael Ruse]] notes that in popular culture evolution and progress are synonyms, while the unintentionally misleading image of the ''[[March of Progress]]'', from apes to modern humans, has been widely imitated.

{{further|Teleology in biology}}

The term orthogenesis (from Ancient Greek ὀρθός orthós, "straight", and γένεσις génesis, "origin") was first used by the biologist [[Wilhelm Haacke]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=LevitOlsson2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould 2002"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=2002 |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=351–352 |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Eimer]] was the first to give the word a definition; he defined orthogenesis as "the general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction, above all in specialized groups".&lt;ref name="Lane 1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lane, David H. |date=1996 |title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age |publisher=Mercer University Press |pages=60–64 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the zoologist [[Michael F. Guyer]] wrote:

{{quote|[Orthogenesis] has meant many different things to many different people, ranging from a mystical [[inner perfecting principle]], to merely a general trend in development due to the natural constitutional restrictions of the germinal materials, or to the physical limitations imposed by a narrow environment. In most modern statements of the theory, the idea of continuous and progressive change in one or more characters, due according to some to internal factors, according to others to external causes-evolution in a "straight line" seems to be the central idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Guyer, Michael F. |date=1922 |jstor=2456504 |title=Orthogenesis and Serological Phenomena |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=56 |issue=643 |pages=116–133 |doi=10.1086/279852}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Susan R. Schrepfer in 1983:

{{quote|Orthogenesis meant literally "straight origins", or "straight line evolution". The term varied in meaning from the overtly vitalistic and theological to the mechanical. It ranged from theories of mystical forces to mere descriptions of a general trend in development due to natural limitations of either the germinal material or the environment&amp;nbsp;... By 1910, however most who subscribed to orthogenesis hypothesized some physical rather than metaphysical determinant of orderly change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schrepfer, Susan R. |date=1983 |title=Fight to Save the Redwoods: A History of the Environmental Reform, 1917–1978 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |pages=81–82 |isbn=978-0-299-08854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1988, [[Francisco J. Ayala]] defined progress as "systematic change in a feature belonging to all the members of a sequence in such a way that posterior members of the sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature". He argued that there are two elements in this definition, directional change and improvement according to some standard. Whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question; therefore Ayala suggested that science should focus on the question of whether there is directional change, without regard to whether the change is "improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |year=1988 |title=Can progress be defined as a biological concept? |work=Evolutionary Progress |editor=Nitecki, M. |pages=75–96 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-58693-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be compared to [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s suggestion of "replacing the idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=1997 |title=Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin |publisher=Harmony |isbn=0-609-80140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Peter J. Bowler]] defined orthogenesis as:

{{quote|Literally, the term means evolution in a straight line, generally assumed to be evolution that is held to a regular course by forces internal to the organism. Orthogenesis assumes that variation is not random but is directed [[Teleology in biology|towards fixed goals]]. Selection is thus powerless, and the species is carried automatically in the direction marked out by internal factors controlling variation.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pages=268–270}}}}

In 1996, [[Michael Ruse]] defined orthogenesis as "the view that evolution has a kind of momentum of its own that carries organisms along certain tracks".{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=261}}

===Mediaeval===
The possibility of progress is embedded in the mediaeval [[great chain of being]], with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in [[Aristotle's biology]], from insects that produced only a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The mediaeval chain, as in [[Ramon Lull]]'s ''Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind'', 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}}

===Pre-Darwinian===
The orthogenesis hypothesis had a significant following in the 19th century when evolutionary mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism]] were being proposed. The French zoologist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) himself accepted the idea, and it had a central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, the hypothesized mechanism of which resembled the "mysterious inner force" of orthogenesis.&lt;ref name="Gould 2001"/&gt; Orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who saw in their fossils a directional change, and in [[invertebrate paleontology]] thought there was a gradual and constant directional change.  Those who accepted orthogenesis in this way, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism that drove orthogenesis was [[teleology|teleological]] (had a definite goal). [[Charles Darwin]] himself rarely used the term "evolution" now so commonly used to describe his theory, because the term was strongly associated with orthogenesis, as had been common usage since at least 1647.&lt;ref name=Gould1977&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=1977 |url=http://wordorigins.org/wordore.htm |title=Darwin's Dilemma: The Odyssey of Evolution |work=Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History |publisher=[[W.

===With Darwin===

Ruse observed that "Progress ''(sic, his capitalisation)'' became essentially a nineteenth-century belief.

The Russian biologist [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (1792–1876) argued for an orthogenetic force in nature, reasoning in a review of Darwin's 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' that "Forces which are not directed—so-called blind forces—can never produce order."&lt;ref name=Brown2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Keven|last2=Von Kitzing|first2=Eberhard|title=Evolution and Bahá'í Belief: ʻAbduʼl-Bahá's Response to Nineteenth-century Darwinism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egDAfpkONRsC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2001|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=978-1-890688-08-0|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barbieri, Marcello |date=2013 |title=Biosemiotics: Information, Codes and Signs in Living Systems |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |page=7 |isbn=978-1-60021-612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jacobsen, Eric Paul |date=2005 |title=From Cosmology to Ecology: The Monist World-view in Germany from 1770 to 1930 |page=100 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0-8204-7231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1864, the Swiss anatomist [[Albert von Kölliker]] (1817–1905) presented his orthogenetic theory, ''[[heterogenesis]]'', arguing for wholly separate lines of descent with no common ancestor.&lt;ref name=Vucinich1988&gt;{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander |date=1988 |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |publisher=University of California Press |page=137 |isbn=978-0-520-06283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1884, the Swiss botanist [[Carl Nägeli]] (1817–1891) proposed a version of orthogenesis involving an "inner perfecting principle". [[Gregor Mendel]] died that same year; Nägeli, who proposed that an "[[idioplasm]]" transmitted inherited characteristics, dissuaded Mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics.&lt;ref name=Mawer2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Mawer, Simon |authorlink=Simon Mawer |title=Gregor Mendel: planting the seeds of genetics |date=2006 |publisher=Harry N.

In 1898, after studying [[butterfly]] coloration, [[Theodor Eimer&lt;!--mild overlink, seems helpful here--&gt;]] (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, ''On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation''.

He used examples such as the [[evolution]] of the [[horse]] to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a [[materialist]] who rejected any [[vitalist]] or [[teleological]] approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new [[species]].&lt;ref name=Gould2002&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=2002 |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=355–364 |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth and twentieth century===
{{see|Eclipse of Darwinism}}

Numerous versions of orthogenesis (see table) have been proposed. Debate centred on whether such theories were scientific, or whether orthogenesis was inherently vitalistic or essentially theological.&lt;ref name=Simpson1964/&gt; For example, biologists such as Maynard M. Metcalf (1914), [[John Merle Coulter]] (1915), [[David Starr Jordan]] (1920) and Charles B. Lipman (1922) claimed evidence for orthogenesis in [[bacteria]], [[fish]] populations and [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Metcalf Maynard M | year = 1913 | title = Adaptation Through Natural Selection and Orthogenesis | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 47 | issue = 554| pages = 65–71 | jstor=2455865 | doi=10.1086/279329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Merle Coulter]].

In 1950, the German paleontologist [[Otto Schindewolf]] argued that variation tends to move in a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of [[vitalism]], but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.&lt;ref name=Kwa2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Kwa, Chunglin |date=2011 |title=Styles of Knowing: A New History of Science from Ancient Times to the Present |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=237 |isbn=978-0-8229-6151-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dimichele William A | year = 1995 | title = Basic Questions in Paleontology: Geologic Time, Organic Evolution, and Biological Systematics, by Otto H.

In 1964 [[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued that orthogenetic theories such as those promulgated by Du Noüy and Sinnott were essentially theology rather than biology.&lt;ref name=Simpson1964&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |date=1964 |title="Evolutionary Theology: The New Mysticism" |work=This View of Life: The World of an Evolutionist |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World |pages=213–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though evolution is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely consistent with the modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jepsen, Glenn L.  |date=1949 |title=Selection. Orthogenesis, and the Fossil Record |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=93 |issue=6  |pages=479–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; These examples have sometimes been referred to as ''orthoselection'' but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on the direction of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs, Susan C.|author2=Larson, Allan|author3=Cheverud, James M. |date=1995 |title=Phylogenetic Relationships and Orthogenetic Evolution of Coat Color Among Tamarins (Genus Saguinus) |journal=Syst.

[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|Multiple explanations have been offered]] since the 19th century for how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection. Many of these theories led (solid blue arrows) to some form of orthogenesis, with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows) directly or indirectly. For example, evolutionists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] believed in a combination of theistic evolution, Lamarckism, vitalism, and orthogenesis,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261-262}} represented by a sequence of arrows on the left of the diagram. The development of modern Darwinism is indicated by dashed orange arrows.]]

The various [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|alternatives to Darwinian evolution]] by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in [[embryology]] and [[palaeontology]]. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261-262}} Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=264}}

The stronger versions of the orthogenetic hypothesis began to lose popularity when it became clear that they were inconsistent with the patterns found by [[paleontology|paleontologists]] in the [[fossil record]], which were non-rectilinear (richly branching) with many complications. The hypothesis was abandoned by the mainstream of evolutionists when no mechanism could be found that would account for the process, and the theory of evolution by natural selection came to prevail.&lt;ref name=Mayr1982&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |date=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=530–531 |isbn=0-674-36446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of biology Edward J. Larson commented that

{{quote|At theoretical and philosophical levels, Lamarckism and orthogenesis seemed to solve too many problems to be dismissed out of hand—yet biologists could never reliably document them happening in nature or in the laboratory. Support for both concepts evaporated rapidly once a plausible alternative appeared on the scene.{{sfn|Larson|2004|page=127}}}}

The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the [[genetics|genetic]] mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms it came to be held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of [[heredity]] could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the [[methodological naturalism]] of the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |date=2002 |pages=Chapter 7, section "Synthesis as Restriction" |isbn=0-674-00613-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levinton, Jeffrey S. |date=2001 |title=Genetics, Paleontology, and Macroevolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=14–16 |isbn=0-521-80317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Montgomery, Georgina M.|author2=Largent, Mark A. |date=2015 |title=A Companion to the History of American Science  |publisher=Wiley |page=218 |isbn=978-1-4051-5625-7 |quote=With the integration of Mendelian genetics and population genetics into evolutionary theory in the 1930s a new generation of biologists applied mathematical techniques to investigate how changes in the frequency of genes in populations combined with natural selection could produce species change.

[[File:Ernst Mayr PLoS.jpg|thumb|[[Ernst Mayr]] considered orthogenesis effectively taboo in 1948.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}]]

By 1948, the evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]], as editor of the journal ''Evolution'', made the use of the term ''orthogenesis'' taboo: "It might be well to abstain from use of the word 'orthogenesis' .. since so many of the geneticists seem to be of the opinion that the use of the term implies some supernatural force."{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}&lt;ref name=Mayr1948/&gt; With the rise of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] in the late 20th-early 21st centuries, however, which is open to an expanded concept of heredity that incorporates the physics of [[self-organization]], ideas of constraint and preferred directions of morphological change have made a reappearance in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, {{cite book |editor1-link=Gerd Müller (theoretical biologist)|editor1=Müller, Gerd B.|editor2-link=Stuart Newman|editor2=Newman, Stuart A.|title=[[Origination of Organismal Form]] |date=2003 |publisher=Bradford |isbn=0-262-13419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these and other reasons, belief in evolutionary progress has remained "a persistent [[heresy]]",&lt;ref name=Popov2005&gt;{{cite web |last1=Popov |first1=Igor |title=The Persistence of Heresy: The Concepts of Directed Evolution (Orthogenesis) |url=http://www.kli.ac.at/events/event-detail/1112872500/the-persistence-of-heresy-the-concepts-of-directed-evolution-orthogenesis |accessdate=15 April 2017 |date=7 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; among evolutionary biologists including [[E.

The philosopher of biology [[Michael Ruse]] wrote that "some of the most significant of today's evolutionists are progressionists, and that because of this we find (absolute) progressionism alive and well in their work."{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=536}} He argued that progressionism has harmed the status of [[evolutionary biology]] as a mature, professional science.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=530}} Presentations of evolution remain characteristically progressionist, with humans at the top of the "Tower of Time" in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington D.C.]], while ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine could illustrate the history of life leading progressively from mammals to dinosaurs to primates and finally man. Ruse noted that at the popular level, progress and evolution are simply synonyms, as they were in the nineteenth century, though confidence in the value of cultural and technological progress has declined.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}}

===In popular culture===
[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The frontispiece to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' was intended to compare the skeletons of apes and humans, but unintentionally created a durable [[meme]] of supposed "monkey-to-man" progress.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Jennifer|title=What our most famous evolutionary cartoon gets wrong|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/10/27/what-our-most-famous-evolutionary-cartoon-gets-wrong/drKMD5121W6EUxXJ4pF0YL/story.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=The [[Boston Globe]]|date=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{further|March of Progress}}

In popular culture, progressionist images of evolution are widespread. The historian Jennifer Tucker, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', notes that [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 illustration comparing the skeletons of apes and humans "has become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution."&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt; She calls its history extraordinary, saying that it is "one of the most intriguing, and most misleading, drawings in the modern history of science." Nobody, Tucker observes, supposes that the "monkey-to-man" sequence accurately depicts Darwinian evolution. ''The Origin of Species'' had only one illustration, a diagrams showing that random events create a process of branching evolution, a view that Tucker notes is broadly acceptable to modern biologists. But Huxley's image recalled the great chain of being, implying with the force of a visual image a "logical, evenly paced progression" leading up to ''Homo sapiens'', a view denounced by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

[[File:Man is But a Worm.jpg|thumb|upright|''Man is But a Worm'' by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]], ''Punch's Almanack'' for 1882]]

Popular perception, however, had seized upon the idea of linear progress. [[Edward Linley Sambourne]]'s ''Man is But a Worm'', drawn for ''Punch's Almanack'', mocked the idea of any evolutionary link between humans and animals, with a sequence from chaos to earthworm to apes, primitive men, a Victorian beau, and Darwin in a pose that according to Tucker recalls [[Michelangelo]]'s figure of [[Adam]] in his fresco adorning the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]]. This was followed by a flood of variations on the evolution-as-progress theme, including ''The New Yorker'''s 1925 "The Rise and Fall of Man", the sequence running from a chimpanzee to [[Neanderthal man]], [[Socrates]], and finally the lawyer [[William Jennings Bryan]] who argued for the anti-evolutionist prosecution in the [[Scopes Trial]] on the State of Tennessee law limiting the teaching of evolution.  Tucker noted that [[Rudolph Franz Zallinger]]'s 1965 "[[March of Progress|The Road to Homo Sapiens]]" fold-out illustration in [[F. Clark Howell]]'s ''Early Man'', showing a sequence of 14 walking figures ending with modern man, fitted the palaeoanthropological discoveries "not into a branching Darwinian scheme, but into the framework of the original Huxley diagram." Howell ruefully commented that the "powerful and emotional" graphic had overwhelmed his Darwinian text.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

===Sliding between meanings===

Scientists, Ruse argues, continue to slide easily from one notion of progress to another: even committed Darwinians like [[Richard Dawkins]] embed the idea of cultural progress in a theory of cultural units, [[meme]]s, that act much like genes.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} Dawkins can speak of "progressive rather than random&amp;nbsp;... trends in evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dawkins, Richard |author2=Krebs, J. R. |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |authorlink2=John Krebs, Baron Krebs |title=Arms races between and within species |date=1979 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=205 |pages=489–511 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=466}} Dawkins and [[John Krebs, Baron Krebs|John Krebs]] deny the "earlier [Darwinian] prejudice"{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}} that there is anything "inherently progressive about evolution",{{sfn|Dawkins|1986|page=178}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}} but the feeling of progress comes from evolutionary [[arms race]]s which remain in Dawkins's words "by far the most satisfactory explanation for the existence of the advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess".{{sfn|Dawkins|1986|page=181}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}}

Ruse concludes his detailed analysis of the idea of ''Progress'', meaning a progressionist philosophy, in evolutionary biology by stating that evolutionary thought came out of that philosophy. Before Darwin, Ruse argues, evolution was just a [[pseudoscience]]; Darwin made it respectable, but "only as popular science". "There it remained frozen, for nearly another hundred years",{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} until mathematicians such as Fisher{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=292–295}} provided "both [[population genetics|models]] and status", enabling evolutionary biologists to construct the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s. That made biology a professional science, at the price of ejecting the notion of progress. That, Ruse argues, was a significant cost to "people [biologists] still firmly committed to Progress" as a philosophy.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}}

==Facilitated variation==
{{multiple image | footer=Different species of ''Heliconius'' butterfly have [[parallel evolution|independently evolved]] similar patterns, apparently both [[facilitated variation|facilitated and constrained]] by the available [[developmental-genetic toolkit]] genes controlling wing [[pattern formation]].  | align=right | image1=Heliconius erato Richard Bartz.jpg | width1=125 | caption1=''[[Heliconius erato]]'' | image2=Heliconius melpomene 2b Richard Bartz.jpg | width2=175 | caption2=''[[Heliconius melpomene]]''}}
{{main|Facilitated variation}}

Biology has largely rejected the idea that evolution is guided in any way,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|page=270}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|page=127}} but the evolution of some features is indeed [[facilitated variation|facilitated]] by the genes of the [[developmental-genetic toolkit]] studied in [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. An example is the development of wing pattern in some species of ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterfly, which have [[parallel evolution|independently evolved]] similar patterns. These butterflies are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]] of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baxter, S.W. |author2=Papa, R. |author3=Chamberlain, N. |author4=Humphray, S.J. |author5=Joron, M. |author6=Morrison, C. |author7=ffrench-Constant, R.H. |author8=McMillan, W.O. |author9=Jiggins, C.D. |year=2008 |title=Convergent Evolution in the Genetic Basis of Mullerian Mimicry in Heliconius Butterflies |journal=Genetics |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=1567–1577 | pmid=18791259 |pmc=2581958 | doi=10.1534/genetics.107.082982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paranoia''' is an instinct or thought process believed to be heavily influenced by [[anxiety]] or [[fear]], often to the point of [[delusion]] and [[irrationality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/paranoia World English Dictionary] (Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition, 2009, William Collins Sons &amp; Co. Ltd.) 3. informal sense: ''intense fear or suspicion, esp when unfounded''&lt;/ref&gt; Paranoid thinking typically includes [[persecutory]], or beliefs of [[wikt:conspiracy|conspiracy]] concerning a perceived threat towards oneself (e.g. the American colloquial phrase, ''"Everyone is out to get me"''). Paranoia is distinct from [[phobia]]s, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame. Making [[false accusations]] and the general [[distrust]] of others also frequently accompany paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.livescience.com/3064-freak-paranoia-common.html |title=Don't Freak Out: Paranoia Quite Common |website=[[Live Science]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=September 16, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an incident most people would view as an [[accident]] or [[coincidence]], a paranoid person might believe was [[intention]]al. Paranoia is a central symptom of [[psychosis]].&lt;ref name=Green08&gt;Green, C., Freeman, D., Kuipers, E., Bebbington, P., Fowler, D., Dunn, G., &amp; Garety, P. (2008). Measuring ideas of persecution and social reference: the Green et al. Paranoid Thought Scales (GPTS). ''Psychological Medicine, 38'', 101 - 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
A popular symptom of paranoia is the [[attribution bias]]. These individuals typically have a biased perception of reality, often exhibiting more hostile beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; A paranoid person may view someone else's accidental behavior as though it is with intent or threatening.

An investigation of a non-clinical paranoid population found that feeling powerless and depressed, isolating oneself, and relinquishing activities are characteristics that could be associated with those exhibiting more frequent paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scientists have created different subtypes for the various symptoms of paranoia including erotic, persecutory, litigious, and exalted.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch and Fishman p. 1414-1415&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the suspicious and troublesome personality traits of paranoia, it is unlikely that someone with paranoia will thrive in interpersonal relationships. Most commonly paranoid individuals tend to be of a single status.&lt;ref&gt;Deutch and Fishman (1963), p.1416&lt;/ref&gt; According to some research there is a hierarchy for paranoia. The least common types of paranoia at the very top of the hierarchy would be those involving more serious threats. [[Social anxiety]] is at the bottom of this hierarchy as the most frequently exhibited level of paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman et al. (2005), p.433&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
===Social and environmental===
Social circumstances appear to be highly influential on paranoid beliefs. Based on data collected by means of a mental health survey distributed to residents of [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]] (in Mexico) and [[El Paso, Texas]] (in the United States), paranoid beliefs seem to be associated with feelings of powerlessness and victimization, enhanced by social situations. Potential causes of these effects included a sense of believing in external control, and mistrust which can be strengthened by lower socioeconomic status. Those living in a lower socioeconomic status may feel less in control of their own lives. In addition, this study explains that females have the tendency to believe in external control at a higher rate than males, potentially making females more susceptible to mistrust and the effects of socioeconomic status on paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Mirowski and Ross (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Emanuel Messinger reports that surveys have revealed that those exhibiting paranoia can evolve from parental relationships and untrustworthy environments. These environments could include being very disciplinary, stringent, and unstable. It was even noted that, "indulging and pampering (thereby impressing the child that he is something special and warrants special privileges)," can be contributing backgrounds.&lt;ref name=D&amp;F &gt;Deutsch and Fishman (1963), p. 1408&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences likely to enhance or manifest the symptoms of paranoia include increased rates of disappointment, stress, and a hopeless state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch and Fishman (1963), p. 1412&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination has also been reported as a potential predictor of paranoid delusions. Such reports that paranoia seemed to appear more in older patients who had experienced higher levels of discrimination throughout their lives. In addition to this it has been noted that immigrants are quite susceptible to forms of psychosis. This could be due to the aforementioned effects of discriminatory events and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
While many more mood-based symptoms, grandiosity and guilt, may underlie functional paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lake|first=C. R.|date=2008-11-01|title=Hypothesis: Grandiosity and Guilt Cause Paranoia; Paranoid Schizophrenia is a Psychotic Mood Disorder; a Review|url=https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/34/6/1151/1936006/Hypothesis-Grandiosity-and-Guilt-Cause-Paranoia|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|language=en|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1151–1162|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm132|issn=0586-7614|pmc=2632512|pmid=18056109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colby (1981) defined ''paranoid cognition'' in terms of ''persecutory delusions and false beliefs whose propositional content clusters around ideas of being harassed, threatened, harmed, subjugated, persecuted, accused, mistreated, wronged, tormented, disparaged, vilified, and so on, by malevolent others, either specific individuals or groups'' (p.&amp;nbsp;518).
Three components of paranoid cognition have been identified by Robins &amp; Post: ''a) suspicions without enough basis that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them; b) preoccupation with unjustified doubts about the loyalty, or trustworthiness, of friends or associates; c) reluctance to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them'' (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;3).

Paranoid cognition has been conceptualized by clinical psychology almost exclusively in terms of psychodynamic constructs and dispositional variables. From this point of view, paranoid cognition is a manifestation of an intra-psychic conflict or disturbance. For instance, Colby (1981) suggested that the biases of blaming others for one’s problems serve to alleviate the distress produced by the feeling of being humiliated, and helps to repudiate the belief that the self is to blame for such incompetence. This intra-psychic perspective emphasize that the cause of paranoid cognitions are inside the head of the people (social perceiver), and dismiss the fact that paranoid cognition may be related with the social context in which such cognitions are embedded. This point is extremely relevant because when origins of distrust and suspicion (two components of paranoid cognition) are studied many researchers have accentuated the importance of social interaction, particularly when social interaction has gone awry. Even more, a model of trust development pointed out that trust increases or decreases as a function of the cumulative history of interaction between two or more persons.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relevant difference can be discerned among "pathological and non-pathological forms of trust and distrust". According to Deutsch, the main difference is that non-pathological forms are flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. Pathological forms reflect exaggerated perceptual biases and judgmental predispositions that can arise and perpetuate them, are reflexively caused errors similar to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].

It has been suggested that a "hierarchy" of paranoia exists, extending from mild social evaluative concerns, through ideas of social reference, to persecutory beliefs concerning mild, moderate, and severe threats.&lt;ref name=Freeman05&gt;Freeman, D., Garety, P., Bebbington, P., Smith, B., Rollinson, R., Fowler, D., Kuipers, E., Ray, K., &amp; Dunn, G. (2005). Psychological investigation of the structure of paranoia in a non-clinical population. ''British Journal of Psychiatry 186'', 427 – 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
A paranoid reaction may be caused from a decline in brain circulation as a result of high blood pressure or hardening of the arterial walls.&lt;ref name=D&amp;F/&gt;

Drug-induced paranoia, associated with [[amphetamines]], [[methamphetamine]] and similar [[stimulants]] has much in common with schizophrenic paranoia; the relationship has been under investigation since 2012. Drug-induced paranoia has a better prognosis than schizophrenic paranoia once the drug has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amphetamine-induced psychosis - a separate diagnostic entity or primary psychosis triggered in the vulnerable?|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=12|pages=221|pmc=3554477|year=2012|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-12-221|pmid=23216941|author1=Bramness|first1=J.

During the 1960s with the increase of the use of marijuana, LSD, and other drugs in places like California, paranoia began to set in with many individuals.  Some thought that because there was illegality in the use of the drugs – the fear of police catching the individuals was bothering them. Professionals felt, however, that those drugs brought on paranoia. 

Based on data obtained by the Dutch NEMISIS project in 2005, there was an association between impaired hearing and the onset of symptoms of psychosis, which was based on a five-year follow up. Some older studies have actually declared that a state of paranoia can be produced in patients that were under a hypnotic state of deafness. This idea however generated much skepticism during its time.&lt;ref name="paranoia"&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
In the [[DSM-IV-TR]], paranoia is diagnosed in the form of:&lt;ref&gt;[[American Psychiatric Association]]. ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paranoid personality disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;[[American Psychiatric Association]]. ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' p.690&lt;/ref&gt; ({{ICD10|F|60|0|f|60}})
* [[Paranoid schizophrenia]] (a subtype of [[schizophrenia]]) ({{ICD10|F|20|0|f|20}})
* The [[persecutory delusions|persecutory]] type of [[delusional disorder]], which is also called "[[querulous paranoia]]" when the focus is to remedy some injustice by legal action&lt;ref&gt;[[American Psychiatric Association]]. ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' p.325&lt;/ref&gt; ({{ICD10|F|22|8|f|20}})
Persecutory type does not exist. This is a false information. In 2015 year the persecutory type was not considered, there it was no information online about such classification.

According to [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]] P. J. McKenna, "As a noun, paranoia denotes a disorder which has been argued in and out of existence, and whose clinical features, course, boundaries, and virtually every other aspect of which is controversial. Employed as an adjective, paranoid has become attached to a diverse set of presentations, from paranoid schizophrenia, through paranoid depression, to paranoid personality&amp;mdash;not to mention a motley collection of paranoid 'psychoses', 'reactions', and 'states'&amp;mdash;and this is to restrict discussion to [[functional disorders]]. Even when abbreviated down to the prefix para-, the term crops up causing trouble as the contentious but stubbornly persistent concept of [[paraphrenia]]".&lt;ref&gt;McKenna (1997), p.238&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 50% of the diagnosed cases of [[schizophrenia]] experience delusions of reference and delusions of persecution.&lt;ref name=Sartorius86&gt;Sartorius, N., Jablensky, A., Korten, A., Ernberg, G., Anker, M., Cooper, JE., &amp; Day, R. (1986). Early manifestations and first-contact incidence of schizophrenia in different cultures. ''Psychological Medicine, 16'', 909 – 928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutting97&gt;Cutting, J. (1997). ''Principles of Psychopathology : Two Worlds–Two Minds–Two Hemispheres.'' Oxford University Press: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Paranoia perceptions and behavior may be part of many mental illnesses, such as depression and dementia, but they are more prevalent in three mental disorders: [[paranoid schizophrenia]], [[delusional disorder]] ([[Persecutory delusion|persecutory type]]), and [[paranoid personality disorder]].

==History==
The word ''paranoia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] παράνοια (''paranoia''), "[[Insanity|madness]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fnoia^ παράνοια],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from παρά (''para''), "beside, by"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F παρά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and νόος (''noos''), "mind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; However, the history of the term is not the history of the concept, let alone the mental condition currently considered as a disease. Indeed, the historiography of ‘paranoia’ is complicated and must be approached with care. &lt;ref&gt;Berrios G E (2009) How to write a good history of paranoia. ''Rivista Sperimentale di Freniatria'' 133: 109-121.&lt;/ref&gt;The term was used to describe a mental illness in which a delusional belief is the sole or most prominent feature.  In this definition, the belief does not have to be persecutory to be classified as paranoid, so any number of delusional beliefs can be classified as paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957154X0001104103&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person who has the sole delusional belief that they are an important religious figure would be classified by Kraepelin as having 'pure paranoia'.

According to Michael Phelan, Padraig Wright, and Julian Stern (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Wright, and Stern (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; paranoia and [[paraphrenia]] are debated entities that were detached from [[dementia praecox]] by Kraepelin, who explained paranoia as a continuous systematized delusion arising much later in life with no presence of either hallucinations or a deteriorating course, paraphrenia as an identical syndrome to paranoia but with hallucinations. Even at the present time, a delusion need not be suspicious or fearful to be classified as paranoid. A person might be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia without delusions of persecution, simply because their delusions refer mainly to themselves.

==Relations to violence==
It has generally been agreed upon that individuals with paranoid delusions will have the tendency to take action based on their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bental and Taylor (2006), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed on the particular types of actions that are pursued based on paranoid delusions. Some researchers have made attempts to distinguish the different variations of actions brought on as a result of delusions. Wessely et al. (1993) did just this by studying individuals with delusions of which more than half had reportedly taken action or behaved as a result of these delusions. However, the overall actions were not of a violent nature in most of the informants. The authors note that other studies such as one by Taylor (1985), have shown that violent behaviors were more common in certain types of paranoid individuals, mainly those considered to be offensive such as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Wessely et al. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have found associations between childhood abusive behaviors and the appearance of violent behaviors in psychotic individuals. This could be a result of their inability to cope with aggression as well as other people, especially when constantly attending to potential threats in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor(2006), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; The attention to threat itself has been proposed as one of the major contributors of violent actions in paranoid people, although there has been much deliberation about this as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p. 287-288&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that there may only be certain types of delusions that promote any violent behaviors, persecutory delusions seem to be one of these.&lt;ref&gt;Bjorkly (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Having resentful emotions towards others and the inability to be able to understand what other people are feeling seem to have an association with violence in paranoid individuals. This was based on a study of paranoid schizophrenics' (one of the common mental disorders that exhibit paranoid symptoms) theories of mind capabilities in relation to empathy. The results of this study revealed specifically that although the violent patients were more successful at the higher level theory of mind tasks, they were not as able to interpret others' emotions or claims.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Akel and Abushua’leh (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paranoid social cognition==
Social psychological research has proposed a mild form of paranoid cognition, ''paranoid social cognition'', that has its origins in social determinants more than intra-psychic conflict.&lt;ref name=Fenigstein92&gt;Fenigstein, A., &amp; Vanable, P. A. (1992). Paranoia and self-consciousness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62'', 129 - 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer94&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1994). The sinister attribution error: Origins and consequences of collective paranoia. ''Motivation and Emotion, 18'', 199 - 230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer95a&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1995a). In dubious battle: Heightened accountability, dysphoric cognition, and self-defeating bargaining behavior. In R. M. Kramer &amp; D. M. Messick (Eds.), ''Negotiation in its social context'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;95 – 120). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer95b&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1995b). Power, paranoia, and distrust in organizations: The distorted view from the top. ''Research on Negotiation in Organizations, 5'', 119 - 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimbardo81&gt;Zimbardo, P. G., Andersen, S. M., &amp; Kabat, L. G. (1981). Induced hearing deficit generates experimental paranoia. ''Science, 212'', 1529 - 1531.&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective states that in milder forms, paranoid cognitions may be very common among normal individuals. For instance, it is not strange that people may exhibit in their daily life, self-centered thought such as they are being talked about, suspiciousness about other’ intentions, and assumptions of ill or hostility (i.e. people may feel as if everything is going against them). According to Kramer, (1998) these milder forms of paranoid cognition may be considered as an adaptive response to cope with or make sense of disturbing and threatening social environment.

Paranoid cognition captures the idea that dysphoric self-consciousness may be related with the position that people occupies within a social system. This self-consciousness conduces to a hypervigilant and ruminative mode to process social information that finally will stimulate a variety of paranoid-like forms of social misperception and misjudgment.&lt;ref name=Kramer98&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1998). Revisiting the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam decisions twenty-five years later: How well has the group think hypothesis stood the test of time? ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 73'', 236 - 271.&lt;/ref&gt;  This model identifies four components that are essential to understanding paranoid social cognition: situational antecedents, dysphoric self-consciousness, hypervigilance and rumination, and judgmental biases.

===Situational antecedents===
Perceived social distinctiveness, perceived evaluative scrutiny and uncertainty about the social standing.
*Perceived social distinctiveness: According to the [[social identity theory]],&lt;ref name=Turner87&gt;Turner, J. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; people categorize themselves in terms of characteristics that made them unique or different from others under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=Cota86&gt;Cota, A. A., &amp; Dion, K. L. (1986). Salience of gender and sex composition of ad-hoc groups: An experimental test of distinctiveness theory. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50'', 770 - 776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner87/&gt; Gender, ethnicity, age, or experience may become extremely relevant to explain people’s behavior when these attributes make them unique in a social group. This distinctive attribute may have influence not only in how people are perceived, but may also affect the way they perceive themselves. 
*Perceived evaluative scrutiny: According to this model, dysphoric self-consciousness may increase when people feel under moderate or intensive evaluative social scrutiny. For instance, when an asymmetric relationship is analyzed, as the relationship among a doctoral student and their advisors, students tend to remember more behaviors and events that they interpret as affecting their level of trust in the relationship compared to their advisors, suggesting that students are more willing to put attention to their advisor that the advisor are motivated to pay attention to them. Also students spent more time ruminating about the behaviors, events, and their relationship in general.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
*Uncertainty about social standing: The knowledge about the social standing is another factor that may induce paranoid social cognition. Many researchers have argued that experiencing uncertainty about a social position in a social system constitutes an adverse psychological state, one which people are highly motivated to reduce.

===Dysphoric self-consciousness===
Refers to an aversive form of heightened 'public self-consciousness' characterized by the feelings that one is under intensive evaluation or [[scrutiny]].&lt;ref name=Kramer95a/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. I., &amp; Galunic, D. C. (1996). Consequences of public scrutiny for leaders and their organizations. In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), ''Research in organizational behavior'' (Vol. 18, pp. 201–250). Greenwich, CT: JAI.&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming self-tormenting will increase the odds of interpreting others' behaviors in a self-referential way.

===Hypervigilance and rumination===
Self-consciousness was characterized as an aversive psychological state. According to this model, people experiencing self-consciousness will be highly motivated to reduce it, trying to make sense of what they are experiencing. These attempts promote hypervigilance and rumination in a circular relationship: more hypervigilance generates more rumination, whereupon more rumination generates more hypervigilance. Hypervigilance can be thought of as a way to appraise threatening social information, but in contrast to adaptive vigilance, hypervigilance will produce elevated levels of arousal, fear, anxiety, and threat perception.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R. S., &amp; Folkman, S. (1984). ''Stress, appraisal, and coping''. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumination is another possible response to threatening social information. Rumination can be related to the paranoid social cognition because it can increase negative thinking about negative events, and evoke a pessimistic explanatory style.

===Judgmental biases===
Three main judgmental consequences have been identified:&lt;ref name=Kramer94/&gt;
*The sinister attribution error: This bias captures the tendency that social perceivers have to overattribute lack of trustworthiness to others.
*The overly personalistic construal of social interaction: Refers to the inclination that paranoid perceiver has to interpret others’  action in a disproportional self-referential way, increasing the belief that they are the target of others’ thoughts and actions. A special kind of bias in the biased punctuation of social interaction, which entail an overperception of causal linking among independent events.
*The exaggerated perception of conspiracy: Refers to the disposition that the paranoid perceiver has to overattribute social coherence and coordination to others’ actions.

'''Pseudophilosophy''' is a term, often considered derogatory{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, applied to criticize philosophical ideas or systems which are claimed not to meet an expected set of standards. The etymology of the term is based on appending the prefix [[pseudo-]] ("false") to the word [[philosophy]] ("love of wisdom"); another term to describe false philosophy is "cod philosophy".

==Targets==
{{Cleanup-list|section|date=August 2016}}
The term has been used against many different targets, including:
* To criticise [[dogmatism]] in general, “which is dissolved when philosophy incorporates the scientific method”;{{sfn|Kearney|Rainwater|1996|p=60}}
* To criticise any philosophy in general which does not meet the criteria of [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] or [[Positivism|positivistic philosophy]];{{sfn|Taylor|Kelly|2013|p=116-117}} 
* To criticise specific philosophical schools, traditions and systems:

==Definitions==
According to Christopher Heumann, an 18th-century scholar, pseudo-philosophy has six characteristics:{{sfn|Hanegraaf|2012|p=131-134}}
# A preference for useless speculation
# It appeals merely to human authority
# It appeals to tradition instead of reason
# It syncretises philosophy with superstition
# It has a preference for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism
# It is immoral

According to [[Michael Oakeshott]], pseudo-philosophy "is theorizing that proceeds partly within and partly outside a given mode of inquiry."{{sfn|Nardin|2001}}

Pieper notes that there cannot be a closed system of philosophy, and that any philosophy that claims to have discovered a "cosmic formula" is a pseudo-philosophy.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} In this he follows Kant, who rejected the postulation of a "highest principle" from which to develop [[Transcendental idealism]], calling this pseudo-philosophy and mysticism.{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}

[[Nicholas Rescher]], in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', describes ''pseudo-philosophy'' as "deliberations that masquerade as philosophical but are inept, incompetent, deficient in intellectual seriousness, and reflective of an insufficient commitment to the pursuit of truth." Rescher adds that the term is particularly appropriate when applied to "those who use the resources of reason to substantiate the claim that rationality is unachievable in matters of inquiry."

==History==
{{See also|Philosophy}}

According to Pieper, for Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle philosophy  is the human search "oriented toward [[Sophia (wisdom)|wisdom]] such as God possesses".{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} It suggests that philosophy includes, in its essence, an orientation toward theology.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} Pieper notes:
{{quote|Thus something is being expressed here that clearly contradicts what in the modern age has become the accepted notion of philosophy; for this new conception of philosophy assumes that it is the decisive feature of philosophical thought to disentangle itself from theology, faith and tradition.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}}}}

The term "pseudo-philosophy" appears to have been coined by [[Jane Austen]].{{sfn|Johnson|Tuite|2011}}

[[Ernest Newman]] (30 November 1868 – 7 July 1959), an English music critic and [[musicologist]], who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 ''Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century'', a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.

==Usage==
The term is almost always used [[pejorative]]ly and is often contentious.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Romanticism===
{{Main|Romanticism}}{{See also|Age of Enlightenment}}

According to Bunge,
{{quote|Pseudophilosophy is nonsense parading as deep philosophy. It may have existed since Lao-Tzu, but it was not taken seriously until about 1800, when the Romantics challenged the Enlightenment. By giving up rationality, they generated a lot of pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}

For Kant, intellectual knowledge is discursive knowledge, not intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} According to Kant, intuition is limited to the realm of senses, while knowledge is "essentially realised in the acts of researching, relating, comparing, differentiating, inferring, proving".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} Kant criticised Romantic philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition,{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}} and not on "philosophical work":{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}}
{{quote|In philosophy, Kant writes, "the law of reason, of acquiring possessions through work", prevails. And because it is not work, the Romantic philosophy is not genuine philosophy - an objection that is also leveled by Kant against Plato, the "father of all rapturous fantasizing in philosophy", while it is noted, with both approval and assent, that "the philosophy of Aristotle is, by contrast, work".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13-14}}}}

Kant called Romantic philosophy pseudo-philosophy, "in which one is entitled not to work, but only to heed and enjoy the oracle in oneself in order to take complete possession of that wisdom toward which philosophy aims".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}}

===Mysticism===
{{Main|Mysticism}}

Mysticism has a long history. In the Age of Enlightenment mysticism had fallen into disrepute.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} Kant called mysticism pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} In the 19th century, with the rise of Romanticism, interest in mysticism was renewed. Rationalists and Lutherans wrote histories of mysticism to reject its claims, but there was a widespread interest in spiritualism and related phenomena.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}

Interest in [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart's works]] was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and [[German idealism|Idealist]] philosophers.{{sfn|McGinn|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxvii}} Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxii}} The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]] and other [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonistic]] thinkers.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}}

===German Idealism===
{{Main|German Idealism}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote the following about [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]:
{{quote|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudophilosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}}}

However his opinion is not widely held of Hegelianism or German Idealism.

===Continental philosophy===
{{Main|Continental philosophy|Analytic philosophy}}

Soccio notes that analytical inclined philosophers tend to dismiss Heidegger's philosophy as pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} According to Christensen, Heidegger himself called the philosophy of Husserl ''scheinphilosophy''.{{sfn|Christensen|2008|p=7}}

===Scientism===
{{Main|Scientism}}

[[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] used the term to critique the central place modern science is occupying in western society:
{{quote|This pseudo philosophy, in which science takes the place of metaphysics and religion, more and more corrodes the life of man, making him more and more blind to the real cosmos, in all its plenitude, depth and mystery ... Today we are witnessing a revolt against the deformation expressed in this pseudo philosophy.{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}}}

===Objectivism===
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Jonathan Chait  used  the term in the title "Ayn Rand's Pseudo-Philosophy" of an article in ''New Republic'', in which he wrote, "She was a true amateur who insisted on seeing herself as the greatest human being who ever lived because she was almost completely unfamiliar with the entire philosophical canon."&lt;ref name="chait"/&gt;

{{for|the song by Silversun Pickups|The Royal We}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2011}}

The '''royal ''we''''', or '''majestic plural''' ({{lang|la|pluralis maiestatis}}), is the use of a [[plural]] [[pronoun]] (or corresponding plural-inflected verb forms) to refer to a single person who is a [[monarch]]. The more general word for the use of a ''we'', ''us'', or ''our'' to refer to oneself is ''[[nosism]]''.

Speakers employing the royal we refer to themselves using a [[grammatical number]] other than the singular (i.e., in plural or [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form). For example, in his manifesto confirming the abdication of Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] begins: "By the Grace of God, We, Alexander I, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias ....".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1097.html|title=Russian Imperial House - Manifesto of Emperor Alexander I, Confirming the Abdication of Tsesarevich and Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and Designating Grand Duke Nicholas Pavlovich as Heir, 16 August 1823|author=|date=|website=www.imperialhouse.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western usage ==
It is commonly employed by a person of high office, such as a monarch, earl, or [[pope]]. It is also used in certain formal contexts by [[bishop]]s and university [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. [[William Longchamp]] is credited with its introduction to England in the late 12th century, following the practice of the [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Longchamp, William de (''d''. 1197) |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16980 |last=Turner |first=Ralph V. |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=May 2007 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/16980 |accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public situations in which it is used, the monarch or other dignitary is typically speaking not only in his or her personal capacity but also in an official capacity as leader of a nation or institution. In the grammar of several languages, plural forms tend to be perceived as deferential and more polite than singular forms. This grammatical feature is common in languages that have the [[T-V distinction]].  English used to have this feature but lost it over time, largely by the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="UofAriz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Politeness in Early Modern English: the second person pronouns|url=http://www2.nau.edu/~eng121-c/politenessin%20AME.htm|website=Northern Arizona University|publisher=Arizona Board of Regents|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In diplomatic letters, such as [[Letter of credence|letters of credence]], it is customary for monarchs to use the singular first-person (''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'', ''me'', ''my'') when writing to other monarchs, while the majestic plural is used in royal letters to a president of a republic.&lt;ref name="satow1932"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satow|first1=Ernest Mason|title=A Guide to Diplomatic Practice|date=1932|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=37|quote=In these letters the plural "We" and "Our" are employed instead of "I" and "My," and the letters terminate thus: "Your Good Friend." This form is used mainly for Royal letters to Presidents of Republics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Commonwealth realms]], the sovereign discharges his/her [[Commission (document)#Examples of military and naval commissions|commissions to ranked military officers]] in the capacity of ''we''.  Many official documents published in the name of the monarch are also presented with royal ''we'', such as [[letters patent]], [[proclamation]], etc.

Popes have historically used the ''we'' as part of their formal speech, for example as used in ''[[Notre charge apostolique]]'', ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', and ''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]''.  
Since [[Pope John Paul II]], however, the royal ''we'' has been dropped by popes in public speech, although formal documents may have retained it.  Recent papal documents dispensed with the majestic plural in the original Latin are given with the singular ''I'' in their official English translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430185550/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/ |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}}

In 1989, [[Margaret Thatcher]], then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], was met with disdain by some in the press for using the royal ''we'' when announcing news that she had become a grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phrase Finder''. [http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/401700.html "We are a grandmother"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Western usage ==
Several prominent [[Names of God in Judaism|epithets]] of the [[Tanakh|Bible]] describe the [[Jewish God]] in plural terms: ''[[Elohim]]'', ''[[Adonai]]'', and ''[[El Shaddai]]''. Many Christian scholars, including the post-apostolic leaders and  [[Augustine of Hippo]], have seen the use of the plural and grammatically singular verb forms as support for the doctrine of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=On the Trinity |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1301.htm |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this poetic device is somewhere in the 4th century AD, during the Byzantine period. Therefore, none of the authors of the books of the Bible understood the unusual grammar as a "royal we".

In the Quran, God sometimes refers to Himself as "We". Muslim exegits and theologians teach that this is specifically when referring to His great power and majesty. They understood it similar to modern Rabbinical understanding of the majestic plural. 

In [[Imperial China]] and every monarchy within its [[East Asian cultural sphere|cultural orbit]] (including [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], [[Korean Empire|Korea]], and [[Vietnamese Empire|Vietnam]]), the majestic imperial pronoun was expressed by the [[Chinese character|character]] ''zhèn'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|朕}}}}) ([[Old Chinese]]: ''*lrəmʔ''). This was in fact the former Chinese first-person {{em|singular}} pronoun (that is, 'I'). However, following his [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]], the [[List of rulers of China|emperor]] [[Shi Huangdi]] arrogated it entirely for his personal use. All other speakers and writers were obliged to choose some [[Chinese honorifics|deferential epithet]] (such as ''yú'' ({{lang|zh|愚}}), 'this foolish one') instead of using the former pronoun. While this practice did not affect the non-Chinese countries as much since their variants of ''zhèn'' ({{lang|zh|朕}}) were generally imported loanwords, it nevertheless led to a polite avoidance of pronouns throughout East Asia. {{Crossreference|(For more information, see: [[Japanese pronouns]], [[Korean pronouns]], and [[Vietnamese pronouns]])}}. This still persists, except in [[China]], following the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In [[Modern Standard Mandarin]], the first-person singular is ''wǒ'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|我}}}}), which gradually emerged from a common epithet expressing 'this [worthless] body'.&lt;ref&gt;''ZDic'', {{lang|zh|《漢典》}} [''Chinese Dictionary'']. [http://www.zdic.net/z/1a/js/6211.htm "我"]. Accessed 22 August 2013. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{contradict inline|wikt:我#Etymology|date=September 2018}}. {{Crossreference|(See also [[Chinese Pronouns]].)}} 

In [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], the majestic plural is a common way for elder speakers to refer to themselves when addressing those younger than them, and also for persons of higher social rank or [[Indian caste system|caste]] to refer to themselves when speaking to those of a perceived inferior rank or caste. In certain communities, the singular plural (मैं, 'I') may be dispensed with altogether for self-reference, and the plural [[nosism]] used uniformly while speaking to a social inferior or superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Run-to-completion scheduling''' is a [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] model in which each task runs until it either finishes, or explicitly yields control back to the scheduler. Run to completion systems typically have an [[event queue]] which is serviced either in strict order of admission by an [[event loop]], or by an [[admission scheduler]] which is capable of scheduling events out of order, based on other constraints such as [[time limit|deadlines]].

Some [[preemptive multitasking]] scheduling systems behave as run-to-completion schedulers in regard to scheduling tasks at one particular [[process priority]] level, at the same time as those processes still preempt other lower priority tasks and are themselves preempted by higher priority tasks.

[[File:Nagant Revolver.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A Russian [[Nagant M1895]] [[revolver]]]]
'''Russian roulette''' ({{lang-ru|русская рулетка}}, ''russkaya ruletka'') is a [[lethal]] [[game of chance]] in which a player places a single [[Cartridge (firearms)|round]] in a [[revolver]], spins the [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]], places the muzzle against his or her head, and pulls the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]]. ''Russian'' refers to the supposed country of origin, and ''[[roulette]]'' to the element of risk-taking and the spinning of the revolver's cylinder, which is reminiscent of a spinning roulette wheel.

==Probability ==
Because only one [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] is loaded, the player has a one in ''x'' chance of being shot; ''x'' is the number of chambers in the cylinder. So, for instance, if a revolver holds six chambers, the chance is one in six. That assumes that each chamber is equally likely to come to rest in the "correct" position. However, due to gravity, in a properly maintained weapon with a single round inside the cylinder, the full chamber, which weighs more than the empty chambers, will usually end up near the bottom of the cylinder when its axis is not vertical, altering the odds in favor of the player.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This only applies to swing-out cylinder type revolvers, and only if the cylinder is spun outside of the revolver and allowed to come to a complete stop before being locked back in.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The number of pulls of the trigger before a round is [[expected value|expected]] to discharge is 3.5 (without spinning between the pulls) or 6 (with spinning between the pulls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statisticalideas.blogspot.com/2015/06/abnormal-risks.html|title=Abnormal risks|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Mikhail Lermontov]]'s "The Fatalist" (1840), one of five novellas comprising his ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', a minor character places a [[flintlock]] pistol to his head, pulls the trigger and survives. However, the term ''Russian roulette'' does not appear in the story, and flintlocks do not have the necessary spinning chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/913/913-h/913-h.htm The Fatalist (1840)] Lermontov, Mikhail. English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=September 2018|reason="The statement itself says that the term was not used in this book. Is there any evidence that this story has any connection to the modern fad???"}}
&lt;!-- see for instance, 
   "Mikhail Yur'yevich Lermontov - A Hero of Our Time" http://community.middlebury.edu/~beyer/courses/lermontov/
   "A Hero of Our Time" http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/A_Hero_of_Our_Time
   Vladimir Golstein "Lermontov's Narratives of Heroism" page 212 https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv6TqCMhgfj8=PA212
 --&gt;

The term ''Russian roulette'' was possibly first used &lt;!-- this formerly said that RR "[originated{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} in a 1937 short story ...]";--&gt;&lt;!-- a reference to a primary source with use of the term does not support that the term "originated" in that source. The source quote merely ''uses'' the term, and does not support that it originated only in 1937. --&gt;  in a 1937 short story of the same name by [[Georges Surdez]]. However, the story describes using a gun with one empty chamber out of six, instead of five empty chambers out of six:

{{quote|'Did you ever hear of Russian Roulette?' ... with the Russian army in Romania, around 1917... some officer would suddenly pull out his revolver, anywhere, at the table, remove a cartridge from the cylinder, spin the cylinder, snap it back in place, put it to his head and pull the trigger. There were five chances to one that the hammer would set off a live cartridge and blow his brains all over the place.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Surdez, [https://monlegionnaire.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/russian-roulette.pdf "Russian Roulette,"] ''Collier's Illustrated Weekly'' 30 January 1937; "Russian roulette ''n.''", ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notable incidents==
* In a 1946 U.S. legal case, ''[[Commonwealth v. Malone]],'' 47 A.2d 445 (1946), a [[Pennsylvania]] teenager's conviction for murder in the second degree as a result of shooting a friend, was upheld by the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]]. In this case, the teenagers involved played a modified version of Russian roulette, called Russian poker, in which they took turns aiming and pulling the trigger of the revolver at each other, rather than at their own heads. The court ruled that "When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness without regard to the probability that death to another is likely to result, that individual exhibits the state of mind required to uphold a conviction of manslaughter even if the individual did not intend for death to ensue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/criminal-law/criminal-law-keyed-to-kadish/homicide/commonwealth-v-malone/2/ |title=Commonwealth v. Malone|work=casebriefs.com |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not yet been established whether simply participating in a game of Russian roulette in which another participant kills himself by his own hand would constitute manslaughter or some lesser form of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] or [[homicide]].
* ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]],'' [[Malcolm X]] recalls an incident during his burglary career when he once played Russian roulette, pulling the trigger three times in a row to convince his partners in crime that he was not afraid to die.

==In popular culture==
===Drinking games===
There is a [[drinking game]] based on Russian Roulette.  The game involves six shot glasses filled by a non-player.  Five are filled with water, the sixth with vodka.  Among some groups, low quality vodka is preferred as it makes the glass representing the filled chamber less desirable.  The glasses are arranged in a circle, and players take turns choosing a glass to take a shot from at random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roulettegamesvariety.com/drinking-roulette.htm|title=Drinking Roulette Fun Game|website=roulettegamesvariety.com|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a game called "Beer Hunter" (titled after the Russian Roulette scenes in the film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''). In this game, six cans of beer are placed between the participants. One can is vigorously shaken, and the cans are scrambled. The participants take turns opening the cans of beer right under their noses; the person who opens the shaken can (and sprays beer up their nose) is deemed the loser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beer Hunter|url=http://drunkard.com/issues/01_07/md_drinking_games.html|website=Modern Drunkard Magazine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209054418/http://drunkard.com/issues/01_07/md_drinking_games.html|archivedate=2014-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian roulette has been portrayed in many different works of modern culture.

&lt;!-- On the TV series The Wild Wild West the two main characters, Gordon and West, were tormented by their Russian captor with a game of Russian roulette. This was done at West's request to stall their execution and buy time to free their bonds to escape in the episode The Night of the Tartar.

* In the 1951 [[Friz Freleng]]-directed [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon ''[[Ballot Box Bunny]]'', in the often censored ending, after both Bugs and [[Yosemite Sam]] lose a mayoral election to a literal "[[dark horse]] candidate", Bugs invites Sam to play Russian roulette. Sam clicks but doesn't get. Just as Bugs is about to put the gun to his head, the cartoon irises out and the audience hears a shot. The iris opens back up to reveal Bugs missed and ended up hitting Sam.

The game takes place in a bamboo room above where the other prisoners are held, so that the losers' blood drips down on future contestants. Several teen deaths following the movie's release caused police and the media to blame the film's depiction of Russian roulette, saying that it inspired the youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/deerhunter.asp |title=The Deer Hunter Suicides |date=August 16, 2007 |publisher=[[Snopes]] |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5760">In [[mathematics]],  a '''semifield''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with two [[binary operation]]s, addition and multiplication, which is similar to a [[field (mathematics)|field]], but with some axioms relaxed. 

==Overview==
The term semifield has two conflicting meanings, both of which include fields as a special case.

* In [[projective geometry]] and [[finite geometry]] ([[Mathematics Subject Classification|MSC]] 51A, 51E, 12K10), a '''semifield''' is a  [[Division_algebra#Not_necessarily_associative_division_algebras|nonassociative division ring]] with multiplicative identity element.&lt;ref name="Knuth" /&gt;  More precisely, it is a [[nonassociative algebra|nonassociative ring]] whose nonzero elements form a [[loop (mathematics)|loop]] under multiplication. In other words, a semifield is a set ''S'' with two operations + (addition) and · (multiplication), such that 
** (''S'',+) is an [[abelian group]], 
** multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] on both the left and right, 
** there exists a multiplicative [[identity element]], and 
** [[division (mathematics)|division]] is always possible: for every ''a'' and every nonzero ''b'' in ''S'', there exist unique ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'' for which ''b''·''x'' = ''a'' and ''y''·''b'' = ''a''. 
: Note in particular that the multiplication is not assumed to be [[commutative property|commutative]] or [[associative property|associative]]. A semifield that is associative is a [[division ring]], and one that is both associative and commutative is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A semifield by this definition is a special case of a [[quasifield]]. If ''S'' is finite, the last axiom in the definition above can be replaced with the assumption that there are no [[zero divisor]]s, so that ''a''&amp;middot;''b'' = 0 implies that ''a'' = 0 or ''b'' = 0.&lt;ref name="Landquist" /&gt; Note that due to the lack of associativity, the last axiom is ''not'' equivalent to the assumption that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, as is usually found in definitions of fields and division rings.

* In [[ring theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[functional analysis]], and [[theoretical computer science]] ([[Mathematics Subject Classification|MSC]] 16Y60), a '''semifield''' is a [[semiring]] (''S'',+,·) in which all elements have a multiplicative inverse.&lt;ref name="Golan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; These objects are also called '''proper semifields'''. A variation of this definition arises if ''S'' contains an absorbing zero that is different from the multiplicative unit ''e'', it is required that the non-zero elements be invertible, and ''a''·0 = 0·''a'' = 0. Since multiplication is [[associative]], the (non-zero) elements of a semifield form a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. However, the pair (''S'',+) is only a [[semigroup]], i.e. additive inverse need not exist, or, colloquially, 'there is no subtraction'. Sometimes, it is not assumed that the multiplication is associative.

== Primitivity of semifields==
A semifield D is called right (resp. left) primitive if it has an element w such that the set of nonzero elements of D* is equal to the set of all right (resp. left) principal powers of w.

== Examples ==
We only give examples of semifields in the second sense, i.e. additive semigroups with distributive multiplication. Moreover, addition is commutative and multiplication is associative in our examples.

* [[Positive real numbers]] with the usual addition and multiplication form a commutative semifield.
*:This can be extended by an absorbing 0, forming the [[probability semiring]], which is isomorphic to the [[log semiring]].
* [[Rational function]]s of the form ''f'' /''g'', where ''f'' and ''g'' are [[polynomial]]s in one variable with positive coefficients, form a commutative semifield.
*:This can be extended to include 0.
* The [[real numbers]] '''R''' can be viewed a semifield where the sum of two elements is defined to be their maximum and the product to be their ordinary sum; this semifield is more compactly denoted ('''R''', max, +).  Similarly ('''R''', min, +) is a semifield. These are called the [[tropical semiring]].
*:This can be extended by −∞ (an absorbing 0); this is the limit ([[tropicalization]]) of the [[log semiring]] as the base goes to infinity.
* Generalizing the previous example, if (''A'',·,≤) is a [[lattice-ordered group]] then (''A'',+,·) is an additively [[idempotent]] semifield with the semifield sum defined to be the [[supremum]] of two elements. Conversely, any additively idempotent semifield (''A'',+,·) defines a lattice-ordered group (''A'',·,≤), where ''a''≤''b'' if and only if ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b''.
* The boolean semifield '''B''' = {0, 1} with addition defined by [[logical or]], and multiplication defined by [[logical and]].

The '''social construction of the body''' is a hypothesis that affirms that the relationship between the body and the [[Sociocultural context|socio-cultural context]] occurs in both senses, and that society and culture influence the formation of its members to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Guerra Carrasco, René (2005). "Donación de órganos: compresión y significado.". Universidad de Chile (20).&lt;/ref&gt; The body has become a social construction, in whose delimitation have participated multiple disciplines. Thus, [[medicine]] and [[religion]] can be mentioned as the agents that have traditionally influenced, together with the rules of urbanity and educational institutions. These four agents have been building a model, which every individual has as reference. According to [[Bryan Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]], the social construction of the body is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951272599|title=The body &amp; society : explorations in social theory|last=S.|first=Turner, Bryan|publisher=Sage|isbn=1412929873|oclc=951272599}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"The nearest and immediate feature of my social self, a necessary feature of my social situation and my personal identity, and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in the natural environment"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[YouTube]] [[video hosting service]] constitutes a social networking website on which practically any individual or organization with Internet access can upload videos that can be seen almost immediately by wide audiences. As the world's largest video platform, YouTube has had impact in many fields, with some individual YouTube videos having directly shaped world events.

====Searchable information repository====
Beyond being what a [[Forrester Research]] analyst characterized as the largest video ''platform'' on the globe, as of January 2012 YouTube was also the world's second most popular [[Web search engine|search engine]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker20120116/&gt; However, YouTube keyword searches are confined to [[wiktionary:metadata|metadata]]—video titles and labels—rather than the video content itself.&lt;ref name=NewYorker20120116/&gt;

===Spurring innovation through distributed communities===
In the year following YouTube's 2005 launch, some early video creators gained large viewing audiences, while others created small, tight communities among mutual watchers.&lt;ref name=Telegram20060611/&gt; In 2010 [[TED (conference)|TED]] curator [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.&lt;ref name=TED201007Anderson/&gt; ''[[The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers|Legion of Extraordinary Dancers]]'' producer [[Jon M. Chu]] described "a whole global laboratory online" in which "kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit, building on it within days and releasing a new video, while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself."&lt;ref name=TED201002LXD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/the_lxd_in_the_internet_age_dance_evolves.html |title=The LXD: In the Internet age, dance evolves |last=Chu |first=Jon M. |date=February 2010 |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MioNt4ZG?url=http://www.ted.com/talks/the_lxd_in_the_internet_age_dance_evolves.html |archivedate=January 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such fields include dance and music, with Chu saying the Internet was causing dance to evolve,&lt;ref name=TED201007Anderson/&gt; and journalist [[Virginia Heffernan]] calling certain music videos "a portal into a worldwide [[microculture]]".&lt;ref name=NYTimes20060827&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/arts/television/27heff.html?_r=0&amp;ei=5088&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Web Guitar Wizard Revealed at Last |last=Heffernan |first=Virginia |date=August 27, 2006 |website=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Mg4TJMoR?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/arts/television/27heff.html?_r=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;pagewanted=all&amp; |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally posted anonymously by a guitarist seeking suggestions on his playing, a 2005 YouTube cover of the "Canon Rock" adaptation of [[Pachelbel's Canon]] received millions of views and spawned hundreds of imitators in "a process of influence, imitation and inspiration".&lt;ref name=NYTimes20060827/&gt; Journalist [[Virginia Heffernan]] asserted in ''The New York Times'' that such videos have "surprising implications" not only for YouTube, but also for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20060827/&gt;

YouTube has provided inventors an audience for market testing their concepts, and a platform—albeit an inherently profitless one—for disseminating innovations more quickly and more widely than writing papers or speaking at conferences.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20081025/&gt; Collaborative "meetings", a global online equivalent of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], take place virtually, via video.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20081025&gt;{{cite news |last=Berlin |first=Leslie |title=If No One Sees It, Is It an Invention? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/business/26proto.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NUja39Jn?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/business/26proto.html?_r=0 |archivedate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years after Google purchased YouTube and larger production companies had begun to dominate,&lt;ref name=WiredUK20131127/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120628/&gt; a ''New York Times Magazine'' journalist said the website was "still incubating novel forms of creative expression and cultivating new audiences" as amateurs continued to create "microgenres" serving niche audiences, collectively creating what she described as an "art [[wiktionary:subculture|scene]]".&lt;ref name=NYTimes20090903&gt;{{cite news |last=Heffernan |first=Virginia |title=Uploading the Avant-Garde |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06FOB-medium-t.html |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=September 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NSYuDfPd?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06FOB-medium-t.html?_r=1&amp; |archivedate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration and crowdsourcing===

In projects such as the [[YouTube Symphony Orchestra]]&lt;ref name=Reuters20090414/&gt; and ''[[The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers]],''&lt;ref name=TED201002LXD/&gt; geographically distributed artists were selected based on their individual online video auditions, and assembled on the same stage to perform, respectively, at Carnegie Hall (2009)&lt;ref name=Reuters20090414&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/04/14/us-youtube-idUSTRE53D4PE20090414 |title=YouTube orchestra prepares for Carnegie debut |last1=Nichols |first1=Michelle (reporter) |last2= Simao |first2=Paul (editor) |date=April 14, 2009 |publisher=Reuters |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MjbFECh1?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/04/14/us-youtube-idUSTRE53D4PE20090414 |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Academy Awards ceremonies (2010).&lt;ref name=TED201007Anderson/&gt;

A further step is to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] geographically distributed performances into a single work, without the performers ever physically meeting each other.

===Effects on values and standards===
YouTube was included in ''Entertainment Weekly's'' "100 Greatest" list in 2009—though with the ironic praise, "a safe home for piano-playing cats, celeb goof-ups, and overzealous lip-synchers since 2005".&lt;ref name=EntWeekly20091204&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_20324138,00.html |title=100 Greatest Movies, TV Shows, and More |date=December 4, 2009 |website=Entertainment Weekly |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MkOc60zc?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_20324138,00.html |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, citing YouTube's then most viewed video ''[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]'' as an example of viewers not choosing what might have traditionally been judged "quality", ''Advertising Age'' journalist Michael Learmonth asserted that for information and entertainment the Internet had both killed and redefined the concept of quality.&lt;ref name=AdAge20100222/&gt; Learmonth reasoned that online journalism, being based on "greatly diminished economics and expectations", is intrinsically inaccurate and a de-professionalized version of offline journalism.&lt;ref name=AdAge20100222/&gt; In this vein, [[GroupM]]'s CEO was quoted as saying there seemed to be a bigger premium on popularity than authority.&lt;ref name=AdAge20100222/&gt; Concerning these phenomena, the CEO of Associated Content (now [[Yahoo!

In 2008, cultural anthropologist [[Michael Wesch]] observed that both YouTube [[Video blog|vloggers]] and their viewers can experience a profound sense of connection, the distance and anonymity between them enabling them to avoid the constraining effect of conventional social norms (such as not staring at people).&lt;ref name=WeschLoC2008/&gt; This sense of connection is said to occur in an era of "cultural inversion" in which we are driven to express our individualism and independence, yet still value community and relationships.&lt;ref name=WeschLoC2008&gt;{{cite web |title=An Anthroplogical Introduction to YouTube |last=Wesch |first=Michael |date=June 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPAO-lZ4_hU |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/WeschYouTube| archivedate=February 17, 2017 |deadurl=no }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170922165546/http://www.allreadable.com/6a6b3DUK Transcript]).

Though television advertising still dominated how 2012 U.S. political campaigns initially reached voters—with only about 10% of advertising budgets being directed at the Internet—the YouTube platform provided quick communication and engaged people in a "one-click" approach to actively participate by volunteering, sharing content or pledging financial support.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120314/&gt; The director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution said that individuals' sharing videos through trusted networks adds credibility over conventional direct ads.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120314&gt;{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy W. |title=With Video, Obama Looks to Expand Campaign's Reach Through Social Media |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/with-youtube-video-obama-looks-to-expand-social-media-reach.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NJZRZhG3?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/with-youtube-video-obama-looks-to-expand-social-media-reach.html?_r=0 |archivedate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When governments of countries such as Syria began to examine user-generated YouTube videos to identify and arrest dissidents, in 2012 YouTube provided a tool by which uploaders may blur subjects' faces to protect their identities.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120718&gt;{{cite news |last=Preston |first=Jennifer |title=YouTube Offers a Way to Blur Faces, Protecting Identities in Videos |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/youtube-offers-a-way-to-blur-faces-protecting-identities-in-videos/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NGsZlxUx?url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/youtube-offers-a-way-to-blur-faces-protecting-identities-in-videos/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube served as a platform for individuals to voice their views about the parliamentary and presidential elections (2011, 2012) in Russia, in either a serious or satirical manner, one of which—the satire "Arrest of [[Vladimir Putin]]: a report from the courtroom"—was viewed enough times to make the list of most popular videos on YouTube for two consecutive weeks.&lt;ref name=PewTopStoriesYT20120716&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalism.org/2012/07/16/top-stories/ |title=YouTube and News: Top Stories |last=Journalism Project Staff |date=July 17, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MGFsXlgy?url=http://www.journalism.org/2012/07/16/top-stories/ |archivedate=December 30, 2013 }} Original video title: "Арест Владимира Путина: репортаж из зала суда"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year following its 2005 formation, YouTube, with its display of view counts, was likened to "a survey of cultural whims", whose more popular artists attracted the interest of established production companies.&lt;ref name=Telegram20060611&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060611/NEWS/606110552/1011/FEATURES |title=Video makers find a vast and eager audience |last=Feifer |first=Jason |date=June 11, 2006 |website=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MWhLHDsU?url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060611/NEWS/606110552/1011/FEATURES |archivedate=January 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In YouTube's first years, however, music labels had trouble gauging the commercial value of online popularity, perceiving that the Internet's "convenience factor" made an artist's online following less indicative of audience attachment than direct measures such as CD sales and concert attendance.&lt;ref name=Reuters20070225/&gt; By early 2013 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the Hot 100 formula-based genre charts.&lt;ref name=Billboard20130220&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1549399/hot-100-news-billboard-and-nielsen-add-youtube-video-streaming-to-platforms |title=Hot 100 News: Billboard and Nielsen Add YouTube Video Streaming to Platforms |author=''Billboard'' staff  |date=February 20, 2013 |website=Billboard |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Mje9ORDm?url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1549399/hot-100-news-billboard-and-nielsen-add-youtube-video-streaming-to-platforms |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Putting online listens on the same footing as actual song purchases to determine hits was described as reflecting "the latest shift in power in the music industry: from record labels and radio DJs to listeners".&lt;ref name=NewRepublic20121116&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/110246/jukeboxes-youtube-how-billboard-catching-the-times |title=From Jukeboxes to YouTube: How Billboard Is Catching Up With The Times |last=Diamond |first=Jason |date=November 16, 2012 |website=The New Republic |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MjeNprI9?url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/110246/jukeboxes-youtube-how-billboard-catching-the-times |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2013, ''[[Forbes]]''' Katheryn Thayer noted that, though booking the right concert venues and radio and television stations once propelled artists to fame, social media activity had become "unquestionably important".&lt;ref name=Forbes20131029/&gt; Emphasizing the importance of the way the 2013 [[YouTube Music Awards]] determined winners—social media statistics informing nominations and social media shares determining winners—Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.&lt;ref name=Forbes20131029&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherynthayer/2013/10/29/the-youtube-music-awards-why-artists-should-care/ |title=The Youtube Music Awards: Why Artists Should Care |last=Thayer |first=Katheryn |date=October 29, 2013 |website=Forbes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KupXHvTe?url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/katherynthayer/2013/10/29/the-youtube-music-awards-why-artists-should-care/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaching wider audiences==
{{See also|List of YouTubers|List of most viewed YouTube videos}}
YouTube has been used to grow audiences, both by undiscovered individual artists&lt;ref name=Reuters20070225/&gt; and by large production companies.&lt;ref name=WiredUK20131127/&gt;

===Evolution of YouTube as a platform for individuals and companies===
Within the year following YouTube's 2005 launch—which one commentator called "the biggest jolt to Internet video"&lt;ref name=Telegram20060611/&gt;—entertainment industry executives and casting agents were researching video sharing websites.&lt;ref name=LATimes20060619/&gt; When a video hit big it was not uncommon for its creator to hear from production companies.&lt;ref name=Telegram20060611/&gt; By June 2006, recognized Hollywood and music industry firms had begun to establish formal business ties with "homegrown" YouTube talent—the first believed to be comedian blogger [[Brooke Brodack|Brooke "Brookers" Brodack]] (through [[Carson Daly]]),&lt;ref name=LATimes20060619&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/19/entertainment/et-channel19 |title=Now she has their attention |last=Collins |first=Scott |date=June 19, 2006 |website=Los Angeles Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MfxAU28P?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/19/entertainment/et-channel19 |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then singer [[Justin Bieber]] (through [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]),&lt;ref name=Billboard20100319&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959001/justin-bieber-the-billboard-cover-story?page=0%2C1 |title=Justin Bieber - The Billboard Cover Story |last=Herrera |first=Monica |date=March 19, 2010 |website=Billboard |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MfyFel8l?url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959001/justin-bieber-the-billboard-cover-story?page=0,1 |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physician-become-political satirist [[Bassem Youssef]] (through an Egyptian television network).&lt;ref name=CBS60Minutes20140316/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeutscheWelle20140207/&gt;

[[Old media]] celebrities also moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings, and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.&lt;ref name=WiredUK20131127/&gt; In June 2006 YouTube formed its first partnership with a major content provider, [[NBC]], promoting its fall television lineup.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider20130215&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/key-turning-points-history-of-youtube-2013-2?op=1 |title=The 22 Key Turning Points In The History Of YouTube |last=Dickey |first=Megan Rose |date=February 15, 2013 |website=Business Insider |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6N1AhzYVF?url=http://www.businessinsider.com/key-turning-points-history-of-youtube-2013-2?op=1 |archivedate=January 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, [[Google]] paid $1.65 billion to purchase the 67-employee YouTube, seeking a lucrative marketing platform as both audiences and advertisers migrated from television to the Internet.&lt;ref name=NBCnews20061010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15196982/ns/business-us_business/t/google-buys-youtube-billion/ |title=Google buys YouTube for $1.65 billion |author=Associated Press |date=October 10, 2006 |publisher=NBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MbxGEHHL?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15196982/ns/business-us_business/t/google-buys-youtube-billion/ |archivedate=January 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google made the website more business-driven,&lt;ref name=WiredUK20131127/&gt; starting to overlay banner ads onto videos in August 2007.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider20130215/&gt; While the video platform remained available for its pioneering content creators, large production companies began to dominate.&lt;ref name=WiredUK20131127&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-11/27/youtube-community |title=The rise and fall of YouTube's celebrity pioneers |last=Tufnell |first=Nicholas |date=November 27, 2013 |website=Wired UK |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Mblm3WtO?url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-11/27/youtube-community |archivedate=January 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120628/&gt;

Independent artists built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, but mass retail and radio promotion—areas still dominated by record labels—proved problematic.&lt;ref name=Reuters20070225&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/26/us-youtube-idUSN2518918320070226 |title=YouTube stars don't always welcome record deals |last=Bruno |first=Antony |date=February 25, 2007 |publisher=Reuters |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Mg15Wsfd?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/26/us-youtube-idUSN2518918320070226 |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as early as 2006, YouTube management convinced four major music labels—who initially had been wary of the website because of its large quantity of their copyrighted material—to enter into a partnership with YouTube, convincing them that YouTube could help them make more money by connecting them with growing Internet audiences.&lt;ref name=NBCnews20061010/&gt; In April 2009, YouTube and Vivendi teamed to form the Vevo music video service.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider20130215/&gt; Though YouTube invested $875,000 in its 2011 NextUp tips and training program for promising pioneering YouTubers, the company spent $100 million on its "originals" strategy to get mainstream celebrities to curate channels—hoping to benefit from both the personal fan loyalty cultivated by its pioneering content creators and the expected higher ad rates of the new celebrity channels.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120628&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Rob |title=On YouTube, Amateur Is the New Pro |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/magazine/on-youtube-amateur-is-the-new-pro.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 28, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NH8HIegc?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/magazine/on-youtube-amateur-is-the-new-pro.html?ref=youtube&amp;_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp; |archivedate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, it was the production companies eventually formed by pioneering YouTubers that created about one-third of these new "originals" channels.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120628/&gt;

By 2012, the [[Complete Music Update|CMU]] business editor had characterized YouTube as "a free-to-use... promotional platform for the music labels",&lt;ref name=BBC20121221&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20812870 |title=Gangnam Style hits one billion views on YouTube |date=December 21, 2012 |publisher=BBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MjXqzO00?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20812870 |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 the videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as "mega", "mainstream" and "mid-sized" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and [[Vevo]].&lt;ref name=NextBigSound2013YearInRewind&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nextbigsound.com/industryreport/2013/ |title=2013: Year in Rewind (report title) / Mapping the Landscape (specific section title) |date=January 2014 |publisher=[[Next Big Sound]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ml0gCaZu?url=https://www.nextbigsound.com/industryreport/2013/ |archivedate=January 20, 2014 }} "Developing" artists 6.9% of the views; "Undiscovered" artists 2.8%.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 YouTube announced that it would block videos from labels that do not sign licensing contracts for the website's premium (paid subscription) [[Streaming media|music streaming]] service, in effect excluding [[independent record label]]s who have refused to sign contracts having terms inferior to those having already been agreed to by all the [[Record label#Major labels|major labels]].&lt;ref name=Guardian20140617&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dredge |first1=Stuart |last2=Rushe |first2=Dominic |title=YouTube to block indie labels who don't sign up to new music service |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/youtube-indie-labels-music-subscription |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QSD4h2jK?url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/youtube-indie-labels-music-subscription |archivedate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, YouTube's demonetization of user videos that had "controversial or sensitive subjects and events ... even if graphic imagery is not shown”—thereby disallowing ad revenue—angered content creators who perceived the policy as "rampant censorship" and inspired a #YouTubeIsOverParty [[hashtag]] on social media.&lt;ref name=WashPost20160901&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dewey |first1=Caitlin |title=Why YouTubers are accusing the site of rampant ‘censorship’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/01/why-youtubers-are-accusing-the-site-of-rampant-censorship/ |work=The Washington Post |date=September 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kK5kEgOm?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/01/why-youtubers-are-accusing-the-site-of-rampant-censorship/ |archivedate=September 6, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posting videos as a livelihood===
Enabling a new way of earning a livelihood, YouTube's "Partner Program", an ad-revenue-sharing arrangement begun in 2007, grew by January 2012 to about 30,000 partners, its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually and some earning "much more".&lt;ref name=NewYorker20120116/&gt; Also, brands were reported in 2012 to pay six figures direct to the most popular YouTubers to create and upload ads.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120628/&gt; ''Forbes'' reported that in the year ending in June 2015, the ten highest-earning YouTube channels grossed from $2.5 million to $12 million,&lt;ref name=Forbes20151113&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berg |first1=Madeline |title=The World's Top-Earning YouTube Stars 2015 |url=http://www3.forbes.com/business/the-worlds-top-earning-youtube-stars-2015/ |publisher=''Forbes'' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d0sXMyOT?url=http://www3.forbes.com/business/the-worlds-top-earning-youtube-stars-2015/ |archivedate=November 13, 2015 |dead-url=no |date=November 2015}} • {{cite web |last1=Berg |first1=Madeline |title=The World's Top-Earning YouTube Stars 2015 / 1.

'''Social reality'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion|last = Berger|first = Peter|publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|year = 1967|isbn = |location = Garden City, NY|pages = 3-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is distinct from biological [[reality]] or [[individual]] cognitive reality, representing as it does a phenomenological level created through [[social interaction]] and thereby transcending individual motives and actions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The product of human dialogue, social reality may be considered as consisting of the accepted social [[wikt:tenet|tenet]]s of a [[community]], involving thereby relatively stable laws and [[social representation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ireke Bockting, ''Character and Personality in the Novels of William Faulkner'' (1995) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radical constructivism]] would cautiously describe social reality as the product of uniformities among observers (whether or not including the current observer themselves).&lt;ref&gt;[[Niklas Luhmann]], ''Theories of Distinction'' (2002) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schütz, Durkheim, and Spencer==

The problem of social reality has been treated exhaustively by philosophers in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition, particularly [[Alfred Schütz]], who used the term "social world" to designate this distinct level of reality. Within the social world, Schütz distinguished between social reality that could be experienced directly (''umwelt'') and a social reality beyond the immediate horizon, which could yet be experienced if sought out.&lt;ref&gt;George Walsh, "Introduction", Alfred Schütz, ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1997)p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; In his wake, [[ethnomethodology]] explored further the unarticulated structure of our everyday competence and ability with social reality.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the subject had been addressed in [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines. For example, [[Émile Durkheim]] stressed the distinct nature of "the social kingdom. Here more than anywhere else the idea is the reality".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. van der Eyden, ''Public Management of Society'' (2003) p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]] had coined the term ''[[superorganism|super-organic]]'' to distinguish the social level of reality above the biological and psychological.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Spencer, ''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 1. "The Data of Sociology"(1876)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searle==

[[John Searle]] has used the theory of [[speech act]]s to explore the nature of social/institutional reality, so as to describe such aspects of social reality which he instances under the rubrics of "marriage, property, hiring, firing, war, revolutions, cocktail parties, governments, meetings, unions, parliaments, corporations, laws, restaurants, vacations, lawyers, professors, doctors, medieval knights, and taxes, for example".&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (Penguin 1996) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle argued that such institutional realities interact with each other in what he called "systematic relationships (e.g., governments, marriages, corporations, universities, armies, churches)"&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; to create a multi-layered social reality.

For Searle, language was the key to the formation of social reality because "language is precisely designed to be a self-identifying category of institutional facts"; i.e., a system of publicly and widely accepted symbols which "persist through time independently of the urges and inclinations of the participants."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 73 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective/subjective==

There is a debate in [[social theory]] about whether social reality exists independently of people's involvement with it, or whether (as in [[social constructionism]]) it is only created by the human process of ongoing interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Giddens, ''Sociology'' (2006) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Peter L. Berger]] argued for a new concern with the basic process of the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Berger stated that the social construction of reality was a process made up of three steps: externalization, objectivation and internalization. In similar fashion, post-[[Sartre|Sartrians]] like [[R. D. Laing]] stress that, "once certain fundamental structures of experience are shared, they come to be experienced as objective entities...they take on the force and character of partial autonomous realities, with their own way of life".&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the same time, Laing insisted that such a socially real grouping "can be nothing else than the multiplicity of the points of view and actions of its members...even where, through the interiorization of this multiplicity as synthesized by each, this synthesized multiplicity becomes ubiquitous in space and enduring in time".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a social reality independent of individuals or the ecology would seem at odds with the views of [[perceptual psychology]], including those of [[J. J. Gibson]], and those of most [[ecological economics]] theories.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scholars such as John Searle argue on the one hand that "a socially constructed reality presupposes a reality independent of all social constructions".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he accepts that social realities are humanly created, and that "the secret to understanding the continued existence of institutional facts is simply that the individuals directly involved and a sufficient number of members of the relevant communities must continue to recognize and accept the existence of such facts".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 190 and p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialisation and the Capital Other==

[[Freud]] saw a child's induction into social reality as consolidated with the passing of the [[Oedipus complex]] and the internalisation of the parents: "the same figures who continue to operate in the [[super-ego]] as the agency we know as conscience...also belong to the real external world. It is from there that they were drawn; their power, behind which lie hidden all the influences of the past and of tradition, was one of the most strongly-felt manifestations of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] clarified the point by stressing that this was "a highly significant moment in the transfer of powers from the subject to the Other, what I call the Capital Other...the field of the Other – which, strictly speaking, is the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 129 and p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considered that "the Oedipus complex...superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of nature",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the child into [[The Symbolic|the Symbolic Order]].

Within that order, [[Lacanianism|Lacanians]] consider that "institutions, as ''signifying practices'', are much more extensive structures than romantic notions allow and they thus implicate us in ways which narrower definitions cannot recognize...exceed any intersubjective intention or effect".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Copjec, in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion, Searle asserts that "institutional power – massive, pervasive, and typically invisible – permeates every nook and cranny of our social lives...the invisible structure of social reality".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 94 and p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring trust==

If one accepts the validity of the idea of social reality, scientifically, it must be amenable to measurement, something which has been explored particularly in relation to [[trust (social sciences)|trust]]. "Trust is...part of a community's [[social capital]], as [[Francis Fukuyama]] argues, and has deep historical and cultural roots".&lt;ref&gt;Will Hutton, ''The State to Come'' (London 1997) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of the measurement of trust in the sociological community are usually called theories of social capital, to emphasize the connection to [[economics]], and the ability to measure outputs in the same manner.

==Propaganda==

One aspect of social reality is the principle of the "[[big lie]]", which states that an outrageous untruth is easier to convince people of than a less outrageous truth. Many examples from [[politics]] and [[theology]] (e.g., the claim that the [[Roman Emperor]] was in fact a "god") demonstrate that this principle was known by effective [[Propaganda|propagandists]] from early times, and continues to be applied to this day. The [[propaganda model]] of [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] supports the "big lie" thesis with more specifics.

In [[mathematics]], a '''spherical coordinate system''' is a [[coordinate system]] for [[dimension|three-dimensional space]] where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: the ''radial distance'' of that point from a fixed origin, its ''polar angle'' measured from a fixed [[zenith]] direction, and the ''[[azimuth|azimuth angle]]'' of its [[orthogonal projection]] on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane. It can be seen as the three-dimensional version of the [[polar coordinate system]]. 

The radial distance is also called the ''radius'' or ''radial coordinate''. The polar angle may be called ''colatitude'', ''zenith angle'', ''normal angle'', or ''inclination angle''.

The use of symbols and the order of the coordinates differs between sources. In one system frequently encountered in physics ({{mvar|r}}, [[theta|{{mvar|θ}}]], [[phi|{{mvar|φ}}]]) gives the radial distance, polar angle, and azimuthal angle, whereas in another system used in many mathematics books {{mvar|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} gives the radial distance, azimuthal angle, and polar angle. In both systems [[rho|{{mvar|ρ}}]] is often used instead of {{mvar|r}}. Other conventions are also used, so great care needs to be taken to check which one is being used. &lt;!-- Please maintain a consistent convention in this article. --&gt;

A number of different spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a [[geographical coordinate system]] positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a number of different [[celestial coordinate system]]s based on different [[Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental planes]] and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use [[radian]]s rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees]] and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the {{mvar|x}}-axis to the {{mvar|y}}-axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the [[horizontal coordinate system]].&lt;ref&gt;Duffett-Smith, P and Zwart, J, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The polar angle is often replaced by the ''elevation angle'' measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.

The spherical coordinate system generalizes the two-dimensional polar coordinate system. It can also be extended to higher-dimensional spaces and is then referred to as a [[N-sphere#Spherical coordinates|hyperspherical coordinate system]].

== Definition ==

To define a spherical coordinate system, one must choose two orthogonal directions, the ''zenith'' and the ''azimuth reference'', and an ''origin'' point in space. These choices determine a reference plane that contains the origin and is perpendicular to the zenith. The spherical coordinates of a point {{mvar|P}} are then defined as follows:

* The ''radius'' or ''radial distance'' is the [[Euclidean distance]] from the origin {{mvar|O}} to {{mvar|P}}.
* The ''inclination'' (or ''polar angle'') is the angle between the zenith direction and the line segment {{mvar|OP}}.
* The ''azimuth'' (or ''azimuthal angle'') is the signed angle measured from the azimuth reference direction to the orthogonal projection of the line segment {{mvar|OP}} on the reference plane.

The sign of the azimuth is determined by choosing what is a ''positive'' sense of turning about the zenith. This choice is arbitrary, and is part of the coordinate system's definition.

The ''elevation'' angle is 90 degrees ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians) minus the inclination angle.

If the inclination is zero or 180 degrees ({{pi}} radians), the azimuth is arbitrary. If the radius is zero, both azimuth and inclination are arbitrary.

In [[linear algebra]], the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] from the origin {{mvar|O}} to the point {{mvar|P}} is often called the ''[[position vector]]'' of ''P''.

=== Conventions ===

Several different conventions exist for representing the three coordinates, and for the order in which they should be written. The use of {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} to denote radial distance, inclination (or elevation), and azimuth, respectively, is common practice in physics, and is specified by [[International Organisation for Standardisation|ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-2|80000-2:2009]], and earlier in [[ISO 31-11]] (1992).

However, some authors (including mathematicians) use {{mvar|φ}} for inclination (or elevation) and {{mvar|θ}} for azimuth, which "provides a logical extension of the usual polar coordinates notation".&lt;ref name="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html
| title = Spherical Coordinates

| publisher = [[MathWorld]]
| date = 2005-10-26
| accessdate = 2010-01-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors may also list the azimuth before the inclination (or elevation), and/or use {{mvar|ρ}} (rho) instead of {{mvar|r}} for radial distance. Some combinations of these choices result in a [[right-hand rule|left-handed]] coordinate system. The standard convention {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} conflicts with the usual notation for the two-dimensional [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], where {{mvar|θ}} is often used for the azimuth. It may also conflict with the notation used for three-dimensional [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]].
&lt;ref name="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html" /&gt;

The angles are typically measured in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (°) or [[radian]]s (rad), where 360°&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2{{pi}} rad. Degrees are most common in geography, astronomy, and engineering, whereas radians are commonly used in mathematics and theoretical physics. The unit for radial distance is usually determined by the context.

When the system is used for physical three-space, it is customary to use positive sign for azimuth angles that are measured in the counter-clockwise sense from the reference direction on the reference plane, as seen from the zenith side of the plane. This convention is used, in particular, for geographical coordinates, where the "zenith" direction is [[north]] and positive azimuth (longitude) angles are measured eastwards from some [[prime meridian]].

=== Unique coordinates ===

Any spherical coordinate triplet {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} specifies a single point of three-dimensional space. On the other hand, every point has infinitely many equivalent spherical coordinates. One can add or subtract any number of full turns to either angular measure without changing the angles themselves, and therefore without changing the point. It is also convenient, in many contexts, to allow negative radial distances, with the convention that {{math|(−''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} is equivalent to {{math|(''r'', ''θ'' + 180°, ''φ'')}} for any {{mvar|r}}, {{mvar|θ}}, and {{mvar|φ}}. Moreover, {{math|(''r'', −''θ'', ''φ'')}} is equivalent to {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'' + 180°)}}.

If it is necessary to define a unique set of spherical coordinates for each point, one must restrict their ranges. A common choice is:

: {{math|''r'' ≥ 0}}
: {{math|0° ≤ ''θ'' ≤ 180° (π rad)}}
: {{math|0° ≤ ''φ'' &lt; 360° (2π rad)}}

However, the azimuth {{mvar|φ}} is often restricted to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{nowrap|(−180°, +180°]}}, or {{nowrap|(−{{pi}}, +{{pi}}]}} in radians, instead of {{nowrap|[0, 360°)}}. This is the standard convention for geographic longitude.

The range {{nowrap|[0°, 180°]}} for inclination is equivalent to {{nowrap|[−90°, +90°]}} for elevation (latitude).

Even with these restrictions, if {{mvar|θ}} is 0° or 180° (elevation is 90° or −90°) then the azimuth angle is arbitrary; and if {{mvar|r}} is zero, both azimuth and inclination/elevation are arbitrary. To make the coordinates unique, one can use the convention that in these cases the arbitrary coordinates are zero.

=== Plotting ===

To plot a dot from its spherical coordinates {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}, where {{mvar|θ}} is inclination, move {{mvar|r}} units from the origin in the zenith direction, rotate by {{mvar|θ}} about the origin towards the azimuth reference direction, and rotate by {{mvar|φ}} about the zenith in the proper direction.

== Applications ==

The [[geographic coordinate system]] uses the azimuth and elevation of the spherical coordinate system to express locations on Earth, calling them respectively [[longitude]] and [[latitude]]. Just as the two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is useful on the plane, a two-dimensional spherical coordinate system is useful on the surface of a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored. This simplification can also be very useful when dealing with objects such as [[Rotation matrix|rotational matrices]].

Spherical coordinates are useful in analyzing systems that have some degree of symmetry about a point, such as [[multiple integral|volume integrals]] inside a sphere, the potential energy field surrounding a concentrated mass or charge, or global weather simulation in a planet's atmosphere. A sphere that has the Cartesian equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} has the simple equation {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''c''}} in spherical coordinates.

Two important [[partial differential equations]] that arise in many physical problems, [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]], allow a [[separation of variables]] in spherical coordinates. The angular portions of the solutions to such equations take the form of [[spherical harmonics]].

Another application is ergonomic design, where {{mvar|r}} is the arm length of a stationary person and the angles describe the direction of the arm as it reaches out.

[[Image:Bosch 36W column loudspeaker polar pattern.png|thumb|The output pattern of an industrial [[loudspeaker]] shown using spherical polar plots taken at six frequencies]]
Three dimensional modeling of [[loudspeaker]] output patterns can be used to predict their performance. A number of polar plots are required, taken at a wide selection of frequencies, as the pattern changes greatly with frequency. Polar plots help to show that many loudspeakers tend toward omnidirectionality at lower frequencies.

The spherical coordinate system is also commonly used in 3D [[game development]] to rotate the camera around the player's position.

=== In geography ===

To a first approximation, the [[geographic coordinate system]] uses elevation angle (latitude) in degrees north of the [[equator]] plane, in the range {{math|−90° ≤ ''φ'' ≤ 90°}}, instead of inclination. Latitude is either [[Latitude#Geocentric latitude|geocentric latitude]], measured at the Earth's center and designated variously by {{math|''ψ'', ''q'', ''φ''′, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} or [[Latitude#Geodetic coordinates|geodetic latitude]], measured by the observer's local vertical, and commonly designated {{mvar|φ}}. The azimuth angle (longitude), commonly denoted by {{mvar|λ}}, is measured in degrees east or west from some conventional reference [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] (most commonly the [[IERS Reference Meridian]]), so its domain is {{math|−180° ≤ ''λ'' ≤ 180°}}. For positions on the [[Earth]] or other solid [[celestial body]], the reference plane is usually taken to be the plane perpendicular to the [[axis of rotation]]. &lt;!--Must explain the conventions for positive latitude and longitude--&gt;

The polar angle, which is 90° minus the latitude and ranges from 0 to 180°, is called [[colatitude]] in geography.

Instead of the radial distance, geographers commonly use [[altitude]] above or below some reference surface, which may be the [[sea level]] or "mean" surface level for planets without liquid oceans. The radial distance {{mvar|r}} can be computed from the altitude by adding the mean radius of the planet's reference surface, which is approximately {{convert|6,360|±|11|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} for Earth.

However, modern geographical coordinate systems are quite complex, and the positions implied by these simple formulae may be wrong by several kilometers. The precise standard meanings of latitude, longitude and altitude are currently defined by the [[World Geodetic System]] (WGS), and take into account the flattening of the Earth at the poles (about {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}) and many other details.

=== In astronomy ===
In astronomy there are a series of [[Celestial coordinate system#Coordinate systems|spherical coordinate systems]] that measure the elevation angle from different [[Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental planes]]. These reference planes are the observer's [[Horizontal coordinate system|horizon]], the [[Equatorial coordinate system#Spherical coordinates|celestial equator]] (defined by Earth's rotation), the plane of the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic]] (defined by Earth's orbit around the [[Sun]]), the plane of the earth terminator (normal to the instantaneous direction to the [[Sun]]), and the [[Galactic coordinate system|galactic equator]] (defined by the rotation of the [[Milky Way]]).

== Coordinate system conversions ==

{{also|List of common coordinate transformations#To spherical coordinates}}

As the spherical coordinate system is only one of many three-dimensional coordinate systems, there exist equations for converting coordinates between the spherical coordinate system and others.

=== Cartesian coordinates ===

The spherical coordinates of a point in the ISO convention (i.e. for physics: ''radius'' {{mvar|r}}, ''inclination'' {{mvar|θ}}, ''azimuth'' {{mvar|φ}}) can be obtained from its [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} by the formulae
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} r&amp;=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\ \theta &amp;= \arccos\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}} = \arccos\frac{z}{r} \\ \varphi &amp;= \arctan \frac{y}{x} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse tangent denoted in {{math|''φ'' {{=}} arctan {{sfrac|''y''|''x''}}}} must be suitably defined, taking into account the correct quadrant of {{math|(''x'',''y'')}}. See the article on [[atan2]].

Alternatively, the conversion can be considered as two sequential [[Polar coordinate system#Converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates|rectangular to polar conversions]]: the first in the Cartesian {{mvar|xy}}-plane from {{math|(''x'',''y'')}} to {{math|(''R'',''φ'')}}, where {{mvar|R}} is the projection of {{mvar|r}} onto the {{mvar|xy}}-plane, and the second in the Cartesian {{mvar|zR}}-plane from {{math|(''z'',''R'')}} to {{math|(''r'',''θ'')}}. The correct quadrants for {{mvar|φ}} and {{mvar|θ}} are implied by the correctness of the planar rectangular to polar conversions.

These formulae assume that the two systems have the same origin, that the spherical reference plane is the Cartesian {{mvar|xy}}-plane, that {{mvar|θ}} is inclination from the {{mvar|z}} direction, and that the azimuth angles are measured from the Cartesian {{mvar|x}}-axis (so that the {{mvar|y}}-axis has {{math|''φ'' {{=}} +90°}}). If ''θ'' measures elevation from the reference plane instead of inclination from the zenith the arccos above becomes an arcsin, and the {{math|cos ''θ''}} and {{math|sin ''θ''}} below become switched.

Conversely, the Cartesian coordinates may be retrieved from the spherical coordinates (''radius'' {{mvar|r}}, ''inclination'' {{mvar|θ}}, ''azimuth'' {{mvar|φ}}), where {{math|''r'' ∈ {{closed-open|0, ∞}}}}, {{math|''θ'' ∈ {{closed-closed|0, π}}}}, {{math|''φ'' ∈ {{closed-open|0, 2π}}}}, by:

&lt;!--***PLEASE do not swap theta and phi - check the conventions***--&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} x&amp;=r \, \sin\theta \, \cos\varphi \\ y&amp;=r \, \sin\theta \, \sin\varphi \\ z&amp;=r \, \cos\theta\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--***PLEASE do not swap theta and phi - check the conventions***--&gt;

=== Cylindrical coordinates ===

{{main|Cylindrical coordinate system}}
&lt;!-- if you notice--rho and r are described opposite of convention here--someone with extra time could remedy this --&gt;

[[cylindrical coordinate system|Cylindrical coordinates]] (''radius'' {{mvar|ρ}}, ''azimuth'' &lt;!--radians--&gt; {{mvar|φ}}, ''elevation'' {{mvar|z}}) may be converted into spherical coordinates (''radius'' {{mvar|r}}, ''inclination'' {{mvar|θ}}, ''azimuth'' {{mvar|φ}}), by the formulas

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} r&amp;=\sqrt{\rho^2 + z^2} \\ \theta&amp;=\arctan\frac{\rho}{z}=\arccos\frac{z}{\sqrt{\rho^2 + z^2}} \\ \varphi&amp;=\varphi \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, the spherical coordinates may be converted into cylindrical coordinates by the formulae

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \rho &amp;= r \sin \theta \\ \varphi &amp;= \varphi \\ z &amp;= r \cos \theta \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These formulae assume that the two systems have the same origin and same reference plane, measure the azimuth angle {{mvar|φ}} in the same sense from the same axis, and that the spherical angle {{mvar|θ}} is inclination from the cylindrical {{mvar|z}}-axis.

== Integration and differentiation in spherical coordinates ==

The following equations assume that {{mvar|θ}} is inclination from the {{mvar|z}} (polar) axis (ambiguous since {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are mutually normal):

The [[line element]] for an infinitesimal displacement from {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} to {{math|(''r'' + d''r'', ''θ'' + d''θ'', ''φ'' + d''φ'')}} is

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} = \mathrm{d}r\,\hat{\mathbf r} + r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\hat{\boldsymbol\theta } + r \sin{\theta} \, \mathrm{d}\varphi\,\mathbf{\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}}.&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hat{\mathbf r}
&amp;=\sin \theta \cos \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf x} +
\sin \theta \sin \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf y} +
\cos \theta \,\hat{\mathbf z}
\\[5px]
\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}
&amp;=\cos \theta \cos \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf x} +
\cos \theta \sin \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf y}
-\sin \theta \,\hat{\mathbf z}
\\[5px]
\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}
&amp;=-\sin \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf x}
+ \cos \varphi \,\hat{\mathbf y}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
are the local orthogonal [[unit vectors]] in the directions of increasing {{mvar|r}}, {{mvar|θ}}, and {{mvar|φ}}, respectively,
and {{math|'''x̂'''}}, {{math|'''ŷ'''}}, and {{math|'''ẑ'''}} are the unit vectors in Cartesian coordinates.


The general form of the formula to prove the differential line element, is &lt;ref&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/line-element-dl-in-spherical-coordinates-derivation-diagram/74503#74503&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}=\sum_i\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial x_i}\mathrm{dx_i}=\sum_i \left|\frac{\partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i}\right| \frac{\frac{\partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i} }
{\left|\frac{ \partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i}\right|} \mathrm{dx_i}=\sum_i \left| \frac{\partial \mathbf{r} }{\partial x_i} \right| \mathrm{dx_i}\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_i
&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the change in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; is decomposed into individual changes corresponding to changes in the individual coordinates. To apply this to the present case, you need to calculate how &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; changes with each of the coordinates. With the conventions being used, we have

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{r}=\begin{bmatrix}r\sin\theta\cos\phi\\ r\sin\theta\sin\phi\\ r\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial r}=\begin{bmatrix}\sin\theta\cos\phi \\ \sin\theta\sin\phi \\ \cos\theta\end{bmatrix} \,,
\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \theta}=\begin{bmatrix}r\cos\theta\cos\phi \\ r\cos\theta\sin\phi \\ -r\sin\theta\end{bmatrix} \,,
\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \phi}=\begin{bmatrix}-r\sin\theta\sin\phi \\ r\sin\theta\cos\phi \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the desired coefficients are the magnitudes of these vectors:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial r}\right| = 1 \\
\left| \frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \theta}\right| = r \\
\left| \frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial \phi}\right| = r\sin\theta \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/line-element-dl-in-spherical-coordinates-derivation-diagram/74503#74503&lt;/ref&gt;


The [[Surface integral|surface element]] spanning from {{mvar|θ}} to {{math|''θ'' + d''θ''}} and {{mvar|φ}} to {{math|''φ'' + d''φ''}} on a spherical surface at (constant) radius {{mvar|r}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S_r=\left\|{\partial r\hat{\mathbf r} \over \partial \theta}\times {\partial r\hat{\mathbf r} \over \partial \varphi}\right\|\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi=r^2\sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the differential [[solid angle]] is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Omega=\frac{\mathrm{d}S_r}{r^2}=\sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

The surface element in a surface of polar angle {{mvar|θ}} constant (a cone with vertex the origin) is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S_\theta=r \sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi\,\mathrm{d}r.&lt;/math&gt;

The surface element in a surface of azimuth {{mvar|φ}} constant (a vertical half-plane) is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S_\varphi=r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[volume element]] spanning from {{mvar|r}} to {{math|''r'' + d''r''}}, {{mvar|θ}} to {{math|''θ'' + d''θ''}}, and {{mvar|φ}} to {{math|''φ'' + d''φ''}} is  ([[determinant]] of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[Partial derivative|partial derivatives]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}V =  \left |\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial (r,\theta,\phi)}\right| 
= r^2 \sin \theta \,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi = r^2 \, \mathrm{d}r \, \mathrm{d}\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example, a function {{math|''f''(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}} can be integrated over every point in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[Multiple integral#Spherical coordinates|triple integral]]

: &lt;math&gt;\ \int\limits_{\varphi=0}^{2 \pi}\ \int\limits_{\theta=0}^{\pi}\ \int\limits_{r=0}^{\infty} f(r,\theta,\varphi) r^2 \sin \theta \,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[del]] operator in this system leads to the following expressions for [[gradient]], [[divergence]], [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and [[Laplacian]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla f = {} &amp;{\partial f \over \partial r}\hat{\mathbf r}
  + {1 \over r}{\partial f \over \partial \theta}\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}
  + {1 \over r\sin\theta}{\partial f \over \partial \varphi}\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}, \\[8pt]
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} = {} &amp; \frac{1}{r^2}{\partial \over \partial r}\left( r^2 A_r \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta}{\partial \over \partial\theta} \left( \sin\theta A_\theta \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} {\partial A_\varphi \over \partial \varphi}, \\[8pt]

== Kinematics ==

In spherical coordinates the position of a point is written

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r \mathbf{\hat r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its velocity is then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \dot{r} \mathbf{\hat r} + r\,\dot\theta\,\hat{\boldsymbol\theta } + r\,\dot\varphi \sin\theta\,\mathbf{\hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}},&lt;/math&gt;

and its acceleration is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{a} &amp; = \left( \ddot{r} - r\,\dot\theta^2 - r\,\dot\varphi^2\sin^2\theta \right)\mathbf{\hat r} \\
&amp; {} + \left( r\,\ddot\theta + 2\dot{r}\,\dot\theta - r\,\dot\varphi^2\sin\theta\cos\theta \right) \hat{\boldsymbol\theta } \\
&amp; {} + \left( r\ddot\varphi\,\sin\theta + 2\dot{r}\,\dot\varphi\,\sin\theta + 2 r\,\dot\theta\,\dot\varphi\,\cos\theta \right) \hat{\boldsymbol\varphi}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Manufacturing==
In the Kraft Process, high [[alkalinity]] and [[temperature]] converts the esters and carboxylic acids in [[rosin]] into soluble sodium [[soap]]s of [[lignin]], rosin, and [[fatty acid]]s. The spent cooking liquor is called weak [[black liquor]] and is about 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a [[Evaporator#Multiple-effect evaporators|multiple effect evaporator]] and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20–30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor. Normally the soaps start to [[Flotation process|float]] in the storage tank for the weak or intermediate liquors and are [[Skimmer (machine)|skimmed]] off and collected. A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2–0.4% w/w of the dry residue. The collected soap is called ''raw rosin soap'' or ''rosinate''. The raw rosin soap is then allowed to [[Settling|settle]] or is [[centrifuge]]d to release as much as possible of the entrained black liquor. The soap goes then to the ''acidulator'' where it is heated and [[acidified]] with [[sulfuric acid]] to produce ''crude tall oil'' (CTO).

The soap skimming and acidulator operation can be improved by addition of [[flocculant]]s. A flocculant will shorten the separation time and give a cleaner soap with lower viscosity. This makes the acidulator run smoother as well.

Most pines give a soap yield of 5–25&amp;nbsp;kg/ton pulp, while [[Scots pine]] gives 20–50&amp;nbsp;kg/ton. Scots pine grown in northern Scandinavia give a yield of even more than 50&amp;nbsp;kg/ton. Globally about 2 mill ton/year of CTO are refined.&lt;ref name="gull"/&gt;

==Composition==
{{see also|Resin acid}}
The composition of crude tall oil varies a great deal, depending on the type of wood used. A common quality measure for tall oil is [[acid number]]. With pure [[pine]]s it is possible to have acid numbers in the range 160–165, while mills using a mix of [[softwood]]s and [[hardwood]]s might give acid numbers in the range of 125–135.&lt;ref name="gull" /&gt;

Normally crude tall oil contains [[rosin]]s (which contains [[resin acid]]s (mainly [[abietic acid]] and its [[isomer]]s), [[fatty acid]]s (mainly [[palmitic acid]], [[oleic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]]) and [[fatty alcohol]]s, [[unsaponifiable]] [[sterol]]s (5–10%), some [[sterol]]s, and other [[alkyl]] [[hydrocarbon]] derivates.&lt;ref name="bier" /&gt;

By [[fractional distillation]] ''tall oil rosin'' is obtained, with rosin content reduced to 10–35%. By further reduction of the rosin content to 1–10%, ''tall oil fatty acid'' (''TOFA'') can be obtained, which is cheap, consists mostly of [[oleic acid]], and is a source of volatile fatty acids.

==Applications==
The tall oil rosin finds use as a component of [[adhesive]]s, [[rubber]]s, and [[ink]]s, and as an [[emulsifier]]. The [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] is used as a [[binder (material)|binder]] in cement, an adhesive, and an [[emulsifier]] for [[asphalt]].

TOFA is a low-cost and [[vegetarian]] lifestyle-friendly alternative to [[tallow]] fatty acids for production of [[soap]]s and [[lubricant]]s. When esterified with [[pentaerythritol]], it is used as a compound of [[adhesive]]s and oil-based [[varnish]]es. When reacted with amines, polyamidoamines are produced which may be used as [[epoxy resin]] curing agents &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hexion.com/en-us/chemistry/epoxy-resins-curing-agents-modifiers/curing-agents/polyamides|title=Hexion Amidoamine epoxy curing agents|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Tall oil is also used in oil drilling as a component of [[drilling fluid]]s.

'''''Thurman v. City of Torrington''''', [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|DC]], 595 F.Supp. 1521 (1985) was a court decision concerning Tracey Thurman, a [[Connecticut]] homemaker who sued the city police department in [[Torrington, Connecticut]], claiming a failure of [[Civil and political rights|equal protection under the law]] against her abusive husband Charles "Buck" Thurman, Sr.

==Case==
After Tracey Thurman was attacked, stabbed, and nearly killed by her husband on June 10, 1983, a subsequent civil lawsuit judged that the local police had ignored growing signs of [[domestic violence]] and had casually dismissed [[restraining order]]s and other legal bars to keep Charles "Buck" Thurman, Sr. away from his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CHRIS PARKERRepublican-American |url=http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2008/06/08/news/doc484b2ed8d4eb7320766604.txt |title=No nonsense, no bitterness, better policing The Republican-American |publisher=Rep-am.com |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2011-09-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033306/http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2008/06/08/news/doc484b2ed8d4eb7320766604.txt |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this lawsuit, filed in 1984, Thurman was the first woman in America to sue a town and its police department for violating her civil rights, claiming the police had ignored the violence because she was married to the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic-violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded $2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic-violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Thurman lawsuit brought about sweeping national reform of domestic violence laws, including the "Thurman Law" (aka the Family Violence Prevention and Response Act) instituted in Connecticut in 1986, making domestic violence an automatically arrestable offense, even if the victim does not wish to press charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/thurmanexcerpt.html |title=Thurman v. City of Torrington |publisher=harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracey Thurman's story was later made into a 1989 television movie, entitled ''[[A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story]]'', starring [[Nancy McKeon]] as Tracey, [[Dale Midkiff]] as Buck, [[Bruce Weitz]] as Tracey's lawyer Burton Weinstein, and [[Philip Baker Hall]] as presiding Judge Blumenfeld.

The '''utility monster''' is a [[thought experiment]] in the study of [[ethics]] created by [[philosopher]] [[Robert Nozick]] in 1974 as a criticism of [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science &amp; Mathematics|date=March 20, 2015|publisher=AMF|isbn=9781329003422|edition=First|page=322|last1=Kennard|first1=Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The thought experiment==
A hypothetical being, which Nozick calls the ''utility monster,'' receives much more [[utility]] from each unit of a resource they consume than anyone else does. For instance, eating a [[cookie]] might bring only one unit of pleasure to an ordinary person but could bring 100 units of pleasure to a utility monster. If the utility monster can get so much pleasure from each unit of resources, it follows from utilitarianism that the distribution of resources should acknowledge this. If the utility monster existed, it would justify the mistreatment and perhaps annihilation of everyone else, according to the mandates of utilitarianism, because, for the utility monster, the pleasure they receive outweighs the suffering they may cause.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nozick writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters who get enormously greater sums of utility from any sacrifice of others than these others lose ... the theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed in the monster's maw, in order to increase total utility.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|last=Nozick|first=Robert|publisher=|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;This thought experiment attempts to show that utilitarianism is not actually [[egalitarian]], even though it appears to be at first glance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The experiment contends that there is no way of aggregating utility which can circumvent the conclusion that all units should be given to a utility monster, because every different system has a monster and defeating one utility monster creates another. For example, in [[Minimax#Maximin in philosophy|Rawls' maximin]] or [[Justice as Fairness#The Difference Principle|difference principle]], maximin sets a group's aggregate utility as that of the being with least utility. Thus, giving units to the utility monster fails to change the group's utility unless the utility monster has the least utility.{{Clarify|Which utility monster?|date=May 2014}} Even if the utility monster has the least utility, maximin would only prefer allocating units to the monster until it catches up with the member that has next-to-least utility. This would defeat the "happy" utility monster of average utility. But if the person who has the least utility gains only a tiny amount of utility from each unit of resources, they may never catch up with the next person, so they can similarly consume all of the resources in the world. It can be shown that all consequentialist systems based on maximizing a global function are subject to utility monsters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Robert Nozick, a twentieth century American philosopher, coined the term "utility monster" in response to Jeremy Bentham's philosophy of [[utilitarianism]]. Nozick proposed that accepting the theory of utilitarianism causes the necessary acceptance of the condition that some people would use this to justify exploitation of others. An individual (or specific group) would claim their entitlement to more "happy units" than they claim others deserve, and the others would consequently be left to receive fewer "happy units".

Nozick deems these exploiters "utility monsters" (and for ease of understanding, they might also be thought of as happiness hogs). Nozick poses utility monsters justify their greediness with the notion that, compared to others, they experience greater inequality or sadness in the world, and deserve more happy units to bridge this gap. People not part of the utility monster group (or not the utility monster individual themselves) are left with less happy units to be split among the members. Utility monsters state that the others are happier in the world to begin with, so they would not need those extra happy units to which they lay claim anyway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Social implications==

===Free speech===
The utility monster has been invoked in debates about [[free speech]]. Advocates for laws against [[hate speech]], [[flag-burning]], and [[blasphemy]] have been accused of becoming utility monsters in order to increase society's willingness to support their policies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa652.pdf|title=Attack of the Utility Monsters: The New Threats to Free Speech|last=Kuznicki|first=Jason|date=November 16, 2009|website=Cato Institute|publisher=Cato Institute|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
The utility monster has been invoked in debates about population. [[Derek Parfit]]'s [[mere addition paradox]] suggests that additional humans would add to total happiness, even if expanding population decreases average happiness. Opposite reasoning yields the "[[repugnant conclusion]]" that the world would be better off with one extremely happy person. Parfit suggests that Nozick's utility monster is misleading because it appeals to our intuitions about a being which experiences more than a million times the utility of a very well-off ordinary person, which is, he thinks, inconceivable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek Parfit]], "[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/PHIL4260/Parfit%20-%20'Overpopulation%20and%20the%20Quality%20of%20Life'.pdf Overpopulation and the quality of life]", in ''The Repugnant Conclusion'', J. Ryberg and T. Tännsjö, eds., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is a more common-sense continuous scale of happiness change, from great to nil, based on scarcity of units, the happiness increasing from an additional unit of resource only inversely proportional to the existing pool of units.

=== Relevance ===
The reason this can come to be, and the reason the utility monster is a condition of utilitarianism in effect, is because the philosophy necessarily begs the question of how to measure happiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A person can be in much grief, but there is no physical way to measure the lack of happiness they experience, and whether this is greater or less than a person who is enduring a different pain, like physical torture. Rephrased, this brings to light the question of which person is more deserving and which person is less deserving of happiness units based on life experiences. Individuals must take other's word regarding how much happiness they each possess, and the happiness they should therefore be able to lay claim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is a common idea among people that hurt individuals deserve compensation for their pain. Yet Nozick's utility monster would take advantage of this reward process, by proclaiming their pain is the greatest and most deserving of reward.

Jason Kuznicki argues the reverse is true. According to Kuznicki, this proposed justification negatively affects society, because people's demand for equal payment for life's pain creates these utility monsters. One such group he suggests comes in the form of people who seek political correctness. He states that these folks butcher other people's right to free speech, under the pretense that it causes their group (or their individual) pain. He states that it is unjustifiable that pain one causes another is greater than someone else's. He thus provides the example of censorship, where if one person finds a certain censorship offensive, while others do not, who's to say that the offended person's hurt is worthy of a law of censorship of that material to be created?&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Specifically, "''If 'feelings of upset' are to be taken into account in shaping our laws, why do my feelings, and the feelings of other libertarians, always count for nothing?''"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the American military domain, the term "violent extremist organizations" or VEO is now used. The [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration defines VEO as groups of "individuals who support or commit ideologically motivated violence to further political goals".&lt;ref&gt;The White House, ''Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Office of the President, 2011), available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/sipfinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These groups include both ideologically-motivated international terrorist organizations (ITO) and homegrown violent extremists (HVE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raugh|first=David|date=June 2016|title=Is the Hybrid Threat a True Threat?|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss2/2|journal=Journal of Strategic Security|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–13|doi=10.5038/1944-0472.9.2.1507|issn=1944-0464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single profile or pathway for radicalization, or even speed at which it happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Lynn|title=Educating against Extremism: Towards a Critical Politicisation of Young People|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ830767|journal=International Review of Education|language=en|volume=55|pages=183–203|doi=10.1007/s11159-008-9126-8|issn=0020-8566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does the level of education seem to be a reliable predictor of vulnerability to radicalization. It is however established that there are [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and institutional factors that lead to violent extremism. Specialists group these factors into three main categories, push factors, pull factors and contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA929.pdf|title=USAID Summary of Factors Effecting Violent Extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=USAID|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://apo.org.au/resource/countering-violent-extremism-developing-evidence-base-policy-and-practice|title=Countering violent extremism: developing an evidence-base for policy and practice|last=Younis|first=Sara Zeiger, Anne Aly, Peter R.

=== Push factors ===
“Push Factors” drive individuals to violent extremism, such as: [[marginalization]], inequality, [[discrimination]], [[persecution]] or the perception thereof; limited access to quality and relevant education; the denial of rights and civil liberties; and other environmental, historical and [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] grievances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pull factors ===
“Pull Factors” nurture the appeal of violent extremism, for example: the existence of well-organized violent extremist groups with compelling discourses and effective programmes that are providing services, revenue and/or employment in exchange for membership. Groups can also lure new members by providing outlets for grievances and promise of adventure and freedom. Furthermore, these groups appear to offer spiritual comfort, “a place to belong” and a supportive social network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Contextual factors ===
Contextual factors that provide a favourable terrain to the emergence of violent extremist groups, such as: fragile states, the lack of [[rule of law]], [[corruption]] and [[Crime|criminality]].

The following behaviours in combination have been identified as signs of potential radicalization:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stop-djihadisme.gouv.fr/|title=Stop-Djihadisme|website=Stop-Djihadisme|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sudden break with the family and long-standing friendships.
* Sudden drop-out of school and conflicts with the school.
* Change in behaviour relating to food, clothing, language or finances.
* Changes in attitudes and behaviour towards others: antisocial comments, rejection of authority, refusal to interact socially, signs of withdrawal and isolation.
* Regular viewing of internet sites and participation in social media networks that condone radical or extremist views.
* Reference to apocalyptic and conspiracy theories.

== Prevention of radicalisation and deradicalisation ==

=== Education ===
[[File:Key dimensions of preventing Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Key dimensions of preventing violent extremism]]
The role of [[education]] in preventing violent extremism and de-radicalizing young people has only recently gained global acceptance. An important step in this direction was the launch, in December 2015, of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]]’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism which recognizes the importance of quality education to address the drivers of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/ctc/docs/2015/SCR%202178_2014_EN.pdf|title=Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. Report of the Secretary-General|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council]] also emphasized this point in its Resolutions 2178 and 2250, which notably highlights the need for “quality education for peace that equips youth with the ability to engage constructively in civic structures and inclusive political processes” and called on “ all relevant actors to consider instituting mechanisms to promote a culture of peace, tolerance, intercultural and interreligious dialogue that involve youth and discourage their participation in acts of violence, terrorism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unoy.org/wp-content/uploads/SCR-2250.pdf|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2250, adopted in December 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has been identified as preventing radicalisation through:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Developing the [[communication]] and [[interpersonal skills]] they need to dialogue, face [[disagreement]] and learn peaceful approaches to change.
* Developing [[critical thinking]] to investigate claims, verify [[Rumor|rumours]] and question the legitimacy and appeal of extremist beliefs.
* Developing resilience to resist extremist narratives and acquire the social-emotional skills they need to overcome their doubts and engage constructively in society without having to resort to violence.
* Fostering critically informed citizens able to constructively engage in peaceful collective action.

[[UNESCO]] has emphasised [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as an emerging approach to education that focuses on developing learners’ knowledge, skills, values and attitudes in view of their active participation in the peaceful and sustainable development of their societies. GCED aims to instill respect for [[human rights]], [[social justice]], [[gender equality]] and [[environmental sustainability]], which are fundamental values that help raise the defences of peace against violent extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global  Citizenship Education – Topics and Learning Objectives|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002277/227729e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education - Preparing learners for the challenges of the twenty-first century|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sabaoon Project, Pakistan ===
[[File:Sabaoons deradicalisation Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Sabaoon’s deradicalisation and rehabilitation model]]
The Sabaoon Project, initiated by the [[Pakistan Army]] and run by the Social Welfare Academics and Training organization (SWAaT) since 2009, has been implemented to deradicalize and rehabilitate former militant youth who were involved in violent extremist activities and apprehended by the army in [[Swat District|Swat]] and the surrounding areas in Pakistan. Based on an individualized approach and intervention, the project follows a three-step model (see image).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247764e.pdf|title=Preventing violent extremism through education: A guide for policy makers|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100215-1|location=|pages=24, 36, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kenya’s initiatives to address radicalization of youth in educational institutions ===
To tackle the issue of violent extremism and radicalization in schools, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Kenya launched a new national strategy targeting youth in 2014, entitled Initiatives to Address Radicalization of the Youth in Educational Institutions in the Republic of Kenya. The Strategy adopted measures that service the students’ interests and well-being. For example, it includes efforts to create child-friendly school environments and encourages students to participate in “talent academies” to pursue an area of their own interest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Strategy also includes the discontinuation of ranking schools based on academic performance. This was to lessen the overemphasis on examinations and to reduce student pressure, incorporating other indicators of student achievement, such as abilities in sport and artistic talent. The purpose is to reduce the stress of students’ lives at home and in school that may be vented through escape tactics, including joining outlawed groups. The Strategy also employs other effective means to prevent violent extremism, including the integration of Preventing of Violent Extremism through Education (PVE-E) in curricula and school programmes; adopting a multi- sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach; encouraging student participation through student governance processes and peer-to-peer education; and the involvement of media as a stakeholder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender disparity ==
While it is being increasingly reported that women play an active role in violent extremist organizations and attacks as assailants and supporters, men are still more often the perpetrators of violent extremist acts and therefore the targets of recruitment campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;B.

In Buddhism, '''''vitarka''''' (Sanskrit, also ''vitarkah''; Pali: ''vitakka''; Tibetan phonetic: ''tokpa''), "applied thought," "attention," and '''''vicara''''', (Sanskrit( विचार) and Pali; also ''vicāra''; Tibetan phonetic: ''chöpa'') "discernment," "sustained thinking," are qualities or elements of the first ''dhyana''. While the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] commentarial tradition interprets ''vitarka'' and ''vicara'' as the initial and sustainted application of attention to a meditational object, they may be one expression referring to "the normal process of discursive thought," which is supprssed by concentration in the second ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=82}}{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}}

==Etymology==
''Vitarka'' ([[Sanskrit]]: वितर्क ), "thoughts,"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} "applied thought,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Visuddhimagga]] ( IV, 88)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} "applied attention."{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} it's roots are:
* वि ''vi'', a prefix to verbs and nouns it expresses;
* तर्क ''tarka'', "reasoning, inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95&amp;direct=au ''tarka'']&lt;/ref&gt;
''Vitarka'' may refer to mental activities that are manifest both in normal consciousness and in the first stage of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} In general, it means "thought," "applied thought," or "distracted thoughts."{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, "In the Suttas, the word Vittaka is often used in the loose sense of thought, but in the Abhidhamma it is used in a precise technical sense to mean the mental factor that mounts or directs the mind towards an object."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}}

''Vicara'', also ''Vichāra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विचार) means "deliberation." Its roots are:
* वि ''vi'', a prefix to verbs and nouns it expresses;
* चर् ''cara'', to move, roam, obtain knowledge of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries Of South Asia|page=1422|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vitarka'' investigates things roughly, while ''[[vicara]]'' investigates things exactly.{{sfn|Rhys-Davids|Stede1921-25}}{{sfn|Guenther|Kawamura|1975|p=Kindle Locations 1030-1033}}{{sfn|Kunsang|2004|p=30}}{{sfn|Berzin|2006}}

==First ''dhyana''==
''Vitarka'' and ''vicara'' are two of the qualities or elements of the first [[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]] (Pali: jhana), which are absent in the higher jhanas.{{sfn|Bucknell|1993}}{{sfn|Keown|2004|p=333}} 

In Theravada, ''vitarka'' is one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] (''cetasika'') that apprehend the quality of an object. It is the "initial application of attention"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} or the mind to its object,{{sfn|Keown|2004|p=333}}  while ''vicara'' is the sustained application of the mind on an object.{{sfn|Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}}

While initially simply referring to thought, which in present at the onset of ''dhyana'', the terms ''vitarka'' and ''vicara'' were re-interpreted by the developing Abhidharma and commentarial tradition. According to Roderick S.Bucknell, "''vitakka-vicara'', the factor that particularly characterizes the first jhana, is probably nothing other than the normal process of discursive thought, the familiar but usually unnoticed stream of mental imagery and verbalization."{{sfn|Bucknell|1993}}{{refn|group=note|Bucknell refers to:&lt;br&gt;* Martin Stuart-Fox, "Jhana and Buddhist Scholasticism," Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 12.2 (1989): 79-110&lt;br&gt;* Paul Griffiths, "Buddhist Jhana: A form-critical study," Religion 13 (1983): 55-68.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also Sujato, [https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/why-vitakka-doesnt-mean-thinking-in-jhana/ ''Why vitakka doesn’t mean ‘thinking’ in jhana'']}}

Martin Stuart Fox explains, referring to Rhys Davids and Stede, when ''vitarka-vicara'' are mentioned in tandem, they are one expression, "to cover ''all'' varieties of thinking, including sustained and focused thought. It is thinking in this inclusive sense that the meditator suppresses through concentration when he attains one-ness of mind and thus moves from first to second ''jhana''."{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=82}}

''Vitarka'' is also regarded in the Theravada-tradition as an anti-dote for ''[[thina-middha]]'' (sloth and torpor), one of the [[five hindrances]].{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}} According to Stuart-Fox, the Abhidhamma separated ''vitarka'' from ''vicara'', and ''ekagatta'' (onepointednes) was added to the description first ''dhyana'' to give an equal number of five hindrances and five anti-dotes.{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=85-87}} The commentarial tradition regards the qualities of the first ''dhyana'' to be antidotes to the five hindrances, and ''ekagatta'' may have been added to the first ''dhyana'' to give exactly five anti-dotes for the five hindrances.{{sfn|Fox|1989}} Stuart-Fox further notes that ''vitarka'', being discursive thought, will do very little as an anti-dote for sloth and torpor, reflecting the inconsistencies which were introduced by the scholastics.{{sfn|Fox|1989}}

==Vitarka Mudrā==
The ''Vitarka mudrā'', "mudra of discussion," expresses ''vitarka,'' joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, and keeping the other fingers straight. This mudra has a great number of variants in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], and is also known as ''{{IAST|Prajñāliṅganabhinaya}}'' and ''Vyākhyāna mudrā'' ("mudra of explanation").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Wholistic reference''' is reference to the whole—with respect to the context. In its strongest, unqualified form, '''the principle of wholistic reference''' is the [[proposition]] that each and every proposition, regardless how limited the referents of its [[non-logical symbol|non-logical]] or content terms, refers to the whole of its [[universe of discourse]]. According to this principle every proposition of [[number theory]], even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers not only to the individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers.  The relation verb ‘refers’ is being used in its broad sense (loosely “is about”) and not as a synonym for ‘names’ in the sense of “is a name of”.

[[George Boole]] (1815–1864) introduced this principle into modern logic: Even though he changed from a monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|Corcoran, John]], and [[José Miguel Sagüillo|Sagüillo, José Miguel]], 2011. “The Absence of Multiple Universes of Discourse in the 1936 Tarski Consequence-Definition Paper”, ''History and Philosophy of Logic'' 32: 359–80.&lt;/ref&gt; he never wavered in his frank avowal of the principle of wholistic reference.  Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity – or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically – was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. ''The Laws of Thought.'' Facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in ''Philosophy in Review'' 24 (2004): 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt; One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first in the history of the English language. See the next section.

Similar views, perhaps not similarly motivated, are found in later logicians, including [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925).  Some recent formulations of standard one-sorted first-order logic seem to be in accord with a form of it, if they do not actually imply the principle itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|Corcoran, John]]. Principle of Wholistic Reference. ''Manuscrito'' 27 (2004): 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boole’s 1854 definition==
{{Quote|text=
In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse. |author=[[George Boole]]|source=&lt;ref&gt;Page 42: [[George Boole]]. 1854/2003.
