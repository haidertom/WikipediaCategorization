'''Asadollah Asgaroladi''' is a [[business magnate]] in [[Iran]] with business interests in [[export]]s, [[banking]], [[real estate]] and [[healthcare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trevorloudon.com/2007/08/who-is-asadollah-asgaroladi/ |title=Who is Asadolla Asgar-Oladi |publisher=trevorloudon |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the richest person in Iran, with a net worth of $9 billion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Asadollah Asgar-Oladi Criticizes Government’s Economic Policies|url=http://parsherald.com/asadollah-asgar-oladi-criticizes-governments-economic-policies/824/|website=Pars Herald|accessdate=4 January 2018|date=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Asgaroladi was born to a merchant family. His ancestors converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sad Fate of Iran's Jews|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/sad-fate-iran%E2%80%99s-jews|website=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|accessdate=4 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klebnikov|first1=Paul|title=Millionaire Mullahs|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0721/056.html|website=Forbes|accessdate=4 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=מנהיגים ואנשי שם ממוצא איראני|url=http://www.kosherdelight.com/Iranleaders.htm|website=www.kosherdelight.com|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Insider's View: Iran Ready to Do Business with the West|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2012/06/media-watch-an-insiders-view-iran-ready-to-do-business-with-the-west.html|website=FRONTLINE - Tehran Bureau|accessdate=4 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Jews of Persia &amp; the Arabian Peninsula genealogy project|url=http://www.geni.com/projects/Notable-Jews-of-Persia-the-Arabian-Peninsula/13198|website=geni_family_tree|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asgaroladi is amongst the world's wealthiest Iranians, and was named the third richest Iranian in the world and is the second wealthiest in Iran, with an estimated wealth in excess of $9 billion.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; His business empire dates back to the 1970s and, since then, Asgaroladi has become one of the leading exporters of [[dried fruit]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s and [[spice]]s from Iran. Asgaroladi is the president of Hasas Co. which is the leading exporter of nuts and pistachios from Iran since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hassas Export Company|url=http://www.hasasco.com/about_us|website=www.hasasco.com|accessdate=4 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asgaroladi increased his wealth dramatically in the 90's when there were two official exchange rates for the US dollar. Those with trade license could obtain the lower exchange rate of 1750 rials but the market value of US dollars was at 8000 rials. During this period his brother [[Habibollah Asgaroladi]] was the commerce minister responsible for handing out trade licenses to obtain the lower exchange rate. He used his connections to obtain large quantities of US dollars at low exchange rate and resold them at the market value price for a profit of more than 300%.&lt;ref&gt;Saints and Sinners, Ali Mahmood, 2013, HarperCollins Publishers India, page 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asgaroladi is a well known member of the Iranian business community (his brother was [[Ministry of Commerce (Iran)|Minister of Commerce]] for many years) and he currently holds the Presidency of several international Chambers of Commerce including the Iran-[[China]], Iran-[[Australia]], Iran-[[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://service.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/437716.html |title=Caspian Chambers of Commerce Meet &amp;#124; Business &amp;#124; The Moscow Times |publisher=Service.themoscowtimes.com |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827013421/http://service.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/437716.html |archivedate=2011-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iran-[[Canada]] [[Chambers of Commerce]].

Asgaroladi has been reported as being in negotiations to purchase [[Iran Air]] / "Homa", Iran's heavily national carrier and has been quoted in media sources as wishing to acquire the [[Iran International Exhibitions Company|Tehran International Trade and Exhibition Centre]], a vast conference and exhibition centre in northern Tehran. He also owns a majority stake in three retail Chinese banks. Asgaroladi has on numerous occasions proposed setting up an Iran-China bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/11/apr/1215.html |title=Iran, China to form joint oil, gas committee |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Glynn Henry''' (1926 – 2003) was a powerful figure in TV and newspaper advertising in the UK in the 1950 and 1960s.

== Early life ==

Brian Glynn Henry was born in February 1926 in [[Liverpool]] and  was educated at [[Stowe School]] under JF Roxburgh from September 1940 to April 1944 where he obtained School and Higher Certificates, and later at [[Trinity College Cambridge]] where he obtained an Honours Degree in English.

During the [[World War II]] Brian Henry served in the [[Navy]]. First as a rating in home waters, and later, after he was commissioned, as a Sub-Lieutenant, [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve|RNVR]], in the Far East including eight months service as First Lieutenant from 1943 to 1947 in the 273rd Infantry [[Landing Craft]] Flotilla.

In 1946, aged 20, he navigated one of HM ships over 10,000 miles from Plymouth to the Philippines. Later, from February to September 1948, Henry served under Lieutenant-Commander HGV Meller, Assistant Secretary to the Commander in Chief of the Home Fleet.

He returned to Cambridge to complete his course and then took his first jobs as a temporary assistant in London University Library, St Marylebone Borough Library in London and at [[AC Nielsen]] Marketing Research Organisation in Oxford.

== Media career ==

In February 1949 Brian Henry was offered a job in the Advertisement Department of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'', London’s leading evening paper, selling space for Classified Advertisements at a wage of £7 per week. It was a career he took to immediately. He wrote to the Secretary of the [[Cambridge University]] Appointments Board in May 1949:

“It seems strange that I should have been looking for almost any job in which selling was not required and then should have found this one so much to my liking. In actual fact, what I am doing now is selling, and, moreover, selling the most difficult commodity of all, namely, advertising space. To my surprise it suits me splendidly, which goes to show, I suppose, that you never know what you can do until you try”.

In May 1949 he was transferred to display advertising, where he took over responsibility for all client work in the area of TV, radio, electrical as well as advertising agencies and publishers. Within two years, aged 25, he had become the youngest Advertisement Manager in Fleet Street with 65 people under his control.

In May 1955 he achieved the papers highest ever advertisement revenue (over £2,000,000). He was being paid £1,560 pa. In 1956 he entered the TV industry almost 1 year after the launch of [[ITV Network|ITV]] in September 1955. It was a seminal time for the TV and advertising industries. Under 1 million people had TV sets, and broadcasts were limited to specific areas of the country in black and white, and for under 30 hours a week.

BG Henry became Controller of Advertisements at [[Associated-Rediffusion]] Ltd, the London weekday station, and the largest and most important television company in the ITV network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/40-years-of-history-broadcast-1959-1999-in-the-beginning-/1225399.article&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four years the industry expanded quickly as TV took off. By 1960 over 8 million homes had televisions and advertising on TV had become the most powerful media in the UK with over £1 million spent on advertising new products each week. Brian Henry was one of the most powerful men in the industry.

On 21 June 1961, after a year making a record breaking profit of £8,000,000 for Rediffusion, Brian Henry was invited by John Davis, chairman of the [[Rank Organisation]], to join the board of Southern Television. He remained at Southern TV until 1969 when he was invited by [[Marmaduke Hussey]] to join Lord Rothemere’s Harmsworth Publications Ltd (the national newspaper subsidiary of the [[Associated Newspapers]] Group), owners of the [[Daily Mail]]. His salary was £13,500 pa, he had annual expenses of £1,500, a full-time secretary, chauffeur, houses in [[Eaton Square]] and in Chilbolton Hampshire, a [[Rambler Ambassador]] and various other perks.

However the move was not successful. Duke Hussey left Associated Newspapers in 1970 and was replaced by Mick Shields amid a backdrop of lost revenues and strikes. Speculation followed concerning the closure of the papers. On 8 March 1971 the Daily Sketch closed with the loss of 1,700 people. In the re-organisation Brian Henry became Director of Marketing and successfully launched the new ‘tabloid’ [[Daily Mail]] before resigning in December 1971 to re-join [[Southern TV]].

He remained at Southern TV until the station lost its license to TVS in 1980. In 1984 Brian Henry completed work on his book 
"British Television Advertising: The First 30 Years", which has since become a popular reference for modern media historians.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/British-Television-Advertising-First-Years/dp/0091658004&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Henry was a Fellow of The Institute of Marketing, The Chairman of The Oxford Playhouse, Trustee of the Bournemough Symphony Orchestra, Founder and Chairman of the Cambridge Society (Berks Branch), Vice Chairman of the Campaign for Rural England and for 36 years he was Governor of Bournemouth &amp; Poole College of Art and Design.

== Personal life ==

Brian Glynn Henry was one of two sons Glynn Henry (1893–1979), a senior executive and director of healthcare company [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], and later [[Beechams]], from 1929 to 1949. Glynn Henry was well known in [[Cookham]] Berkshire during the 1950s and 1969s where he owned the chemist shop on the High Street for over twenty years, 'The Old Apothecary'. The artist [[Stanley Spencer]] was a famous client of the shop. Brian Henry's brother Hugh Henry became director of Scottish Television.

Brian Henry was married twice, firstly to Elizabeth Craig and later to Jan Barney, and had four children, Susan, Louise, Julian and Deborah.

'''''Bloodline''''' is a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] picture released in 1979. Based upon the novel ''[[Bloodline (Sheldon novel)|Bloodline]]'' by [[Sidney Sheldon]], it was produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] and directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] with music by [[Ennio Morricone]]. The film was also released under the title ''Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline''. It was the only [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film to star [[Audrey Hepburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/29/archives/film-audrey-hepburn-in-bloodline-international-intrigue.html|title=Film: Atidtey Hepburn in ‘Bloodline’|date=1979-06-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Sam Roffe, President of Roffe &amp; Sons Pharmaceuticals, dies in what appears to be a climbing accident, leaving his daughter Elizabeth ([[Audrey Hepburn]]) a billion-dollar empire. Roffe's board members see an opportunity to settle old scores, jockey for higher position, and reap lucrative profits. However, an investigation into Sam's death discloses that it was a murder and that a power struggle is going on within the company.

Lead investigator Max Hornung ([[Gert Fröbe]]) informs Elizabeth of his list of suspects, which includes her closest advisers and financially strapped family members. During this time, she marries CEO Rhys Williams ([[Ben Gazzara]]), but he, too, is identified by Hornung as a suspect. As president, Elizabeth follows her father's wishes and refuses to let shares of Roffe &amp; Sons sell on the world market. Her choice prevents the board members from selling their shares as the company's [[by-law]]s prohibit it until all board members agree; on the other hand, her death would allow for a unanimous decision.

After several attempts on her life, an international chase across Europe ensues. Hornung is able to connect these murder attempts to a series of homicides of prostitutes, which have been recorded on [[snuff film]]s using Roffe film stock with a witness in a black Gucci leather coat (several suspects are linked to this coat).

Elizabeth returns to her father's villa in Sardinia during a scirocco for protection from the unseen murderer, who sets her house on fire after she begins destroying objects and shouting, "Now try to make it look like an accident!" Williams and one of the shareholders, Sir Alec Nichols ([[James Mason]]), both show up to save her, but Hornung figures out that Nichols is the killer and shoots him before he can murder Elizabeth in a symbolic snuff film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">'''Cathodic arc deposition''' or '''Arc-PVD''' is a [[physical vapor deposition]] technique in which an [[electric arc]] is used to [[vaporize]] material from a [[cathode]] target.  The vaporized material then condenses on a substrate, forming a [[thin film]]. The technique can be used to deposit [[metal]]lic, [[ceramic]], and [[Composite material|composite]] films.

==History==
Industrial use of modern cathodic arc deposition technology originated in [[Soviet Union]] around 1960–1970.
By the late 70's Soviet government released the use of this technology to the West. 
Among many designs in USSR at that time the design by [[L. P. Sablev]], et al., was allowed to be used outside the USSR.

==Process==
The arc evaporation process begins with the striking of a high [[Electric current|current]], low [[voltage]] arc on the surface of a [[cathode]] (known as the target) that gives rise to a small (usually a few [[micrometre]]s wide), highly energetic emitting area known as a cathode spot. The localised temperature at the cathode spot is extremely high (around 15000&amp;nbsp;°C), which results in a high [[velocity]] (10&amp;nbsp;km/s) jet of vapourised cathode material, leaving a crater behind on the cathode surface. The cathode spot is only active for a short period of time, then it self-extinguishes and re-ignites in a new area close to the previous crater. This behaviour causes the apparent motion of the arc.

As the arc is basically a current carrying conductor it can be influenced by the application of an [[electromagnetic field]], which in practice is used to rapidly move the arc over the entire surface of the target, so that the total surface is eroded over time.

The arc has an extremely high [[power density]] resulting in a high level of [[ionization]] (30-100%), multiple charged [[ions]], neutral particles, clusters and macro-particles (droplets). If a reactive gas is introduced during the evaporation process, [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], ionization and [[Excited state|excitation]] can occur during interaction with the [[ion flux]] and a compound film will be deposited.

One downside of the arc evaporation process is that if the cathode spot stays at an evaporative point for too long it can eject a large amount of macro-particles or droplets. These droplets are detrimental to the performance of the coating as they are poorly adhered and can extend through the coating. Worse still if the cathode target material has a low melting point such as [[aluminium]] the cathode spot can evaporate through the target resulting in either the target backing plate material being evaporated or cooling water entering the chamber. Therefore, magnetic fields as mentioned previously are used to control the motion of the arc. If cylindrical cathodes are used the cathodes can also be rotated during deposition. By not allowing the cathode spot to remain in one position too long aluminium targets can be used and the number of droplets is reduced. Some companies also use filtered arcs that use magnetic fields to separate the droplets from the coating flux.

==Equipment design==

[[File:ArcSource SablevType.jpg|thumb|right|Sablev type Cathodic arc source with magnet to steer the movement of arc spot]]

Sablev type Cathodic arc source, which is the most widely used in the West, consists of a short cylindrical shape electrical conductive target at cathode with one open end. This target has an electrically-floating metal ring surrounded working as an arc confinement ring (Strel'nitskij shield). The anode for the system can be either the vacuum chamber wall or a discrete anode. Arc spots are generated by mechanical trigger (or igniter) striking on open end of the target making a temporarily short circuit between the cathode and anode. After the arc spots being generated they can be steered by magnetic field or move randomly in absence of magnetic field.

[[File:AksenovQuaterTorusFilter.jpg|thumb|right|Aksenov Quarter-torus duct macroparticle filter using plasma optical principles which was developed by [[A. I. Morozov]]]]

The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] beam from Cathodic Arc source contains some larger clusters of atoms or molecules (so called macro-particles), which prevent it from being useful for some applications without some kind of filtering.
There are many designs for macro-particle filters and the most studied design is based on the work by I. I. Aksenov et al. in 70's. It consists of a quarter-torus duct bent at 90 degrees from the arc source and the plasma is guided out of the duct by principle of plasma optics.

There are also other interesting designs such as a design which incorporates a straight duct filter built-in with truncated cone shape cathode as reported by D. A. Karpov in the 90's. This design became quite popular among both the thin hard-film coaters and researchers in Russia and former USSR countries until now.
Cathodic arc source can be made into the long tubular shape (extended-arc) or long rectangular shape but both designs are less popular.

==Applications==

[[File:TiNCoatedPunches NanoShieldPVD Thailand.JPG|thumb|right|Titanium Nitride (TiN) coated punches using Cathodic arc deposition technique]]
[[File:AlTiNCoatedEndmill NanoShieldPVD Thailand.JPG|thumb|right|Aluminium Titanium Nitride (AlTiN) coated [[endmill]]s using Cathodic arc deposition technique]] 
[[File:AlCrTiN-CoatedHob NanoShieldPVD Thailand.jpg|thumb|right|Aluminium Chromium Titanium Nitride (AlCrTiN) coated [[Hobbing|Hob]] using Cathodic arc deposition technique]]

Cathodic arc deposition is actively used to synthesize extremely hard film to protect the surface of cutting tools and extend their life significantly.  A wide variety of thin hard-film, [[Superhard coatings]] and [[nanocomposite]] coatings can be synthesized by this technology including [[TiN]], [[TiAlN]], [[CrN]], [[ZrN]], [[AlCrTiN]] and [[TiAlSiN]].

This is also used quite extensively particularly for carbon ion deposition to create [[diamond-like carbon]] films. Because the ions are blasted from the surface [[Ballistics|ballistic]]ally, it is common for not only single atoms, but larger clusters of atoms to be ejected. Thus, this kind of system requires a filter to remove atom clusters  from the beam before deposition.
The DLC film from filtered-arc contains extremely high percentage of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; diamond which is known as [[tetrahedral amorphous carbon]], or [[ta-C]].

Filtered Cathodic arc can be used as metal ion/plasma source for ''[[Ion implantation]]'' and ''[[Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition]]'' (PIII&amp;D).

{{Strategy}}

'''Competitive intelligence''' ('''CI''') is the action of defining, gathering, analyzing, and distributing [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] about products, customers, [[competitor]]s, and any aspect of the environment needed to support executives and [[manager]]s in strategic [[decision making]] for an organization.

CI means understanding and learning what is happening in the world outside the business to increase one's [[competitivity]]. It means learning as much as possible, as soon as possible, about one's external environment including one's industry in general and relevant competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/competitive-intelligence |title=Competitive Intelligence Definition &amp;#124; Small Business Encyclopedia |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key points:
# Competitive intelligence is a legal business practice, as opposed to [[industrial espionage]], which is illegal.&lt;ref name="SCIP Code of Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title=SCIP Code of Ethics for CI Professionals|url=https://www.scip.org/CodeOfEthics.php|publisher=Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The focus is on the external business environment.&lt;ref name="Haag, 2006"&gt;Haag, Stephen. ''Management Information Systems for the Information Age''. Third Edition. McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is a process involved in gathering information, converting it into intelligence and then using it in decision making. Some CI professionals erroneously emphasise that if the intelligence gathered is not usable or actionable, it is not intelligence.&lt;ref name=mcgonagle&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGonagle|first1=John J. and Carolyn M. Vella|title=The Manager's Guide to Competitive Intelligence|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport CT|isbn=978-1567205718|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTVN4YubwVwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of CI regards it as the organizational function responsible for the early identification of [[risk management|risks]] and [[Opportunity management|opportunities]] in the market before they become ''obvious'' ("early signal analysis"). This definition focuses attention on the difference between dissemination of widely available factual information (such as [[market statistics]], [[financial report]]s, newspaper clippings) performed by functions such as libraries and information centers, and competitive intelligence which is a ''perspective'' on developments and events aimed at yielding a competitive edge.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben. "The Future of Competitive Intelligence: Contest for the Profession's Soul", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 2008, 11(5), 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CI is often viewed as synonymous with [[competitor analysis]], but competitive intelligence is more than analyzing competitors; it embraces the entire environment and stakeholders: customers, competitors, distributors, technologies, and macroeconomic data.

== Historic development ==
CI literature is best exemplified by the bibliographies that were published in the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]]' academic journal ''The Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management''.&lt;ref name="Dishman, Fleisher, &amp; Knip, 2003"&gt;Dishman, P., Fleisher, C. S., and V. Knip. "Chronological and Categorized Bibliography of Key Competitive Intelligence Scholarship: Part 1 (1997-2003), ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', 1(1), 16–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Wright &amp; Tindale, 2007"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S., Wright, Sheila, and R. Tindale. "Bibliography and Assessment of Key Competitive Intelligence Scholarship: Part 4 (2003–2006), ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', 2007, 4(1), 32–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S., Knip, Victor, and P. Dishman. "Bibliography and Assessment of Key Competitive Intelligence Scholarship: Part 2 (1990-1996), ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', 2003, 1(2), 11–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003"&gt;Knip, Victor, P. Dishman, and C.S. Fleisher. "Bibliography and Assessment of Key Competitive Intelligence Scholarship: Part 3 (The Earliest Writings-1989), ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', 2003, 1(3), 10–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Although elements of [[organizational intelligence]] collection have been a part of business for many years, the history of competitive intelligence arguably began in the U.S. in the 1970s, although the literature on the field pre-dates this time by at least several decades.&lt;ref name="Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003" /&gt; In 1980, [[Michael E. Porter|Michael Porter]] published the study ''Competitive-Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors'' which is widely viewed as the foundation of modern competitive intelligence. This has since been extended most notably by the pair of [[Craig Fleisher]] and [[Babette Bensoussan]], who through several popular books on competitive analysis have added 48 commonly applied competitive intelligence analysis techniques to the practitioner's tool box.&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. and Babette E. Bensoussan. ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis: Methods and Techniques for Analyzing Business Competition''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2007"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. and Babette E. Bensoussan. Business and Competitive Analysis: Effective Application of New and Classic Methods, FT Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Leonard Fuld published his best selling book dedicated to competitor intelligence.&lt;ref name="Fuld, 1985"&gt;Fuld, Leonard M., ''Competitor Intelligence: How to Get It, How to Use It''. NY: Wiley, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the institutionalization of CI as a formal activity among American corporations can be traced to 1988, when Ben and Tamar Gilad published the first organizational model of a formal corporate CI function, which was then adopted widely by US companies.&lt;ref name="Gilad &amp; Gilad, 1988"&gt;Gilad, [[Benjamin Gilad]] and Tamar Gilad. ''The Business Intelligence System''. NY: American Management Association, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional certification program (CIP) was created in 1996 with the establishment of The [[Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.

In 1986 the ''Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals'' (SCIP) was founded in the United States and grew in the late 1990s to around 6,000 members worldwide, mainly in the United States and Canada, but with large numbers especially in the UK and Australia. Due to financial difficulties in 2009, the organization merged with Frost &amp; Sullivan under the Frost &amp; Sullivan Institute. SCIP has since been renamed "Strategic &amp; Competitive Intelligence Professionals" to emphasise the strategic nature of the subject, and also to refocus the organisation's general approach, while keeping the existing SCIP brandname and logo. A number of efforts have been made to discuss the field's advances in post-secondary (university) education, covered by several authors including Blenkhorn &amp; Fleisher,&lt;ref name="Blenkhorn &amp; Fleisher, 2003"&gt;Blenkhorn, D. and C. S. Fleisher (2003). "Teaching CI to three diverse groups: Undergraduates, MBAs, and Executives", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 6(4), 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleisher,&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Education, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, C. S. (2003). "Competitive Intelligence Education: Competencies, Sources and Trends," ''Information Management Journal'', March/April, 56–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuld,&lt;ref&gt;Fuld, 2006{{Specify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott,&lt;ref name="Prescott, 1999"&gt;Prescott, J. (1999). "Debunking the Academic Abstinence Myth of Competitive Intelligence", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 2(4).&lt;/ref&gt; and McGonagle.&lt;ref name="McGonagle, 2003"&gt;McGonagle, J. (2003). "Bibliography: Education in CI," ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 6(4), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the general view would be that competitive intelligence concepts can be readily found and taught in many business schools around the globe, there are still relatively few dedicated academic programs, majors, or degrees in the field, a concern to academics in the field who would like to see it further researched.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Education, 2003" /&gt; These issues were widely discussed by over a dozen knowledgeable individuals in a special edition of the Competitive Intelligence Magazine that was dedicated to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;(Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 2003, 6(4), July/August)&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a Specialized Master in Economic Intelligence and Knowledge Management was created in 1995 within the CERAM Business School, now [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926132909/http://www.skema-bs.fr/faculte-recherche/centre-intelligence-economique-et-influence SKEMA Business School], in Paris, with the objective of delivering a full and professional training in Economic Intelligence. A Centre for Global Intelligence and Influence was created in September 2011 in the same School.

On the other hand, practitioners and companies regard professional accreditation as especially important in this field.&lt;ref name="Gilad and Herring, 2001"&gt;Gilad, Ben and Jan Herring. "CI Certification - Do We Need It?", Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 2001, 4(2), 28-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, SCIP recognized the [[Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence]]'s CIP certification process as its global, dual-level (CIP-I and CIP-II) certification program.

Global developments have also been uneven in competitive intelligence.&lt;ref name="Blenkhorn &amp; Fleisher, 2005"&gt;Blenkhorn, D. and C.S. Fleisher. Competitive Intelligence and Global Business. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Several academic journals, particularly the ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'' in its third volume, provided coverage of the field's global development.&lt;ref&gt;(''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', volume 2, numbers 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1997 the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|École de guerre économique|fr}} (''School of economic warfare'') was founded in Paris, [[France]]. It is the first European institution which teaches the tactics of economic warfare within a globalizing world. In [[Germany]], competitive intelligence was unattended until the early 1990s. The term "competitive intelligence" first appeared in German literature in 1997. In 1995 a German SCIP chapter was founded, which is now second in terms of membership in Europe. In summer 2004 the Institute for Competitive Intelligence was founded, which provides a postgraduate certification program for Competitive Intelligence Professionals. [[Japan]] is currently the only country that officially maintains an economic intelligence agency ([[JETRO]]). It was founded by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ([[MITI]]) in 1958.

Accepting the importance of competitive intelligence, major multinational corporations, such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[Johnson and Johnson]], have created formal CI units.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Importantly, organizations execute competitive intelligence activities not only as a safeguard to protect against market threats and changes, but also as a method for finding new opportunities and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calof|first=Jonathan L|author2=Sheila Wright|title=Competitive intelligence: A practitioner, academic and inter-disciplinary perspective|journal=European Journal of Marketing|year=2008|volume=42|issue=7/8|pages=717–730|doi=10.1108/03090560810877114}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 7, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations use competitive intelligence to compare themselves to other organizations ("competitive benchmarking"), to identify risks and opportunities in their markets, and to pressure-test their plans against market response (business wargaming),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://competitive-intelligence.mirum.net/competitive-intelligence-methods/what-is-a-business-wargame.html|title=What Is A Business Wargame?|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enable them to make informed decisions. Most firms today realize the importance of knowing what their competitors are doing and how the industry is changing, and the information gathered allows organizations to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

One of the major activities involved in corporate competitive intelligence is use of [[ratio analysis]], using [[key performance indicator]]s (KPI). Organizations compare annual reports of their competitors on certain KPI and ratios, which are intrinsic to their industry. This helps them track their performance, vis-a-vis their competitors.

The actual importance of these categories of information to an organization depends on the contestability of its markets, the organizational culture, the personality and biases of its top decision makers, and the reporting structure of competitive intelligence within the company.

''Strategic Intelligence'' (SI) focuses on the longer term, looking at issues affecting a company's competitiveness over the course of a couple of years. The actual time horizon for SI ultimately depends on the industry and how quickly it's changing. The general questions that SI answers are, ‘Where should we as a company be in X years?' and 'What are the strategic risks and opportunities facing us?' This type of intelligence work involves among others the identification of weak signals and application of methodology and process called Strategic Early Warning (SEW), first introduced by Gilad,&lt;ref name="Gilad, 2001"&gt;Gilad, Ben (2001). "Industry Risk Management: CI's Next Step", Competitive Intelligence Magazine, 4 (3), May–June.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilad, Early Warning, 2003"&gt;Gilad, Ben. Early Warning. NY: American Management Association, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilad, 2006"&gt;Gilad, Ben (2006). "Early Warning Revisited", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 9(2), March–April.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Steven Shaker and Victor Richardson,&lt;ref name="Shaker and Richardson, 2004"&gt;Shaker, Steven and Richardson, Victor (2004). "Putting the System Back into Early Warning". ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 7(3), May–June.&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandro Comai and Joaquin Tena,&lt;ref name="Comai and Tena, 2007"&gt;Comai, Alessandro and Tena, Joaquin (2007). "Early Warning Systems for your Competitive Landscape", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 10(3), May–June.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comai and Tena, 2006"&gt;Comai, Alessandro and Tena, Joaquin (2006). "Mapping and Anticipating the Competitive Landscape", ''Emecom Ediciones'', Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; and others. According to Gilad, 20% of the work of competitive intelligence practitioners should be dedicated to strategic early identification of weak signals within a SEW framework.

''Tactical Intelligence'': the focus is on providing information designed to improve shorter-term decisions, most often related with the intent of growing market share or revenues. Generally, it is the type of information that you would need to support the sales process in an organization. It investigates various aspects of a product/product line marketing:

* Product – what are people selling?
* Price – what price are they charging?
* Promotion – what activities are they conducting for promoting this product?
* Place – where are they selling this product?
* Other – sales force structure, clinical trial design, technical issues, etc.

With the right amount of information, organizations can avoid unpleasant surprises by anticipating competitors' moves and decreasing response time. Examples of competitive intelligence research is evident in daily newspapers, such as the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Business Week]]'', and ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. Major airlines change hundreds of fares daily in response to competitors' tactics. They use information to plan their own marketing, pricing, and production strategies.

Resources, such as the Internet, have made gathering information on competitors easy. With a click of a button, analysts can discover future trends and market requirements. However competitive intelligence is much more than this, as the ultimate aim is to lead to [[competitive advantage]]. As the Internet is mostly public domain material, information gathered is less likely to result in insights that will be unique to the company. In fact there is a risk that information gathered from the Internet will be misinformation and mislead users, so competitive intelligence researchers are often wary of using such information.

As a result, although the Internet is viewed as a key source, most CI professionals should spend their time and budget gathering intelligence using primary research—networking with industry experts, from [[trade show]]s and conferences, from their own customers and suppliers, and so on. Where the Internet is used, it is to gather sources for primary research as well as information on what the company says about itself and its online presence (in the form of links to other companies, its strategy regarding search engines and online advertising, mentions in discussion forums and on blogs, etc.). Also, important are online subscription databases and news aggregation sources which have simplified the secondary source collection process. Social media sources are also becoming important—providing potential interviewee names, as well as opinions and attitudes, and sometimes breaking news (e.g., via [[Twitter]]).

Organizations must be careful not to spend too much time and effort on old competitors without realizing the existence of any new competitors. Knowing more about your competitors will allow your business to grow and succeed. The practice of competitive intelligence is growing every year, and most companies and business students now realize the importance of knowing their competitors.

According to Arjan Singh and Andrew Beurschgens in their 2006 article in the ''Competitive Intelligence Review'', there are four stages of development of a competitive intelligence capability with a firm. It starts with "stick fetching", where a CI department is very reactive, up to "world class", where it is completely integrated in the decision-making process.

The technical advances in massive parallel processing offered by the [[Hadoop]] "[[big data]]" architecture has allowed the creation of multiple platforms for [[named-entity recognition]] such as the [[Apache Project]]s [[OpenNLP]] and [[Apache Stanbol]]. The former includes pre-trained statistical parsers that can discern elements key to establishing trends and evaluating competitive position and responding appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augmentedintel.com/wordpress/index.php/augmented-intel-free-online-analytics-applications-for-corporate-intelligence/working-net-entity-extractor-using-opennlp-models/|title=Working entity extractor with openNLP models for name extraction|last=Krapohl|first=Don|publisher=AugmentedIntel|date=14 April 2013|website=AugmentedIntel|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public information mining from ''SEC.gov'', Federal Contract Awards, social media ([[Twitter]], [[Reddit]], [[Facebook]], and others), vendors, and competitor websites now permit real-time counterintelligence as a strategy for horizontal and vertical market expansion and product positioning. This occurs in an automated fashion on massive marketplaces such as [[Amazon.com]] and their classification and prediction of product associations and purchase probability.

Competitive intelligence has been influenced by national [[strategic intelligence]]. Although national intelligence was researched 50 years ago, competitive intelligence was introduced during the 1990s. Competitive-intelligence professionals can learn from national-intelligence experts, especially in the analysis of complex situations.&lt;ref&gt;Barnea, A., (2010), "Intelligence Failures: Competitive Intelligence and Strategic Surprises", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', Vol. 13. No. 3, July/September.&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive intelligence may be confused with (or seen to overlap) [[environmental scanning]], [[business intelligence]] and [[market research]].&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Blenkhorn, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. and David Blenkhorn. Controversies in Competitive Intelligence: The Enduring Issues. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Fleisher]]&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Blenkhorn, 2003" /&gt; questions the appropriateness of the term, comparing it to business intelligence, competitor intelligence, knowledge management, market intelligence, marketing research and strategic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003"&gt;Fleisher, Craig S. (2003). "Should the Field be Called 'Competitive Intelligence?' pp. 56-69 in Fleisher, Craig S. and David Blenkhorn [eds.], ''Controversies in Competitive Intelligence: The Enduring Issues''. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleisher&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}} suggests that business intelligence has two forms. Its narrow (contemporary) form is more focused on information technology and internal focus than CI, while its broader (historical) definition is more inclusive than CI. Knowledge management (KM), when improperly achieved, is seen as an information-technology driven organizational practice relying on data mining, corporate intranets and mapping organizational assets to make it accessible to organization members for decision-making. CI shares some aspects of KM; they are human-intelligence- and experience-based for a more-sophisticated qualitative analysis.&amp;nbsp;km is essential for effective change. A key effective factor is a powerful, dedicated IT system executing the full intelligence cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnea|first=Avner|title=Intelligence Solutions through the Use of Expert Tools|journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine|date=May–June 2009|volume=12|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market intelligence (MI) is industry-targeted intelligence developed in real-time aspects of competitive events taking place among the four Ps of the [[marketing mix]] (pricing, place, promotion and product) in the product (or service) marketplace to better understand the market's attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Skyrme, 1989"&gt;Skyrme, D. J. (1989). "The Planning and Marketing of the Market Intelligence Function," ''Marketing Intelligence and Planning'', 7(1/2), 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt; A time-based competitive tactic, MI is used by marketing and sales managers to respond to consumers more quickly in the marketplace. Fleisher suggests it is not distributed as widely as some forms of CI, which are also distributed to non-marketing decision-makers.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}} Market intelligence has a shorter time horizon than other intelligence areas, and is measured in days, weeks, or (in slower-moving industries) months.

Market research is a tactical, method-driven field consisting of neutral, primary research of customer data (beliefs and perceptions) gathered in surveys or focus groups, and is analyzed with statistical-research techniques.&lt;ref name="Sharp, 2000"&gt;Sharp, S. (2000). "Truth or Consequences: 10 Myths that Cripple Competitive Intelligence", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 3(1), 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; CI draws on a wider variety (primary and secondary) of sources from a wider range of stakeholders (suppliers, competitors, distributors, substitutes and media) to answer existing questions, raise new ones and guide action.&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Controversies, 2003" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}

Ben Gilad and Jan Herring lay down a set of prerequisites defining CI, distinguishing it from other information-rich disciplines such as market research or business development. They show that a common body of knowledge and a unique set of tools (key intelligence topics, [[business war games]] and [[blindspots analysis]]) distinguish CI; while other sensory activities in a commercial firm focus on ''one'' segment of the market (customers, suppliers or acquisition targets), CI synthesizes data from all high-impact players (HIP).&lt;ref name="Gilad and Herring, 2001"/&gt;

Gilad later focused his delineation of CI on the difference between information and intelligence. According to him, the common denominator among organizational sensory functions (whether they are called market research, business intelligence or market intelligence) is that they deliver information rather than intelligence. Intelligence, says Gilad, is a perspective on facts rather than the facts themselves. Unique among corporate functions, competitive intelligence has a perspective of risks and opportunities for a firm's performance; as such, it (not information activities) is part of an organization's risk-management activity.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, B. (2008) "The Future of Competitive Intelligence: Contest for the Profession's Soul", ''Competitive Intelligence Magazine'', 11 (5), 21–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
Ethics has been a long-held issue of discussion among CI practitioners.&lt;ref name="Fleisher &amp; Blenkhorn, 2003" /&gt; The questions revolve around what is and is not allowable in terms of CI activity. A number of scholarly treatments have been generated on this topic, most prominently addressed through Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals publications.&lt;ref name="Competitive Intelligence Foundation, 2006"&gt;Competitive Intelligence Foundation (2006). ''Competitive Intelligence Ethics: Navigating the Gray Zone''. D. Fehringer and Hohhof, B.[Eds], Alexandria, VA: Competitive Intelligence Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Competitive Intelligence Ethics: Navigating the Gray Zone'' provides nearly twenty separate views about ethics in CI, as well as another 10 codes used by various individuals or organizations.&lt;ref name="Competitive Intelligence Foundation, 2006" /&gt; Combining that with the over two dozen scholarly articles or studies found within the various CI bibliographic entries,&lt;ref&gt;Knip, Fleisher, &amp; Dishman, 2003{{Specify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}&lt;ref name="Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.telfer.uottawa.ca/ci-wiki/index.php/Ethics_in_Competitive_Intelligence#.22The_Bible_of_BI_Ethics.22 |title=Ethics in Competitive Intelligence, University of Ottawa |publisher=Wiki.telfer.uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is clear that no shortage of study has gone into better classifying, understanding and addressing CI ethics.

Competitive information may be obtained from public or subscription sources, from networking with competitor staff or customers, disassembly of competitor products or from field research interviews. Competitive intelligence research is distinguishable from [[industrial espionage]], as CI practitioners generally abide by local legal guidelines and ethical business norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhesq.com/CI/SCIP%20EEA%20Policy%20Analysis.pdf |title=white pages |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical path drag is the amount of time that an activity or constraint on the critical path is adding to the project duration.  Alternatively, it is the maximum amount of time that one can shorten the activity before it is no longer on the critical path or before its duration becomes zero.

In networks where all dependencies are finish-to-start (FS) relationships (i.e., where a predecessor must finish before a successor starts), the drag of a critical path activity is equal to whichever is less: its remaining duration or (if there is one or more parallel activity) the total float of the parallel activity that has the least total float.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Devaux [http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/ATL%20Docs/Jan_Feb_2012/Devaux.pdf "The Drag Efficient: The Missing Quantification of Time on the Critical Path"] Defense AT&amp;L magazine of the Defense Acquisition University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:SimpleAONwDrag3.png|thumb|''Activity-on-node diagram'' showing critical path schedule, along with total float and critical path drag computations]]

In this diagram, Activities A, B, C, D, and E comprise the critical path, while Activities F, G, and H are off the critical path with floats of 15 days, 5 days, and 20 days respectively. Whereas activities that are off the critical path have float and are therefore not delaying completion of the project, those on the critical path have critical path drag, i.e., they delay project completion. 
# Activities A and E have nothing in parallel and therefore have drags of 10 days and 20 days respectively.
# Activities B and C are both parallel to F (float of 15) and H (float of 20). B has a duration of 20 and drag of 15 (equal to F's float), while C has a duration of only 5 days and thus drag of only 5. 
# Activity D, with a duration of 10 days, is parallel to G (float of 5) and H (float of 20) and therefore its drag is equal to 5, the float of G.

In network schedules that include start-to-start (SS), finish-to-finish (FF) and start-to-finish (SF) relationships and lags, drag computation can be quite complex, often requiring either the decomposition of critical path activities into their components so as to create all relationships as finish-to-start, or the use of scheduling software that computes critical path drag with complex dependencies. 

A quick way to compute the drag of a critical path activity that has one or more start-to-start or start-to-start plus lag successors
is that the drag of the critical path activity that has such successors will be equal to whichever is less: the duration of the predecessor activity OR the sum of the lag plus total float of whichever SS successor has the LEAST lag plus total float. This is shown in the diagram where Activity A has four SS+lag successors: B, C, E, and F. The drag-plus-lag of B is 3 + 12 = 15. For each of C, E, and F, it is 20, 12, and 10 respectively. The lowest is F with 10. Since Activity A's duration is 20 which is higher than F's drag-plus-lag of 10, A's drag is 10. In other words, A is adding 10 units of time to the project duration. (If there were another separate parallel path, not in this diagram, that had float of 9 or fewer units, then A's drag would be equal to that float amount as it would be less than 10.)   

[[File:Activity-on-node diagram showing SS relationship drag computation.png|thumb|''Activity-on-node diagram'' showing critical path drag computation for an activity with start-to-start successors]]
  
Note that in the SS + lag relationship, the drag is in the work scheduled in the predecessor activity, e.g., digging the first 100 metres of trench in order to start laying the pipe. If the volume of work in the first part of the activity can be performed faster, the lag to the trench-digging can shrink, decreasing the drag in the predecessor and compressing the critical path. Occasionally, however, the lag on an SS relationship may be strictly a "time lag" representing a waiting period rather than work in the predecessor. In that case, the drag should be associated with the lag as that constraint is the delaying factor that must be addressed to shorten the project. Time lags are far more common on finish-to-start and finish-to-finish relationships ("Wait for cement to dry") than on SS relationships.

Critical path drag is often combined with an estimate of the increased cost and/or reduced expected value of the project due to each unit of the critical path's duration. This allows such cost to be attributed to individual critical path activities through their respective drag amounts (i.e., the activity's [[drag cost]]). If the cost of each unit of time in the diagram above is $10,000, the drag cost of E would be $200,000, B would be $150,000, A would be $100,000, and C and D $50,000 each. 

This in turn can allow a project manager to justify those additional resources that will reduce the drag and drag cost of specific critical path activities where the cost of such resources would be less than the value generated by reduction in drag. For example, if the addition of $50,000 worth of resources would reduce the duration of B to ten days, the project would take only 55 days, B's drag would be reduced to five days, and its drag cost would be reduced to $50,000.

'''Improvement''' is the process of a thing moving from one state to a state considered to be better, usually through some action intended to bring about that better state. The concept of improvement is important to governments and businesses, as well as to individuals.

==History of the concept==
The term "improvement" in general means "gradual, piecemeal, but cumulative betterment", which can refer to both individuals and societies as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Slack, The Invention of Improvement: Information &amp; Material Progress in Seventeenth-Century England (2015), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The term "improvement" historically referred to [[land improvement]], the process of making wild land more suitable for human uses, particularly the cultivation of crops.&lt;ref name="Houston"&gt;Alan Craig Houston, ''Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement'' (2008), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural writers contrasted "improvement" with the traditional custom that governed farming practices at the time. The belief in agricultural "improvement" was the belief that the earth could be made more fruitful. More specifically, it was the belief that "the knowledge of nature would allow the best possible use of resources".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drayton, ''Nature’s Government: Science, Imperial Britain and the ‘Improvement' of the World'' (2000), p.xv&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged in late medieval England and later shaped the colonies of the British Empire, through what Richard Drayton describes as "enlightened imperialism". The British believed "that they ultimately knew better than those on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drayton, Nature’s Government: Science, Imperial Britain and the ‘Improvement' of the World (2000), p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

This limited agricultural use of the term changed in the 17th century, when "its metaphoric range was extended to include a host of social and political reforms aimed at growth, development, or perfection".&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt; In short order, the term "improvement" became "nothing less than shorthand for the civilizing process",&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Andrew D. Lambert, ''The Gates of Hell: Sir John Franklin's Tragic Quest for the North West Passage'' (2014), p. 136: "The Enlightenment concept of improvement as applied to the land was seen as a civilising mission".&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter "played an important role in eighteenth- century European debates over the foundations of social order".&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized this concept of "improvement" in his notes published in ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', asserting that it created a false and self-serving sense of human superiority over nature, and that the "civilizing" of man was actually a "softening".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' (2011 ed.), p. 91, 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the concept of improvement expanded even further. Businesses developed philosophies of having a [[continual improvement process]], wherein all activities of the business are constantly examined to weed out inefficiencies and better ways of carrying out tasks. At the same time, the concept of individual [[self-improvement]] blossomed, leading to "tremendous growth in self-help publishing [and] self-improvement culture",&lt;ref&gt;Micki McGee. ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; wherein people assessed their lives in much the same way. [[Home improvement]], the process or result of improving the efficiency, livability, or market value of a personal dwelling, has also become a substantial industry.

Sarah Tarlow, a Professor of Archaeology, has argued that the idea of “improvement” is so familiar to us today that it seems natural. It is therefore difficult to fully understand the history of “improvement” as a concept, and to appreciate that it was a genuinely new way of thinking in the early modern period. Furthermore, in contemporary use the notion of “improvement” is assumed to be positive. This assumption has limited the critical attention given to the history of the idea and the practices associated with it. For example, the [[enclosure]] of common land for private use was understood as an “improvement” in the eighteenth century. But this had both positive and negative effects for the different people involved. The poor family who were denied a crucial means of subsistence did not regard the newly enclosed fields as “better”.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Tarlow, The Archeology of Improvement in Britain, 1750-1850 (2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===In business===
Many theories and practices exist with respect to improvement in business.  For example, business process improvement is a systematic approach to help an organization optimize its underlying processes to achieve more efficient results. One such approach is [[focused improvement]], the ensemble of activities aimed at elevating the performance of any system, especially a business system, by working on eliminating its constraints one by one while ''not'' working on non-constraints. [[Performance improvement]] focuses on measuring the output of a particular [[business process]] or procedure, then modifying the process or procedure to increase the output, increase [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]], or increase the effectiveness of the process or procedure. Quality improvement is one of the four aspects of the concept of [[quality management]]. A crucial component of professional development is evaluation. Recently, we have seen a push for evaluation systems to be used to sort and fire teachers—a supposed quick fix, but one that ignores the vast majority of dedicated educators. To be effective, an evaluation system must identify strengths and weaknesses, so that all teachers can get the necessary support to improve their practice.

===In government===
Governments often use language proposing improvement of processes or areas. In some places a [[business improvement district]] or [[tourism improvement district]] may be incorporated into [[urban area|urban]] [[zoning]], with the enactment of laws intended to benefit businesses that are established in the area. An [[improvement trust]], a type of [[Trust law|legal trust]] created for the improvement of something, may be settled for the benefit of a municipal area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2190">The '''Insolvency Protection Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:283:0036:0042:EN:PDF 2008/94/EC] is an [[EU Directive]] concerning the protection of employees in the event of [[insolvency]] of an employer. It replaced Directive 80/987/EC and 2002/74/EC in turn.

==Contents==
The recitals of the Directive state its purpose is the protection of employees, in the interests of ‘balanced economic and social development’. It makes reference to the Charter of Social Rights for Workers 1989. In particular, recital 8 contains a declaration of the law’s ‘social purpose’.

*article 1(2) ‘Member States may, by way of exception, exclude claims by certain categories of employee from the scope of the Directive, by virtue of the special nature of the employee’s contract of employment or employment relationship or of the existence of other forms of guarantee…’
*article 3, ‘Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that guarantee institutions guarantee, subject to article 4.
*article 4, payment of employees’ outstanding claims resulting from contracts of employment or employment relationships, including, where provided for by national law, severance pay on termination of employment relationships. The claims taken over by the guarantee institution shall be the outstanding pay claims relating to a period prior to and/or, as applicable, after a given date determined by the Member States.’

==Member state law==
In the United Kingdom, the relevant implementing legislation is found in the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]]. Under section 166 any employee may lodge a claim with the [[National Insurance]] Fund for outstanding wages.

In Italy, the Directive gave rise to ''[[Francovich v Italy]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1990) C-6/90&lt;/ref&gt; on the principle of member state liability for non-implementation of [[EU law]].

{{Property law}}
A '''license''' (American English) or '''licence''' (British English)&lt;ref name=cam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/licence?a=british|title=licence Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

A license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is "an authorization to use licensed material".

In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations.

A licensor may grant a '''license''' under [[intellectual property]] laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a ([[patent]]ed) invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor.&lt;ref&gt;Intellectual Property Licensing:  Forms and Analysis, by [[Richard Raysman]], Edward A. Pisacreta and Kenneth A. Adler. Law Journal Press, 1999-2008. {{ISBN|978-1-58852-086-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a '''term''', '''territory''', '''renewal''' provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor.

'''Term:''' many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement.

'''Territory:''' a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to "North America" (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan.

A shorthand definition of license is "a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee". That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Licensing Intellectual Property: Law &amp; Management, by [[Raman Mittal]]. Satyam Law International, New Delhi, India, 2011. {{ISBN|978-81-902883-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing form sub-branches of law born out of the interplay of general laws of contract and specific principles and statutory laws relating to these respective assets.

== Mass licensing of software ==

{{Main|Software license agreement}}

Mass distributed software is used by individuals on personal computers under license from the developer of that software. Such license is typically included in a more extensive end-user license agreement (EULA){{Clarify|date=January 2018|reason=Difference between license and EULA is unclear.}} entered into upon the installation of that software on a computer.
Typically, a license is associated with a unique code, that when approved grants the end user access to the software in question.

Under a typical end-user license agreement, the user may install the software on a limited number of computers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The enforceability of end-user license agreements is sometimes [[Software license agreement#Enforceability of EULAs in the United States|questioned]].

== Patent licensing ==
A licensor may grant permission to a licensee to conduct activities which would otherwise be within the licensor's [[patent]]ed exclusive rights.  Under U.S. patent law, those activities are to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import a patented product, or to perform a patented process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/html/USCODE-2011-title35-partIII-chap28-sec271.htm|title=U.S.C. Title 35 - PATENTS|author=|date=|website=www.gpo.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term of a [[patent]] license may be a "fixed" (i.e., specified) term, such as 5 years, or may be for the life of the [[patent]] (i.e., until the [[patent]] expires).  A patent is by its nature limited in territorial scope; it only covers activity within the borders of the country issuing the patent.  Accordingly, a [[patent]] license does not require a territory provision.

The consideration provided by the licensee in return for the patent license grant is called a [[patent]] [[royalty payment]].  In a "paid-up" license, the "lump sum" royalty payment is a specified monetary amount, typically due shortly after the effective date of the patent (e.g., within 15 business days of the effective date), and no further payments are required.  Otherwise, the royalty payment is a "running royalty," typically payable on an annual basis.  The annual royalty may be a specified amount (e.g., one million dollars each year), or an amount proportional to the volume of licensed activity conducted by the licensee (e.g., one dollar per unit of licensed product sold by the licensee that year, or one percent of the net sales amount of the licensed products sold by the licensee that year).

A '''Licensing agreement''' is an arrangement whereby a licensor grants the right to intangible property to another entity for a specified period, and in return, the licensor receives a royalty fee from the licensee. Intangible property includes patents, inventions, formulas, processes, designs, copyrights, and trademarks.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W.L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|pages=455–456|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advantages of a Licensing Agreement:''' 
* A primary advantage of a licensing agreement, the firm does not have to bear the development and risks associated with opening a foreign market. It is very attractive for firms lacking the capital to develop operations overseas. Licensing can be attractive when a firm is unwilling to commit substantial financial resources to an unfamiliar or politically volatile foreign market.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt; Licensing is primarily used with a firm wants to participate in a foreign market but is prohibited because of barriers to investment.

'''Disadvantages of a Licensing Agreement'''
* First, it does not give a firm the tight control over manufacturing, marketing, and strategy that is required for realizing experience curve and location economies.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;
* Second, competing in a global market may require a firm to coordinate strategic moves across countries by using profits earned in one country to support competitive attacks in another. Licensing limits a firms ability to do this.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;
* Lastly, a third problem with licensing is the relationship of the economic theory of FDI. This is associated with licensing technological know-how foreign companies. Technological know-how constitutes the basis of many multi-national firms' competitive advantages. Most firms wish to control how their know-how is used, because they can lose control easily. Many firms make the mistake of thinking they could maintain control over their know-how within the licensing agreement.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;

== Trademark and brand licensing ==

A licensor may grant permission to a licensee to distribute products under a [[trademark]]. With such a license, the licensee may use the trademark without fear of a claim of trademark infringement by the licensor.
The assignment of a license often depends on specific [[contractual terms]]. The most common terms are, that a license is only applicable for a particular geographic region, just for a certain period of time or merely for a stage in the [[value chain]].
Moreover, there are different types of fees within the trademark and brand licensing. The first form demands a fee independent of [[sales]] and [[profit (accounting)|profits]], the second type of license fee is dependent on the productivity of the licensee.

When a licensor grants permission to a licensee to not only distribute, but manufacture a patented product, it is known as [[licensed production]].

==Artwork and character licensing==

A licensor may grant a permission to a licensee to copy and distribute [[copyright]]ed works such as "art" (e.g., [[Thomas Kinkade]]'s painting "Dawn in Los Gatos") and characters (e.g., [[Mickey Mouse]]). With such license, a licensee need not fear a claim of copyright infringement brought by the copyright owner.

[[Artistic license]] is, however, not related to the aforementioned license. It is a [[euphemism]] that denotes freedom of expression, the ability to make the subject appear more engaging or attractive, by [[fiction]]alising part of the subject.

==Academia== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ecclesiastical court]] --&gt;
:''National examples of the licentiate are listed at [[licentiate (degree)]]''

A [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] is an [[academic degree]] that traditionally conferred the license to teach at a university or to practice a particular profession. The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a [[doctorate]] is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/licentiate?region=uk&amp;q=Licentiate Oxford Living Dictionaries] Accessed September 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/licentiate|title=Definition of LICENTIATE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English, the degree has never been called a license. In French-speaking countries, the bachelor's degree is called a ''licence''.

In [[Education in Sweden|Sweden]], [[Education in Finland|Finland]], and in some other European university systems, a 'licentiate' is a postgraduate degree between the master's degree and the doctorate.  The licentiate is a popular choice in those countries where a full [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] would take five or more years to achieve.

==Vehicle licensing==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
{{see also|Driver's license}}
A license to driving certain vehicles has been applied to many countries around the world. Being allowed to drive a certain vehicle requires a specific driving license, the type of license depending on the type of vehicle.

==Criminal law==
{{Main|Parole#United Kingdom|Temporary licence}}
In the United Kingdom prisoners may be released prior to the completion of their full sentence "on licence".  Basically, the licence is the prisoner's agreement to maintain certain conditions, such as periodic reporting in to a probation officer and maintaining fixed address, in exchange for his freedom.&lt;ref name="NOMS"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Licence conditions, licences and licence and supervision notices |date=23 March 2015 |publisher=National Offender Management Service |url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FRY3UOT?url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Gianquitto |first1=Lisa |last2=Rule |first2=Philip |date=1 February 2012 |title=Licences and Licence conditions |newspaper=InsideTime |url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FSHvnGT?url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parole]] and [[release on licence]] are the same procedure by another name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Parole and release on licence |publisher=The  Scottish Government |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/parole-release-on-licence |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617223119/http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/parole-release-on-licence |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The provision of licenses and the agencies that mandate them are often criticised by libertarians, like [[Milton Friedman]], for creating an anticompetitive environment for occupations, which creates a [[barrier to entry]] for more qualified and skilled individuals who may not have the resources to obtain the necessary licences. According to Friedman, licenses and permits have become so burdensome due to legislation that favors the current  establishment of wealthy occupants that they decrease the supply of such occupations, which raises prices for the average consumer. Libertarians and the anti-authoritarian left ([[anarcho-communists]]) view competing guilds and other voluntary communes as being more beneficial for disseminating the skills and education required to perform a specified career.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26582">'''Marvin Kitman''' (born  November 24, 1929) is an American [[television critic]], [[humorist]], and [[author]].  He was a columnist for ''[[Newsday]]'' for 35&amp;nbsp;years and was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] in 1982.  He is the author of nine books, including two on [[George Washington]] that combine humor with extensive historical research.

== Early life and education ==
Kitman was born on November 24, 1929, in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="whos-80"&gt;{{cite book | title=Who's Who in America 1980–1981 Volume 1 | edition=41st | publisher=Marquis Who's Who | location=Chicago | year=1980 | page=1853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family moved to [[Brooklyn, New York]], during his childhood.  A line he subsequently used often was, "Some parents send their kids to Switzerland 'for finishing'; mine brought me to Brooklyn."&lt;ref&gt;Kitman, ''The Making of the Prefident 1789'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, he has remained a fan of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] throughout his life.&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;

He attended [[Brooklyn Technical High School]]&lt;ref name="btech"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bthsalumni.org/page.aspx?pid=798&amp;srcid278#kitman | title=Biographies 2 | publisher=Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation | accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating in 1947. He then graduated from [[City College of New York]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;

== Marriage, military service, and family ==
Kitman married the former Carol Sibushnick in 1951.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;  She became a photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/11/style/andrea-j-kitman-becomes-a-bride.html | title=Andrea J. Kitman Becomes a Bride | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 11, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitman was drafted into the [[Army of the United States]], where he served from 1953 to 1955.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gwea-16"&gt;Kitman, ''George Washington's Expense Account'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time he was a member of the [[47th Infantry Regiment (United States)|47th Infantry Regiment]] in the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] stationed at [[Fort Dix]].&lt;ref name="gwea-16" /&gt;  In his later telling, he "rose in only two years to the rank of Private First Class".&lt;ref name="lamb"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.booknotes.org/FullPage.aspx?SID=10427-1 | title= Marvin Kitman: The Making of the President 1789 | first=Brian | last=Lamb | work=Booknotes | publisher=C-SPAN | date= December 11, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return, the couple raised a son and two daughters.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;  They became longtime residents of [[Leonia, New Jersey]], beginning in 1961.&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-gop1964" /&gt;  He became active in several organizations within the town.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;  He lived across the street from novelist [[Robert Ludlum]], then working on the first in a long list of thrillers, the sight of which Kitman later said inspired him to get serious about his own writing.&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;

== Early career ==
Kitman worked as a [[freelance writer]] during the 1950s and 1960s.  For ten years he wrote a column for ''[[The Armstrong Daily]]'', a horseracing tout sheet.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krassner" /&gt;  The cleverness of these efforts led to [[Paul Krassner]] hiring him to write satirical consumer advocacy for ''[[The Realist]]'', which included pieces that took television commercials literally or imagined sardonic extremes of [[Cold War]] preparedness.&lt;ref name="krassner"&gt;{{cite book | title=Confessions of a Raving, Unconfined Nut: Misadventures in the Counterculture | first=Paul | last=Krassner | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location=New York | year=1993 | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1963, Kitman became a managing editor of ''[[Monocle (satirical magazine)|Monocle]]'', a satirical magazine of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-gop1964" /&gt;  He subsequently became an officer and partner in ''Monocle'''s periodicals and books divisions.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;  Kitman was one of ''Monocle'' editors who created the idea of the ''[[Report from Iron Mountain]]'' satirical hoax, which was written and published by [[Leonard C. Lewin|Leonard Lewin]] in 1967 and subsequently believed as true by many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17006107.html | title=Anatomy of a Hoax | first=Victor S. | last=Navasky | magazine=The Nation | date=June 12, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also worked as a staff writer for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' during 1965–66.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;

Taking on politics, Kitman staged a mock run in the [[United States presidential election, 1964]], entering the [[New Hampshire primary]] for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="nyt-gop1964" /&gt;  He ran as a "Lincoln Republican" who would finish the unmet campaign promises of 1864, such as providing for civil rights, and said that accordingly "I am the only truly reactionary Republican in the race."&lt;ref name="nyt-gop1964" /&gt;  He also mentioned his Jewish upbringing, say he was "twice as Jewish" as candidate and eventual nominee [[Barry Goldwater]], whom he labeled a "McKinley Republican".&lt;ref name="nyt-gop1964" /&gt;  His campaign slogan was "I would rather be President than write."&lt;ref name="nyt-gop1964"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/03/01/118652528.pdf | title=A 'Lincoln Man' Enters Politics | first=John H. | last=Fenton | newspaper=The New York Times | date=March 1, 1964 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitman said the delegate pledged to him received 725 votes in the primary, but that he was demanding a recount as "there was some kind of fraud in my getting so many."&lt;ref name="ct-gop1964"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/04/16/page/55/article/cronmic-looks-at-authors-and-books | title=Seeks Presidency – on 1864 Platform | first=Robert | last=Cromie | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=April 16, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He carried his campaign on a bit further, including staging a $1-a-plate fundraising dinner at a self-service cafeteria in New York.&lt;ref name="ct-gop1964" /&gt;

Kitman had a brief period working in [[advertising]] in New York:  first as a "humorist-in-residence" with the firm of [[Solow/Wexton]] during 1966–67 and then as a [[copywriter]] for the firm [[Ally &amp; Gargano|Carl Ally]] during 1967–68.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;

== Television critic ==
Kitman was one of the earlier, and longer-lasting, [[television critic]]s.  He began his efforts in this arena writing for ''[[The New Leader]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt;  He then started his run at ''[[Newsday]]'' on  December 7, 1969 ("A day that will live in infamy, as far as the TV industry is concerned," he said&lt;ref name="lamb" /&gt;), and remained there until April 1, 2005, totaling 5,786 columns.&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;  The column was called "The Marvin Kitman Show" and Kitman was credited as its "Executive Producer".&lt;ref name="mcl-bio" /&gt;  It ran three times a week in ''Newsday'' and was also distributed by the [[Los Angeles Times Syndicate]].&lt;ref name="mcl-bio" /&gt;  Kitman worked from his home in Leonia the entire time, avoiding the commute to [[Melville, New York]], where the paper was published,&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt; and in the earlier years sometimes using couriers to carry videotapes and copy back and forth.  When the time came for the column to end, Kitman said in typical fashion, "''Newsday'' gave me a tryout, and after 35 years we decided it wasn't working out."&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;

Kitman held strong views about the lack of quality of much of what was on television during his time as a critic.&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;  Regarding the premiere of [[Saturday Night Live (season 6)|the sixth season of ''Saturday Night Live'']] in 1980, the first with none of the original cast, he called it "offensive and raunchy" without being funny. "This new edition is terrible. Call it 'Saturday Night Dead on Arrival'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hill |first1= Doug |last2= Weingrad |first2= Jeff |title= Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live |location= New York |publisher= Beech Tree Books |year= 1986  |page= 412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In reaction to the 1983 television film ''[[Kentucky Woman (1983 film)|Kentucky Woman]]'', starring ex-[[Charlie's Angels]] lead [[Cheryl Ladd]] in a serious role, Kitman wrote, "Cheryl Ladd as a coal miner was a very moving television experience. It made me want to convert to nuclear power."&lt;ref name="nyt-amvcr"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/nyregion/about-books.html | title=About Books | first=Shirley | last=Horner | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 9, 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding his need to judge television news programs, he summed that he had spent "thirty-five years of getting paid to watch the bad, the bemused, and the blond of TV news."&lt;ref&gt;Kitman, ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  He coined the so-called Kitman's Law: "On the TV screen pure drivel tends to drive off ordinary drivel."&lt;ref name="mcl-bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/participants.htm | title=The Legacy of McLuhan: Symposium Participants | publisher=University of Toronto | date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer [[Bob Klapisch]] has described Kitman's style as "like sarcasm dried to a delicate crisp."&lt;ref name="br-klapisch"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bergen.com/people-and-parties/neighbors/newsday-newsie-leonia-s-marvin-kitman-recalls-his-days-as-a-media-critic-1.791313 | title= Leonia's Marvin Kitman recalls his days as a media critic | first=Bob | last=Klapisch | newspaper=The Record | location=Bergen County | date=November 11, 2013 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Kitman recognized that by and after the end of his tenure at ''Newsday'', there was a wave of quality series on television, which he claimed a connection to: "I take credit for [today's better programming] because I used to say cable was the answer. The whole fallacy was that television was giving the public what they wanted, but the public didn't know what was out there until cable showed what can happen – all the great stories, all the great acting – when you're not worried about ratings."&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;  In retrospect, Kitman has identified the 1980s series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' as a turning point in American broadcast television quality, although not fully capitalized on at the time.&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;

Kitman had two runs on television as a critic on New York local news, first with [[WPIX]] Channel 11 in 1973–74&lt;ref name="whos-80" /&gt; and later for several years with [[WNYW|WNEW Channel 5]] on Saturday nights during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="btech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitman, ''I Am a VCR'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   He was also a frequent panelist on the show ''All About TV'' which appeared on [[WNYC-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.longtailnet.com/1560/all-about-tv-2-disc-set | title=All About TV (2 Disc Set) | publisher=Longtailnet.com | accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a radio show known as "Watching TV" on the [[RKO Radio Network]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1980/1980-01-07-BC.pdf | title=unknown | magazine=Broadcasting | date=January 7, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ending his ''Newsday'' column, Kitman has remained active in that idiom, well into his eighties.  In 2008, he wrote a regular column for the [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marvin-kitman/ | title=Entries by Marvin Kitman | publisher=Huffington Post | accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently he voiced unhappiness over that site's disinclination to pay its contributors.&lt;ref name="mk-whatever"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marvinkitman.com/whatever.html | title=Part 1, Whatever Happened to Marvin Kitman? | first=Marvin | last=Kitman | publisher=MarvinKitman.com | accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2011–12, he wrote columns on business, media, and politics for the [[Investor Uprising]] business information site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marvinkitman.com/investoruprising_archive/ | title=MarvinKitman.com's ''Unofficial'' Archive of Marvin's Columns from the Late (Lamented?) InvestorUprising.com Website | publisher=MarvinKitman.com | accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did pay.  But it then folded.&lt;ref name="mk-whatever" /&gt;  And starting in 2013 he has been posting columns on television and politics to his MarvinKitman.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marvinkitman.com/ | title=MarvinKitman.com | publisher=MarvinKitman.com | accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author ==
[[Kirkus Reviews]] said of 1969's ''You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover'', a collection of humor pieces by Kitman, "He talks and he talks … but he talks. Yet the groggy reader is usually jarred into ordering more coffee and reading on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marvin-kitman/you-cant-judge-a-book-by-its-cover/ | title=You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover | magazine=Kirkus Reviews | date=February 23, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitman wrote several other books that were explicit humorist efforts.  He also wrote about television, in particular in ''I Am a VCR'' (1988), which was about the effect watching television constantly for two decades was having on the author.&lt;ref name="nyt-amvcr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ct-amvcr" /&gt;  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' found that "Kitman generally finesses his contradictory viewpoint that television is both contemptible and fascinating.... ''VCR'' has its chuckles, but Kitman's joke-a-line style makes for a book best 'watched' in several installments, one with all the permanence of the medium it covers."&lt;ref name="ct-amvcr"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-10-09/entertainment/8802060206_1_marvin-kitman-vcr-prime-time | title=Two Critics Ask If TV Has Made Us Robots | first=Abe | last=Peck | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=October 9, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitman was a co-creator and co-writer, along with [[Jim Bouton]] and [[Vic Ziegel]], of the short-lived 1976 television [[situation comedy]] ''[[Ball Four (TV series)|Ball Four]]'', based upon Bouton's [[Ball Four|book of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Single Season Sitcoms, 1948–1979: A Complete Guide | first=Bob | last=Leszczak | publisher=McFarland &amp; Company | location=Jefferson, North Carolina | year=2012 | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It gave Kitman a chance to see the television creative process from the inside.  As he later recalled: "It was the constant rewriting at night, how everyone was always so exhausted. And the input from the executives – all they knew about writing was the alphabet, but they were the ones who kept saying, 'This is the way it's always been done.'"&lt;ref name="br-klapisch" /&gt;

Kitman wrote two books about [[George Washington]] that combined humor with extensive historical research.  The first was ''George Washington's Expense Account'', published in 1970, which capitalized on Washington having declined a salary while serving as Commander-in-Chief of the [[Continental Army]] and instead only asking for his expenses to be reimbursed.&lt;ref name="stauffer" /&gt;  Billed as being by coauthors "General George Washington and Marvin Kitman, Pfc (Ret.)", it presents in facsimile form Washington's ledger from 1775 to 1783 combined with Kitman's investigations and discussions regarding the expenses.&lt;ref name="stauffer"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=10.2307/4247623 | title=George Washington's Expense Account | first=William H. | last=Stauffer | journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography | volume=79 | number= 1 | date=January 1971 | pages=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-gwexp-prof"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/07/21/issue.html | title=George Washington Gets a Belated Audit | first=McCandlish | last=Phillips | newspaper=The New York Times | date=July 21, 1970 | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitman's theme is that Washington foreshadowed the modern practice of maintaining, and sometimes manipulating, [[expense account]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt-gwexp-prof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cunliffe"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=10.2307/1890099 | title=George Washington's Expense Account | first=Marcus | last=Cunliffe | journal=The Journal of American History | volume=58 | number= 1 | date=June 1971 | page= 138 | doi=10.2307/1890099}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book made the ''New York Times Book Review'''s "New and Recommended" list;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/09/13/223540332.html?pageNumber=199 | title=New and Recommended | magazine=The New York Times Book Review | date=September 13, 1970 | page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; a profile from that paper noted Kitman's "serious digging in various archives" and said that "Kitman's interpretation[s] keep crossing the line that divides verity from travesty."&lt;ref name="nyt-gwexp-prof" /&gt;  The second work was ''The Making of the Prefident 1789'', with the fifth word of the title intentionally misspelled to make it look like a colonial-era use of the [[long s]].  First envisioned in 1972 or before, when [[Theodore H. White]]'s ''The Making of the President'' books were popular,&lt;ref name="lamb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/03/26/90711288.html?pageNumber=78 | title=Some Tips About the Making of a President | first=Joseph | last=Deitch | newspaper=The New York Times | date=March 26, 1972 | page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was published in 1989 and sought to explore how Washington and his supporters managed to get into a position where he was unopposed in the [[United States presidential election, 1788–1789]].&lt;ref name="nyt-prefident"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/21/books/books-of-the-times-chopping-down-washington-s-cherry-tree.html | title=Books of the Times: Chopping Down Washington's Cherry Tree | first=Christopher | last=Lehmann-Haupt | newspaper=The New York Times | date= December 21, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It again drew comic parallels between those events and politics in modern times.&lt;ref name="nyt-prefident" /&gt;

Judged as history, reactions to Kitman's two Washington works were mixed.  Brent Tarter, a public historian in Virginia, wrote that the first was "temporarily amusing but highly perishable" while the second was "sometimes carelessly and sometimes even deliberately contemptuous of evidence; it destroys Kitman's credibility with serious readers.  Whatever useful he might have to say is impeached by his over-clever prose and his twisting of facts and misrepresentation of historical context in order to make puns, draw irrelevant parallels, and otherwise write in [a] flip and entertaining style ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=10.2307/27550671 | first=Brent | last=Tarter | title=The Making of the Prefident [sic] 1789; The Unauthorized Campaign Biography by Marvin Kitman | journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly | volume= 21 | number= 1 | date=Winter 1991 | pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British historian [[Marcus Cunliffe]] did not quibble with the accuracy of ''George Washington's Expense Account'' but found its interpretation comparing Washington to modern practices too stretched.&lt;ref name="cunliffe" /&gt;  But historian of Virginia William H. Stauffer found the same work "informative" and "praiseworthy" for the full light it shed on Washington's character.&lt;ref name="stauffer" /&gt;  Art historian and Washington iconographer Karal Ann Marling said that while ''The Making of the Prefident 1789'' maintained an "air of pie-in-the-face irreverance," Kitman had demonstrated that he could "moonlight in the library with the best of 'em."&lt;ref name="marling"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=10.2307/20092506 | title=The Making of the Prefident 1789: The Unauthorized Campaign Biography | first=Karal Ann | last=Marling | journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography | volume=114 | number= 3 | date=July 1990 | pages= 439–440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And American historian [[Francis Jennings]] cited ''George Washington's Expense Account'' regarding the subject's drinking habits, and noted that it contains "hilarious and fully documented analysis" and that "as my trade's custom is to deplore such irreverence, let it be noted that the book includes a facsimile of the account in question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Francis | last=Jennings | title= Empire of Fortune: Crowns, Colonies, and Tribes in the Seven Years War in America | publisher= W. W. Norton | location=New York | year=1988 | page=63n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Kitman published a biography of the popular but controversial television commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]].&lt;ref name="nyt-billo" /&gt;  Titled ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', it was based upon 29&amp;nbsp;interviews Kitman conducted with the subject as well as large amounts of research.&lt;ref name="br-oreilly" /&gt;  Although [[Modern liberalism in the United States|politically liberal]], Kitman had often admired the mostly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] O'Reilly as a broadcaster&lt;ref name="pw-billo" /&gt; and O'Reilly in turn had read Kitman's ''Newsday'' columns growing up.&lt;ref name="nyt-billo" /&gt;  ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said "it's difficult to imagine a better-researched or less-biased work about such a divisive figure as O'Reilly".&lt;ref name="pw-billo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-31435-4 | title=The Man Who Would Not Shut Up: The Rise of Bill O'Reilly | magazine=Publishers Weekly | date=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[New York Times]]'' praised Kitman for doing [[Boswellian]] amounts of research and constructing a well-written narrative, but ultimately concluded that the positive aspect of the portrayal was "unconvincing" and a "mash note".&lt;ref name="nyt-billo"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/books/review/Heilbrunn.t.html | title=Spin Cycle | first=Jacob | last=Heilbrunn | newspaper=The New York Times | date=January 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, O'Reilly hated the book, apparently because Kitman addressed the 2004 sexual harassment charges against the star by one of his program's female producers, and refused to follow through on what Kitman said was an agreement to feature the author and the book on the show.&lt;ref name="br-oreilly"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-137146162.html | title=O'Reilly factors out Leonia's Kitman | first=Mike | last=Kerwick | newspaper=The Record | location=Bergen County | date=March 25, 2007 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, sales of the book suffered, as did Kitman's opinion of O'Reilly.&lt;ref name="br-oreilly" /&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
In 1982, Kitman was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Criticism | title=Criticism: Finalists | publisher=Pulitzer.org | accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- can't find a real cite for this one: the Folio Award (1988) --&gt;

'''''Monopoly Tycoon''''' is a [[construction and management simulation]] PC game published in 2001. The player operates a business that owns stores and apartments in a city derived from the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board game. Instead of using [[dice]], the game relies more on the speed and innovativeness of the players. In the standard mode, the user plays against the AI opponents. In the [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] version, players go against other [[online]] players in order to gain victory.

There are various levels with varying difficulty. Some involve just financial prosperity of the businesses while others involve success in the political arena. But the primary objective of most levels is to accumulate the most wealth in the given time.

==Gameplay==
In ''Monopoly Tycoon'', the player operates a business by owning businesses, apartments, and being landlord to blocks. The player earns income from selling products and services, housing people in apartments and hotels. Income is also generated from rent for any blocks that the player is landlord of, plus utilities and railroads.

''Monopoly Tycoon'' has the same set of blocks as the board game with an additional three. When a player is landlord of all blocks of the same color, they are able to build hotels. In addition, being landlord of any property allows the player to build park space.

As in the board game, there are railroads and utilities blocks that players can become landlord of and receive income from. To become landlord, there is an auction among the players with the property going to the highest bidder.

At the end of the day, the player is offered a mystery card similar to those from the board game. Some of the cards are a simple deposit or withdrawal of money from the player's account. Other cards allow the player to aid his businesses or harm the opponent, say by restocking one of his stores or giving an opponent block bad publicity.

Monopoly Tycoon also includes support for multiplayer game play over a [[Local area network|LAN]] or Internet connection. Additionally, there is support for finding live online opponents through the included [[GameSpy|GameSpy Arcade]] software.[[Image:Montycoon screenshot.jpg|200px|thumb|Examining the status of one of your businesses during a game. On the left side you have the summary of its income, profit, sales, etc.]]

==Music and sound effects==
The music of the game is lighthearted and changes as the game progresses through the different decades. For example, in the 1970s (1970 and 1975 Monopoly Tycoon years), music from the 1970s can be heard; in 1990 and 1995, 1990s music plays. This music will play until the year 2030 is reached (this year can only be reached in the "My Mega Metropolis" level, "Starting Out", "A Homely City", "Sell, Sell, Sell", and the "First to be Worth $20,000, $25,000, or $40,000" levels). At that point, music from the 1930s can be heard from then on.

After every two days at midnight, the music from the previous decade becomes quieter and quickly fades away, while the music from the next decade starts at normal volume. For example, when midnight of 1960 occurs, the music from the 1950s fades away and the music from the 1960s plays at normal volume.

Other sounds indicate the time of day. People, cars, and the wind all make noises, in varying degrees depending on the time of day. For example, during the morning, footsteps of people waking up and coming out of their apartments is played to signify the time the city wakes up. Throughout the game, also, the sound of coins falling can be heard when the player makes money.

''Monopoly Tycoon'' received generally positive reviews from critics. It received a 'great' score of 8.5/10 from [[GameSpot]]&lt;ref name=gamespot&gt;{{cite web|title=Monopoly Tycoon|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/monopolytycoon/index.html|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 'great' score from [[IGN]] of 8.2/10.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|title=Monopoly Tycoon|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/014/014103.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trey Walker at GameSpot said that "Monopoly Tycoon is the kind of game you might have imagined as a kid while you played the real board game."&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt;

The developers of the game, however, were critical of their work saying that "I don’t think we got it entirely right either."&lt;ref name=rps /&gt;

The [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] nominated ''Monopoly Tycoon'' for its 2001 "Online Game Play of the Year" and "Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering" awards,&lt;ref name=aias2001-2&gt;{{cite press release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602183409/http://www.interactive.org/newsandevents.asp?show=138&amp;thetype=1 |url=http://www.interactive.org:80/newsandevents.asp?show=138&amp;thetype=1 |title=Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Announces Finalists for the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards |date=February 5, 2002 |publisher=[[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] |archivedate=June 2, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df= |location=[[Los Angeles]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which ultimately went to ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name=aias2001&gt;{{cite press release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020306070041/http://www.interactive.org/newsandevents.asp |url=http://www.interactive.org:80/newsandevents.asp |title=Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Announces Recipients of Fifth Annual Interactive Achievement Awards |date=March 1, 2002 |publisher=[[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] |archivedate=March 6, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df= |location=[[Las Vegas]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monopoly Tycoon'' was also a nominee for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s 2001 "Best Strategy Game" award, although it lost to ''[[Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns]]''.

The '''National Historic Route 66 Federation''' was founded in 1995 for the purpose of saving the businesses, communities and roadbed of [[U.S. Route 66]]. The famous road carried travelers across much of the country from the day it was commissioned on November 11, 1926 through June 25, 1985 when it was decommissioned.

==Historical background==
Since its construction, most motorists preferred to travel that way because the weather tended to be more hospitable than along the more northerly highways. Businesses and entire towns sprang up to cater to the ever-increasing traffic. Although it brought considerable prosperity, the thoroughfare also spawned bumper-to-bumper congestion in the communities and numerous accidents on the rural stretches leading to the gruesome nickname, “Bloody 66”.

Just as it seemed the mostly two lane road could not handle another vehicle, on June 29, 1956, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed the [[Interstate Highway Act]] into law, which allocated $25 billion for the construction of {{convert|41000|mi|km}} of interstate highways. Over the next 29 years, section after section of Route 66 was methodically bypassed by multi-lane, high speed [[Limited-access road|expressways]] enabling motorists to increase their speeds and avoid hazardous congestion. This was a time-saving advantage to those on the move, but a distinct disadvantage to businesses and communities along the Route. Where customers once thronged, they rarely showed up at all, anymore.

==Inspiring the Federation==
By 1994, Route 66 was well on its way to becoming little more than miles of memories. Unaware of these declining conditions, in August of that year, David and Mary Lou Knudson set out to relive their early experiences along the legendary road. Mary Lou remembered traveling it during [[World War II]] with her parents as her father, a [[U.S. Air Force]] Sergeant, drove between several bases in Illinois and California. David remembered the trip he made in 1963 to move from Detroit to Los Angeles as being like a “2,400 mile carnival”. But this time, they couldn’t even find the famous byway. They soon discovered it was no longer a [[U.S. Highway]] and was not on their map as “US 66”. So the Knudsons stopped at a [[truck stop]] west of Chicago to ask where it was, and the clerk sold them the “Here It Is” map set which guided them to and along the original road.

The moment they got on what was once Route 66, the Knudsons realized that something was very wrong. The once colorful and often gaudy trading posts, side shows, rare animal displays, [[motel]]s and cafés were gone. In their place was mile after mile of roadside that was little more than boarded up buildings. Many stretches of roadbed were poorly maintained or completely closed to traffic. Entire  towns that were once bustling tourist meccas were all but shut down.

They were saddened by the deterioration of such an important American icon; so much so, they decided to do something about it. As they traveled, they photographed many of the buildings and [[Tape recorder|tape recorded]] captions for each of their locations. They had planned to take a week to travel to their home in Los Angeles but that turned into 3 weeks. They arrived home laden with hundreds of photos and several tapes of captions. On the trip, David decided to sell the shares in his business and commit his time to developing a nonprofit corporation that would work to save Route 66.

==Establishing the federation==
To that end, the Knudson’s first step was to contact the gentleman who had prepared the Route 66 map set they had used to cross the country. He directed them to the [[National Park Service]] office in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] where they had prepared a study of the Route for [[United States Senator|Senators]] [[Pete Domenici]] (R) and [[Jeff Bingaman]] (D). Between the Knudsons, the Senators and New Mexico Congresswoman [[Heather Wilson]] (R) a [[Bill (law)|Congressional Bill]] was drafted that would help fund the restoration of the famous highway. In 1999, the "National Route 66 Preservation Bill" was passed by the [[United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The act provides $10 million in matching fund grants to individuals, corporations and communities for the purpose of preserving or restoring historic properties along Route. To this day, David Knudson sits on the grant committee.

Acquiring the funds for restoration through the Bill was the first tangible step toward the renaissance. Although restoration dollars were essential to the Knudson’s plans and hopes, bringing in tourists to patronize the businesses was every bit as important. This is where David’s advertising and publicity background came into play. He launched a worldwide campaign to turn the Route into a tourist destination. To this day, it is estimated that 40% of the business the Route generates comes from countries other than the U. S.

==The John Steinbeck Awards==
Then came the Federation’s [[John Steinbeck]] Awards evenings. The purpose of these events was threefold:
#Present the “John Steinbeck Award” to an individual who had contributed significantly to the preservation of Route 66.
#Bring Route 66 historians, authors, artists, photographers, business people and enthusiasts together to network and meet to discuss what could be done to preserve the road.
#Introduce these people to various Route 66 communities and conversely, familiarize citizens within these host communities with the importance of the Route.

The first John Steinbeck Awards Evening was scheduled for May, 1995 in [[Oklahoma City]]. The [[Oklahoma City bombing|bombing of the Murrah building]] on April 19 put an end to those plans. The Federation suffered significant financial loss as a result, and it was not until October 1998 that a John Steinbeck Awards Evening took place; this time in [[Kingman, Arizona]]. From that year on, the evenings were produced annually in one Route 66 community after another until the last one in [[San Bernardino, California]] in September 2005. By that time, Route 66 communities were vying to have the evenings and they would build three-day, communitywide Route 66 celebrations around them. Shortly after that last event, Mary Lou Knudson suffered a debilitating [[stroke]] and died three years later. She had been the one who managed the myriad of details involved in producing the large events.

==Promoting Route 66==
As the popularity of Route 66 grew around the world, an increasing number of tourists began driving the road and enjoying its history and sights, however most of them were not enjoying the vintage dining and lodging establishments that were so much the essence of early roadside [[Americana]]. The majority of travelers were staying in and eating in chain establishments that were familiar to them. The Knudsons had become acquainted with many of the owners of the vintage businesses and knew that most of their facilities were at least as clean and as well run as the chains. They were also usually much less expensive.

In order to introduce the public to the family-owned, vintage enterprises, the first “Route 66 Dining &amp; Lodging Guide” was published in 1999. It was, and still is prepared from reviews conducted by the “Adopt-A-Hundred” adopters. The Federation’s “Adopt-A-Hundred” Program was initially developed to keep an eye on possible preservation problems along the Route such as a bridge, a business or a stretch of roadbed being closed. Adopters canvassed their {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} sections once a year watching for preservation trouble. So, the adopters were asked to review the dining and lodging businesses while they traveled their sections. The current edition is the 14th and includes over 500 mostly vintage businesses.

&lt;!-- Over the years, Route 66 acquired several nicknames and marketing titles, probably the most notable being, “The Mother Road” which John Steinbeck coined  in his epic novel, “[[The Grapes Of Wrath]]”. Others included, “The Main Street Of America", "The Glory Road", the "[[Will Rogers]] Highway", "The Fair Weather Highway",and "Bloody 66". In addition to the various names, it also acquired many different alignments. One extreme case is the two alignments in New Mexico—one traveling a virtually horizontal east-to-west path through Albuquerque, the other wending its way {{convert|60|mi|km}} north through Santa Fe. Yet, it was the alignments that only varied by a few miles or even blocks that often lost first-time traveling enthusiasts. It is to be noted here that U. S. 66 road signs do exist along some of the more popular alignments of the road but sporadically, at best. (This appears to be an after-the-fact addition that duplicates material in the Route 66 main article.) --&gt;

==Map guide==

With the intent of making it as easy as possible for travelers to find the most popular alignments, the Federation commissioned Route 66 artist, historian and cartographer, Jerry McClanahan to produce a map guide. The product, introduced in 2005, was the 200 page, spiral bound EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers. It is now in its 3rd edition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15661">The '''National Microbiology Laboratory''' ('''NML''') is part of the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch of the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] (PHAC), the agency of the Government of Canada that is responsible for public health, health emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention.

NML is located in several sites across the country including the [[Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health]] (CSCHAH) in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], also home to the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]’s [[National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease]]. This modern state-of-the-art infectious disease laboratory facility houses the only [[Containment Level 4]] (also known as [[Biosafety Level 4]]) operational laboratories in Canada. With maximum containment, scientists are able to work safely with pathogens ranging from the most common to the most serious including [[Ebolavirus|Ebola]], [[Marburg virus|Marburg]] and [[Lassa fever]].

NML has a second site in Winnipeg, the JC Wilt Infectious Disease Research Centre on Logan Avenue which serves as a hub for HIV research and diagnostics in Canada. The three other primary sites include locations in Guelph, St. Hyacinthe and Lethbridge.

== History ==

The National Microbiology Laboratory was preceded by the Bureau of Microbiology which was originally part of the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control of Health Canada in Ottawa. In the 1980s, Health Canada identified both the need to replace existing laboratory space that was reaching the end of its lifespan and the need for Containment Level 4 space in the country. Around the same time, Agriculture Canada (prior to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency being formed) also identified the need for new laboratory space including high-containment. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building and Winnipeg was chosen as the site; an announcement to that effect was made in October 1987.

After some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre (a major teaching hospital), the University of Manitoba’s medical school, and other life science organizations. Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as “the Virology Lab”) began with an official ground-breaking in December 1992. The joint venture design team of Toronto-based Dunlop Architects and Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc. visited 30 laboratories to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction was largely complete by the end of 1997 with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 and all laboratories coming on line after that. The official opening took place in June 1999.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213074113/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_81_e.html News Release].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was formed in 2004 &lt;ref name="two"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213075940/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2004/2004_47_e.html News Release]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a stronger focus on public health and emergency preparedness in the country. It is a member of the federal Health Portfolio (along with Health Canada, the Canadian Institute of Health Research, and other organizations).

== Containment ==

Human pathogens are classified into risk groups.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-biosafety-standards-guidelines/handbook-second-edition.html Canadian Biosafety Handbook, Second Edition 2016 ].&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria to determine the group includes the level of risk to the health of a person or to public health, as well as the likelihood that the human pathogen will actually cause disease in a human, and whether treatment and preventative measures are available. It can depend on the type of work being done as to which level of containment is needed for pathogens from specific risk groups; as an example, culturing (or growing) a virus or bacterium requires higher containment than some diagnostic tests.

NML operates Containment Level 2, 3 and 4 laboratories. In human health infectious disease laboratories, the design and construction of the facility, the engineering controls, and the training and techniques of staff are all focused on protecting lab workers, containing the pathogens, and preventing contamination of materials to ensure accurate diagnosis and research. All of these factors vary depending on the level of containment.

The vast majority (87.7%) of NML’s lab space is Containment Level 2 (CL2). This is the same type of laboratory found in doctors' offices, hospitals and universities. In a Level 2 lab, work with infectious materials is done inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC) and appropriate personal protective gear is worn relative to activities (gloves, eye protection, lab coats, gowns, etc.). Risk Group 2 pathogens worked with in Level 2 can cause disease but are not a serious hazard and they are often circulating in the community. Environmental contamination must be minimized by the use of hand washing sinks and decontamination facilities such as autoclaves. Examples include E-coli; whooping cough; and seasonal influenza.

NML also has Containment Level 3 (CL3) laboratories (8.6% of lab space). Risk Group 3 pathogens may be transmitted by the airborne route, often need only a low infectious dose to produce effects, and can cause serious or life-threatening disease. CL3 emphasizes additional primary and secondary barriers to minimize the release of infectious organisms into the immediate laboratory and the environment. Additional features to prevent transmission of CL3 organisms are appropriate respiratory protection, HEPA filtration of exhausted laboratory air, and strictly controlled laboratory access. Examples include tuberculosis; West Nile virus; and pandemic H1N1 influenza.

A small percentage of laboratory space (3.6%) is devoted to Containment Level 4 (CL4) at NML. These agents have the potential for aerosol transmission, often have a low infectious dose and produce very serious and often fatal disease; there is no licensed treatment or vaccine available. This level of containment represents an isolated unit independent of other areas. CL4 emphasizes maximum containment of the infectious agent by completely sealing the facility perimeter with confirmation by negative pressure testing; isolation of the researcher from the pathogen by an enclosed positive pressure suit; and decontamination of air and all other materials. Examples include Ebola; Nipah; Marburg; and 1918 pandemic influenza.

== Structure ==

NML programs are housed in several facilities across the country. Two of these facilities are in proximity to each other in Winnipeg: The Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health on Arlington Street and the J.C. Wilt Infectious Diseases Research Centre on Logan Avenue. The other facilities are located in Guelph, ON; St. Hyacinthe, QC and Lethbridge, AB.

NML is divided into five main laboratory divisions which are supported by scientific and administrative services. The primary NML divisions are:

'''Bacterial Pathogens''' - focussing on bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant organisms.

'''Enteric Diseases''' - focussing on food and water-borne pathogens including E.coli and Salmonella.

'''Viral Diseases''' - addressing a range of viral diseases, including hepatitis and other blood-borne pathogens, respiratory viruses and viral exanthemata, such as measles.

'''Zoonotic Diseases and Special Pathogens''' - dealing with viral, bacterial and rickettsial zoonoses (diseases transmitted to humans from other species), such as West Nile Virus and Lyme disease, along with risk group 4 agents such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses.

'''HIV and Retrovirology''' - providing laboratory services and scientific expertise relating to HIV and emerging retroviruses.

'''The Science Technology Core and Services''' Division works with these divisions to provide technological approaches, including genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics.

There is also the '''Public Health Risk Sciences Division''', which is a specialized resource that provides scientific knowledge and [[solution]]s to better assess public health risks and enable decisions, with specific attention to infectious disease threats transmitted from food, the animals, or the physical environment.

These science-based divisions are complemented and supported by numerous other units that ensure their ongoing operations such as the Office of Science Planning, Program Support and Services, Scientific Informatic Services, Science Support and Client Services, Surveillance and References Services, the Facility and Property Management Division, and the Biorisk and Occupational Safety Services Division. NML also funds the National Reference Centre for Parasitology in Montreal and has a Laboratory Liaison Technical Officer in most provincial labs.

== Workforce ==

NML employs scientists (MD, PhD, and DVM), biologists, and laboratory technicians, but it also includes informatics specialists, biosafety experts, specialized operations and maintenance staff, and administrative staff, among others. In total, there are approximately 600 staff members as of 2016.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

== Accomplishments ==

NML is renowned{{cn|date=July 2018}} for its work on a broad spectrum of infectious diseases from seasonal influenza to Ebola and its accomplishments are too many to detail.

Some recent examples of the work done by NML include their involvement in the response to the West African Ebola outbreak. For a period of about 18 months, teams from NML travelled to West Africa to aid in the diagnostics during the outbreak. They worked closely with the World Health Organization and Médecins sans frontières to ensure people were properly diagnosed so that they could be properly cared for and isolated from others to stop the spread. Also during this outbreak, a promising vaccine and treatment for Ebola that were developed at NML, in conjunction with collaborators, were fast tracked into clinical trials so that they could get to the people that needed it as soon as possible.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Another accomplishment was the response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In April 2009, the Mexican national lab approached NML for assistance with identifying a respiratory virus that was causing outbreaks in Mexico. NML was able to quickly identify the new virus and recognize that it matched the virus that was beginning to circulate in the U.S. As the lead laboratory in Canada, NML rapidly developed diagnostic tests and equipped provincial labs to be able to test for the new virus.  NML also assisted Mexico by providing additional testing and sent staff to their national laboratory to enable to help them set up their own testing protocols.

In the international laboratory sector, NML has developed different types of mobile labs: a lab-truck, a lab-trailer, and a “lab in a suitcase.” The lab-truck is generally used for in-country deployments at high-profile events such as the 2010 Olympics, the lab-trailer is used for international large-scale events where there may be a threat of bio-terrorism or other deliberate acts involving infectious agents, and the lab in a suitcase is frequently used in remote areas of the world with little available infrastructure. An example would be the multiple deployments over the years to combat outbreaks of Ebola in Africa. This model was adopted by many other countries during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

NML houses the secretariats for both the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network (CPHLN) and the Global Health Security Action Group – Laboratory Network (GHSAG-LN). The role of CPHLN is to provide a forum for public health laboratory leaders to share knowledge. The GHSAG-LN network’s goals are to coordinate the diagnostic capabilities of all participants and contribute to disease surveillance around the world.

The Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) is an innovation developed by NML staff. It is a secure web-based system that compiles information from various surveillance systems and issues alerts to users. More than 4,000 public health officials across Canada now subscribe to it. CNPHI tools assist in determining the existence or extent of an outbreak through the recognition of related cases across jurisdictions.

== Directors ==

From 2000 to 2014, Dr. [[Frank Plummer]] was the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory. Under Dr. Plummer's guidance, the NML developed into one of the world's premier institutions in the research, detection, and response to global infectious disease and bio-security threats.

Dr. Plummer received his medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1976. Between 1984 and 2001, Dr. Plummer lived in Nairobi, Kenya where he spearheaded the development of the world renowned "Kenya AIDS Control Program," established by the Universities of Manitoba and Nairobi. This HIV epidemiological work was central to global understanding of the risk factors for HIV transmission and how to prevent its spread. Dr. Plummer was the first to reveal that heterosexual women could also be infected with HIV/AIDS and that a cohort of Nairobi sex workers had a natural immunity to HIV/AIDS. This latter discovery suggested the possibility that a vaccine could eventually be developed.

Dr. Plummer stepped down as the NML’s Scientific Director General to take the position as senior adviser to the Agency's Chief Public Health Officer in 2014. He continues to be a distinguished professor at the University of Manitoba and a Canada Research Chair.

In 2015, Dr. Matthew Gilmour became the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory and the Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses. Dr. Gilmour spearheaded the partnership that brought these two laboratories together under the National Microbiology Laboratory umbrella. He was previously the Chief, Enteric Diseases and subsequently the Program Director, Bacteriology and Enteric Diseases at the NML.

Dr. Gilmour has won a number of scientific awards including Canadian Society of Microbiologists’ Canadian Graduate Student Microbiologist of the Year Award; the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Most Promising Researcher Merit Award and Dr. Andrés Petrasovits Public Health Merit Award; and Health Canada’s Excellence Award in Collaborative Leadership and Award for Excellence in Science. Dr. Gilmour continues to be an Assistant Professor at the University of Manitoba’s Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases as well as the Secretary Treasurer of the Canadian Association for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (CACMID).

In April 2013, the company filed for bankruptcy due to [[liquidity]] problems.&lt;ref name=apr/&gt;

==History==
Pescanova was founded in 1960 by [[José Fernández López]], who established the company in [[Vigo]]. From its beginnings Pescanova introduced cutting-edge technology for the complete activity of fish processing, best defined by the [[factory ship]] which was not common in Spain at the time. The business model worked and allowed a continued growth making it one of the biggest firms in the [[fishing industry]].

In 1980 [[Manuel Fernández de Sousa-Faro]], the son of the founder, took over the presidency and, after a period of restructuring, Pescanova became a multinational empire. In 1985 it joined [[Madrid Stock Exchange]].

With more than 120 fishing boats and 150,000 tons of fish products sold into the global market every year, Pescanova is among the top 5 companies in its sector. Besides the Spanish facilities, the company has production plants in 21 countries,&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; amongst which are [[Portugal]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Namibia]] and [[Honduras]].  It had in 2013 approximately 3,400 employees.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

On 15 April 2013, Pescanova filed in Spanish court for bankruptcy protection. The insolvency filing mentions debts of 1.5bn euros, but financial sources who have had dealings with the company say total debt is probably more than double that amount, potentially making it the country's third-largest bankruptcy.  The court accepted the filing and said it would name independent administrators to replace the board.  Pescanova revealed only on the day of the insolvency filing that Fernandez Sousa had sold half his 14.4 percent stake in the company in the months leading up to the filing without telling regulators, as required by law.&lt;ref name=apr&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/26/us-spain-pescanova-insight-idUSBRE93P06020130426 reuters.com: "Insight: Failure of Spain's Pescanova lifts lid on culture of secrecy"], 26 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The multinational empire had by January 2014 an accumulated debt of $5.8bn euros, according to Spain's National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;  In January 2014, three multinational investment funds were interested to refloat the bankrupt company with approximately 300m euros.  The company operated under court protection while arrangements were made.  The interested investors are consortia of&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.mercopress.com/2014/01/13/three-investment-funds-interested-in-recapitalization-of-bankrupt-pescanova mercopress: "Three investment funds interested in recapitalization of bankrupt Pescanova" 14 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[S.A. Damm|Damm]], [[Luxempart]], [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] and [[Ergon Capital Partners]];
# [[Centerbridge]] and [[Bluecrest]] [[vulture funds]],
# the major domestic creditor banks - [[Banco Sabadell]], [[Banco Popular]], [[NCG Banco]], [[Bankia]], [[CaixaBank]], [[Grupo Santander|Santander]] and [[BBVA]]

The current board and management were opposed by minority shareholders.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; A director of Pescanova, [[Luis Angel Sanchez Merlo]], resigned on 14 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fis.com/fis/companies/details.asp?l=e&amp;filterby=companies&amp;=&amp;country_id=&amp;page=1&amp;company_id=23019&amp;submenu=cpp fis.com: Pescanova SA, company news, "Pescanova adviser resigns" 14 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, negotiations were under way to separate Pesca Chile from the others through an offer by [[Cooke Aquaculture]] of Canada and [[Econsult]] of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=upi&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/01/13/Canada-eyes-Chilean-arm-of-troubled-Spanish-fishery-firm/UPI-77481389664245/ upi.com: "Canada eyes Chilean arm of troubled Spanish fishery firm" 13 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2014, Pescanova disclosed a new set of over 2bn euros outstanding loans to its restructuring committee.
The loans are trading at about 12 cents on the euro while 160mn euros of its convertible bonds are quoted at about 14 cents. Lenders were willing to accept losses of 60 percent on the debt in exchange for a 90 percent stake in the [[Pontevedra]], Spain-based business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-17/pescanova-hidden-debt-lenders-face-90-losses-corporate-finance bloomberg.com: "Pescanova Hidden Debt Lenders Face 90% Losses: Corporate Finance"], 17 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2014, the major domestic creditor banks agreed to lift the bankruptcy, and the company remained as one of the Galician multinationals.  Damm and Luxempart were sidelined, and as a result, Jose Carceller of Damm and Francois Tesch of Luxempart resigned from the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2014/05/02/pescanova-restructuring-plan-officially-approved-with-63-65-creditors-support/ undercurrentnews.com: "Pescanova restructuring plan officially approved with 63% creditor support"], 2 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-01/pescanova-seen-winning-creditor-vote-for-bank-led-restructuring bloomberg.com: "Pescanova Seen Winning Creditor Vote for Debt Restructuring"], 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2014, Pescanova exited bankruptcy proceedings after 403 days. The restructuring plan had received support from 65% of its major domestic creditor banks.  The company was to continue under administration by [[Deloitte]], until the subsequent shareholders’ meeting.  On 22 May 22, Deloitte reported to the Spanish financial regulator CNMV the resignation of [[Juan Manuel Urgoiti]], who had been chairman of the Spanish multinational since September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2014/05/23/pescanova-officially-out-of-bankruptcy-after-403-days/ undercurrentnews.com: "Pescanova officially out of bankruptcy, after 403 days"], 23 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2015, Manuel Fernandez Sousa-Faro was chastised because of his failure to report a number of properties to the Court, which had fined him for his role in the collapse of Pescanova.  In January 2014, Fernandez had been condemned, along with colleagues Carlos Turci, Alfonso Garcia and Angel Gonzales, Alfonso Paz-Andrade, Fernando Fernandez, Robert Albert Williams, Antonio Taboas, Joaquin Vina, Alfredo Lopez and ICS Holding Limited, for their contributions to the collapse of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2015/01/08/former-pescanova-chairman-omitted-patrimony-unwittingly-to-pay-imposed-fines/ undercurrentnews.com: "Former Pescanova chairman omitted patrimony ‘unwittingly’ to pay imposed fines"], 8 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 February 2015, the company reported profits of 1.6bn euros, which contrasted with losses one year earlier that totalled 718mn euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2015/02/02/pescanova-reverses-losses-with-e1-6m-net-profit/ undercurrentnews.com: "Pescanova reverses losses, ups operating profit"], 2 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  By 6 February 2015, New York-based hedge fund [[Broadbill Investment Partners]] had acquired 3.69% of Pescanova, according to records of the Spanish financial regulator [[CNMV]].  The financial regulator showed Pescanova's former chairman [[Manuel Fernandez de Sousa]] as the company's largest shareholder with 7.5% of shares, followed by the Spanish heiress [[Carolina Herrero Masaveu]], with 7.1% and Spanish brewery [[S.A. Damm|Damm]], which lost its bid to control the fishing giant the previous year, with 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undercurrentnews.com/2015/02/06/us-investment-fund-buys-stake-in-pescanova/ undercurrentnews.com: "US investment fund buys stake in Pescanova"], 6 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Johan Bøyesen''' (13 January 1799 &amp;ndash; 24 November 1867&lt;ref name="skips"&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/porsgrunn-1957/b2/ph-12d.html Trelast og ishandel, skipsbygging og skipsfart 1860-1890. Skipsfarten], in volume two of ''Porsgrunns historie'', by Joh. N. Tønnessen. Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] businessperson and politician.

==Personal life==
Peter Johan Bøyesen was born in Western [[Porsgrunn|Porsgrund]] 1799 as the son of shipmaster and boat pilot Peter Bøye Larsen.&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/porsgrunn-1957/b2/ph-05a.html Nye veier, nye menn, nye kriser], in volume two of ''Porsgrunns historie'', by Joh. N. Tønnessen. Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his sons, named Peter, became a shipbuilder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/porsgrunn-1957/b2/ph-12c.html Trelast og ishandel, skipsbygging og skipsfart 1860-1890. Skipsbyggeriets storhetstid], in volume two of ''Porsgrunns historie'', by Joh. N. Tønnessen. Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bøyesen started his career as a shipmaster and trader. He had been a trainee with [[Hans Eleonardus Møller, Sr.]] at an early age, from 1813, and then bought his first ship in 1818, sailing from Porsgrund to [[Copenhagen]]. Timber and iron were traded for grain. While losing the ship at sea, he replaced it by investing in new ships. The trade routes were later expanded to the [[Baltic Sea]]. In 1834 he acquired burghership, and expanded his business as a grain and timber merchant and ship-owner.&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt;

Bøyesen was active in the local community. First, he was a benefactor for the literary circle ''Porsgrunds Læseselskab'', founded by [[Jens Gasmann]] in 1833. For the purpose of general enlightenment, Bøyesen founded the ''Henrik Wergelands Almuebogsamling'', a public library.&lt;ref name="tønnessen"&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/porsgrunn-1957/b2/ph-08a.html Byens liv. Foreninger, organisasjoner og selskaper. Aviser og politisk interesse], in volume two of ''Porsgrunns historie'', by Joh. N. Tønnessen. Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the latter organization he was the first chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/bibliotek/lund1946.html Henrik Wergelands Folkeboksamling 1846 - 1946], by Ernst W. Lund. Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a board member of the first [[temperance movement|temperance]] society in Porsgrund, named the ''Porsgrunds Forening mod Brændevins-Drik'', founded in December 1845 with former mayor [[Ole Hersted Schjøtt]] as chairman.&lt;ref name="tønnessen"/&gt; He was also a founder and board member of the local seamen's society, one of the first of its kind in Norway.&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt;

In 1843 he proposed establishing the [[Porsgrunds Sparebank|local savings bank]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/porsgrunn-1957/b2/ph-09.html Skipsassuranse og banker], in volume two of ''Porsgrunns historie'', by Joh. N. Tønnessen. Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, was done in the role of politician. Bøyesen was elected mayor of [[Porsgrunn|Porsgrund]] municipality for the years 1843, 1844 and 1846,&lt;ref name="mayors"&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/lund/Lund_19.html Ordførere og viceordførere], by Carl Lund. Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt; having first been elected to the [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] in 1842.&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt; Bøyesen was then elected to the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] in 1845, 1854, 1857 and 1859/60, representing the constituency [[Porsgrund]].&lt;ref name="nsd"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071107211656/http://samfunnsveven.no/TT/U21.cfm?Utside=&amp;Uttaksnummer=21&amp;person=10398 Peter Johan Boyesen born 1799] - Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848 he had been elected deputy representative from the constituency ''Porsgrund og Brevig''.&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt; In his political views, he was described by one historian as proto-[[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]] (political parties did not exist until 1884), having been vocally supported by later Liberal Party founder and [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] [[Johan Sverdrup]] in their common opposition of Conservative [[Anton Martin Schweigaard]] during the 1860 debate on the Merchant Shipping Act (''Sjøfartsloven'').&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt;

Bøyesen went bankrupt in July 1867, following general economic hardships. The city had seen only one bankruptcy in 1866, but 32 from 1868 to 1871. This depression was partially caused by the difficult transition from [[wooden ship|wooden]] to [[steam ship]]s. Four months after his bankruptcy, Bøyesen died.&lt;ref name="skips"/&gt;

This is a partial list of notable '''[[price fixing]] and [[bid rigging]] cases'''.

==US==
A federal district court in February 1961 fined 29 electrical manufacturing companies and 45 individuals a total of $1,924,500 for violating the [[antitrust laws]] by fixing prices and rigging bids on heavy electrical equipment, some of which was sold to the Government.&lt;ref&gt;CQ almanac [http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal61-879-29203-1371699 Electrical Price Fixing Stirs Inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air travel===
On 1 August 2007 it was reported that [[British Airways]] has been fined £121.5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =  BA gets £121.5m price-fixing fine| publisher = BBC News | date = 8 January 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6925397.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for price-fixing. The fine was imposed by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) after BA admitted to the price-fixing of fuel surcharges on long haul flights. The allegation first came to light in 2006 when [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]] reported the events to the authorities after it found staff members from BA and [[Virgin Atlantic]] were colluding. Virgin Atlantic have since been granted immunity by both the OFT and the [[United States Department of Justice]] who have been investigating the allegations since June 2006. The US DOJ later announced that it would fine British Airways [[$]]300 million (£148 million) for price fixing.

The allegations are thought to be linked to the resignation of commercial director Martin George and communications chief Iain Burns. Although BA said fuel surcharges were "a legitimate way of recovering costs", in May 2007 it put aside £350 million for legal fees and fines.

===Beer===
On 18 April 2007 The [[European commission]] imposed fines on [[Heineken]]  €219.3m, [[Grolsch]] €31.65m and [[Bavaria Brewery (Netherlands)|Bavaria]]  €22.85m for operating a [[cartel|price fixing cartel]] in the [[Netherlands]], totalling €273.7m. [[InBev]], (formerly [[Interbrew]]), escaped without a penalty because it provided "decisive information" about the cartel which operated between 1996 and 1999 and others in the EU market. The brewers controlled 95% of the Dutch market, with [[Heineken]] claiming a half and the three others 15% each.&lt;ref name = 'beer'&gt;{{cite news | first= David| last= Gow| coauthors= | title=Heineken and Grolsch fined for price-fixing | date= 18 April 2007| publisher= | url =http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2059542,00.html | work =[[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 1 August 2007 | language = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neelie Kroes]] said she was "very disappointed" that the collusion took place at the very highest (boardroom) level. She added, [[Heineken]], [[Grolsch]], [[Bavaria]] and [[InBev]] tried to cover their tracks by using code names and abbreviations for secret meetings to carve up the market for beer sold to [[supermarkets]], [[hotels]], [[restaurants]] and [[cafes]]. The [[price fixing]] extended to cheaper [[Store brand|own-brand]] labels and [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]] for [[Bar (establishment)|bars]].&lt;ref name = 'beer'/&gt;

{{quote|This is simply unacceptable: that major beer suppliers colluded to up prices and to carve up markets among themselves.&lt;ref name = 'beer' /&gt;|[[EU Competition Commissioner]] [[Neelie Kroes]]}}

In December 2001 Interbrew, [[Danone]] (former owner of Kronenbourg), and two other smaller brewers were fined €91m for operating a cartel in [[Belgium]] while four Luxembourg companies were fined €448,000 the same month.&lt;ref name = 'beer' /&gt;

In 2004, [[Heineken]] and [[Kronenbourg]], the two dominant brewers in France, were fined €2.5m - with the penalty reduced for co-operating. A similar inquiry into an alleged Italian cartel was closed without proceedings while the British and German beer markets were specifically excluded.&lt;ref name = 'beer' /&gt;

===Switchgear===

In January 2007 [[Siemens]] was fined €396 million over its role in a [[collusion]] scandal. The [[European Commission]] handed out a massive €750 million in fines to Siemens, [[Alstom]], [[Areva]], [[Schneider Electric]] and Japanese firms [[Fuji Electric]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Japan AE Systems]]. Switzerland's [[ABB Group]] was a [[whistleblower]] and escaped without any fine from the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Vote call by Siemens shareholders  | date= 25 January 2007| publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6296985.stm | work =[[BBC]] | pages = | accessdate = 1 August 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulators found that the companies [[bid rigging|rigged bids for contracts]] and [[price fixing|fixed prices]] in the market for [[Switchgear|gas-insulated switchgear]] - equipment is used to control the flow of energy in electricity grids. Siemens' fine was the biggest of the companies involved because it was a ringleader, the Commission said. About 30 business premises and private homes were searched as part of the investigation.

The cartel swapped information on offers from customers and operated a quota system for the division of work. Bids were rigged so that tenders went to whichever firm was due work under the quota system. "Code names were used for both companies and individuals. They relied on anonymous email addresses for communication and used [[encryption]] for sending messages," said the Commission.&lt;ref name=out-law&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Siemens hit with €396 million price fixing fine | date= | publisher= | url=http://www.out-law.com/page-7701 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 1 August 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The General Court reduces the fines of certain members of the gas insulated switchgear cartel |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_CJE-11-5_en.pdf |format=PDF |location=Luxembourg |publisher=General Court of the European Union |agency= |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dairy products===
On 7 December 2007, [[Sainsbury's]], [[Asda]], [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]], [[Dairy Crest]], [[Robert Wiseman Dairies]] and [[The Cheese Company]] have all admitted that they had secretly swapped information with each other to make shoppers pay more for milk and cheese in a £270m [[price-fixing]] conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=427337&amp;in_page_id=2&amp;ito=1565|title=Supermarkets fined £116m for price-fixing|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartel agreed in principle with the [[Office of Fair Trading]] that they conspired against the interests of consumers. In their defense, the corporations have publicly said they had been under pressure to help farmers hit by [[foot-and-mouth]], however, the OFT said "I think it is reasonable to say we don't doubt the purpose initially was to pass money back to farmers but, in general, there is no evidence that [[farm gate price]] increased as a result of the initiative. We don't know what happened to the money."

All the major UK store chains, with the exception of [[Waitrose]] and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], are embroiled in the OFT inquiry into [[milk]] prices in 2002 and 2003 which has been ongoing since the beginning of 2004. It was accepted by [[Asda]], Sainsbury and Safeway that stores increased the price of milk as a result of collusion. [[Dairy Crest]] and [[Robert Wiseman Dairies|Wiseman]] allegedly acted as middle men, passing on sensitive information about prices to their supposed rivals. Britain's biggest store chain [[Tesco]], and [[Morrisons]], are accused of collusion too, but vigorously deny they took part. The allegations against Tesco involve [[cheese]] as well as [[milk]] and [[butter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/07/supermarkets?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront|title=OFT hands out £116m in fines for milk price fixing|first1=Fiona|last1=Walsh|first2=business|last2=editor|date=7 December 2007|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the OFT proves its case, the retailers could theoretically face fines of up to 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover, which in Tesco's case would amount to £4.3bn. The Office of Fair Trading told Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway, Dairy Crest, Wiseman and The Cheese Company they faced maximum fines of £116m, though the final figure may be as low as £80m as a result of their co-operation. [[Sainsbury's]] told the [[London Stock Exchange]] that its fine was £26m. The fine for [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] is thought to be between £8m and £10m; £9m for [[Dairy Crest]] and £6m for [[Robert Wiseman Dairies|Robert Wiseman]]. It is unclear who blew the whistle on the price-fixing but [[Arla Foods|Arla]], the dairy processor, will escape a fine after fully co-operating with authorities. Consumer advocate [[Which?]] Ltd complained that, despite overpaying £270m, [[consumer]]s would not receive any refunds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article3233342.ece|title=Milked!

===Construction===
In April 2008, The [[Office of Fair Trading]] named 112 companies that it says colluded to inflate the cost of a wide range of contracts worth billions of pounds, including tenders for schools, universities and hospitals.&lt;ref name='building'/&gt;

The list includes several publicly listed companies, including [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Kier Group]] and [[Carillion]], with 80 of the firms have already admitted participating in some form of bid-rigging, or have applied for leniency in return for assisting the OFT. The allegations centre around "cover pricing", in which firms secretly agreed the prices they would submit during a tender process. A firm that did not want to win the contract would submit a price that was much too high. In some cases, the eventual successful bidder would then reward them with a secret payment. This bid rigging often involved false invoices. The OFT declined to comment on the value of the fraud.&lt;ref name='building'&gt;[http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/52-08 OFT issues statement of objections against 112 construction companies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420231329/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/52-08 |date=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial===
In April 2003, The London office of [[ABN Amro]] was fined £900,000 for helping a US client, Oechsle International Advisers, to rig share prices. The fine was the [[Financial Services Authority|FSA]]'s fifth biggest, and is the largest involving market abuse on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name='abm'/&gt;

ABN's then joint head of the UK equity trading desk, Michael Ackers, has been fined £70,000 for "market misconduct." The FSA decided that traders in ABN Amro Equities (UK), known as AAE, "accepted improper instructions whose apparent purpose was to push the closing market price of certain shares to a higher level than would otherwise have been the case". This happened on three separate occasions between April and October 1998 in respect of shares in Carlton Communications, British Biotech, Volkswagen and Metro. Angelo Iannone, the head of ABN's international sales trading desk in New York, had had a long-standing relationship with Oechsle and one of its fund managers, Andrew Parlin. They agreed to increase the price of the shares in question at the end of certain days' trading, to make the prices look better in clients' portfolios.&lt;ref name='abm'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/abn-fined-pound900000-for-price-rigging-595508.html|title=US|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7390">'''Resin casting''' is a method of plastic [[casting]] where a [[Moulding (process)|mold]] is filled with a liquid [[synthetic resin]], which then hardens. It is primarily used for small-scale production like industrial prototypes and dentistry. It can be done by amateur [[hobby]]ists with little initial investment, and is used in the production of collectible toys, models and figures, as well as small-scale jewellery production.

The synthetic resin for such processes is a [[monomer]] for making a plastic [[thermosetting polymer]]. During the setting process, the liquid monomer polymerizes into the polymer, thereby hardening into a solid. 

Single-monomer resins may be used in the process, which form [[homopolymer]]s (polymers containing only one type of polymer). In such uses, the "curing agent" mixed with the resin contains what is loosely referred to as a "[[catalyst]]," but which is more technically an initial source of free radicals (such as [[MEKP]]) to act as an initiator in a free-radical chemical [[chain reaction]] polymerization. Alternately, resin casting may be accomplished with a resin plus a nearly equal amount of a "hardener" liquid (as in many [[epoxy resin]] or [[polyester resin]] systems), which functionally contains a second polymer, for use in forming a final product plastic which is a [[copolymer]]. Copolymers contain two different alternating chemical entities in the final polymer molecule.

==Process==
Most commonly a [[Thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] resin is used that [[Polymerization|polymerizes]] by mixing with a [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] agent (polymerization catalyst) at room temperature and normal pressure. The resins are named by analogy with plant resins, but are synthetic monomers for making polymer plastics. The so-called synthetic resins used include [[polystyrene]] resin, [[polyurethane]] resin, [[epoxy]] resin, unsaturated [[polyester resin]], [[acrylic resin]] and [[silicone resin]].

Epoxy resin has a lower viscosity than polyurethane resin {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}; polyester resin also shrinks markedly while curing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmolds.com/polyurethane]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acrylic resin]], in particular the [[methyl methacrylate]] type of synthetic resin, produces [[acrylic glass]] (also called PMMA, Lucite, Plexiglass), which is not a glass but a plastic polymer that is transparent, and very hard. It is suitable for embedding objects (such as, for example, [[acrylic trophy|acrylic trophies]]), for display purposes. [[Styrene]] is a similar liquid monomer at room temperature, which will also polymerize into clear glass-like [[polystyrene]] plastic, with addition of a suitable catalyst.

A [[flexible mold]] can be made of [[latex]] rubber, [[Vulcanization#Room temperature vulcanization|room temperature vulcanized]] [[silicone]] rubber or other similar materials at relatively low cost, but can only be used for a limited number of castings.

The simplest method is gravity casting where the resin is poured into the mold and pulled down into all the parts by gravity. When the two part resin is mixed air bubbles tend to be introduced into the liquid which can be removed in a [[vacuum chamber]]. The casting can also be done in a vacuum chamber (when using open molds) to either extract these bubbles, or in a pressure pot, to reduce their size to the point where they aren't visible. Pressure and/or centrifugal force can be used to help push the liquid resin into all details of the mold. The mold can also be vibrated to expel bubbles.

Each unit requires some amount of hands-on labor, making the final cost per unit produced fairly high. This is in contrast to [[injection molding]] where the initial cost of creating the metal mold is higher, but the mold can be used to produce a much higher number of units, resulting in a lower cost per unit.

==Collectibles and models==
[[File:Silicone mold resin cast figure.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A custom resin cast [[Pinky:St]] part and two-part silicone mold]]
Resin casting is used to produce collectible and customized toys and figures like [[designer toys]], [[garage kit]]s and [[ball-jointed doll]]s, as well as [[scale model]]s, either individual parts or entire models of objects like [[Rail transport modelling|trains]], [[Model aircraft|aircraft]] or [[Ship model|ships]]. They are generally produced in small quantities, from the tens to a few hundred copies, compared to injection-molded plastic figures which are produced in many thousands. Resin casting is more labor intensive than injection molding, and the soft molds used are worn down by each cast. The low initial investment cost of resin casting means that individual hobbyists can produce small runs for their own use, such as customization, while companies can use it to produce small runs for public sale.

The creation of a toy or figure start with the traditional [[sculpting]] process where the artist designs a [[clay]] sculpture. Where appropriate, for example when making a garage kit, the sculpture is dissected into several parts like head, torso, arms and legs. A flexible mold made from [[Vulcanization#Vulcanization of silicones|room temperature vulcanized]] (RTV) silicone rubber is made for each part.

After the mold has been made, a synthetic [[resin]] - such as polyurethane or epoxy - mixed with a curing agent, is poured into each mold cavity. Mixing the two liquid parts causes an [[exothermic reaction]] which generates heat and within minutes causes the material to harden, yielding castings or copies in the shape of the mold into which it has been poured. The molds are commonly half-divided (like the hollowed chocolate Easter eggs with candy inside) and a [[release agent]] may be used to make removal of the hardened/set resin from the mold easier. The hardened resin casting is removed from the flexible mold and allowed to cool.
[[File:SHKANGLE.JPG|thumb|250px|A Baldwin 6-axle locomotive kit cast in resin in HO Scale]]
Due to aggressive nature of most compounds used for casting and the high temperature of the reaction the mold gradually degrades and loses small details. Typically, a flexible mold will yield between 25 and 100 castings depending upon the size of the part, the intensity of the heat generated.

Depending on the type of product it may then be cut or sanded to remove any casting artefacts like [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprues]] and seams. Some products are also assembled and painted, while some models and kits, which are intended for the consumer to assemble, are left unfinished.

The ability of RTV silicone molds to reproduce even the tiniest detail means that many of these low volume castings are of very high quality. Quality of both original masters and resin castings varies due to differences in creator's skill, as well as casting techniques.

The '''Sukkur IBA University''' (''previously'' '''Sukkur Institute of Business Administration''' or '''Sukkur IBA''') ({{lang-sd|'''سکر آئي بي اي يونيورسٽي'''}}) is a higher education institute in [[Sukkur]], [[Pakistan]]. 
The university is a public sector degree-awarding institute chartered by the [[Government of Sindh]] and recognized by the Higher Education Commission.

==History==

In 1994, the school was established as '''Sukkur Institute of Business Administration'''. It was located initially in hired rooms of Public School Sukkur building in Sukkur. At first, Sukkur IBA was affiliated to [[Institute of Business Administration, Karachi]]; with founding Director Professor Dr. Syed Anwar Ali Shah (Present Pro-Vice Chancellor University of Sindh) the institute received its full charter from the Government of Sindh in 2006, creating an opportunity for the Sindhi youth.  The institute is ranked 3rd among the five independent business schools of Pakistan included in the Higher Education Commission Pakistan Business School Ranking-2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paked.net/higher_education/hec_university_rankings.htm : Higher Education Commission (HEC) ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2017, [[Provincial Assembly of Sindh|Sindh Assembly]] approved promotion of institute from Sukkur IBA to Sukkur IBA University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nation.com.pk/karachi/16-May-2017/sa-approves-iba-university-in-sukkur|title=SA approves IBA university in Sukkur|last=Nation|first=The|date=16 May 2017|website=Nation PK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

==Garma Festival==

For several years Mr Burarrwanga has been actively involved in the management of cultural programs at the annual [[Garma Festival]] of Traditional Cultures held at the Gulkula site in north eastern Arnhem Land.&lt;ref&gt;Garma sponsor, [http://www.cdu.edu.au/garma-report/outcomes/index.html Charles Darwin University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311143951/http://www.cdu.edu.au/garma-report/outcomes/index.html |date=11 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 Garma Festival===

:At the 2005 Garma Festival Mr Burarrwaŋa talked openly of his experiences in developing his own tourism company. As a speaker for a Garma session focused on key outcomes for tourism he used the metaphor of building a house to describe the chain of processes and challenges required to create the final dream.

:Mr Burarrwanga stressed it was important to employ and train Yolŋu people at home, to give them respect and responsibilities for their rights and for their future. Up until 2005 his tourism business's development involved six years of hard work, persistence, and many challenges.

:He went on to point out that it was much harder for an Indigenous person to succeed in a business than for members of the mainstream population. The complication being that there was the responsibility to comply with the wishes of the traditional owners in addition to the 'whitefella' law. During his talk he shared that he had experienced frustrations in dealing with the various government bodies and associations. They had an overwhelming propensity for talking and achieved little that was practical.&lt;ref&gt;Garma 2005 Session 6 Where Have We Been? Where Are We Going?

===Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians===

In '''December 2010''' the Australian Government announced that Mr Burarrwanga was to join other prominent members to sit on the 'Expert Panel' on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians. The role of the panel being to lead a wide-ranging national public consultation and engagement program throughout 2011, before reporting its findings to the Australian Government by December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians, [http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/sa/indigenous/progserv/engagement/Pages/membership_expert_panel.aspx FAHCSIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''February 2011''' Mr Burarrwanga met with the other Expert Panelists for the first time in Canberra. The following is a brief excerpt from the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians Communiqué 16–17 February 2011;

:&lt;small&gt;The Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians appointed by the Australian Government came to Canberra over two days for our first historic meeting.

:The Panel welcomes the commitment of successive Federal Governments to constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and acknowledges the support of all major Australian political parties and independents.

:The Panel is united in its view that constitutional recognition will benefit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and all Australians.

:Members reflected on the privilege and responsibility of the role with which they have been charged. They acknowledged that their work will facilitate one of our most important national conversations.

:The Panel’s diverse experience makes it well placed to provide guidance and support in stimulating this conversation, and providing considered advice to government.

:Co-chair [[Patrick Dodson]] spoke about the importance of the Panel’s role in engaging the Australian nation to set the foundations for recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within the constitution:

:''“Recognition by the nation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution will advance reconciliation and contribute towards a more united Australia. It is important to open a new chapter which celebrates the richness of Australia’s connected cultural history”.''

:Co-chair Mark Leibler welcomed the Panel: ''“ It’s wonderful to hear from such a diverse group of Australians with wide ranging views united behind a common purpose”.''

:The Panel is made up of Australians from Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities: people from small and large business, community leaders, academia and members of parliament across the political spectrum – from all states, city and country.

:The Panel considered how best to engage all Australians and ensure a wide range of ideas are sought and heard. The conversation will continue throughout the year and the Panel encourages all Australians to be involved.

:A discussion paper on constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples will be released for public comment as the starting point for Australia’s conversation on this significant issue.

:In December 2011, the Panel will report to the Australian Government on possible options for recognition and the likely degree of support they could receive from the Australian population.&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué 16–17 February 2011,[http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/sa/indigenous/progserv/engagement/Documents/communique_expert_panel_indig.pdf FAHCSIA]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/small&gt;

==Early life, education, career and controversy==
Bell was born on 18 October 1941, to Greta Mary Finlay, an Australian, and Arthur Leigh Bell, who was Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timothy John Leigh Bell, Baron Bell|url=http://thepeerage.com/p13721.htm#i137206 |publisher=Lundy Consulting Ltd |work=The Peerage |accessdate=7 December 2011 |date=10 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys|Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Barnet]], and joined [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] at 18 as a post boy.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/7601491/Tim-Bell-Theres-never-been-so-much-tension-between-business-and-politicians.html "Tim Bell: 'There's never been so much tension between business and politicians'"], telegraph.co.uk, 17 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in various advertising/PR firms in the late 60s including the London agency Geers Gross, before helping to found and becoming [[Managing Director]] of [[Saatchi and Saatchi]] in 1970, later serving as Chairman and Managing Director of Saatchi and Saatchi Compton from 1975.

==Thatcher years==
Bell was instrumental in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] general election campaign victories of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and was seen as Thatcher's "favourite spin-doctor and confidant."&lt;ref name="vecono" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=A famous London PR firm suffers a PR disaster|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21728677-bell-pottinger-which-managed-some-controversial-reputations-receives-blow-its-own-brand|work=[[The Economist]]|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For her first [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 victory]], he created the '[[Labour Isn't Working]]' campaign&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; and advised the future Prime Minister on interview techniques, clothing, and even hairstyle choices.

Bell was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52543 |date=28 May 1991 |page=8208}}&lt;/ref&gt; after nomination by Margaret Thatcher, and created a [[Life Peer]] after nomination by [[Tony Blair]], as '''Baron Bell''' ''of [[Belgravia]] in the [[City of Westminster]]'' on 31 July 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=55216 |date=5 August 1998 |page=8519}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now often seen on panels and current affairs programmes discussing the issues of the day, and is Chairman of the Conservative Party's ''Keep the £ Campaign''. He has also served on various arts and public administration bodies. On 8 April 2013 it was Bell who officially announced the [[Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher|news of Lady Thatcher's death]].

==International work==
Bell advised [[Hernán Büchi]], a former minister of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet dictatorship]], in the [[Chilean general election, 1989|presidential election of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Beckett, ''Pinochet in Piccadilly. Britain and Chile's Hidden History'' (Faber and Faber, 2002), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Büchi eventually lost by a large margin to [[Patricio Aylwin]].&lt;ref name=AngellPollack1990&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angell |first=Alan |last2=Pollack |first2=Benny |date=1990 |title=The Chilean Elections of 1989 |journal=[[Bulletin of Latin American Research]] |publisher=Society for Latin American Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–23 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Bell, a friend of Russian tycoon [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], handled the media attention behind poisoned Russian ex-spy [[Alexander Litvinenko]], who died in hospital 23 November 2006. The Bell Pottinger Communications agency distributed a photograph showing a hairless Litvinenko in his hospital bed.

In December 2006 Lord Bell successfully lobbied on behalf of the [[Saudi government]] to discontinue the [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]] investigation into alleged bribes in the [[Al Yamamah#Investigation discontinued|Al Yamamah]] arms deal.&lt;ref name="guardianbrutal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/armstrade/story/0,,1973421,00.html| title=Brutal politics lesson for corruption investigators|author=David Leigh|author2=Rob Evans |date=16 December 2006|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Bell has also performed public relations work for the authoritarian government of [[Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12342630&amp;fsrc=rss "No breakthrough in Belarus"], ''The Economist'', 2 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and for the [[Pinochet]] Foundation (Fundación Pinochet). He has also worked as an advisor to former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moseley |first=Ray |date=18 February 1994 |title=Malaysia Dam Linked To Arms Deal With Britain |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-02-18/news/9402180371_1_british-airways-british-aid-malaysian-prime-minister-mahathir |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location=Chicago |accessdate=26 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Bell's lobbying interests were investigated by the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] for ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper which reported claims that the company attempts to interfere with Google results to "drown" out coverage of human rights abuses, that his employees had altered [[English Wikipedia]] entries to create a better impression of clients and had easy access (via former Conservative MP [[Tim Collins (politician)|Tim Collins]]) to the Cameron government and others overseas.&lt;ref name="NewmanWright"&gt;Melanie Newman and Oliver Wright  [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/caught-on-camera-top-lobbyists-boasting-how-they-influence-the-pm-6272760.html "Caught on camera: top lobbyists boasting how they influence the PM"], ''The Independent'', 6 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Bell-Pottinger, via a sting operation, were found to be willing to work for the authoritarian regime in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="NewmanWright"/&gt; Bell launched an internal inquiry, but believed he had been singled out for his connection with Mrs Thatcher.&lt;ref name=EveSta&gt;Stephen Robinson [https://web.archive.org/web/20111208213424/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-24019238-of-course-i-regret-it-i-need-it-like-a-hole-in-the-head-all-this-st.do "'Of course I regret it, I need it like a hole in the head, all this s**t'"], ''Evening Standard'' (London), 8 December 2011. Retrieved 27 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chime disposed of Bell Pottinger in June 2012 (while retaining a 25% stake in the business), when Bell also resigned as a director of Chime.&lt;ref name=ChimeCoD&gt;{{cite web|title=Completion of Disposal|url=http://www.chime.plc.uk/announcements/chime-final-of-mbo-new-director-of-board|work=Market Announcements, Monday 02 July 2012|publisher=Chime plc|accessdate=20 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130114050941/http://www.chime.plc.uk/announcements/chime-final-of-mbo-new-director-of-board|archivedate=14 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bell Pottinger exit under cloud of PR malpractice==
[[Bell Pottinger#.27White Monopoly Capital.27|Bell Pottinger]] announced Lord Bell's departure as chairman to set up an advisory firm, [http://www.sansfrontieresassociates.com/who-we-are/ Sans Frontières Associates], in August 2016. He retained a 7% stake in Bell Pottinger.&lt;ref name="Mance-25Aug2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mance|first1=Henry|title=Lord Bell quits as Bell Pottinger chairman|url=https://www.ft.com/content/10114318-6adb-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c?mhq5j=e3|accessdate=29 June 2017|work=Financial Times|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tony Walford, partner at [http://www.gsquare.co.uk/Team.aspx Green Square] stated, "Perhaps not coincidentally, Sans Frontières was the original name of the public relations firm he set up before it was renamed Bell Pottinger; it was also the name of the unit that handled the firm's controversial lobbying and consultancy work for the governments of countries such as Belarus and Sri Lanka."&lt;ref name="TD-2Sep2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walford|first1=Tony|title=Why maverick PR man Lord Bell may enjoy being his own man again|url=http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2016/09/02/sans-fronti-res-why-maverick-pr-man-lord-bell-may-enjoy-being-his-own-man-again|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The Drum|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A "leading PR figure" told ''[[The Times]]'' that his resignation from his own agency didn't come as a surprise, saying: "Ultimately, he did not fit with the kind of corporate image Bell Pottinger wanted to project", in the end.&lt;ref name="TD-26Aug2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stuart|first1=Rebecca|title=Lord Bell departs from Bell Pottinger to open new PR firm Sans Frontières|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/08/26/lord-bell-departs-bell-pottinger-open-new-pr-firm-sans-fronti-res|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The Drum|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Walford explains that, "there is big money to be made from representing governments and other entities, no matter how reviled they are. The problem is, this kind of activity sits increasingly uneasily with corporates keen on projecting a responsible image."&lt;ref name="TD-2Sep2016"/&gt;

In January 2017 the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' reported that [[Johann Rupert]], CEO of [[Remgro]] and [[Richemont]], ended an 18 year old contract with Bell Pottinger due to their 'concerted effort on social and other media to discredit him'. [[Johann Rupert|Rupert]] had spoken out against [[state capture]] and called on President [[Jacob Zuma]] to resign "for the sake of our children". As the [[State capture#South Africa|Guptas]] back [[Jacob Zuma#Gupta family relationship|Zuma]], Rupert asserted that Bell Pottinger painted him as the embodiment of [[Bell Pottinger#.27White Monopoly Capital.27|white monopoly capital]] and as the counterweight to the Guptas and state capture, an example of how state capture allegedly worked under apartheid.&lt;ref name="HP 25 January 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= du Toit |first= Pieter | authorlink= |title= How Rupert Was Warned About Bell Pottinger: 'They're Behind It.' |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/01/25/how-rupert-was-warned-about-bell-pottinger-theyre-behind-it_a_21662494/| date= 25 January 2017|work= [[Huffington Post]] |location=London| accessdate= 5 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven months after leaving Bell Pottinger and six days after the [[Public Relations and Communications Association]] (PRCA) acknowledged receipt of the Democratic Alliance's complaint,&lt;ref name="STSA-4Jul2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bell Pottinger probed for stoking racial tension in SA|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2017-07-04-bell-pottinger-probed-for-stoking-racial-tension-in-sa/|accessdate=5 July 2017|work=Sunday Times (South Africa)|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 July 2017 Bell announces for the first recorded time to ''[[PRWeek]]'' that he had left Bell Pottinger after raising his concerns about its "smelly" relationship with the [[Gupta family]]'s Oakbay conglomerate in South Africa but that they had "completely ignored me"; Bell Pottinger denied his claims.&lt;ref name="PRWeek 11 July 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Burne James |first= Sam | authorlink= |title= 'I kept saying it was smelly': Lord Bell claims Bell Pottinger ignored his concerns over Gupta work |url= http://www.prweek.com/article/1439079/i-kept-saying-smelly-lord-bell-claims-bell-pottinger-ignored-concerns-gupta-work| date= 11 July 2017|work= [[PRWeek]] |location=London| accessdate= 4 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRCA expelled Bell Pottinger for at least five years from September 2017 for inflaming racial tensions in [[South Africa]]. The PRCA found Bell Pottinger guilty of four breaches of its code of conduct and dispensed its toughest possible punishment. PRCA director-general, Francis Ingham told the [[Financial Times|FT]], "This is the most blatant instance of unethical PR practice I’ve ever seen. Bell Pottinger's work has set back South Africa by possibly 10 years."&lt;ref name="FT 4 September 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Bond |first= David | authorlink= |title= 'Bell Pottinger expelled by industry body for unethical practice |url= https://www.ft.com/content/66088476-9176-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c| date= 4 September 2017|work= [[Financial Times]] |location=London| accessdate= 4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a live ''[[Newsnight]]'' interview on 4 September 2017, Lord Bell mentioned that he was the most senior director at the several hour long initial meeting with the [[Gupta family|Guptas]]. Bell explained to [[Kirsty Wark]] that upon his return to London he told Bell Pottinger CEO [[James Henderson (businessman)|James Henderson]], "it's a very interesting piece of business but we can't handle it because there's a conflict of interest". [[Kirsty Wark|Wark]] then read Bell his own email, dated 26 January 2016, stating, "The trip was a great success and we will put forward a deal whereby we will earn £100,000 per month plus costs and I will oversee this and make further reports." Wark asserted that the email was in "direct conflict with what you just said". Bell went on to deny this on the basis the email was sent before his return to London. Rather than oversee the deal, Bell claimed that upon his return "I did absolutely nothing", but Bell Pottinger "submitted a [fee] proposal". Bell went on to deny Wark's assertion that he is the senior figure working on the Gupta account, but rather he is a "father figure of the meeting". Wark asked that when Bell, as the founder of the company, stated that there was a conflict of interest, "nobody listens? Really?". Bell responded, "Nobody listens to me. That's why I left the company". Wark then produced a further Bell-authored email, dated 3 months later (April 2016), in which Bell offered further advice regarding the account. Bell retorted, "You can attack me all you like but I had nothing to do with getting this account."&lt;ref name="HP 4 September 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Demianyk |first= Graeme | authorlink= |title= 'Lord Bell On BBC Newsnight: Bell Pottinger Co-Founder's Extraordinary Interview Amid Firm's South Africa Racism Row.

Bell's Newsnight performance was pilloried by the UK press, with ''[[The Spectator]]'' labelling it, "Lord Bell's Newsnight PR disaster".&lt;ref name="Spectator 5 September 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Steerpike |first=  | authorlink= |title= 'Lord Bell's Newsnight PR disaster. |url= https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5z2gi9eE2V0J:https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/09/lord-bells-newsnight-pr-disaster/+&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk| date= 5 September 2017|work= [[The Spectator]] |location=London| accessdate= 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' exclaimed, "Mr PR needs some PR.

The '''United Africa Company of Nigeria''' is a publicly listed company based in [[Nigeria]]. 
Its areas of operation include manufacturing, services, logistics and warehousing, agricultural and [[real estate]]. UACN's food operations include UAC Franchising, UAC Restaurants and UAC Dairies. It also has equity stake in UACN Property Development Company, a quoted firm, CAP Plc, makers of Dulux paints and Portland Paints, manufacturers of Sandtex paints. 

A former chairman of the board was Senator Udoma U.Udoma when Mr Larry Ettah was serving as Group Managing Director and CEO in 2010.

==History==
UAC Nigeria also known as UACN was first incorporated in Nigeria under the name Nigerian Motors Ltd on April 22, 1931 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[United Africa Company]] Ltd, the firm that later became UAC International (UACI). UAC International, a subsidiary of [[Unilever]], included in its business, the trading activities formerly carried on by a number of other companies including [[Royal Niger Company|The Niger Company]] Ltd. and the [[African &amp; Eastern Trade Corporation|African and Eastern Trade Corporation]] Ltd, all of which had long-standing trading links with West Africa. 

===Produce buying and merchandise trade period===
At inception, United Africa Company of Nigeria was a subsidiary of UACI's group of companies in Nigeria, a group that was incorporated to transact in selected markets within the country. Many of these companies later became divisions under UAC of Nigeria in 1973 following a consolidation exercise.&lt;ref name="har"&gt;{{Cite book |title=To the new Nigeria: a story of co-operation and fulfilment |last=Harrison |first=Godfrey |publisher=Newman Neame  |year=1960 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UACN's business activities was initially in the auto trade market but soon expanded into other areas. Strategic to its business conduct in Nigeria, the firm believed in the development of the economy and an improvement in the income of farmers and Nigerians as key to its success, this belief partly motivated its drive to expand into other areas of business. A major segment of the firm was produce buying of [[Cash crop|cash crops]] from local farmers for export to foreign markets. This activity also involved extension of credit to traders and middlemen who went into the hinterland to source for quality grades of produce. The firm operated in this market through staffing of personnel at different buying stations or through the use of traders and middlemen. When [[Marketing board|marketing boards]] were created for major cash crops such as [[Palm kernel oil|palm kernels]], [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] and groundnuts, UAC of Nigeria was appointed as one of the licensed buying agents. The company also traded in other agricultural products not regulated by the government such as [[Hide (skin)|hides and skins]], [[beeswax]], [[Natural rubber|rubber]], [[Vitellaria|shea nut]], [[Castor oil|castor seed]], [[piassava]], [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]], coffee, copra and [[Gum arabic|gum]].  The revenue from the sale of agricultural produce was used to import various goods for sale in the Nigerian market.&lt;ref name="har" /&gt; 

The firm's trade in consumer goods such as shirts, shoes, electrical appliances and mechanical equipment involved importation from various countries of the world, a process overseen by its parent company. Many goods distributed by the company were sold by middlemen or associate companies such as Kingsway Stores.&lt;ref name="har" /&gt;

The firm also managed transportation of bulk [[palm oil]] at buying points and storage at various ports in the country for onward distribution to foreign markets.  The firm had a fleet of river crafts operating within the internal water ways of the country, an operation that was managed out of UAC's office at [[Burutu]].  In addition, the firm helped to introduce new machinery for many pioneer oil mills in [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="har" /&gt;

===Restructuring period===
The company, whose name was changed to United Africa Company Ltd in 1943, retained the name until 1955 when it became The United Africa Company of Nigeria Ltd and started acquiring, over a period of five years, a large part of the business of UAC International. In 1960 C.W.A. Holdings Ltd, England also a subsidiary of Unilever, acquired the interest of UAC International in the company. Further re-organisation concluded in 1973 and resulted in the acquisition of a number of wholly owned fellow subsidiaries of C.W.A. Holdings. In 1968, Niger House, the new head office of UACN was completed. The 12 storey building was built by [[Taylor Woodrow]] and has adjacent structures including an 8 storey building at the rear.

Following re-organisation, the company conducted the acquired businesses as operating divisions, which are now in voluntary liquidation. The company took the name UAC of Nigeria Ltd in 1973. In compliance with the [[Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree|Nigerian Enterprises Promotion]] Act 1972, 40 percent of the company's share capital was acquired in 1974 by Nigerian citizens and associations and in accordance with the provisions of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Act 1977, an additional 20 percent of the UAC's share capital was publicly offered in 1977, increasing Nigerian equity participation to 60 percent. The name UACN Plc was adopted in 1991.

==Historical divisions==
From 1973 onwards, UACN managed many of the Nigerian assets of its parent company.. At a point in time, the company managed 22 divisions and subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="scope" /&gt; 

===Kingsway stores===
Kingsway Stores was a [[Department store|departmental store]] headquartered in Lagos and managed by the firm. It was the first modern departmental store established in [[British West Africa]].&lt;ref name="har" /&gt; The first Kingsway store was opened in Lagos in 1948 and by 1982, the firm had 13 stores across major cities in the country including a three storey store at Ibadan. The stores initially provided access to consumer goods found in departmental stores of foreign countries, but over time, majority of its [[Stock keeping unit|SKUs]] were procured in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="scope" /&gt; Towards the end of the 1980s, price and currency regulations and a downturn in the economy forced the closure of many stores and eventually the closure of Kingsway Stores.&lt;ref name="oguns"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=November 1992 |title=The Footprints of a Giant |magazine=Money |language=en |publisher=Alfa Communications |publication-place=Yaba |pages=18-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textiles===
UAC's textile division was one of the largest textile distributors in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="scope" /&gt; The division was formed as combination of the textile businesses of UAC and G.B Ollivant. At its height the company designed and distributed wax prints.&lt;ref name="oguns" /&gt;

===A.J. Seward===
A.J. Seward was a manufacturer of personal care products that was majority owned by UAC International, the firm was formally introduced to Nigeria in 1968. Prior to the incorporation of A.J. Seward in Nigeria, UAC's department of drugs and personal care handled the importation of Seward's products. The department was later merged with a newly formed A.J. Seward Nigeria limited. The firm began operations marketing importing toiletries before establishing a personal and hair care factory at [[Zaria]] and later at Oregun, Lagos. In 1980, the company's main warehouse was opened in Oregun, Lagos. Many of the firm's products became popular such as Pears baby care products, Nku, Lotus, Jellen, Fresh and Shield.&lt;ref name="scope"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=June 1982 |title=UAC Supplement |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/afriscope/oclc/1585840 |journal=Afriscope. |language=English |issn=0044-667X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tractor and Equipment===
T and E or Tractor and Equipment handled the franchise to sell [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] trucks in Nigeria. UAC's relationships with CAT officially began in 1950. Mining of [[Tin mining|tin]] in [[Jos]] had created a market for mining equipment which prodded the firm to begin selling mining machinery in the country. The firm's product also included CAT's agricultural, infrastructure maintenance and marine engineering products. The firm also sold [[Braithwaite &amp; Co.|Braithwaite]] steel tanks and storage products.&lt;ref name="oguns" /&gt;

===Foods division===
UAC International established a consumer food trading arm in 1958 called West African Cold Storage. The firm later merged with [[Wall's (meat)|Wall's Company]]. In 1973, the company was collapsed into UACN to become its Food division. The division markets meat related products and cold storage of food and meat products.&lt;ref name="scope" /&gt;

===African Timber and Plywood===
The firm operated African Time and Plywood from [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]] in [[Delta State]]. The facility was an expansion of an old saw mill originally managed by [[Alexander Miller (merchant)|Miller Bros]] out of [[Koko, Delta|Koko]], Delta State. The firm transferred the old saw mill at Koko to Sapele in 1929. Between 1945 and 1951, additional investments were poured into the facility.  A plywood mill was commissioned in 1948 and the old mill was replaced in 1951. Major sources of wood were [[Iroko]] and Mahogany trees with one species known as [[Sapele]] mahogany.&lt;ref name="oguns" /&gt; Initially the products of the mills were mostly for foreign markets but an expanding local market caused an inwards focus to generate sales. The products of the firm included cresta branded plywood, ATAPEX particle board, flushed doors and furniture.&lt;ref name="scope" /&gt;

===Federated motors===
Federated Motors assembled Bedford trucks from completely knocked down parts. UAC international's involvement in the motor trade dates back to its early years when it imported Bedford trucks into the country. The firm later imported [[Chassis|partially assembled chassis]] and cabs before assembling knocked down parts. The firm's factory at [[Apapa]] churned out trucks with payloads between 1 to 8 tonnes. The firm also sold [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] buses including its BF model used by commercial transport companies.&lt;ref name="scope" /&gt;

==Operations==
In 1994, Unilever which had a minority stake in UACN, divested its interest which were sold to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=UAC Nigeria Begins New Chapter|last=Adams|first=Paul|date=November 8, 1994|work=Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; local investors.
