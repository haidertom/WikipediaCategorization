'''''Ann Dancing''''' is an artwork created in 2007 by [[Julian Opie]] (born 1958, London) an English artist and former trustee of the [[Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/governancefunding/boardoftrustees/trusteesretired.htm#opie About Tate | Governance &amp; Funding | Current and Recently Retired Trustees&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907093439/http://www.tate.org.uk/about/governancefunding/boardoftrustees/trusteesretired.htm#opie |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpture was removed from its base on August 20, 2008, for repairs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080828/LOCAL/80828046 Dancing sculpture needs electronic facelift]&lt;/ref&gt; and was returned on October 31 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Rogue Public Art Project Captures Cultural Trail Attention |date=October 31, 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.indyculturaltrail.org/128.html |work=Indianapolis Cultural Trail |pages= |accessdate=2009-09-23 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318160028/http://www.indyculturaltrail.org/128.html |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The sculpture consists of four rectilinear panels of light-emitting diode ([[LED]]) screens that each display the same animated image in orange of a woman on all four panels.  The woman, "Ann," is wearing a [[sheath dress]] and sways from side to side in a dancing motion.   Ann either has pointed feet or is wearing high-heeled shoes.  She appears to have no clear hairstyle.

It is probable that the animated image of Ann dancing is computer generated from an internally housed computer located in the red brick base of the sculpture.

==History and Location==
The sculpture was installed at the intersection of [[Massachusetts Avenue, Indianapolis|Massachusetts Avenue]], Alabama Street, and  Vermont Street in [[Indianapolis]] from January to February, 2008.   The sculpture is located directly in front of the Old Point Tavern and was the first artwork installed on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail [http://www.indyculturaltrail.info/] at a total expense of $150,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indyculturaltrail.info/114.html |title=Indianapolis Cultural Trail : First permanent art installation along Indianapolis Cultural Trail is illuminated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093739/http://www.indyculturaltrail.info/114.html |archive-date=2008-08-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture is visible in the Google Maps Street View, but only from the middle of the intersection [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=401+Massachusetts+Ave,+indianapolis&amp;sll=42.42805,-71.200397&amp;sspn=0.009535,0.02223&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=39.772592,-86.152437&amp;panoid=IR2fF0XWgVjQtGD-ObatlA&amp;cbp=13,78.23,,0,4.67&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=401+Massachusetts+Ave,+Indianapolis,+Marion,+Indiana+46204&amp;ll=39.772692,-86.152296&amp;spn=0.012452,0.033023&amp;z=16].

{{cquote|I am really happy that ‘Ann Dancing’ will be in Indianapolis and become part of the street fabric. As I sit in my studio in London I think of her endlessly dancing for the passing traffic."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6593">'''Backtesting''' is a term used in modeling to refer to testing a [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] on historical data.  Backtesting is a type of [[retrodiction]], and a special type of [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] applied to previous time period(s).

== Financial analysis==
In a trading strategy, investment strategy, or risk modeling, backtesting seeks to estimate the performance of a strategy or model if it had been employed during a past period. This requires simulating past conditions with sufficient detail, making one limitation of backtesting the need for detailed historical data.  A second limitation is the inability to model strategies that would affect historic prices. Finally, backtesting, like other modeling, is limited by potential [[overfitting]]. That is, it is often possible to find a strategy that would have worked well in the past, but will not work well in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does Backtesting Really Work?|url=http://www.backtestbroker.com/backtestingfaq.aspx|author=BacktestBroker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limitations, backtesting provides information not available when models and strategies are tested on synthetic data.

Backtesting has historically only been performed by large institutions and professional money managers due to the expense of obtaining and using detailed datasets. However, backtrading is increasingly used on a wider basis, and independent web-based backtesting platforms have emerged. Although the technique is widely used, it is prone to weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Issues related to back testing|url=http://www.financialtrading.com/issues-related-to-back-testing/|author=FinancialTrading}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basel Accords|Basel financial regulations]] require large financial institutions to backtest certain risk models.

Hindcasting usually refers to a [[computer simulation|numerical-model]] integration of a historical period where no observations have been [[data assimilation|assimilated]]. This distinguishes a hindcast run from a [[meteorological reanalysis|reanalysis]]. Oceanographic observations of [[salinity]] and [[temperature]] as well as observations of [[ocean surface wave|surface-wave parameters]] such as the [[significant wave height]] are much scarcer than meteorological observations, making hindcasting more common in oceanography than in meteorology. Also, since surface waves represent a forced system where the wind is the only generating force, [[wind wave model|wave hindcasting]] is often considered adequate for generating a reasonable representation of the wave [[climate]] with little need for a full reanalysis. Hydrologists use hindcasting for model stream flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Guidance on Conducting  Streamflow Hindcasting in  CHPS|url= http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/water/RFC_support/HEFS_doc/Streamflow_Hindcasting_Guidance_V3.pdf|publisher= NOAA|accessdate= 22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of hindcasting would be entering [[climate]] forcings (events that force change) into a [[climate model]]. If the hindcast showed reasonably-accurate climate response, the model would be considered successful.

The [[ECMWF re-analysis]] is an example of a combined atmospheric reanalysis coupled with a wave-model integration where no wave parameters were assimilated, making the wave part a hindcast run.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., "Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., "Testing Time for El Niño", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;
Not only did hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance, or to some other "chaotic" event.

[[File:BDN for social networking.jpg|thumb|Shows a network of cause and effect; in response to drivers, to work towards desired outcomes, enablers and capabilities support various beneficial changes.]]
A '''benefit dependency network''' (BDN) is a diagram drawn according to a specific structure that visualizes multiple cause-effect relationships organized into capabilities, changes and benefits.  It can be considered a business-oriented method of what engineers would call [[goal modeling]] and is usually read from right to left to provide a one-page overview of how a business generates value, starting with the high level drivers for change, such as found with Digital Initiatives&lt;ref&gt;Joe Peppard Harvard Business Review https://hbr.org/2016/06/a-tool-to-map-your-next-digital-initiative&lt;/ref&gt; or cross-organizational ERP management.&lt;ref&gt;Eckartz Daneva Wieringa van Hillegersberg SAC 09 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1529641&lt;/ref&gt; First proposed by Cranfield School of Management as part of a Benefits Management approach &lt;ref&gt;Benefits Management Best Practice Guidelines by John Ward, Peter Murray and Elizabeth Daniel, Cranfield School of Management, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the original model has developed to encompass all the domains required for Benefits Management &lt;ref&gt;A look at existing methods by Torsten Langner, LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/look-existing-methods-torsten-langner&lt;/ref&gt; namely Why, What, Who and How.  Recent development has added weights to the connections to create a [[weighted graph]] so that causal analysis, sometimes referred to as [[causality]], is possible on the represented [[value chain]]s so different strategies can be compared according to value and outcome. These chains provide a way to construct a compelling story or message that shows how the benefits proposed can be realized from the changes being considered.

In [[mathematics]], '''injections''', '''surjections''' and '''bijections''' are classes of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] distinguished by the manner in which ''[[parameter|arguments]]'' (input [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] from the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]) and ''[[image (mathematics)|images]]'' (output expressions from the [[codomain]]) are related or ''mapped to'' each other.

A function [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] elements from its domain to elements in its codomain. Given a function &lt;math&gt;f: \; X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;

*The function is '''[[injective function|injective]]''' ('''one-to-one''') if each element of the codomain is mapped to by ''at most'' one element of the domain. An injective function is an '''injection'''. Notationally:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x, x' \in X, f(x) = f(x') \Rightarrow x = x'.&lt;/math&gt;
: Or, equivalently (using [[Transposition (logic)|logical transposition]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x,x' \in X, x \neq x' \Rightarrow f(x) \neq f(x').&lt;/math&gt;

*The function is '''[[surjective function|surjective]]''' ('''onto''') if each element of the codomain is mapped to by ''at least'' one element of the domain.  (That is, the image and the codomain of the function are equal.) A surjective function is a '''surjection'''. Notationally:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X \text{ such that } y = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

*The function is '''[[bijective function|bijective]]''' ('''one-to-one and onto''' or '''one-to-one correspondence''') if each element of the codomain is mapped to by ''exactly'' one element of the domain.  (That is, the function is ''both'' injective and surjective.) A bijective function is a '''bijection'''.

An injective function need not be surjective (not all elements of the codomain may be associated with arguments), and a surjective function need not be injective (some images may be associated with ''more than one'' argument). The four possible combinations of injective and surjective features are illustrated in the adjacent diagrams.

==Injection==
{{main|Injective function}}
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
[[Image:Injective composition.svg|thumb|300px|Injective composition: the second function need not be injective.]]
A function is '''injective''' ('''one-to-one''') if each possible element of the codomain is mapped to by at most one argument. Equivalently, a function is injective if it maps distinct arguments to distinct images. An injective function is an '''injection'''. The formal definition is the following.

:The function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is injective [[iff]] for all &lt;math&gt;x,x' \in X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(x') \Rarr x = x'.&lt;/math&gt;

*A function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is injective if and only if ''X'' is empty or ''f'' is left-[[Inverse function|invertible]]; that is, there is a function g : f(X) → X such that ''g'' o ''f'' = identity  function on ''X''. Here f(X) is the image of f.
*Since every function is surjective when its [[codomain]] is restricted to its [[image (mathematics)|image]], every injection induces a bijection onto its image. More precisely, every injection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' can be factored as a bijection followed by an inclusion as follows. Let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''f''(''X'') be ''f'' with codomain restricted to its image, and let ''i'' : ''f''(''X'') → ''Y'' be the inclusion map from ''f''(''X'') into ''Y''. Then ''f'' = ''i'' o ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;. A dual factorisation is given for surjections below.
*The composition of two injections is again an injection, but if ''g'' o ''f'' is injective, then it can only be concluded that ''f'' is injective. See the figure at right.
*Every [[embedding]] is injective.

==Surjection==
{{main|Surjective function}}
[[Image:Surjective composition.svg|thumb|300px|Surjective composition: the first function need not be surjective.]]
A function is '''surjective''' ('''onto''') if each possible image is mapped to by at least one argument. In other words, each element in the codomain has non-empty [[preimage]]. Equivalently, a function is surjective if its image is equal to its codomain. A surjective function is a '''surjection'''. The formal definition is the following.

:The function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is surjective [[iff]] for all &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = y.&lt;/math&gt;

*A function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is surjective if and only if it is right-invertible, that is, if and only if there is a function ''g'': ''Y'' → ''X'' such that ''f'' o ''g'' = identity  function on ''Y''. (This statement is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].)
*By collapsing all arguments mapping to a given fixed image, every surjection induces a bijection defined on a quotient of its domain. More precisely, every surjection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' can be factored as a non-bijection followed by a bijection as follows. Let ''X''/~ be the equivalence classes of ''X'' under the following equivalence relation: ''x'' ~ ''y'' if and only if ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y''). Equivalently, ''X''/~ is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all preimages under ''f''. Let ''P''(~) : ''X'' → ''X''/~ be the projection map which sends each ''x'' in ''X'' to its equivalence class [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;~&lt;/sub&gt;, and let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X''/~ → ''Y'' be the well-defined function given by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;([''x'']&lt;sub&gt;~&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''x''). Then ''f'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; o ''P''(~). A dual factorisation is given for injections above.
*The composition of two surjections is again a surjection, but if ''g'' o ''f'' is surjective, then it can only be concluded that ''g'' is surjective. See the figure.

==Bijection==
{{main|Bijective function}}
[[Image:Bijective composition.svg|thumb|300px|Bijective composition: the first function need not be surjective and the second function need not be injective.]]
A function is '''bijective''' if it is both injective and surjective. A bijective function is a '''bijection''' ('''one-to-one correspondence'''). A function is bijective [[if and only if]] every possible image is mapped to by exactly one argument. This equivalent condition is formally expressed as follow.

:The function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is bijective [[iff]] for all &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = y.&lt;/math&gt;

*A function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is bijective if and only if it is invertible, that is, there is a function ''g'': ''Y'' → ''X'' such that ''g'' o ''f'' = identity  function on ''X'' and ''f'' o ''g'' = identity  function on ''Y''. This function maps each image to its unique preimage.
*The composition of two bijections is again a bijection, but if ''g'' o ''f'' is a bijection, then it can only be concluded that ''f'' is injective and ''g'' is surjective. (See the figure at right and the remarks above regarding injections and surjections.)
*The bijections from a set to itself form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition, called the [[symmetric group]].

==Cardinality==
Suppose you want to define what it means for two sets to "have the same number of elements". One way to do this is to say that two sets "have the same number of elements" if and only if all the elements of one set can be paired with the elements of the other, in such a way that each element is paired with exactly one element. Accordingly, we can define two sets to "have the same number of elements" if there is a bijection between them. We say that the two sets have the same [[cardinality]].

Likewise, we can say that set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; "has fewer than or the same number of elements" as set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if there is an injection from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. We can also say that set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; "has fewer than the number of elements" in set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if there is an injection from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; but not a bijection between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
It is important to specify the domain and codomain of each function since by changing these, functions which we think of as the same may have different ''jectivity''. &lt;!-- someone change this wording please. MarSch --&gt;

===Injective and surjective (bijective)===
* For every set ''X'' the identity function id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and thus specifically &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R} : x \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^+ \to \mathbf{R}^+ : x \mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt; and thus also its inverse &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^+ \to \mathbf{R}^+ : x \mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;\exp : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^+ : x \mapsto \mathrm{e}^x&lt;/math&gt; and thus also its inverse the [[natural logarithm]] &lt;math&gt;\ln : \mathbf{R}^+ \to \mathbf{R} : x \mapsto \ln{x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Injective and non-surjective===
* The exponential function &lt;math&gt;\exp : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R} : x \mapsto \mathrm{e}^x&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-injective and surjective===
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R} : x \mapsto (x-1)x(x+1) = x^3 - x &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \to [-1,1] : x \mapsto \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-injective and non-surjective===

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}: x \mapsto \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
* For every function ''f'', subset ''X'' of the domain and subset ''Y'' of the codomain we have ''X'' ⊂ ''f''{{i sup|−1}}(''f''(''X'')) and ''f''(''f''{{i sup|−1}}(''Y'')) ⊂ ''Y''. If ''f'' is injective we have ''X'' = ''f''{{i sup|−1}}(''f''(''X'')) and if ''f'' is surjective we have ''f''(''f''{{i sup|−1}}(''Y'')) = ''Y''.
* For every function ''h'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' we can define a surjection ''H'' : ''X'' → ''h''(''X'') : ''x'' → ''h''(''x'') and an injection {{math|''I'' : ''h''(''X'') → ''Y'' : ''x'' → ''x''}}. It follows that {{tmath|1=H = I \circ H}}. This decomposition is unique [[up to isomorphism]].

==Category theory==
In the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], injections, surjections, and bijections correspond precisely to [[monomorphism]]s, [[epimorphism]]s, and [[isomorphism]]s, respectively.

==History==
This terminology was originally coined by the [[Bourbaki group]].

[[Image:TheCadetHonorCodeMonument.jpg|right|thumb|Honor Code Monument at West Point]]
The [[United States Military Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[Virginia Military Institute]], and [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]]  have a '''Cadet Honor Code''' as a formalized statement of the minimum standard of ethics expected of cadets. The only single-sanction honor code systems in the United States exists at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], where a "Drum-Out" ceremony is still conducted in barracks in the middle of the night for those found guilty of an honor violation. At [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] where if found guilty the result of the trial is announced at lunch the following day, and they are never permitted to return to the campus. 
The [[United States Naval Academy]] has a related standard, known as the [[Honor Concept]].

Other military-styled schools like [[Norwich University]] and [[Texas A&amp;M]] have similar codes which apply to both cadets and civilian students with their own methods of administration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|access-date=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A system and tradition of peer-enforced honorable conduct in a higher educational setting has historically been a part of campus life in other notable U.S. institutions, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[College of William and Mary]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[University of Virginia]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], among others. In contrast, the U.K. educational system has not until very recently adopted such honor codes, sarcastically dubbing them "cheaters charters".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/mar/20/highereducation.students An idea worth imitating]", Jessica Shepherd, ''The Guardian'', 20 March 2007, Retrieved 26 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The U.S. Military Academy at West Point==
West Point's Cadet Honor Code reads simply that

:'''''"A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do."'''''

Cadets accused of violating the Honor Code face a standardized investigative and hearing process ([http://www.west-point.org/publications/honorsys/chap3.html]).  First they are tried by a jury of their peers.  If they are found guilty, the case will go up to the Commandant of the Academy who will give his recommendation, then to the Superintendent of the Academy, who has the discretion to either impose sanctions or recommend that the Secretary of the Army expel the cadet from the Academy.

===Definitions of the tenets of the Honor Code===
LYING: Cadets violate the Honor Code by lying if they deliberately deceive another by stating an untruth or by any direct form of communication to include the telling of a partial truth and the vague or ambiguous use of information or language with the intent to deceive or mislead.

CHEATING: A violation of cheating would occur if a Cadet fraudulently acted out of self-interest or assisted another to do so with the intent to gain or to give an unfair advantage. Cheating includes such acts as plagiarism (presenting someone else's ideas, words, data, or work as one's own without documentation), misrepresentation (failing to document the assistance of another in the preparation, revision, or proofreading of an assignment), and using unauthorized notes.

STEALING: The wrongful taking, obtaining, or withholding by any means from the possession of the owner or any other person any money, personal property, article, or service of value of any kind, with intent to permanently deprive or defraud another person of the use and benefit of the property, or to appropriate it to either their own use or the use of any person other than the owner.

TOLERATION: Cadets violate the Honor Code by tolerating if they fail to report an unresolved incident with honor implications to proper authority within a reasonable length of time. "Proper authority" includes the Commandant, the Assistant Commandant, the Director of Military Training, the Athletic Director, a tactical officer, teacher or coach. A "reasonable length of time" is the time it takes to confront the Cadet candidate suspected of the honor violation and decide whether the incident was a misunderstanding or a possible violation of the Honor Code. A reasonable length of time is usually considered not to exceed 24 hours.

To have violated the honor code, a Cadet must have lied, cheated, stolen, or attempted to do so, or tolerated such action on the part of another Cadet. The procedural element of the Honor System examines the two elements that must be present for a Cadet to have committed an honor violation: the act and the intent to commit that act. The latter does not mean intent to violate the Honor Code, but rather the intent to commit the act itself.

===Three rules of thumb===
#Does this action attempt to deceive anyone or allow anyone to be deceived?
#Does this action gain or allow the gain of privilege or advantage to which I  or someone else would not otherwise be entitled?
#Would I be dissatisfied by the outcome if I were on the receiving end of this action?

===History and relevance===
The premise behind the Honor Code is as old as the Academy itself.  When the Academy was founded in 1802, the officer corps operated on a simple code of honor—an officer's word was his bond.  [[Sylvanus Thayer]], Superintendent of the Academy from 1817 to 1833, explicitly banned cheating as part of his efforts to increase the Academy's scholarship standards. Allegations of theft were dealt with under normal Army regulations until the 1920s. The first major step toward formalizing the unwritten Honor Code came in 1922 when  Superintendent [[Douglas MacArthur]] formed the first Cadet Honor Committee, which reviewed all allegations of honor infractions. In 1947, Superintendent [[Maxwell Taylor]] drafted the first official Honor Code publication, which is considered the first codification of the “Cadet Honor Code.” Although failure to report violations had long been reckoned as grounds for expulsion, the code wasn't formally amended to expressly forbid "toleration" until 1970."&lt;ref name="westpoint"&gt;"[http://www.usma.edu/PublicAffairs/PressReleasesbd/nr14-08_brigade_honor_cpt.htm Brigade Honor Captain Named For 2009 ]", Release № 14-08 ''[[United States Military Academy]]'', 14 March 2008, Retrieved 3 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1951, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that 90 of the Academy's 2,500 cadets were facing dismissal for mass violations of the honor code related to "cribbing", receiving the answers to exams ahead of time, allegedly through upperclass tutors who were assisting other cadets, mostly dedicated football players, to study for those exams."&lt;ref name="TimeMag"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889147,00.html TIME Magazine: The Nation: Trouble at West Point]", 13 August 1951, Retrieved 26 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army arranged for an investigation by a panel which included famed jurist [[Learned Hand]] and retired generals [[Troy H. Middleton]], then president of [[Louisiana State University]], and [[Robert M. Danford]], a former [[List of Commandants of Cadets of the United States Military Academy|Commandant of Cadets]] at West Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ambrose |first=Stephen E. |date=1999 |title=Duty, Honor, Country: A History of West Point |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC5wr5A_hbkC&amp;pg=PA318 |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |page=318 |isbn=978-0-8018-6293-9 |author-link=Stephen E. Ambrose}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board recommended dismissal of all 90 suspected violators of the Honor Code, and while the Army and Congress debated the issue and its causes, the cadets were left with a cloud hanging over their heads and their futures.

There have been other instances of mass cheating scandals at the Academy, including two very famous ones.  In August 1976, where it was found that possibly over half of the junior class at the Academy had violated the honor code by cheating on a case assignment.&lt;ref name="Jorgie"&gt;"[http://www.west-point.org/publications/aba_article.html Duty, Honor, Country, and Too Many Lawyers]", John Harry "Jorgie" Jorgenson, Originally printed in "The Lawyer's Washington" column in the American Bar Association Journal for April 1977 (63 ABAJ 564-S67). Copyright 1977 by the American Bar Association, Retrieved 26 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951, 37 members of the football team were dismissed after they were found to have cheated.  The team was so decimated that it fell to 2-7, the only losing record suffered by legendary coach [[Red Blaik]].

==Virginia Military Institute==
"Above all else, cadets are men and women of honor and integrity who can always be trusted. They live by a simple code, The VMI Honor Code, which states:

''“'''A Cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do'''.”'' 

The Code pervades all aspects of a cadet’s life. A cadet’s honor is his/her most guarded possession.
The education of new cadets about the Honor System is the responsibility of the Honor Court. The Honor Court is composed of first and second class cadets elected by their classmates. In addition to education, the Honor Court is also responsible for adjudicating reported violations of the Honor Code.
The VMI Honor System is unique in that it is a single sanction system. The system does not recognize degrees of honor. The sanction for any breach of honor is dismissal. So, when new cadets sign the book on matriculation day they are committing themselves to a life of honesty and integrity. If their commitment is not complete, their stay at the Institute may be short."

Cadets found guilty of an honor violation at VMI are still dismissed in a Drum Out Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/cadet-life/citizen-soldiers/honor-code/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Air Force Academy==
The Cadet Honor Code at the Air Force Academy, like that at West Point, is the cornerstone of a cadet's professional training and development — the minimum standard of ethical conduct that cadets expect of themselves and their fellow cadets. Air Force's honor code was developed and adopted by the Class of 1959, the first class to graduate from the Academy, and has been handed down to every subsequent class.&lt;ref name="honorcode"&gt;"[http://www.usafa.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9427 The Honor Code ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626141648/http://www.usafa.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9427 |date=26 June 2010 }}", ''[[USAFA]]'' Fact Sheet, April 2009, Retrieved 3 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Honor Code Handbook"&gt;"[http://www.usafa.edu/Commandant/cwc/cwch/HCHandbook_Vol02.pdf Honor Code Reference Handbook- Volume II – The Honor System ]", (646 KB) ''USAFA'', August 2008, Retrieved 3 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The code adopted was based largely on West Point's Honor Code, but was modified slightly to its current wording:

:'''''We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.'''''

In 1984, the Cadet Wing voted to add an "Honor Oath," which was to be taken by all cadets. The oath is administered to fourth class cadets (freshmen) when they are formally accepted into the Wing at the conclusion of Basic Cadet Training.&lt;ref name="Honor Code Handbook" /&gt; The oath consists of a statement of the code, followed by a resolution to live honorably:

:'''''We will not lie, steal or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.'''''
:'''''Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably (so help me God).&lt;ref name="Final clause in cadet Honor Oath made optional"&gt;"[http://www.usafa.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123368388]", Final clause in cadet Honor Oath made optional, October 2013, Retrieved 4 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;'''''

Cadets are considered the "guardians and stewards" of the Code. Cadet honor representatives throughout the Wing oversee the honor system by conducting education classes and investigating possible honor incidents. Cadets throughout the Wing are expected to sit on Honor Boards as [[jury|juries]] that determine whether their fellow cadets violated the code. Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. Although the presumed sanction for a violation is disenrollment, mitigating factors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for some period of time. This "honor probation" is usually only reserved for cadets in their first two years at the Academy.

==Norwich University, Texas A&amp;M University, The Citadel==

The Cadet Honor Codes, described within the Cadet Honor Manuals, belong to the Corps of Cadets at these institutions and is administered by cadets. It is each cadet's duty upon enrollment to be familiar with the honor system as set forth in the Honor Manual and to abide by the Honor Code. Simply stated, the Code demands that a cadet does not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor at The Citadel|url=http://155.225.198.23/root/honor-at-the-citadel|website=www.citadel.edu|publisher=The Citadel|accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|access-date=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilian Students at these schools are also required to adhere to an honor code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|access-date=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 2005 [[ESPN]] made-for-TV movie ''[[Code Breakers (film)|Code Breakers]]'' was about the 1951 scandal in which 83 West Point cadets were implicated in violations of the Cadet Honor Code in order to help the [[Army Black Knights football|West Point football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code Breakers at IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463944/|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The film was nominated for two awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for Code Breakers at IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463944/awards|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song 'Intolerance' by the rock band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] makes specific mention of the Honor Code.

The 1975 TV movie [[The Silence (1975 film)|The Silence]] is a recounting of the case of Cadet James Pelosi, who though accused of an honor code violation maintained his innocence and refused to resign from the Military Academy; and as a result was "silenced" by his fellow cadets as permitted under such circumstances by the Honor Code at that time. He was isolated from the other cadets, was not permitted to have roommates, and had to eat all his meals at a separate table. He was not spoken to by other cadets or officers except on duty, and then only on matters of duty; and when addressed was addressed as "Mister," not by name. Pelosi endured 19 months of this treatment, but went on to graduate with his class in 1973.

[[The Long Gray Line]], a 1955 biopic of Master Sergeant Martin Maher, who served in the West Point Athletic Department as both an Army enlisted man and a civilian employee, featured a sequence concerning a cadet who married a girl on impulse while on leave. Even though the marriage was immediately annulled, Sergeant Maher pointed out to the cadet that there was the Honor Code to consider. (Cadets at West Point cannot be married, an inflexible rule even today.) The cadet in question submitted his resignation rather than face the Honor Committee.

Jimmy Cagney starred in the 1950 movie [[The West Point Story (film)|The West Point Story]]. Part of the plot involved his character, Elwin "Bix" Bixby, a World War II combat veteran and Broadway director, living at West Point as a [[plebe]] cadet and occasionally running afoul of the Honor Code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4987">'''Charlotte Selver''' (April 4, 1901 in [[Ruhrort]] (Duisburg), Germany – August 22, 2003 in [[Muir Beach]], [[California]]; née ''Wittgenstein'') was a German music educator.

The central point of Charlotte Selver's work was "experience through the senses". Charlotte Selver was convinced that the well-being of the individual, the society as a whole and even the worries about our environment depend on how far we find new confidence in organic processes.

With her work, "Sensory Awareness", Charlotte Selver had a deciding influence on the "Human Potential Movement", which also came out of the [[Esalen Institute]], where she taught as of 1963. Because of that, she also had influence on [[Humanistic Psychology]] and the therapies based on it. Aspects of her work, especially the conscious sensing of the body and the following of physical sensations (Sensory Awareness), flowed into many of the methods of physical work, physical therapy, physical psychotherapy and psychotherapy which still exist today.

== Biography ==
In the 1920s, Charlotte Selver encountered [[Elsa Gindler]] in [[Berlin]], who together with the students in her courses, researched how the natural gifts of people could be developed, even at an adult age. Up until she emigrated to [[New York City|New York]] in 1938, she studied with Elsa Gindler and the music teacher, [[Heinrich Jacoby]], and she reestablished contact with them in the 1950s.

In 1971, the "Sensory Awareness Foundation" was brought into being. Its goal is to preserve and document Charlotte Selver's life work. In 1995, the "California Institute of Integral Studies" in [[San Francisco]] awarded her an honorary doctorate.

Charlotte Selver died on August 22, 2003, at her home in Muir Beach, California, among her closest friends and students at the age of 102.

== Sensory Awareness ==
Sensory Awareness has its origin in the work of the gymnastics and exercise teacher, [[Elsa Gindler]] (1885–1961), and the Swiss music teacher, [[Heinrich Jacoby]] (1889–1964). They never gave their 'work' a formal name. The fundamental objective of the Jacoby/Gindler approach is the development of the person (integral unfolding as development and growth to meaningful being). Charlotte Selver was Gindler's student in Berlin before she emigrated to the United States in 1938 and she introduced this work under the name of Sensory Awareness.

== Influences on dance therapy and psychotherapy ==
Charlotte Selver touched and encouraged thousands of people in the USA, Mexico and [[Europe]] in her 80 years of work, among them influential personalities, such as: 
* Psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]]
* [[Zen]] philosopher [[Alan Watts]] and his teacher [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]]
* [[Fritz Perls]], the founder of [[Gestalt therapy]]
* [[Ida Rolf]], the founder of [[Rolfing]]
* [[Moshe Feldenkrais]] 
* Peter Levine, founder of [[Somatic experiencing]]
* Ron Kurtz, founder of [[Hakomi]] therapy
* Somatics teachers and practitioners including Don Hanlon Johnson, Judyth Weaver, Pat Odgen, Susan Aposhyan, Christine Cadwell, Edward Maupin and others who taught at the Esalen Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Barnaby|title=The Emergence of Somatic Psychology and Bodymind Therapy|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke, UK|isbn=978-0-230-22216-8|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; including teachers of [[Massage#Esalen massage|Esalen Massage]]

The City of [[Oakland, California]], adopted a [[Zero waste|Zero Waste Strategic Plan]] in 2006, detailing a road map for the City to follow toward the implementation of a Zero Waste System by 2020.  As stated in a City Resolution, introduced by then Mayor [[Jerry Brown]], Zero Waste principles:

:"[P] romote the highest and best use of materials to eliminate [[waste]] and [[pollution]], emphasizing a closed-loop system of production and consumption, moving in logical increments toward the goal of zero waste through the core principles of":
:# Improving [[reuse]]/[[recycling]] of [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life products]] and materials to ensure their highest and best use;
:# Pursuing design strategies to minimize product hazards and lifestyles that limit consumption; and
:# Using [[waste disposal]] operations to improve the [[economy]] and develop the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/13137.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133100/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/13137.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Waste systems can be traced back to chemist Paul Palmer who developed and coined the concept in the 1970s (in Oakland, CA) in order to find a way to reuse the vast amount of [[chemical]]s produced by the [[electronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=P|title=History of zero waste institute.|url=http://zerowasteinstitute.org/?page_id=202|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, cities like Oakland are adopting Zero Waste Systems to create a process that redirects all end-of-life products toward future applications in the marketplace, rather than to a [[landfill]].&lt;ref name="Zero Waste Alliance"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zero Waste Alliance|title=What is Waste?|url=http://www.zerowaste.org/case.htm#what_is|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan==

The city of Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan set out in 2006 to reduce the annual tons of waste directed toward landfills from 400,000 tons to 40,000 annually by 2020. Chiefly, the city aimed to create comprehensive systems that transfer end-of-life products back into the economy. The City's Strategic Plan is based on five strategies that include recycling but also [[Product design|product]] and [[system design]] changes and policy revisions, as follows:
# Expand and Improve Local and Regional Recycling and Composting
#* Greater engagement with the general public and particularly the business community is necessary, requiring the development of additional recovery services and initiatives, for example, to support businesses that utilize the [[Port of Oakland]] and produce [[construction]] and [[demolition]] materials.
# Develop and Adopt New Rules and Incentives to Reduce Waste Disposal
#* Create stronger [[incentive]]s to “reward reuse, repair, and reduced consumption” to replace the present incentive to use landfills.
# Preserve Land for Sustainable Development and Green Industry Infrastructure
#* Expand industrial land for businesses that manufacture and make use of materials traditionally discarded. Create partnerships with StopWaste.Org, and East Bay Economic Alliance toward the development of policies that attract such businesses.
# Advocate for Manufacturer Responsibility for Product Waste, Ban Problem Materials
#* Adopt [[California]]’s [[Extended producer responsibility|Extended Producer Responsibility]] (EPR) created to require businesses to assume the responsibility for any environmental impacts resulting from their products (throughout the product’s life cycle).
# Educate, Promote and Advocate a Zero Waste Sustainability Agenda
#* Since only 15% of Oakland homes [[compost]], and 67% of waste continues to be produced by industries, stronger, though positive, messaging about Zero Waste and [[sustainability]] should be circulated and tailored for different audiences, situations and locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/pwa/documents/policy/oak025986.pdf|accessdate=March 6, 2011}} pp. 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abiding by the system advocated by Zero Waste International Alliance, Oakland’s Zero Waste System follows “natural cycles, where all outputs are simply an input for another process.”  Moreover, Zero Waste systems place the “highest priority on conserving resources and retaining their form and function without burning, burying, or otherwise destroying their form and function. “  This calls for “eliminating discharges to land, water or air that harm natural systems,” as well as, “preventing rather than managing, waste and pollution, and recommitting to the priority ordering of the [[waste reduction]] hierarchy: first reduce consumption; next, reuse what is left; and finally, recycle anything that is no longer usable and landfill any residual.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan}} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland's Zero Waste System also examines each management of goods in accordance with specific criteria, such as:
* “Customer Benefits,” such as opportunities for residents and businesses to reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es and access to recycling services.
* “Economic Development,” such as the creation of jobs and the development of a range of employment opportunities within organizations that process, manufacture or sell “discards-based” businesses.
* “Financial,” such as cost to city and ratepayers, as well as pricing that incentivizes waste reduction and promotes recycling.
* “Innovation,” such as methods that allow for system upgrades and evolution over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution adopting evaluative criteria for assessing [[solid waste management]] system designs responsive to the zero waste by 2020 goal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
In 2006, Oakland residents surpassed the state mandate of diverting 50% landfill waste from 580,000 to 400,000 tons, yet progress toward greater waste reduction was slowing down.  Meanwhile, consumption of materials and products continued to grow. Widespread evidence indicated that every stage of production, transportation, use and disposal of materials and products negatively impacted [[ecosystem]]s, the [[climate]], [[public health]] and [[biodiversity]]. The quantity of toxic materials in the disposal process was increasing and Oakland was struggling to maintain cost effective [[waste management]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland's system of waste reduction in 2006 allowed businesses to determine how their products would be designed and packaged, without regulation. This practice left the [[consumer]]s and [[local government]]s to bear the burden of disposing of material goods. Zero Waste Systems, on the other hand, call for businesses to develop not only recyclable [[packaging]] and product designs, but designs that could have endless new uses and applications. The Zero Waste System, therefore, offered Oakland an ambitious strategy to address waste and inefficiencies endemic to the City's structure, economy and practices.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Causes/sources of excess waste ==
We commonly think of waste as garbage, or refuse; anything that becomes useless or a byproduct. In other words, waste has countless physical sources. Zero Waste Alliance  (2011) describes waste in this way:

:"In our industrial society waste results from the inefficient use of any resource and includes activities and products that generate by-products with no clear use, no [[market value]], or hazardous properties and by-products that decrease their potential value.  Waste takes many different forms: from solid and hazardous waste to wastes in energy and material use; wastes in manufacturing and administrative activities and wastes of [[human resources]].&lt;ref name="Zero Waste Alliance"/&gt;

When Oakland adopted its Zero Waste Strategic Plan in 2006, the actual 400,000 tons of waste consisted of the following:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|Yard Trimmings || 9%
|-
|Food Waste || 12%
|-
|Clean Wood &amp; Other Organics || 9%
|-
|Metals || 6%
|-
|Glass || 1%
|-
|Plastic || 5%
|-
|Paper || 19%
|-
|Concrete, Asphalt, Roofing || 6%
|-
|Non-recyclables || 33%
|-
| || 100%
|}	

Oakland categorized the source of waste by the individual or group that submitted the waste to the City for disposal in landfills, (1) Non-residential or commercial sources and (2) Residential, including single family or multi-family sources.  At the time, 67% of waste was generated by non-residential sources, and residents produced 33%. Of this non-residential group, 30% was being hauled to landfills by entities over which the City had minimal control (those that haul their own garbage to the landfill), such as [[Cal Trans]], [[AC Transit]], [[BART]] and independent contractors. Of the 400,000 tons of material transferred to landfills, 67% could be recycled using city operations already established. Regional recovery and diversion options existed in 2006 for paper, glass, metals, plastics, yard trimmings, food, clean wood, [[concrete]], [[asphalt]], and [[Roofing material|roofing]]. The City recognized that it could minimize the transfer of these materials with additional focus on improving separation of materials, messaging to businesses regarding diversion and recycling options and stronger incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and historical underpinnings==

The need for [[incentive]]s touches upon the social and historical forces that have led to excessive waste production.  As scholars, historians, environmentalists, and even politicians have increasingly asserted, the American [[economic system]] has long prioritized [[economic growth]] over preserving the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gore|first=A.|title=Earth in the balance: Ecology and the human spirit|year=2006|publisher=Rodale|location=New York|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach has often put nature at the bottom of our hierarchy of importance. As Porritt contends in Capitalism as if the World Matters, corporations focused on growth have not been held accountable for damages they cause to the environment; which has created very little incentive for industries to concern themselves with sustainability or [[environmental protection]]. With profit and growth as the ultimate goal, businesses have sought out the cheapest resources and environments lacking regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=J.|title=Capitalism as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately environmental concerns didn’t come to the forefront until the 1970s when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a series of pro-environment policy changes in response to a wave of environmental passion flaring across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vig|first=N.|title=Environmental policy: New directions for the twenty-first century|year=2010|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, while policies have led to environmental progress in some areas, such as in [[air quality]], governments have had a harder time implementing programs that regulate [[groundwater]] [[contaminant]]s. Meanwhile, landfills continue to contaminate ground and [[drinking water]] around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vig|title=Environmental policy: New directions for the twenty-first century|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, as late as 2006, the City of Oakland offered incentives for businesses to haul garbage to a landfill, rather than consider reuse and recycling options. Additionally, Oakland recognized in 2006 that a lack of [[service provider]]s for recycling and recovery efforts had prevented progress toward environmentally sustainable solutions. Also, the City had never set aside land needed for reuse and recycling business materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, incentives and the marketplace were working against the City's environmental concerns. In fact, most product consumption serves to undermine a Zero Waste Policy because of the inherent negative “externalities,” or those factors outside the market transaction, which are not accounting for in the cost of producing and consuming an item. Historically, prices for [[toy]]s, [[watch]]es, [[car]]s, etc., have not covered the costs associated with disposing or recycling these items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzman|first=J.|title=Environmental law and policy|year=2010|publisher=Thomson Reuters/Foundation Press|location=New York|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Oakland will remedy this flaw in the system by working toward shifting the responsibility of material disposal to the manufacturer instead of the government or the consumer. Further, rather than apply the [[tax base]] toward cleanup of contaminated landfills, the Zero Waste system will use the tax base to invest in recycling, composting and reuse facilities, called “Resource Recovery Parks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020. Attachment A: Zero Waste Economy|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133237/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of policy==

Oakland's Zero Waste Policy evolved out of a series of mandates originating with the [[California Integrated Waste Management Board|California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989]], which required every city and county in California to reduce their solid waste disposal amounts by 50% by year 2000. Soon after, in 1990, the Alameda County Waste Reduction and Recycling Initiative Charter Amendment (Measure D) mandated a 75% reduction in waste disposal countywide, allowing the Alameda County Source Reduction and Recycling Board to set a deadline for the goal. This board set 2010 as the deadline date. In 2002, the City of Oakland advocated for this goal by adopting a 75% reduction waste goal through Resolution 77500. This resolution called upon the Environmental Service Division of the City of Oakland's Public Works Agency to identify strategies to accomplish this goal. The City also amended the Oakland Municipal Code to establish requirements for construction and demolition [[debris]] waste reduction in 2002 through Ordinance #612253.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Marking another milestone in the evolution toward Zero Waste, [[San Francisco]] hosted the United Nations World Environment meeting of 2005, bringing together mayors across the country for a strategy session on waste disposal. Governor Jerry Brown's Sustainability Director at the time, Randy Hayes, played a pivotal role in Oakland's participation in the Accords and in creating momentum supporting Zero Waste systems within the Mayor's office. Brown signed the United Nations [[World Environment Day]] Urban Environmental Accords, pledging that Oakland would implement 21 action steps toward sustainability, which included a Zero Waste Goal. This accord meeting and related efforts spurred Oakland in 2006 to adopt a Zero Waste Strategic Plan, calling for 90% reduction in annual tons sent to landfills by 2020.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Policy tools==

What policies are aiding Oakland's in advancing toward Zero Waste? Oakland's Zero Waste Economy document, created in 2006, presents a multifaceted approach that incorporates prescriptive regulation, incentive-based or financial payments, penalties, and capacity policy tools directing the City toward a more “environmentally and economically sustainable system where resources are kept in the production cycle”, as described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020. Attachment A: Zero Waste Economy.|url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023133237/http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/12914.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 23, 2006|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive regulations or those that mandate actions allowed by law, also known as “[[command and control regulation]]”:
*	Ban toxic products from landfills or [[incinerator]]s.
*	Prohibit sale of “unnecessarily toxic or polluting products.”
Financial Penalties, or those tools designed to mitigate environmental harm by charging the offending party [[tax]]es or [[fee]]s:
*	Require that the manufacturer be held financially responsible for the product's end-cycle.
Incentive-based actions or financial payment encourage behavior by subsidizing certain actions or methods:
*	Build incentives for product designers to develop packaging with the use of non-toxic materials and opt for designs that promote reuse, recycle, or composting.
*	Create incentives for businesses to abide by environmental and [[Worker protection laws|worker protection]] standards, rather than choose the least expensive production methods and hiring workers outside the [[United States]].
*	Establish financial incentives for businesses and residents to recycle more and create less waste. (Federal tax subsidies at the time provided financial incentives to industries that make products from virgin materials).
*	Build incentives for consumers to voice their interest in non-toxic, reusable, and recyclable products by only purchasing items that meet these standards.
[[Persuasion]] techniques offer soft approaches urging behavior to change by distributing or publicizing information about the environmental issue.
*	Require [[distributor]]s and [[retailer]]s to become education centers to inform consumers about proper disposal and work with manufacturers to build reusable packaging and [[crate]]s and reduce any packaging where possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzman|first=J.|title=Environmental law and policy|pages=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status in 2011==

Oakland is no longer measuring progress in terms of diversion rates, which allows credits for recycling, [[population]] and economic factors, but evaluates waste reduction more ambitiously, in terms of total disposal tonnage.  The 90% reduction rate it seeks by 2020 will require Oakland to double the waste reduction it had achieved over the past 15 years.  After 2002, when the City adopted the 75% reduction rate goal, Oakland's Public Works Agency realized that the systems that enabled Oakland to reach a 50% reduction rate would not be sufficient for Oakland to reach a 75% reduction rate. Hence, improving the systems has been a primary focus since 2006, which are outlined in Strategies #2 and #4 of the Strategic Plan. These strategies aim to build an end to incentives to continue disposing in landfills, instead calling for [[manufacturer]]s to take responsibility for the products and their materials through the entire duration of product [[Product lifecycle (engineering)|life cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	

One third of the materials that were winding up at city landfills in 2002 did not have recovery possibilities, leaving landfills as the only option. Much of this had to do with factors outside of the City's control, for reaching the 75% reduction rate would require changes at the state and/or federal level where manufacturing decisions are made. In fact, within the Zero Waste Strategic Plan, strategies 4 and 5 largely depend on behaviors and regulations outside municipal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Zero waste strategic plan, p. 3-4, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	
	
This realization led the City toward a stronger [[advocacy]] role, beginning when Jerry Brown was governor in 2002. Since that time, Oakland has been working with numerous regulatory and implementing agencies to advance legislation favoring system changes that allow for a Zero Waste goal to be achieved, including (to name a few):
*	The [[Association of Bay Area Governments]]
*	East Bay Development Alliance
*	[[Californians Against Waste]]
*	Berkeley Ecology Center
*	Product Policy Institute
*	National Recycling Coalition
*	[[Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice|Greenaction for Heath and Environmental Justice]]

Oakland also worked in a national group to  develop a [http://captoolkit.wikispaces.com/ Zero Waste Toolkit] designed to aid governments in implementing an Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan (ECAP) for the reduction of greenhouse gases through materials management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gagliardi|first=M.|title=Materials Management Approaches for State and County Government|url=http://captoolkit.wikispaces.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, while advocating for systemic changes at the state and regional level, the City recognized a need for assistance in implementing system changes at the local level. In 2009, Oakland's Public Works Agency entered into contract with R3 Consulting for support with [[system analysis]], planning and implementation of Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan. R3 Consulting was chosen as the most highly experienced agency in [[system design]] for municipal governments, having formerly completed projects with the Cities of [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Los Angeles]], as well as with StopWaste.org. R3's work plan was split into two phases with an estimated project end date in 2011, including:

* Phase 1—Assessing and testing models and Zero Waste system designs to identify best options.
* Phase 2—Implement selected system design options by supporting City staff in building work plans for “collection, processing, transfer, and disposal of discarded products and materials.”

The City of Oakland's Public Works Agency is named as the primary administrator of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution adopting evaluative criteria for assessing solid waste management system designs responsive to the zero waste by 2020 goal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Oakland's Public Works Agency Web site (April, 2011), Oakland has steadily advanced its progress toward Zero Waste in recent years. Residents have reduced their landfill disposal by 27% since 2000, down to approximately 100,000 tons, bringing the City markedly closer to its goal of minimizing waste to 40,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Oakland recycles|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/FE/s/GAR/index.htm|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland residents have played an important role in moving the City toward Zero Waste. Indeed, the “empowered consumer” is critical in the Zero Waste Economy. In our society, all systems circle back to money and sales (Gore, 2006).  Using their buying-power, consumers can tell industries that products must be non-toxic, reusable, recyclable or compostable or they will stay on the shelf. Following this directive, manufacturers and products designers will ultimately have no choice but to create or distribute sustainable products that drive the economy toward a [[paradigm]] that views production cycles as they do in nature, where “waste” is repurposed in the cycle of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Oakland|title=Resolution 79774, Adopting a zero waste goal by 2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">In [[Freudian psychology]], a '''condensation''' ({{lang-de|Verdichtung}}) is when a single idea (an image, memory, or thought) or dream object stands for several associations and ideas.

==In dreams/symptoms/jokes==
[[Freud]] considered that "dreams are brief, meagre and laconic in comparison with the range and wealth of the dream-thoughts." Images and chains of association have their emotional charges [[Displacement (psychology)|displaced]] from the originating ideas to the receiving one, where they merge and "condense" together.&lt;ref&gt;J Childers ed., ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example a dream figure may resemble A, wear B's clothes and act like C, but nevertheless we know somehow that they are 'really' D - rather as with the composite photographs of [[Francis Galton]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 205-6&lt;/ref&gt; While condensation could serve the purposes of the dream [[Censorship (psychoanalysis)|censorship]] by disguising thoughts, Freud considered condensation as primarily the preferred mode of functioning of the unconscious [[Superego, ego and id|Id]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures of Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud saw the same mechanism of condensation at work in [[Phantasy (psychology)|phantasies]] and neurotic symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;O Fenichel, ''Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in parapraxis and jokes: he often cited as an instance [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]'s quip about the rich man treating him 'famillionairily'.&lt;ref&gt;P Gay, ''Reading Freud'' (Yale 1990) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metaphor/metonymy==

In the 1950s the concept was used by linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] in his influential article on [[metaphor and metonymy]]. Comparing the linguistic evidence to Freud's account of the dream-work, Jakobson saw symbolism as relating to metaphor, condensation and displacement to metonymy.&lt;ref&gt;E Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Jakobson's work encouraged [[Jacques Lacan]] to say that the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] is structured like a language, though he himself linked condensation to metaphor, not metonymy.&lt;ref&gt;J Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (London 1997) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''consistent life ethic''', or the '''consistent ethic of life''' is an ideology that opposes [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], [[assisted suicide]], and [[euthanasia]]. Adherents are opposed, at the very least, to [[Just War|unjust war]], while some adherents also profess [[pacifism]], or opposition to all war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/opinion/sunday/catholics-and-the-power-of-political-communion.html?_r=1 | work=New York Times | title=The Power of Political Communion | date=15 September 2012 | accessdate=18 September 2012 | first1=Molly | last1=Worthen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in 1983 by the Catholic Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] to express an ideology based on the premise that all [[Sanctity of life|human life is sacred]] and should be protected by law.&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988"&gt;Bernardin, Joseph. ''Consistent ethics of life'' 1988, Sheed and Ward&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The phrase "consistent ethic of life" was used as far back as a 1971 speech delivered by then-Archbishop [[Humberto Medeiros]] of Boston.&lt;ref name=Gregg&gt;{{cite news | last=Gregg | first=Samuel | title=The Consistent—and Not So Seamless—Ethic of Life | website=Catholic World Report | date=13 August 2015 | url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/4098/the_consistentand_not_so_seamlessethic_of_life.aspx | ref=harv | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eileen Egan ===

In 1971, [[Roman Catholic]] [[pacifist]] [[Eileen Egan]] coined the phrase "seamless garment" to describe a holistic reverence for life.&lt;ref name="Dear 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leach&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/soul-seeing/cardinal-bernardin's-gift-fits-all-sizes |last=Leach |first=Michael |title=Cardinal Bernardin's gift fits all sizes |work=National Catholic Reporter |date=6 November 2012 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is a [[Bible]] reference from John 19:23 to the [[seamless robe of Jesus]], which his executioners did not tear apart. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life. "The protection of life", said Egan, "is a seamless garment. You can't protect some life and not others."  Her words were meant to challenge those members of the [[pro-life]] movement who were in favor of capital punishment.

=== Joseph Cardinal Bernardin ===
Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Chicago]] helped publicize the consistent life ethic idea in 1983.{{sfn|Bernardin|1988|p=v}}{{nonspecific|date=July 2017}}  Initially, Bernardin spoke out against nuclear war and abortion. However, he quickly expanded the scope of his view to include all aspects of human life. In one of the first speeches given on the topic at Fordham University, Bernardin said: "The spectrum of life cuts across the issues of genetics, abortion, capital punishment, modern warfare and the care of the terminally ill."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Overberg, Kenneth R. S.J.:"A Consistent Ethic of Life", Catholic Update, St. Anthony's Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernardin said that although each of the issues was distinct, nevertheless the issues were linked since the valuing and defending of (human) life were, he believed, at the center of both issues. Bernardin told an audience in Portland, Oregon: "When human life is considered 'cheap' or easily expendable in one area, eventually nothing is held as sacred and all lives are in jeopardy."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Bernardin drew his stance from New Testament principles, specifically of forgiveness and reconciliation, yet he argued that neither the themes nor the content generated from those themes were specifically Christian.&lt;ref name="Walter, James J 2005"&gt;Walter, James J. and Shannon, Thomas A.: ''Contemporary Issues in Bioethics: A Catholic perspective'', Rowan and Littlefeild Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; By doing this, Bernardin attempted to create a dialogue with others who were not necessarily aligned with Christianity.

Bernardin and other advocates of this ethic sought to form a consistent policy that would link abortion, capital punishment, economic injustice, euthanasia, and unjust war.&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988" /&gt; Bernardin sought to unify conservative Catholics (who opposed abortion) and liberal Catholics (who opposed capital punishment) in the United States. By relying on fundamental principles, Bernardin also sought to coordinate work on several different spheres of Catholic [[moral theology]]. In addition, Bernardin argued that since the 1950s the church had moved against its own historical, [[casuistry|casuistic]] exceptions to the protection of life. "To summarize the shift succinctly, the presumption against taking human life has been strengthened and the exceptions made ever more restrictive."&lt;ref name="Bernardin, Joseph 1988" /&gt;

=== Other supporters ===
[[File:Hentoff bio.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Consistent Life Ethic has spread from Catholic theology to supporters such as [[Nat Hentoff]]]]
The non-profit organization Consistent Life Network, founded in 1987 as the Seamless Garment Network, promotes adherence to the ethic through education and non-violent action.  Individual endorsers belonging to the Consistent Life Network organization include Father [[Daniel Berrigan]], theologian [[Harvey Cox]], ''Village Voice'' columnist [[Nat Hentoff]], Father [[Theodore Hesburgh]], actress [[Patricia Heaton]], ''[[L'Arche]]'' founder [[Jean Vanier]], death penalty activist Sister [[Helen Prejean]], pro-life activist [[Abby Johnson (activist)|Abby Johnson]], author [[Ken Kesey]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]] and Nobel Peace Prize laureates [[Mairead Corrigan Maguire]] and [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]].&lt;ref name="endorsers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consistent Life Individual Endorsers As of January 9, 2017|url=http://www.consistent-life.org/clsigners.pdf|website=Consistent Life Network|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel MacNair]], for ten years (1994–2004) President of [[Feminists for Life]], a pro-life organization,&lt;ref&gt;MacNair, R.M.

In the US, several groups have promoted the "consistent ethic of life" approach, including the [[USCCB|United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], [[Democrats for Life of America]], and the [[American Solidarity Party]], a [[Christian Democratic]] political organization.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite news| last=Hughes | first=Mariann | title=The search for a third way in U.S. politics | work=Our Sunday Visitor | date=30 October 2016 | url=https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/20947/The-search-for-a-third-way-in-US-politics.aspx | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Complete Platform | website=American Solidarity Party | url=http://www.solidarity-party.org/complete-platform | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups without a religious orientation that support the ideology include Democrats for Life of America, the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians (PLAGAL), and All Our Lives (a pro-contraception feminist group), all of which are members of the Consistent Life Network. Other secular groups supporting a consistent ethic of life position include Rehumanize International (formerly known as Life Matters Journal)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rehumanizeintl.org/ http://www.rehumanizeintl.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/cover_story/2016/10/the_future_of_the_pro_life_movement.html|title=The New Culture of Life|last=Graham|first=Ruth|date=11 October 2016|work=Slate|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Wave Feminists]].&lt;ref name="Halper 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=Halper | first=Daniel | title=WH Denies Endorsement Will Intimidate FBI Investigators | work=Weekly Standard | date=9 June 2016 | url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/wh-denies-endorsement-will-intimidate-fbi-investigators/article/2002757 | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About | website=New Wave Feminists | url=https://www.newwavefeminists.com/about | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent authors who have written in support of the consistent life ethic include [[Frank Pavone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pavone |first=Frank |url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/columns/4378-the-consistent-ethic-of-life-myths-and-realities |title=The Consistent Ethic of Life: Myths and Realities |website=Priests for Life |date=1 January 1999 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Martin (priest, born 1960)|James Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/gun-control-pro-life-issue Gun Control is a Pro-Life Issue, America, 17 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dear]],&lt;ref name="Dear 2008"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dear | first=John | title=The Consistent Ethic of Life | website=FatherJohnDear.org | date=15 July 2008 | url=http://www.fatherjohndear.org/articles/the_consistent_ethic.html | archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131019001027/http://www.fatherjohndear.org/articles/the_consistent_ethic.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=19 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dear 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dear | first=J. | title=The God of Peace: Toward A Theology of Nonviolence | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-59752-112-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE5LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158 | accessdate=9 March 2017 | p=158ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsers-web"&gt;{{cite web | title=Consistent Life Network Endorsers | website=Consistent Life Network | url=http://www.consistentlifenetwork.org/endorsers | accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Sider]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sider|first1=Ron|title=Completely Pro-Life|date=1987|publisher=Intervarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1706-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Campolo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campolo|first1=Tony|title=Who is Really Pro-Life?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-campolo/who-is-really-prolife_b_31947.html|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=18 October 2006}} (revised 25 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Jonathan|title=Tony Campolo hits hard on abortion, gay marriage, Israel and more|url=http://religionnews.com/2013/12/17/tony-campolo-hits-hard-hot-button-issues/|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Religion News Service|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pally" /&gt; [[Joel Hunter]],&lt;ref name="Pally"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pally|first1=Marcia|title=The New Evangelicals: How Christians are rethinking Abortion and Gay Marriage|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2011/12/28/3399068.htm|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Australian Broadcasting Commission|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wendell Berry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |last=Berry |first=Wendell |date=22 June 1986 |subject=The consequences of treating a fetus as a human being: Reader survey on abortion |work=Whole Earth Review |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/nvp/consistent/whole-earth.html |access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berry |first=Wendell |title=The failure of war}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endorsers-web" /&gt; and [[Shane Claiborne]].&lt;ref name="Pally" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claiborne|first1=Shane|title=A Dialogue on What it Means to be Pro-Life|url=https://www.redletterchristians.org/a-dialogue-on-what-it-means-to-be-pro-life/|website=Red Letter Christians|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Claiborne|first1=Shane|title=The Irresistible Revolution|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
According to Michael Leach, "If one contends, as we do, that the right of every fetus to be born should be protected by civil law and supported by civil consensus, then our moral, political and economic responsibilities do not stop at the moment of birth."&lt;ref name=Leach /&gt; This viewpoint was emphasized by Pope John Paul II in his 1995 encyclical, ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'' (Gospel of Life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=John Paul II |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html |title=Evangelium Vitae |location=Vatican City |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book-length document outlined the Pope's emphasis on fostering a [[culture of life]] based on the New Testament and the life of Jesus. Specifically, he emphasized the value and inviolability of human life, from conception until natural death.

=== Abortion ===
{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}

Rather than "thinking of a pregnant women and her fetus as being adversaries battling over exclusive rights, the right of a woman to control her body versus the right of the fetus to live long enough to control hers", a consistent life ethic would view both as valuable and important, and seek to provide both all the support they needed to live and live well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=The consequences of treating a fetus as a human being |work=Whole Earth Review |date=22 June 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capital punishment ===
{{See also|Catholic Church and capital punishment}}
Traditionally, arguments for the death penalty focus on the idea that it: 1) deters further violence; 2) enacts just retribution on the criminal, effectively gaining a sense of justice for society and those affected by the crime; 3) seeks to reform other criminals with the threat of such severe punishment and; 4) protects society from those criminals which the government has deemed to be the most heinous.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Bernardin and some other consistent life ethic advocates recognize the right of the state to use capital punishment. However, they reject the necessity of this type of punishment for many reasons, arguing that there are more appropriate and effective ways for the state to defend its people.  Many consistent life ethic advocates call for a total abolition of the death penalty.  The consistent ethic's opposition to capital punishment is rooted in the conviction that an atmosphere of respect for life must pervade a society, and resorting to the death penalty does not support this attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardin, Cardinal Joseph A.: ''The Seamless Garment: Writings on the Consistent Ethic of Life'' Orbis Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argue that the result of the death penalty&amp;nbsp;– removing the criminal from society, enacting justice on the criminal, and bringing about feelings of revenge for those affected and the greater society&amp;nbsp;– do not necessarily have to be accomplished by taking a life.

One out-spoken anti-death penalty activist is Sister [[Helen Prejean]]. Her books ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'' and ''The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account to Wrongful Executions'' are autobiographical accounts of the time she spent ministering to death row inmates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rachel MacNair|MacNair, Rachel M.]], and Zunes, Stephen: ''Consistently Opposing Killing: from abortion to assisted suicide, the death penalty and war'', pages 58–60. Praeger Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable independent Catholic anti-death penalty organization is [[Priests for Life]].

=== Health care ===
Bernardin understood the consistent life ethic as implying a societal responsibility to provide adequate health care for all, especially the poor.{{sfn|Bernardin|1985}}{{sfn|Bernardin|1986}}{{sfn|Bernardin|1986}}

According to Ron Hamel,&lt;blockquote&gt;...a moral vision constituted by the consistent ethic of life sensitizes one to procedures, technological developments, and aspects of the health care system that fail to promote or do not adequately promote human dignity and do not sufficiently enhance human life. ...it is not sufficient to only oppose euthanasia, but one must also be concerned about and address those factors that give rise to euthanasia and find ever better ways to care for the dying and ensure the dying the opportunity to forgo treatment and to live their lives fully while dying.&lt;ref name=Hamel&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.chausa.org/publications/health-progress/article/november-december-2008/twenty-five-years-later-cardinal-bernardin's-consistent-ethic-of-life |last=Hamel |first=Ron |title=Twenty-Five Years Later: Cardinal Bernardin's Consistent Ethic of Life |work=Health Progress |date=November 2008 |p=56-59 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, appeals to the consistent life ethic have been made in support of universal health care.&lt;ref name="LIC-2009"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On health care, a consistent ethic of life | work=The Long Island Catholic | volume=48 | issue=23 | date=30 September 2009 | url=http://www.newspaper.licatholic.org/editorial/health-care-consistent-ethic-life | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Refugees ===
The consistent life ethic has been invoked to include care for immigrants and refugees.&lt;ref name="Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Scribner | first=Todd | title=The Gospel of Life and the Catholic approach to the refugee crisis | website=Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good | date=31 July 2014 | url=http://www.catholicsinalliance.org/refugeecrisis | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIC-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite web | last=Adkins | first=Jason | title=Catholic Spirit: Border children and a consistent ethic of life | website=Minnesota Catholic Conference | date=13 August 2014 | url=https://mncatholic.org/catholic-spirit-border-children-consistent-ethic-life/ | accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kangas 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kangas | first=Billy | title=Keeping "Pro-Life" Consistent | website=The Orant | date=22 January 2015 | url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/billykangas/2015/01/keeping-pro-life-consistent.html | accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly appealing to the consistent life ethic, other Catholics have sought to apply the "pro-life" ethic to the issue of immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Snyder |first=L. |display-authors=etal|title=Catholic Leaders to Congress: Immigration Reform is a Pro-Life Issue |date=20 January 2015 |publisher=Faith in Public Life |url=http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/immigrationlife/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329173750/http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/immigrationlife/ |archive-date=29 March 2016 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen 2014"&gt;{{cite news | last=Allen | first=John L.

== Criticisms ==
One criticism made of the consistent life ethic position is that it inadvertently helped provide "cover" or support for politicians who supported legalized abortion or wanted to minimize this issue, a circumstance that Bernardin himself both recognized and deplored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronald N.|last=Neff|url=http://www.sobran.com/columns/2005/050816.shtml |title=The "Seamless Garment" Revisited |work=Sobran's |date=16 August 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregg /&gt;
A critic of [[Joseph Bernardin]], [[George Weigel]] rejected the claims that the consistent life ethic had been created to cover up for abortion rights, saying that Bernardin was "a committed pro-lifer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Weigel |first=George |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2011/02/the-end-of-the-bernardin-era |title=The End of the Bernardin Era: The rise, dominance, and decline of a culturally accommodating Catholicism |work=First Things |date=February 2011 |access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flintenbreite constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland in an ecological settlement in Flintenbreite near Lübeck, Germany]]

A '''constructed wetland''' ('''CW''') is an artificial [[wetland]] to treat municipal or industrial [[wastewater]], [[greywater]] or [[stormwater]] runoff. It may also be designed for land reclamation after [[mining]], or as a [[Flood mitigation|mitigation]] step for natural areas lost to [[land development]].

Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that use natural functions [[vegetation]], [[soil]], and organisms to treat wastewater. Depending on the type of wastewater the design of the constructed wetland has to be adjusted accordingly. Constructed wetlands have been used to treat both centralized and on-site wastewater. Primary treatment is recommended when there is a large amount of suspended solids or soluble organic matter (measured as [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] and [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Similarly to natural wetlands, constructed wetlands also act as a [[biofilter]] and/or can remove a range of [[pollutant]]s (such as organic matter, [[Nutrient pollution|nutrients]], [[pathogen]]s, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]) from the water. Constructed wetlands are a [[sanitation]] technology that have not been designed specifically for [[pathogen]] removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; All types of pathogens (i.e., bacteria, viruses, protozoan and helminths) are expected to be removed to some extent in a constructed wetland. Subsurface wetland provide greater pathogen removal than surface wetlands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are two main types of constructed wetlands: subsurface flow and surface flow constructed wetlands. The planted vegetation plays an important role in contaminant removal. The filter bed, consisting usually of [[sand]] and [[gravel]], has an equally important role to play.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; Some constructed wetlands may also serve as a [[habitat]] for native and migratory [[wildlife]], although that is not their main purpose. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands are designed to have either horizontal flow or vertical flow of water through the gravel and sand bed. Vertical flow systems have a smaller space requirement than horizontal flow systems.

== Terminology ==

Many terms are used to denote constructed wetlands, such as [[reed bed]]s, soil infiltration beds, treatment wetlands, engineered wetlands, man-made or artificial wetlands.&lt;ref name="hoffmann"&gt;Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011): [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/930 Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment]. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; A [[biofilter]] has some similarities with a constructed wetland, but is usually without plants.

The term of constructed wetlands can also be used to describe restored and recultivated land that was destroyed in the past through draining and converting into farmland, or mining.

== Overview ==
[[File:Hamburg-Allermöhe, effluent from constructed wetland (3252520051).jpg|thumb|Effluent from a constructed wetland for [[greywater]] treatment at an ecological housing estate in Hamburg-Allermoehe, Germany]]
[[File:Constructed wetland Bayawan City (4113800865).jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland for domestic wastewater treatment in Bayawan City, the Philippines]]
A constructed wetland is an engineered sequence of water bodies designed to filter and treat [[water pollution|waterborne pollutants]] found in [[sewage]], industrial effluent or [[stormwater|storm water runoff]]. Constructed wetlands are used for [[wastewater treatment]] or for [[greywater]] treatment.&lt;ref name="Dotro"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iwapublishing.com/open-access-ebooks/3567|title=Volume 7. Biological Wastewater Treatment Series|last1=Dotro|first1=G.|last2=Langergraber|first2=G.|last3=Molle|first3=P.|last4=Nivala|first4=J.|last5= Puigagut Juárez|first5=J.|last6=Stein|first6=O. R.|last7=von Sperling|first7=M.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781780408767|location=London|pages=|chapter=Treatment wetlands|oclc=984563578}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used after a [[septic tank]] for primary treatment (or other types of systems) in order to separate the solids from the liquid effluent. Some constructed wetland designs however do not use upfront primary treatment.

Vegetation in a wetland provides a substrate (roots, stems, and leaves) upon which [[microorganism]]s can grow as they break down organic materials. This community of microorganisms is known as the [[periphyton]]. The periphyton and natural chemical processes are responsible for approximately 90 percent of [[pollutant]] removal and waste breakdown.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The plants remove about seven to ten percent of pollutants, and act as a [[carbon]] source for the microbes when they decay. Different species of [[aquatic plant]]s have different rates of heavy metal uptake, a consideration for plant selection in a constructed wetland used for water treatment. Constructed wetlands are of two basic types: subsurface flow and surface flow wetlands.

Constructed wetlands are one example of [[nature-based solutions]] and of [[phytoremediation]].

Many regulatory agencies list treatment wetlands as one of their recommended "[[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]]" for controlling [[urban runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, Denver, CO. "Treatment BMP Fact Sheets:"

==Removal of contaminants==

Physical, chemical, and biological processes combine in wetlands to remove contaminants from wastewater. An understanding of these processes is fundamental not only to designing wetland systems but to understanding the fate of chemicals once they enter the wetland. Theoretically, [[wastewater treatment]] within a constructed wetland occurs as it passes through the wetland medium and the plant [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]]. A thin film around each root hair is [[Oxygen|aerobic]] due to the leakage of oxygen from the [[rhizome]]s, [[root]]s, and rootlets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] micro-organisms facilitate decomposition of organic matter. Microbial [[nitrification]] and subsequent [[denitrification]] releases [[nitrogen]] as gas to the [[atmosphere]]. [[Phosphorus]] is [[Coprecipitation|coprecipitated]] with [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[calcium]] compounds located in the root-bed medium.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brix, H., Schierup, H. (1989): Danish experience with sewage treatment in constructed wetlands. In: Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 565–573&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, T.H., Hart, B.T. (1990): [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080407845500127 Use of aeration to promote nitrification in reed beds treating wastewater]. Advanced Water Pollution Control 11: 77–84. doi:10.1016/b978-0-08-040784-5.50012-7. {{ISBN|9780080407845}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suspended solids]] filter out as they settle in the water column in surface flow wetlands or are physically filtered out by the medium within subsurface flow wetlands. Harmful [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es are reduced by filtration and adsorption by [[biofilm]]s on the gravel or sand media in subsurface flow and vertical flow systems.

===Nitrogen removal===
The dominant forms of nitrogen in wetlands that are of importance to [[wastewater]] treatment include [[organic nitrogen]], [[ammonia]], [[ammonium]], [[nitrate]] and [[nitrite]]. Total nitrogen refers to all nitrogen species. Wastewater nitrogen removal is important because of ammonia’s toxicity to fish if discharged into watercourses. Excessive nitrates in drinking water is thought to cause [[methemoglobinemia]] in infants, which decreases the blood's oxygen transport ability. Moreover, excess input of N from point and non-point sources to surface water promotes eutrophication in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans which causes several problems in aquatic ecosystems e.g. toxic algal blooms, oxygen depletion in water, fish mortality, loss of aquatic biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.R., Caraco, N.F., Correll, D.L., Howarth, R.W., Sharpley, A.N. &amp; Smith, V.H. (1998)[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008%5B0559:NPOSWW%5D2.0.CO;2/abstract  Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen].Ecological Applications, 8, 559–568.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia removal occurs in constructed wetlands – if they are designed to achieve biological nutrient removal – in a similar ways as in [[sewage treatment]] plants, except that no external, energy-intensive addition of air (oxygen) is needed.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; It is a two-step process, consisting of [[nitrification]] followed by [[denitrification]]. The [[nitrogen cycle]] is completed as follows: ammonia in the wastewater is converted to ammonium ions; the aerobic bacterium ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' sp. oxidizes ammonium to nitrite; the bacterium ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' sp. then converts nitrite to nitrate. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is reduced to relatively harmless nitrogen gas that enters the atmosphere.

==== Nitrification ====
{{Further|Nitrification}}
Nitrification is the biological conversion of organic and inorganic nitrogenous compounds from a reduced state to a more oxidized state, based on the action of two different bacteria types.&lt;ref name="Wetzel-1983"&gt;Wetzel, R.G. (1983): Limnology. Orlando, Florida: Saunders college publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrification is strictly an aerobic process in which the end product is nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}). The process of nitrification oxidizes ammonium (from the wastewater) to nitrite ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), and then nitrite is oxidized to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).

==== Denitrification ====
{{Further|Denitrification}}
Denitrification is the biochemical reduction of oxidized nitrogen anions, nitrate and nitrite to produce the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide ({{chem|N|2|O}}) and nitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}), with concomitant oxidation of organic matter.&lt;ref name="Wetzel-1983" /&gt; The end product, {{chem|N|2}}, and to a lesser extent the intermediary by product, {{chem|N|2|O}}, are gases that re-enter the atmosphere.

====Ammonia removal from mine water====
Constructed wetlands have been used to remove ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from contaminated [[mine water]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, S., Hellman, M., Choudhury, M.I. &amp; Ecke, F. (2015) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135415302116 Relative importance of plant uptake and plant associated denitrification for removal of nitrogen from mine drainage in sub-arctic wetlands]. Water Research, 85, 377–383.
&lt;/ref&gt; including cyanide and nitrate.

===Phosphorus removal===
[[Phosphorus]] occurs naturally in both organic and inorganic forms. The analytical measure of biologically available [[Phosphate|orthophosphates]] is referred to as soluble reactive phosphorus (SR-P). Dissolved organic phosphorus and insoluble forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus are generally not biologically available until transformed into soluble inorganic forms.&lt;ref name="Mitsch-Gosselink-1986"&gt;Mitsch, J.W., Gosselink, J.G. (1986): Wetlands. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;

In freshwater [[aquatic ecosystem]]s phosphorus is typically the major limiting nutrient. Under undisturbed natural conditions, phosphorus is in short supply. The natural scarcity of phosphorus is demonstrated by the explosive growth of [[algae]] in water receiving heavy discharges of phosphorus-rich wastes. Because phosphorus does not have an atmospheric component, unlike nitrogen, the [[phosphorus cycle]] can be characterized as closed. The removal and storage of phosphorus from wastewater can only occur within the constructed wetland itself. Phosphorus may be sequestered within a wetland system by:
# The binding of phosphorus in organic matter as a result of incorporation into living biomass,
# [[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]] of insoluble phosphates with [[ferric]] iron, [[calcium]], and [[aluminium]] found in wetland soils.&lt;ref name="Mitsch-Gosselink-1986" /&gt;

====Biomass plants incorporation====
Aquatic vegetation may play an important role in phosphorus removal and, if harvested, extend the life of a system by postponing phosphorus saturation of the sediments.&lt;ref name="gunten89"&gt;Guntensbergen, G.R., Stearns, F., Kadlec, J.A. (1989): Wetland vegetation. In Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 73–88&lt;/ref&gt; Plants create a unique environment at the biofilm's attachment surface. Certain plants transport oxygen which is released at the biofilm/root interface, adding oxygen to the wetland system. Plants also increase soil or other root-bed medium hydraulic conductivity. As roots and rhizomes grow they are thought to disturb and loosen the medium, increasing its porosity, which may allow more effective fluid movement in the rhizosphere. When roots decay they leave behind ports and channels known as macropores which are effective in channeling water through the soil.

===Metals removal===
Constructed wetlands have been used extensively for the removal of dissolved metals and [[metalloids]]. Although these contaminants are prevalent in mine drainage, they are also found in [[stormwater]], [[Leachate|landfill leachate]] and other sources (e.g., leachate or FDG washwater{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} at [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]]), for which treatment wetlands have been constructed for mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/wetlands/Welcome.htm |title=Wetlands for Treatment of Mine Drainage |publisher=Technology.infomine.com |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mine water—Acid drainage removal====
Constructed wetlands can also be used for treatment of [[acid mine drainage]] from coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hedin, R.S., Nairn, R.W.; Kleinmann, R.L.P. (1994): Passive treatment of coal mine drainage. Information Circular (Pittsburgh, PA.: U.S. Bureau of Mines) (9389).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathogen removal ===
Constructed wetlands are a sanitation technology that have not typically been designed for pathogen removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter (BOD/COD) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

All types of pathogens are expected to be removed in a constructed wetland; however, greater pathogen removal is expected to occur in a subsurface wetland. In a free water surface flow wetland one can expect 1 to 2 [[Common logarithm|log10]] reduction of pathogens; however, bacteria and virus removal may be less than 1 log10 reduction in systems that are heavily planted with vegetation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is because constructed wetlands typically include vegetation which assists in removing other pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, the importance of sunlight exposure in removing viruses and bacteria is minimized in these systems.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Removal in a properly designed and operated free water surface flow wetland is reported to be less than 1 to 2 log10 for bacteria, less than 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 1 to 2 log10 for protozoa:, and 1 to 2 log10 for helminths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In subsurface flow wetlands, the expected removal of pathogens is reported to be 1 to 3 log10 for bacteria, 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 2 log10 for protozoa, and 2 log10 for helminths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The log10 removal efficiencies reported here can also be understood in terms of the common way of reporting removal efficiencies as percentages: 1 log10 removal is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 90%; 2 log10 = 99%; 3 log10 = 99.9%; 4 log10 = 99.99% and so on.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

==Types and design considerations==
The main three broad types of constructed wetlands include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stefanakis|first1=Alexandros|last2=Akratos|first2=Christos|last3=Tsihrintzis|first3=Vassilios|title=Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands: Eco-engineering Systems for Wastewater and Sludge Treatment|date=5 August 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-404612-2|pages=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/vertical-flow-constructed-wetlands/stefanakis/978-0-12-404612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;
* Subsurface flow constructed wetland - this wetland can be either with vertical flow (the effluent moves vertically, from the planted layer down through the substrate and out) or with horizontal flow (the effluent moves horizontally, parallel to the surface)
* Surface flow constructed wetland (this wetland has horizontal flow)
* Floating treatment wetland

The former types are placed in a basin with a substrate to provide a surface area upon which large amounts of waste degrading biofilms form, while the latter relies on a flooded treatment basin upon which aquatic plants are held in flotation till they develop a thick mat of roots and rhizomes upon which biofilms form. In most cases, the bottom is lined with either a polymer [[geomembrane]], concrete or clay (when there is appropriate clay type) in order to protect the water table and surrounding grounds. The substrate can be either [[gravel]]—generally limestone or pumice/volcanic rock, depending on local availability, [[sand]] or a mixture of various sizes of media (for vertical flow constructed wetlands).

===Subsurface flow ===
[[File:Tilley et al 2014 Schematic of the Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland: Effluent flows through pipes on the subsurface of the ground through the root zone to the ground.&lt;ref name="eawag.ch"&gt;Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph., Zurbrügg, C. (2014): [http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies – (2nd Revised Edition)]. Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland. {{ISBN|978-3-906484-57-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Tilley et al 2014 Schematic of the Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of the Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland: Effluent flows horizontally through the bed.&lt;ref name="eawag.ch" /&gt;]]
[[File:Final tags.jpg|thumb|right|Vertical flow type of constructed wetlands (subsurface flow)]]

In subsurface flow constructed wetlands the flow of wastewater occurs between the roots of the plants and there is no water surfacing (it is kept below gravel). As a result, the system is more efficient, does not attract mosquitoes, is less odorous and less sensitive to winter conditions. Also, less area is needed to purify water. A downside to the system are the intakes, which can clog or [[bioclogging|bioclog]] easily, although some larger sized gravel will often solve this problem.

Subsurface flow wetlands can be further classified as horizontal flow or vertical flow constructed wetlands. In the vertical flow constructed wetland, the effluent moves vertically from the planted layer down through the substrate and out (requiring air pumps to aerate the bed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stefanakis|first1=Alexandros|last2=Akratos|first2=Christos|last3=Tsihrintzis|first3=Vassilios|title=Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands: Eco-engineering Systems for Wastewater and Sludge Treatment|date=5 August 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780124046122|pages=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/vertical-flow-constructed-wetlands/stefanakis/978-0-12-404612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the horizontal flow constructed wetland the effluent moves horizontally via gravity, parallel to the surface, with no surface water thus avoiding mosquito breeding. Vertical flow constructed wetlands are considered to be more efficient with less area required compared to horizontal flow constructed wetlands. However, they need to be interval-loaded and their design requires more know-how while horizontal flow constructed wetlands can receive wastewater continuously and are easier to build.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

Due to the increased efficiency a vertical flow subsurface constructed wetland requires only about {{convert|3|m2|sqft}} of space per [[Population equivalent|person equivalent]], down to 1.5 square metres in hot climates.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

The "French System" combines primary and secondary treatment of raw wastewater. The effluent passes various filter beds whose grain size is getting progressively smaller (from gravel to sand).&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

==== Applications ====
Subsurface flow wetlands can treat a variety of different wastewaters, such as household wastewater, agricultural, paper mill wastewater, mining [[runoff (water)|runoff]], [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] or [[meat]] processing wastes, [[storm water]].&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

The quality of the effluent is determined by the design and should be customized for the intended reuse application (like irrigation or toilet flushing) or the disposal method.

==== Design considerations ====
Depending on the type of constructed wetlands, the wastewater passes through a gravel and more rarely [[sand]] medium on which plants are rooted.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; A [[gravel]] medium (generally limestone or volcanic rock [[Lava filter|lavastone]]) can be used as well (the use of lavastone will allow for a surface reduction of about 20% over limestone) is mainly deployed in horizontal flow systems though it does not work as efficiently as sand (but sand will clog more readily).&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

Constructed subsurface flow wetlands are meant as [[secondary treatment]] systems which means that the effluent needs to first pass a primary treatment which effectively removes solids. Such a primary treatment can consist of sand and grit removal, grease trap, [[compost]] filter, [[septic tank]], [[Imhoff tank]], anaerobic baffled reactor or u[[Upflow  anaerobic sludge blanket|pflow anaerobic sludge  blanket]]  (UASB) reactor.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification. Most important is the biological filtration through a biofilm of [[Aerobic bacteria|aerobic]] or [[facultative bacteria]]. Coarse sand in the filter bed provides a surfaces for microbial growth and supports the adsorption and filtration processes. For those microorganisms the oxygen supply needs to be sufficient.

Especially in warm and dry climates the effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation are significant. In cases of water loss, a vertical flow constructed wetland is preferable to a horizontal because of an unsaturated upper layer and a shorter retention time, although vertical flow systems are more dependent on an external energy source. Evapotranspiration (as is rainfall) is taken into account in designing a horizontal flow system.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

The effluent can have a yellowish or brownish colour if [[sewage|domestic wastewater]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] is treated. Treated [[greywater]] usually does not tend to have a colour. Concerning pathogen levels, treated greywater meets the standards of pathogen levels for safe discharge to surface water.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Maiga, Y., von Sperling, M., Mihelcic, J. 2017.

Plantings of [[reedbed]]s are popular in European constructed subsurface flow wetlands, although at least twenty other plant species are usable. Many fast growing timer plants can be used, as well for example as Musa spp., Juncus spp., cattails (''[[Typha]]'' spp.) and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]].

==== Operation and maintenance ====
Overloading peaks should not cause performance problems while continuous overloading lead to a loss of treatment capacity through too much suspended solids, sludge or fats.

Subsurface flow wetlands require the following maintenance tasks: regular checking of the pretreatment process, of pumps when they are used, of influent loads and distribution on the filter bed.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

==== Comparisons with other types ====
Subsurface wetlands are less hospitable to [[mosquito]]es compared to surface flow wetlands, as there is no water exposed to the surface. Mosquitos can be a problem in surface flow constructed wetlands. Subsurface flow systems have the advantage of requiring less land area for water treatment than surface flow. However, surface flow wetlands can be more suitable for wildlife habitat.

For urban applications the area requirement of a subsurface flow constructed wetland might be a limiting factor compared to conventional municipal [[wastewater treatment plants]]. High rate aerobic treatment processes like [[activated sludge]] plants, trickling filters, rotating discs, submerged aerated filters or [[membrane bioreactor]] plants require less space. The advantage of subsurface flow constructed wetlands compared to those technologies is their operational robustness which is particularly important in developing countries. The fact that constructed wetlands do not produce secondary sludge ([[sewage sludge]]) is another advantage as there is no need for [[sewage sludge treatment]].&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; However, primary sludge from primary settling tanks does get produced and needs to be removed and treated.

==== Costs ====
The costs of subsurface flow constructed wetlands mainly depend on the costs of sand with which the bed has to be filled.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; Another factor is the cost of land.

===Surface flow ===
[[File:Schematic of the Free Water Surface Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a free-water surface constructed wetland: It aims to replicate the naturally occurring processes, where particles settle, pathogens are destroyed, and organisms and plants utilize the nutrients.]]
Surface flow wetlands, also known as free water surface constructed wetlands, can be used for tertiary treatment or polishing of effluent from [[wastewater treatment]] plants. They are also suitable to treat stormwater drainage.

Surface flow constructed wetlands always have horizontal flow of wastewater across the roots of the plants, rather than vertical flow. They require a relatively large area to purify water compared to subsurface flow constructed wetlands and may have increased smell and lower performance in winter.

Surface flow wetlands have a similar appearance to ponds for wastewater treatment (such as "[[waste stabilization pond]]s") but are in the technical literature not classified as ponds.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogens are destroyed by natural decay, predation from higher organisms, sedimentation and UV irradiation since the water is exposed to direct sunlight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The soil layer below the water is anaerobic but the roots of the plants release oxygen around them, this allows complex biological and chemical reactions.

Surface flow wetlands can be supported by a wide variety of soil types including [[bay mud]] and other [[silt]]y [[clay]]s.

Plants such as  Water Hyacinth (''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'') and ''[[Pontederia]]'' spp. are used worldwide (although Typha and Phragmites are highly invasive).

However, surface flow constructed wetlands may encourage mosquito breeding. They may also have high algae production that lowers the effluent quality and due to open water surface mosquitos and odours, it is more difficult to integrate them in an urban neighbourhood.

===Hybrid systems===
A combination of different types of constructed wetlands is possible to use the specific advantages of each system.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

[[File:Newly planted constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Newly planted constructed wetland]]
[[File:Mature Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Same constructed wetland, two years later]]

===Others===
====Integrated constructed wetland====
An integrated constructed wetland (ICW) is an unlined free surface flow constructed wetland with emergent vegetated areas and local soil material. Its objectives is not only to treat wastewater from farmyards and other wastewater sources, but also to integrate the wetland infrastructure into the landscape and enhancing its [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]].&lt;ref name=Scholz07b&gt;Scholz M., Sadowski A. J., Harrington R. and Carroll P. (2007b), Integrated Constructed Wetlands Assessment and Design for Phosphate Removal. ''Biosystems Engineering'', 97 (3), 415–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated constructed wetland facilitates may be more robust treatment systems compared to other constructed wetlands.&lt;ref name=Mustafa09&gt;Mustafa A., Scholz M., Harrington R. and Carrol P. (2009) Long-term Performance of a Representative Integrated Constructed Wetland Treating Farmyard Runoff. ''Ecological Engineering'', 35 (5), 779–790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz07a&gt;Scholz M., Harrington R., Carroll P. and Mustafa A. (2007a), The Integrated Constructed Wetlands (ICW) Concept. ''Wetlands'', 27 (2), 337–354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz07b/&gt; This is  due to the greater biological complexity and generally relatively larger land area use and associated longer hydraulic [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] of integrated constructed wetland compared to conventional constructed wetlands.&lt;ref name=Carty08&gt;Carty A., Scholz M., Heal K., Gouriveau F. and Mustafa A. (2008), The Universal Design, Operation and Maintenance Guidelines for Farm Constructed Wetlands (FCW) in [[Temperate|Temperate Climates]]. ''Bioresource Technology'', 99 (15), 6780–6792.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integreated constructed wetlands are used in [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the [[United States]] since about 2007. Farm constructed wetlands, which are a subtype of integrated constructed wetlands, are promoted by the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] and the [[Northern Ireland]] [[Environment Agency]] since 2008.&lt;ref name=Carty08/&gt;

==Plants and other organisms==
{{See also|Organisms used in water purification}}

===Plants===

[[File:Newly planted constructed wetland - details (3110372910).jpg|thumb|Newly planted constructed wetland for [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] treatment (Lima, Peru)]]
[[File:Constructed wetland (5547294390).jpg|thumb|The large roots of this uprooted plant growing in a constructed wetlands indicate a healthy plant (Lima, Peru)]]
Typhas and Phragmites are the main species used in constructed wetland due to their effectiveness, even though they can be [[Invasive species|invasive]] outside their native range.

In North America, cattails (''[[Typha latifolia]]'') are common in constructed wetlands because of their widespread abundance, ability to grow at different water depths, ease of transport and transplantation, and broad tolerance of water composition (including pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and contaminant concentrations). Elsewhere, Common Reed (''[[Phragmites australis]]'') are common (both in blackwater treatment but also in [[greywater treatment]] systems to purify wastewater).

Plants are usually [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] in that location for [[Ecology|ecological]] reasons and optimum workings.

===Animals===

[[File:Flowform.jpg|thumb|right|A hybrid system using Flowforms in a treatment pond, in [[Norway]].]]
Locally grown non-[[predator]]y [[fish]] can be added to surface flow constructed wetlands to eliminate or reduce [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, such as [[mosquito]]s. 

[[Stormwater]] wetlands provide habitat for amphibians but the pollutants they accumulate can affect the survival of larval stages, potentially making them function as "ecological traps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Parris |first2=Kirsten M. |last3=Swearer |first3=Stephen E. |last4=Hale |first4=Robin |title=Stormwater wetlands can function as ecological traps for urban frogs |journal=Ecological Applications |date=June 2018 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=1106–1115 |doi=10.1002/eap.1714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
Since constructed wetlands are self-sustaining their lifetime costs are significantly lower than those of conventional treatment systems. Often their capital costs are also lower compared to conventional treatment systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |date=December 2003 |title=Technical and Regulatory Guidance Document for Constructed Treatment Wetlands |url=http://www.itrcweb.org/GuidanceDocuments/WTLND-1.pdf |publisher=Interstate Technology &amp; Regulatory Council |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do take up significant space, and are therefore not preferred where real estate costs are high.

== History ==
Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with sand filter bed have their origin in Europe and are now used all over the world. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with a gravel bed are mainly found in North Africa, South Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Austria ===
The total number of constructed wetlands in [[Austria]] is 5,450 (in 2015).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langergraber|first=Guenter|last2=Weissenbacher|first2=Norbert|date=2017-05-25|title=Survey on number and size distribution of treatment wetlands in Austria|url=http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/75/10/2309|journal=Water Science and Technology|language=en|volume=75|issue=10|pages=2309–2315|doi=10.2166/wst.2017.112|issn=0273-1223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to legal requirements (nitrification), only vertical flow constructed wetlands are implemented in Austria as they achieve better [[nitrification]] performance than horizontal flow constructed wetlands. Only about 100 of these constructed wetlands have a design size of 50 [[population equivalent]]s or more. The remaining 5,350 treatment plants are smaller than that.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
The [[Arcata Marsh]] in Arcata, California is a sewage treatment and wildlife protection marsh.

=== Australia ===
The [[Urrbrae Wetland]] in Australia was constructed for urban flood control and environmental education.

At the Ranger Uranium Mine, in Australia, ammonia is removed in "enhanced" natural wetlands (rather than fully engineered constructed wetlands), along with manganese, uranium and other metals.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The '''Count's Feud''' ({{lang-da|Grevens Fejde}}), also called the '''Count's War''', was a [[war of succession]] that raged in [[Denmark]] in 1534–36 and brought about the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]]. In the international context, it was part of the [[European wars of religion]]. The Count's Feud takes its name from the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Count [[Christopher of Oldenburg]], who supported the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], deposed in 1523, over the election of [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | place = DK | title = Danske Konger | url = http://www.danskekonger.dk/biografi/andre/grevefejde.html | contribution = Grevens Fejde | trans-title = Danish Kings and their History | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100920120934/http://danskekonger.dk/biografi/andre/grevefejde.html | archivedate = 2010-09-20 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | title = Danmark Historien | place = DK | url = http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/grevens-fejde-1534-36 | contribution = Grevens Fejde 1534–36 | publisher = Aarhus Universitet}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a staunch Protestant who had already implemented [[Lutheranism]] as the state religion in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] and [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] in 1528.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Christian_3|title= Christian 3|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author= Erik Opsahl|accessdate= August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/Wolfgang_von_Utenhof|title=Wolfgang von Utenhof

== Background ==
[[File:Christian III.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]]]
After [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]]'s death in 1533, the [[Election of Christian III|Jutland nobility proclaimed his son]], then Duke Christian of [[Gottorp]], as King under the name [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. Meanwhile, Count Christopher (or Christoffer) organized an uprising against the new king, demanding that Christian II be set free. Supported by [[Lübeck]] and troops from [[Oldenburg]] and [[Mecklenburg]], parts of the [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] and [[Skåneland|Skåne]] nobilities rose up, together with cities such as [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmø]]. The violence itself began in 1534, when a [[privateer]] captain who had earlier been in Christian II's service, Klemen Andersen, called [[Skipper Clement]], at Count Christoffer's request instigated the peasants of [[Vendsyssel]] and [[North Jutland County|North Jutland]] to rise up against the nobles. The headquarters for the revolt came to be in [[Aalborg]]. A large number of manors were burned down in northern and western Jutland. On 10 August 1534, Count Christoffer accepted [[Skåneland|Skåne]] for Christian II's rule. The month before, Christoffer was heralded as [[regent]] on Christian II's behalf by the Zealand Council in [[Ringsted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | publisher = Roennebech | url = http://www.roennebech.dk/www_fredericiashistorie/html/fredericia/artikler/Grevens_fejde.html | contribution = Grevens Fejde | title = Danmarks historie | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100525172351/http://www.roennebech.dk/www_fredericiashistorie/html/fredericia/artikler/Grevens_fejde.html | archivedate = 2010-05-25 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battles of Svenstrup and Aalborg==
[[Image:Johan rantzau.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Johan Rantzau]]
An army of nobles under the leadership of [[Niels Brock]] and [[Holger Rosenkrantz]] was defeated at the Battle of Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian III, in the meantime, forced a peace with Lübeck, from which great reinforcements could be freed up to fight against the rebels.  Under the leadership of [[Johan Rantzau]], the royal troops pursued the peasants all the way to Aalborg, where the latter, under the leadership of Skipper Clement, had taken refuge behind the city's fortifications.

On 18 December, Rantzau's troops stormed the city, and it fell.  At least 2,000 people are thought to have lost their lives in the storming of the city and in the plundering of the following days.  For his part, Skipper Clement, badly wounded, managed to escape, but a few days later was recognized by a peasant in [[Storvorde]] east of Aalborg and handed over to Rantzau.  Skipper Clement was later sentenced to death by the judicial council in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] and executed in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3724 ''Grevens Fejde, borgerkrig 1534-1536'' (Grænseforeningen)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124213/http://graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3724 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battles of Helsingborg and Øksnebjerg==
Fortune did not fare well for the rebelling supporters of the Catholic faith, nor for the farmers on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] front.  The Swedish King [[Gustav Vasa]] sent a Swedish army to the aid of Christian III, which invaded [[Skåne]] at [[Loshult]] and plundered, burned, and murdered their way throughout the {{Interlanguage link multi|Göinge (region)|sv|3=Göinge|lt=Gønge}} area as it advanced toward the town of [[Vä|Væ]].  Later, a Swedish army invaded [[Halland]], which was destroyed by fire and sword.  Some of the Scanian nobles sided with the Swedes, but [[Tyge Krabbe]] in [[Helsingborg]] Castle supported Count Christoffer.  In January 1535, the Swedes and the army of nobles advanced on Helsingborg.  An army consisting of residents of Lübeck and Malmø under [[Jørgen Kock]] was entrenched outside of the castle, and in a decisive moment, Tyge Krabbe suddenly had the castle's cannons open fire against its defenders, after which he opened the castle to the Swedes, who set fire to Helsingborg and reduced the town to ashes.  With that, Denmark east of the [[Oresund|Sound]] was lost for Count Christoffer.

After the victory at Aalborg, Rantzau brought his troops to Funen, and on 11 June 1535, they fought the [[Battle of Øksnebjerg]], where the rest of Count Christoffer's army was decisively defeated.  Both Copenhagen and Malmø, however, were able to hold out until 1536, when they were forced to capitulate after several months' siege.  With this, the Count's Feud was officially over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bricksite.com/grevensfejde?id=377277|title=Grevensfejde|website=www.bricksite.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aftermath==
In the aftermath of the feud, the nobles regrouped and healed the rifts the usual way, namely through inter-marriage. One of the most powerful among the Danish nobility in [[Skåneland|Skåne]] at this time was the Bille family, who were tied through blood relations to seven of the eight Catholic bishops of Denmark. The Billes also had six family members on the Council of the Realm and owned castles throughout Denmark and Norway. In order to keep the family's powerful position, in spite of the religious affiliation with the Catholic faith, [[Claus Bille]] (of [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] fame, second cousin to [[Gustav Vasa]]), protected the family by forming a political alliance through marriage with the Brahe family, another powerful Scanian family among the Danish nobility at this time. The Brahe family was one of the first among the nobility to convert to Lutheranism. Claus Bille gave his 18-year-old daughter Beate in marriage to [[Otte Brahe]], and thus became a grandfather in 1546 to the perhaps most famous Scanian of the era, the astronomer Tyge Brahe, better known as [[Tycho Brahe]]. Tycho Brahe's paternal grandfather, whom he was named after, Tyge Brahe of Tosterup in eastern Skåne, was killed 7 September 1523 during the siege of Malmø, fighting for Frederick I. Axel Brahe, the brother of the older Tyge Brahe, served as governor of Scania for a long period, and was one of the first to convert to Lutheranism.

In contrast, the consequences of the peasant uprising cost all parties dearly.  Many were forced to purchase their lives with great gifts both to the king and to the nobles.  Moreover, the dissatisfactions of the peasants, which had culminated in the uprising of the Count's Feud, were only made worse, as the nobility began to stick together even more after this incident.  Moreover, Christian III's rule, ushered in by this war, saw the rise of royal absolutism in Denmark, and, with it, greater repression of the peasant classes.

An important consequence not sufficiently appreciated by Danes at the time was the introduction of a Swedish army into Skåne. Though in this case the Swedes came at the invitation of a Danish King to help subdue his rebellious subjects and duly handed over to the King the territory which they conquered, it had a clear effect of whetting Swedish appetite to gain the territory for themselves, which was manifested in a long series of subsequent wars culminating with the final Swedish victory and conquest in 1658.

''nat_ind'' stands for [[mathematical induction]], ''eq_ind'' for substitution of equals and ''f_equal'' for taking the same function on both sides of the equality.  Earlier theorems are referenced showing ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0 and S&amp;nbsp;(''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;''y''.]]

In [[programming language theory]] and [[proof theory]], the '''Curry–Howard correspondence''' (also known as the '''Curry–Howard isomorphism''' or '''equivalence''', or the '''proofs-as-programs''' and '''propositions-''' or '''formulae-as-types interpretation''') is the direct relationship between [[computer program]]s and [[mathematical proof]]s. 

It is a generalization of a syntactic [[analogy]] between systems of formal logic and computational calculi that was first discovered by the American [[mathematician]] [[Haskell Curry]] and [[logician]] [[William Alvin Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;The correspondence was first made explicit in {{harvnb|Howard |1980}}. See, for example section 4.6, p.53 [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/courses/sem-ws07/notes/0.pdf Gert Smolka and Jan Schwinghammer (2007-8), Lecture Notes in Semantics]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the link between logic and computation that is usually attributed to Curry and Howard, although the idea is related to the operational interpretation of [[intuitionistic logic]] given in various formulations by  [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], [[Arend Heyting]] and [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (see [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]])&lt;ref&gt;The Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation  is also called the 'proof interpretation': p. 161 of Juliette Kennedy, Roman Kossak, eds. 2011.

The relationship has been extended to include [[category theory]] as the three-way '''Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence'''.

The beginnings of the '''Curry–Howard correspondence''' lie in several observations:
# In 1934 [[Haskell Curry|Curry]] observes that the [[typed lambda calculus|type]]s of the combinators could be seen as [[axiom-scheme]]s for [[intuitionism|intuitionistic]] implicational logic.{{sfn|Curry|1934}}
# In 1958 he observes that a certain kind of [[proof calculus|proof system]], referred to as [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s, coincides on some fragment to the typed fragment of a standard [[model of computation]] known as [[combinatory logic]].{{sfn|Curry|Feys|1958}}
# In 1969 [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] observes that another, more "high-level" [[proof calculus|proof system]], referred to as [[natural deduction]], can be directly interpreted in its [[intuitionistic]] version as a typed variant of the [[model of computation]] known as [[lambda calculus]].{{sfn|Howard|1980}}

In other words, the Curry–Howard correspondence is the observation that two families of seemingly unrelated formalisms—namely, the proof systems on one hand, and the models of computation on the other—are in fact the same kind of mathematical objects.

If one abstracts on the peculiarities of either formalism, the following generalization arises: ''a proof is a program, and the formula it proves is the type for the program''.  More informally, this can be seen as an [[analogy]] that states that the [[return type]] of a function (i.e., the type of values returned by a function) is analogous to a logical theorem, subject to hypotheses corresponding to the types of the argument values passed to the function; and that the program to compute that function is analogous to a proof of that theorem.  This sets a form of [[logic programming]] on a rigorous foundation: ''proofs can be represented as programs, and especially as lambda terms'', or ''proofs can be '''run'''''.

The correspondence has been the starting point of a large spectrum of new research after its discovery, leading in particular to a new class of [[formal system]]s designed to act both as a [[proof calculus|proof system]] and as a typed [[functional programming language]]. This includes [[Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]] and [[Thierry Coquand|Coquand]]'s [[Calculus of Constructions]], two calculi in which proofs are regular objects of the discourse and in which one can state properties of proofs the same way as of any program. This field of research is usually referred to as modern [[type theory]].

Such [[typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] derived from the Curry–Howard paradigm led to software like [[Coq]] in which proofs seen as programs can be formalized, checked, and run.

A converse direction is to ''use a program to extract a proof'', given its [[program correctness|correctness]]—an area of research closely related to [[proof-carrying code]].  This is only feasible if the [[programming language]] the program is written for is very richly typed:  the development of such type systems has been partly motivated by the wish to make the Curry–Howard correspondence practically relevant.

The Curry–Howard correspondence also raised new questions regarding the computational content of proof concepts that were not covered by the original works of Curry and Howard. In particular, [[classical logic]] has been shown to correspond to the ability to manipulate the [[continuation]] of programs and the symmetry of [[sequent calculus]] to express the duality between the two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] known as call-by-name and call-by-value.

Speculatively, the Curry–Howard correspondence might be expected to lead to a substantial [[unifying theories in mathematics|unification]] between mathematical logic and foundational computer science:

Hilbert-style logic and natural deduction are but two kinds of proof systems among a large family of formalisms. Alternative syntaxes include [[sequent calculus]], [[proof net]]s, [[calculus of structures]], etc. If one admits the Curry–Howard correspondence as the general principle that any proof system hides a model of computation, a theory of the underlying untyped computational structure of these kinds of proof system should be possible. Then, a natural question is whether something mathematically interesting can be said about these underlying computational calculi.

Conversely, [[combinatory logic]] and [[simply typed lambda calculus]] are not the only [[models of computation]], either.  Girard's [[linear logic]] was developed from the fine analysis of the use of resources in some models of lambda calculus; is there typed version of [[Turing machine|Turing's machine]] that would behave as a proof system? [[Typed assembly language]]s are such an instance of "low-level" models of computation that carry types.

Because of the possibility of writing non-terminating programs, [[Turing-complete]] models of computation (such as languages with arbitrary [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]) must be interpreted with care, as naive application of the correspondence leads to an inconsistent logic.  The best way of dealing with arbitrary computation from a logical point of view is still an actively debated research question, but one popular approach is based on using [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]] to segregate provably terminating from potentially non-terminating code (an approach that also generalizes to much richer models of computation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Eugenio|last=Moggi|year=1991|title=Notions of Computation and Monads|journal=Information and Computation|volume=93|issue=1|url=http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/ftp/ic91.pdf|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(91)90052-4|pages=55–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is itself related to modal logic by a natural extension of the Curry–Howard isomorphism&lt;ref name=PfenningDaviesJudgmental group=ext/&gt;).  A more radical approach, advocated by [[total functional programming]], is to eliminate unrestricted recursion (and forgo [[Turing completeness]], although still retaining high computational complexity), using more controlled [[corecursion]] wherever non-terminating behavior is actually desired.

==General formulation==
In its more general formulation, the Curry–Howard correspondence is a correspondence between formal [[proof calculus|proof calculi]] and [[type systems]] for [[model of computation|models of computation]]. In particular, it splits into two correspondences. One at the level of [[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] and [[data type|types]] that is independent of which particular proof system or model of computation is considered, and one at the level of [[mathematical proof|proofs]] and [[computer program|programs]] which, this time, is specific to the particular choice of proof system and model of computation considered.

At the level of formulas and types, the correspondence says that implication behaves the same as a function type, conjunction as a "product" type (this may be called a tuple, a struct, a list, or some other term depending on the language), disjunction as a sum type (this type may be called a union), the false formula as the empty type and the true formula as the singleton type (whose sole member is the null object). Quantifiers correspond to [[dependent type|dependent]] function space or products (as appropriate). 
&lt;!-- If quantification comes in two flavors, it is because there are two ways to think about the Curry–Howard correspondence. If one considers that every single proof step has to be computational, then [[universal quantification]] is interpreted as dependent product and [[existential quantification]] as a dependent sum (this corresponds to interpreting a proof as a term typed  [[simply typed lambda calculus|à la Church]]). If otherwise one considers that some trivial computational step can be omitted, then universal quantification is interpreted as a dependent [[Type_system#Intersection_types|intersection type]] and existential quantification as a dependent [[Type_system#Union_types|union type]] (this corresponds to interpreting a proof as a term typed [[simply typed lambda calculus|à la Curry]], which was actually the approach taken by Howard). --&gt; 
This is summarized in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"
! style="width:300px" | Logic side
! style="width:300px" | Programming side
|-

|- 
| [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] || [[sum type]]
|-
| true formula || [[unit type]]
|-
| false formula || [[bottom type]]
|-
|}

At the level of proof systems and models of computations, the correspondence mainly shows the identity of structure, first, between some particular formulations of systems known as [[Hilbert-style deduction system]] and [[combinatory logic]], and, secondly, between some particular formulations of systems known as [[natural deduction]] and [[lambda calculus]].

== Corresponding systems ==

===Hilbert-style deduction systems and combinatory logic===
It was at the beginning a simple remark in Curry and Feys's 1958 book on combinatory logic: the simplest types for the basic combinators K and S of [[combinatory logic]] surprisingly corresponded to the respective [[axiom scheme]]s α → (β → α) and (α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)) used in [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s. For this reason, these schemes are now often called axioms K and S. Examples of programs seen as proofs in a Hilbert-style logic are given [[#Examples|below]].

If one restricts to the implicational intuitionistic fragment, a simple way to formalize logic in Hilbert's style is as follows. Let Γ be a finite collection of formulas, considered as hypotheses. Then δ is ''derivable'' from Γ, denoted Γ ⊢ δ, in the following cases:

* δ is an hypothesis, i.e. it is a formula of Γ,
* δ is an instance of an axiom scheme; i.e., under the most common axiom system:
** δ has the form α → (β → α), or
** δ has the form (α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)),
* δ follows by deduction, i.e., for some α, both α → δ and α are already derivable from Γ (this is the rule of [[modus ponens]])

This can be formalized using [[inference rules]], as in the left column of the following table.

Typed combinatory logic can be formulated using a similar syntax: let Γ be a finite collection of variables, annotated with their types. A term T (also annotated with its type) will depend on these variables [Γ ⊢ T:δ] when:

* T is one of the variables in Γ,
* T is a basic combinator; i.e., under the most common combinator basis:
** T is K:α → (β → α) [where α and β denote the types of its arguments], or
** T is S:(α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)),
* T is the composition of two subterms which depend on the variables in Γ.

The generation rules defined here are given in the right-column below. Curry's remark simply states that both columns are in one-to-one correspondence. The restriction of the correspondence to [[intuitionistic logic]] means that some [[Classical logic|classical]] [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], such as [[Peirce's law]] ((α → β) → α) → α, are excluded from the correspondence.

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash E_1:\alpha \rightarrow \beta \qquad \Gamma \vdash E_2:\alpha}{\Gamma \vdash E_1\;E_2:\beta} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Seen at a more abstract level, the correspondence can be restated as shown in the following table. Especially, the [[deduction theorem]] specific to Hilbert-style logic matches the process of [[Combinatory logic#Conversion of a lambda term to an equivalent combinatorial term|abstraction elimination]] of combinatory logic.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"

|-
| assumption || variable
|- 
| axioms || combinators
|- 
| modus ponens || application
|- 
| [[deduction theorem]]  || [[Combinatory logic#Conversion of a lambda term to an equivalent combinatorial term|abstraction elimination]]
|}

Thanks to the correspondence, results from combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and vice versa. For instance, the notion of [[combinatory logic#Reduction in combinatory logic|reduction]] of terms in combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and it provides a way to canonically transform proofs into other proofs of the same statement. One can also transfer the notion of normal terms to a notion of normal proofs, expressing that the hypotheses of the axioms never need to be all detached (since otherwise a simplification can happen).

Conversely, the non provability in intuitionistic logic of [[Peirce's law]] can be transferred back to combinatory logic: there is no typed term of combinatory logic that is typable with type ((α → β) → α) → α.

Results on the completeness of some sets of combinators or axioms can also be transferred. For instance, the fact that the combinator '''X''' constitutes a [[Combinatory logic#One-point basis|one-point basis]] of (extensional) combinatory logic implies that the single axiom scheme
:(((α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ))) → ((δ → (ε → δ)) → ζ)) → ζ,
which is the [[principal type]] of '''X''', is an adequate replacement to the combination of the axiom schemes 
:α → (β → α) and
:(α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)).

===Natural deduction and lambda calculus===
After [[Haskell Curry|Curry]] emphasized the syntactic correspondence between [[Hilbert-style deduction system|Hilbert-style deduction]] and [[combinatory logic]], [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] made explicit in 1969 a syntactic analogy between the programs of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and the proofs of [[natural deduction]]. Below, the left-hand side formalizes intuitionistic implicational natural deduction as a calculus of [[sequent]]s (the use of sequents is standard in discussions of the Curry–Howard isomorphism as it allows the deduction rules to be stated more cleanly) with implicit weakening and the right-hand side shows the typing rules of [[lambda calculus]]. In the left-hand side, Γ, Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote ordered sequences of formulas while in the right-hand side, they denote sequences of named (i.e., typed) formulas with all names different.

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash t:\alpha \rightarrow \beta \qquad \Gamma \vdash u:\alpha}{\Gamma \vdash t\;u:\beta} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

To paraphrase the correspondence, proving Γ ⊢ α means having a program that, given values with the types listed in Γ, manufactures an object of type α. An axiom corresponds to the introduction of a new variable with a new, unconstrained type, the →&amp;nbsp;I rule corresponds to function abstraction and the →&amp;nbsp;E rule corresponds to function application. Observe that the correspondence is not exact if the context Γ is taken to be a set of formulas as, e.g., the λ-terms λx.λy.x and λx.λy.y of type α → α → α would not be distinguished in the correspondence. Examples are given [[#Examples|below]].

Howard showed that the correspondence extends to other connectives of the logic and other constructions of simply typed lambda calculus. Seen at an abstract level, the correspondence can then be summarized as shown in the following table. Especially, it also shows that the notion of normal forms in [[lambda calculus]] matches [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]]'s notion of normal deduction in [[natural deduction]], from which it follows that the algorithms for the [[type inhabitation problem]] can be turned into algorithms for deciding [[intuitionistic]] provability.

Howard's correspondence naturally extends to other extensions of [[natural deduction]] and [[simply typed lambda calculus]]. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

The "lax" modality referred to is from {{Citation|last=Benton|last2=Bierman|last3=de Paiva|title=Computational types from a logical perspective|journal=Journal of Functional Programming|volume=8|pages=177–193|year=1998|doi=10.1017/s0956796898002998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical logic and control operators===
At the time of Curry, and also at the time of Howard, the proofs-as-programs correspondence concerned only [[intuitionistic logic]], i.e. a logic in which, in particular, [[Peirce's law]] was ''not'' deducible. The extension of the correspondence to Peirce's law and hence to [[classical logic]] became clear from the work of Griffin on typing operators that capture the evaluation context of a given program execution so that this evaluation context can be later on reinstalled. The basic Curry–Howard-style correspondence for classical logic is given below. Note the correspondence between the [[double-negation translation]] used to map classical proofs to intuitionistic logic and the [[continuation-passing style|continuation-passing-style]] translation used to map lambda terms involving control to pure lambda terms. More particularly, call-by-name continuation-passing-style translations relates to [[Kolmogorov]]'s double negation translation and call-by-value continuation-passing-style translations relates to a kind of double-negation translation due to Kuroda.

| [[Peirce's law]]: ((α → β) → α) → α || [[call-with-current-continuation]]
|-
| [[double-negation translation]] || [[continuation-passing style|continuation-passing-style translation]]
|}

A finer Curry–Howard correspondence exists for classical logic if one defines classical logic not by adding an axiom such as [[Peirce's law]], but by allowing several conclusions in sequents. In the case of classical natural deduction, there exists a proofs-as-programs correspondence with the typed programs of Parigot's [[lambda-mu calculus|λμ-calculus]].

===Sequent calculus===
A proofs-as-programs correspondence can be settled for the formalism known as [[Gentzen]]'s [[sequent calculus]] but it is not a correspondence with a well-defined pre-existing model of computation as it was for Hilbert-style and natural deductions.

Sequent calculus is characterized by the presence of left introduction rules, right introduction rule and a cut rule that can be eliminated. The structure of sequent calculus relates to a calculus whose structure is close to the one of some [[abstract machine]]s. The informal correspondence is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"

|-

|}

==Related proofs-as-programs correspondences==

===The role of de Bruijn===

[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|N. G. de Bruijn]] used the lambda notation for representing proofs of the theorem checker [[Automath]], and represented propositions as "categories" of their proofs.  It was in the late 1960s at the same period of time Howard wrote his manuscript; de Bruijn was likely unaware of Howard's work, and stated the correspondence independently (Sørensen &amp; Urzyczyn [1998] 2006, pp 98–99).  Some researchers tend to use the term Curry–Howard–de Bruijn correspondence in place of Curry–Howard correspondence.

===BHK interpretation===

The [[BHK interpretation]] interprets intuitionistic proofs as functions but it does not specify the class of functions relevant for the interpretation. If one takes lambda calculus for this class of function, then the [[BHK interpretation]] tells the same as Howard's correspondence between natural deduction and lambda calculus.

===Realizability===

[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]'s recursive [[realizability]] splits proofs of intuitionistic arithmetic into the pair of a recursive function and of
a proof of a formula expressing that the recursive function "realizes", i.e. correctly instantiates the disjunctions and existential quantifiers of the initial formula so that the formula gets true.

[[Georg Kreisel|Kreisel]]'s modified realizability applies to intuitionistic higher-order predicate logic and shows that the [[simply typed lambda calculus|simply typed lambda term]] inductively extracted from the proof realizes the initial formula. In the case of propositional logic, it coincides with Howard's statement: the extracted lambda term is the proof itself (seen as an untyped lambda term) and the realizability statement is a paraphrase of the fact that the extracted lambda term has the type that the formula means (seen as a type).

[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s [[dialectica interpretation]] realizes (an extension of) intuitionistic arithmetic with computable functions. The connection with lambda calculus is unclear, even in the case of natural deduction.

===Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence===
[[Joachim Lambek]] showed in the early 1970s that the proofs of intuitionistic propositional logic and the combinators of typed [[combinatory logic]] share a common equational theory which is the one of [[cartesian closed categories]]. The expression Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence is now used by some people to refer to the three way isomorphism between intuitionistic logic, typed lambda calculus and cartesian closed categories, with objects being interpreted as types or propositions and morphisms as terms or proofs. The correspondence works at the equational level and is not the expression of a syntactic identity of structures as it is the case for each of Curry's and Howard's correspondences: i.e. the structure of a well-defined morphism in a cartesian-closed category is not comparable to the structure of a proof of the corresponding judgment in either Hilbert-style logic or natural deduction.  To clarify this distinction, the underlying syntactic structure of cartesian closed categories is rephrased below.

Objects (types) are defined by
* &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is an object
* if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are objects then &lt;math&gt;\alpha \times \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; are objects.

Morphisms (terms) are defined by
* &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{eval}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism,  &lt;math&gt;\lambda t&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms, &lt;math&gt;(t, u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u \circ t&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms.

Well-defined morphisms (typed terms) are defined by the following [[type rule|typing rules]] (in which the usual categorical morphism notation &lt;math&gt;f : \alpha \to \beta&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with [[sequent calculus]] notation &lt;math&gt;f :\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta&lt;/math&gt;).

Identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{id:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Composition:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta\qquad u:\!\!-~~ \beta ~\vdash~ \gamma}{u \circ t:\!\!- ~\alpha ~\vdash~ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Unit type]] ([[terminal object]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{\star:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \top}&lt;/math&gt;

Cartesian product:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \beta\qquad u:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \gamma}{(t,u):\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta \times \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

Left and right projection:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{\pi_1:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \alpha}\qquad\frac{}{\pi_2:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Currying]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \gamma}{\lambda t:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta \rightarrow \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Apply|Application]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{eval:\!\!-~~ (\alpha \rightarrow \beta) \times \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the equations of the category are
* &lt;math&gt;id \circ t = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;t \circ id = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(v \circ u) \circ t = v \circ (u \circ t)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\star = id&lt;/math&gt;  (if well-typed)
* &lt;math&gt;\star \circ u = \star&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 \circ (t, u) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\pi_2 \circ (t,u) = u&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\pi_1, \pi_2) = id&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(t_1, t_2) \circ u = (t_1 \circ u, t_2 \circ u) &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;eval \circ (\lambda t \circ \pi_1, \pi_2) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda eval = id&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda t \circ u  = \lambda (t \circ (u \circ \pi_1, \pi_2))&lt;/math&gt;

These equations imply the following &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;-laws:
* &lt;math&gt;(\pi_1 \circ t, \pi_2 \circ t) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda (eval \circ (t \circ \pi_1, \pi_2)) = t&lt;/math&gt;

Now, there exists &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;t:\!\!-~ \alpha_1 \times \ldots \times \alpha_n \vdash \beta&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \vdash \beta &lt;/math&gt; is provable in implicational intuitionistic logic,.

==Examples==
Thanks to the Curry–Howard correspondence, a typed expression whose type corresponds to a logical formula is analogous to a proof of that formula. Here are examples.

===The identity combinator seen as a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt; in Hilbert-style logic===
As an example, consider a proof of the theorem &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;. In [[lambda calculus]], this is the type of the identity function '''I''' = λ''x''.''x'' and in combinatory logic, the identity function is obtained by applying '''S''' = λ''fgx''.''fx(gx)'' twice to '''K''' = λ''xy''.''x''.  That is, '''I''' = (('''S''' '''K''') '''K'''). As a description of a proof, this says that the following steps can be used to prove &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;:

* instantiate the second axiom scheme with the formulas &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;β → α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;(α → ((β → α) → α)) → ((α → (β → α)) → (α → α))&lt;/tt&gt;,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme once with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β → α&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → ((β → α) → α)&lt;/tt&gt;,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme a second time with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → (β → α)&lt;/tt&gt;,
* apply modus ponens twice so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;

In general, the procedure is that whenever the program contains an application of the form (''P'' ''Q''), these steps should be followed:
# First prove theorems corresponding to the types of ''P'' and ''Q''. 
# Since ''P'' is being applied to ''Q'', the type of ''P'' must have the form α → β and the type of ''Q'' must have the form α for some &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;. Therefore, it is possible to detach the conclusion, &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;, via the modus ponens rule.

===The composition combinator seen as a proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in Hilbert-style logic===
As a more complicated example, let's look at the theorem that corresponds to the '''B''' function. The type of '''B''' is (β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α. '''B''' is equivalent to ('''S''' ('''K''' '''S''') '''K'''). This is our roadmap for the proof of the theorem (β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α.

The first step is to construct ('''K''' '''S'''). To make the antecedent of the '''K''' axiom look like the '''S''' axiom, set α equal to &lt;tt&gt;(α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; equal to &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt; (to avoid variable collisions):

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K''' : α → β → α&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;'''K'''[α = (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ, β=δ] : ((α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ) → δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

Since the antecedent here is just '''S''', the consequent can be detached using Modus Ponens:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K S''' : δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the theorem that corresponds to the type of ('''K''' '''S'''). Now apply '''S''' to this expression. Taking '''S''' as follows

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S''' : (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;,

put &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;α → β → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;γ&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;(α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S'''[α = δ, β = α → β → γ, γ = (α → β) → α → γ] : (δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ) → (δ → (α → β → γ)) → δ → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

and then detach the consequent:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S)''' : (δ → α → β → γ) → δ → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the formula for the type of ('''S''' ('''K''' '''S''')). A special case of this theorem has &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;(β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S)'''[δ = β → γ] : ((β → γ) → α → β → γ) → (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This last formula must be applied to '''K'''. Specialize '''K''' again, this time by replacing &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;(β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K''' : α → β → α&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;'''K'''[α = β → γ, β = α] : (β → γ) → α → (β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the same as the antecedent of the prior formula so, detaching the consequent:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S) K''' : (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

Switching the names of the variables &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;γ&lt;/tt&gt; gives us

:&lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt;

which was what remained to prove.

===The normal proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in natural deduction seen as a λ-term===
The diagram below gives proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in natural deduction and shows how it can be interpreted as the λ-expression λ ''a''. λ''b''. λ ''g''.(''a'' (''b'' ''g'')) of type &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt;.

                                      a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b : γ → β    a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ g : γ
 ———————————————————————————————————  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
 a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a : β → α      a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b g : β
 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
                a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a (b g) : α
                ————————————————————————————————————
                a:β → α, b:γ → β ⊢ λ g. a (b g) : γ → α
                ————————————————————————————————————————
                         a:β → α ⊢ λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (γ → β) -&gt; γ → α
                         ————————————————————————————————————
                                 ⊢ λ a. λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (β → α) -&gt; (γ → β) -&gt; γ → α

==Other applications==
Recently, the isomorphism has been proposed as a way to define search space partition in [[genetic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Binard and A. Felty, "Genetic programming with polymorphic types and higher-order functions." In ''Proceedings of the 10th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation,'' pages 1187 1194, 2008.[http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~afelty/dist/gecco08.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt; The method indexes sets of genotypes (the program trees evolved by the GP system) by their Curry–Howard isomorphic proof (referred to as a species).

==Generalizations==
The correspondences listed here go much farther and deeper. For example, cartesian closed categories are generalized by [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal categories]]. The [[internal language]] of these categories is the [[linear type system]] (corresponding to [[linear logic]]), which generalizes simply-typed lambda calculus as the internal language of cartesian closed categories. Moreover, these can be shown to correspond to [[cobordism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;John c. Baez and Mike Stay, "[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta/rose3.pdf Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone]", (2009) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340/ ArXiv 0903.0340] in ''New Structures for Physics'', ed. Bob Coecke, ''Lecture Notes in Physics'' vol. '''813''', Springer, Berlin, 2011, pp. 95–174.&lt;/ref&gt; which play a vital role in [[string theory]].

An extended set of equivalences is also explored in [[homotopy type theory]], which became a very active area of research around 2013 and {{As of|2018|lc=y}} still is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%22homotopy%20type%20theory%22 |title=homotopy type theory - Google Trends |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=trends.google.com |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, [[type theory]] is extended by the [[univalence axiom]] ("equivalence is equivalent to equality") which permits homotopy type theory to be used as a foundation for all of mathematics (including [[set theory]] and classical logic, providing new ways to discuss the [[axiom of choice]] and many other things). That is, the Curry–Howard correspondence that proofs are elements of inhabited types is generalized to the notion [[homotopy|homotopic equivalence]] of proofs (as paths in space, the [[identity type]] or [[Intuitionistic type theory#Connectives of type theory|equality type]] of type theory being interpreted as a path).&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/ ''Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics''].

'''Ecology''' (from {{lang-el|οἶκος}}, "house", or "environment"; -λογία, "study of"){{Cref2|A}} is the branch of [[biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ecology|title=the definition of ecology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221095929/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ecology|archivedate=21 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which studies the interactions among organisms and their environment. Objects of study include interactions of [[organism]]s with each other and with [[abiotic component]]s of their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest include the [[biodiversity]], distribution, [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and [[population]]s of organisms, as well as cooperation and competition within and between [[species]]. [[Ecosystems]] are dynamically interacting systems of [[organisms]], the [[Community (ecology)|communities]] they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as [[primary production]], [[pedogenesis]], [[nutrient cycling]], and [[niche construction]], regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits. Biodiversity means the varieties of [[species]], [[gene]]s, and [[ecosystem]]s, enhances certain [[ecosystem services]].

Ecology is not synonymous with [[environmentalism]], natural history, or [[environmental science]]. It overlaps with the closely related sciences of [[evolutionary biology]], [[genetics]], and [[ethology]]. An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. Ecologists seek to explain:

* Life processes, interactions, and [[adaptations]]
* The movement of materials and [[energy]] through living communities
* The [[ecological succession|successional]] development of ecosystems
* The [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and distribution of organisms and biodiversity in the context of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

Ecology has practical applications in [[conservation biology]], wetland management, [[natural resource management]] ([[agroecology]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[agroforestry]], [[fisheries]]), city planning ([[urban ecology]]), [[community health]], [[Ecological economics|economics]], [[basic science|basic]] and [[applied science]], and human social interaction ([[human ecology]]). For example, the ''[[Circles of Sustainability]]'' approach treats ecology as more than the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and [[Resource (biology)|resources]] compose [[ecosystem]]s which, in turn, maintain [[Biophysics|biophysical]] feedback mechanisms that moderate processes  acting on living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[abiotic]]) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce [[natural capital]] like  [[Biomass |biomass production]] (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of [[climate]], global [[biogeochemical cycles]], [[water filtration]], [[soil formation]], erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.

The word "ecology" ("Ökologie") was coined in [[1866]] by the German scientist [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics.&lt;ref name="LaferrièreStoett2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Laferrière|author2=Peter J. Stoett|title=International Relations Theory and Ecological Thought: Towards a Synthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWtncHw7ErIC&amp;pg=PA25|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-71068-3|pages=25–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624045150/https://books.google.com/books?id=HWtncHw7ErIC&amp;pg=PA25|archivedate=24 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] laid the foundations of ecology in their studies on [[natural history]]. Modern ecology became a much more rigorous [[natural sciences|science]] in the late 19th century. [[Evolution]]ary concepts relating to adaptation and [[natural selection]] became the cornerstones of modern [[Theoretical ecology|ecological theory]].

== Levels, scope, and scale of organization ==

The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., [[cell (biology)|cells]]) to a planetary scale (e.g., [[Earth's spheres|biosphere]]) [[phenomena]]. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic [[Resource (biology)|resources]] and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into [[population]]s which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain [[ecological succession|successional stages]] of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it.&lt;ref name="Stadler98"/&gt; Several generations of an [[aphid]] population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse [[bacteria]]l communities.&lt;ref name="Humphreys97"/&gt; The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole.&lt;ref name=Liere2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liere|first=Heidi|author2=Jackson, Doug|author3=Vandermeer, John|author4=Wilby, Andrew|title=Ecological Complexity in a Coffee Agroecosystem: Spatial Heterogeneity, Population Persistence and Biological Control|journal=PLoS ONE | date=20 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9 | pages=e45508 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045508|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...745508L |pmid=23029061|pmc=3447771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;

The main subdisciplines of ecology, [[population ecology|population]] (or [[community ecology|community]]) ecology and [[ecosystem ecology]], exhibit a difference not only of scale, but also of two contrasting paradigms in the field. The former focus on organisms distribution and abundance, while the later focus on materials and energy fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, S. T. A.; Kolasa, J.; Jones, C. G. (1994). ''Ecological understanding: the nature of theory and the theory of nature''. Academic Press, San Diego. [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=u9kz1IYyZg8C Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hierarchy ===
{{See also|Biological organisation|Biological classification}}

{{quote box
| quote = System behaviors must first be arrayed into different levels of organization. Behaviors corresponding to higher levels occur at slow rates. Conversely, lower organizational levels exhibit rapid rates. For example, individual tree leaves respond rapidly to momentary changes in light intensity, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, and the like. The growth of the tree responds more slowly and integrates these short-term changes.| source = O'Neill et al. (1986)&lt;ref name="O'Neill86" /&gt;{{Rp|76}}| width = 25%| align = right}}

The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remain open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify [[ecosystems]] hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, [[landscape]], and chronological scales.

To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a [[Biological organisation|nested hierarchy]], ranging in scale from [[gene]]s, to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, to [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], to [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], to [[organism]]s, to [[species]], to [[population ecology|population]]s, to [[Community (ecology)|communities]], to [[ecosystem]]s, to [[biome]]s, and up to the level of the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="Nachtomy01"/&gt; This framework forms a [[panarchy]]&lt;ref name="Holling01"/&gt; and exhibits [[non-linear]] behaviors; this means that "effect and cause are disproportionate, so that small changes to critical variables, such as the number of [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixers]], can lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system properties."&lt;ref name="Levin99"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== Biodiversity ===
{{main|Biodiversity}}
{{quote box
| quote = Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. It includes the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, the communities and ecosystems in which they occur, and the ecological and [[evolution]]ary processes that keep them functioning, yet ever changing and adapting.| source= Noss &amp; Carpenter (1994)&lt;ref name="Noss94"/&gt;{{Rp|5}}| width = 25%| align = right}}

Biodiversity (an abbreviation of "biological diversity") describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization.&lt;ref name="Noss90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholes08"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cardinale2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cardinale|first=Bradley J.|author2=Duffy, J.

=== Habitat ===
{{Main|Habitat}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Biodiversity of a [[coral reef]]. [[Coral]]s adapt to and modify their environment by forming [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons. This provides growing conditions for future generations and forms a habitat for many other species.&lt;ref name="Kiessling09" /&gt;]]
[[File:Long-tailed Broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae).jpg|thumb|[[Long-tailed broadbill]] building its [[Bird nest|nest]]]]
The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73"/&gt; More specifically, "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal."&lt;ref name="Beyer10"/&gt;{{Rp|745}} For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a [[Montane ecosystem|montane]] or [[alpine tundra|alpine]] ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population of a species of tropical lizards (''Tropidurus hispidus'') has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental [[life history theory|life history]] of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. [[Biotope]] and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoener75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vitt97"/&gt;

=== Niche ===
{{Main|Ecological niche}}

[[File:Termite mound-Tanzania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Termite]] mounds with varied heights of chimneys regulate gas exchange, temperature and other environmental parameters that are needed to sustain the internal physiology of the entire colony.&lt;ref name="Laland99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes08"/&gt;]]

Definitions of the niche date back to 1917,&lt;ref name="Wiens05"/&gt; but [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] made conceptual advances in 1957&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57b"/&gt; by introducing a widely adopted definition:  "the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes."&lt;ref name="Wiens05" /&gt;{{Rp|519}} The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the ''fundamental'' and the ''realized'' niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists.&lt;ref name="Wiens05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Begon05"/&gt; The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a "[[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[N-dimensional space|hyperspace]] whose ''dimensions'' are defined as environmental variables and whose ''size'' is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has ''positive fitness''."&lt;ref name="Hardesty75"/&gt;{{rp|71}}

[[Biogeography|Biogeographical]] patterns and [[Range (biology)|range]] distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species' [[trait (biology)|traits]] and niche requirements.&lt;ref name="Pearman08"/&gt; Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, [[phenotype]], or [[Phenotypic trait|characteristic]] of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt; Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The [[competitive exclusion principle]] states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting [[Resource (biology)|resource]]; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements.&lt;ref name="Hardin60"/&gt; Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities.&lt;ref name="Scheffer06"/&gt; The habitat plus the niche is called the [[ecotope]], which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73" /&gt;

===Niche construction===
{{Main|Niche construction}}
{{See also|Ecosystem engineering}}

Organisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The [[negative feedback|regulatory feedback]] between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a [[beaver]] [[pond]]) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or [[silica]] skeleton deposits from marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Hastings07"/&gt; The process and concept of [[ecosystem engineering]] is related to [[niche construction]], but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: "organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats."&lt;ref name="Jones94"/&gt;{{Rp|373}}

The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term "niche construction" is more often used in reference to the under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche.&lt;ref name="Laland99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Write06"/&gt; An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of [[social insects]], including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent [[homeostasis]] or [[homeorhesis]] in the structure of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes08"/&gt;

=== Biome ===
{{main|Biome}}

Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation.&lt;ref name="Palmer94"/&gt; There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include [[tropical rainforest]], [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]], [[temperate deciduous forest]], [[taiga]], [[tundra]], [[hot desert]], and [[polar desert]].&lt;ref name="Prentice92"/&gt; Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic [[microbiome]]s. To a [[microorganism|microbe]], the human body is a habitat and a landscape.&lt;ref name="Turnbaugh07"/&gt; Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in [[molecular genetics]], which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays a significant role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.&lt;ref name="DeLong09"/&gt;

=== Biosphere ===
{{main|Biosphere}}
{{See also|Earth's spheres}}
The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. [[Ecological relationship]]s regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals.&lt;ref name="igamberdiev06"/&gt; Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the [[Gaia hypothesis]] is an example of [[holism]] applied in ecological theory.&lt;ref name="Lovelock73"/&gt; The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent [[feedback loop]] generated by the [[metabolic theory of ecology|metabolism]] of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.&lt;ref name="Lovelock03"/&gt;

=== Population ecology ===
{{Main|Population ecology}}
{{See also|Lists of organisms by population}}

Population ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; A population consists of individuals of the same species that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.&lt;ref name="Waples06"/&gt;

A primary law of population ecology is the [[Malthusian growth model]]&lt;ref name="Turchin01"/&gt; which states, "a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant."&lt;ref name="Turchin01" /&gt;{{Rp|18}} Simplified population [[Scientific modelling|models]] usually start with four variables: death, birth, [[immigration]], and [[emigration]].

An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population, such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that [[random]] processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of population change is described by:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}N}{\operatorname{d}T} = bN - dN = (b - d)N = rN, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the population, ''b'' and ''d'' are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively, and ''r'' is the per capita rate of population change.&lt;ref name="Turchin01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandermeer03"/&gt;

Using these modelling techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the [[Law of population growth|logistic equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dT} = aN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of individuals measured as [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] density, ''a'' is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the population. The formula states that the rate of change in population size (''dN/dT'') is equal to growth (''aN'') that is limited by carrying capacity (1&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''N''/''K'').

Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[fecundity]], and survivorship, and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]].

=== Metapopulations and migration ===
{{Main|Metapopulation}}
{{See also|Animal migration}}
The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969&lt;ref name="Levins69"/&gt; as "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize".&lt;ref name="Levins70"/&gt;{{Rp|105}} Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in [[conservation biology|conservation research]].&lt;ref name="Smith05"/&gt; Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality,&lt;ref name="Hanski98"/&gt; and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat.&lt;ref name="Nebel10"/&gt; Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.&lt;ref name="Clark98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dingle96"/&gt;

In metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of [[Juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and [[field study|field studies]] to explain metapopulation structure.&lt;ref name="Hanski04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKenzie06"/&gt;

=== Community ecology ===

Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure [[species diversity]] in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.

[[File:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA) is an example of [[ecosystem ecology]]]]

Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes. Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g. carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic material). Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure [[primary production]] (g C/m^2) in a [[wetland]] in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/m^2/y). This requires an understanding of the community connections between plants (i.e., primary producers) and the decomposers (e.g., [[fungi]] and bacteria),&lt;ref name="Brinson81"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brinson| first1 = M.

The underlying concept of ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of [[George Perkins Marsh]] ("Man and Nature").&lt;ref name="Marsh64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Neil01"/&gt; Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted.&lt;ref name="Tansley35"/&gt; Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space.&lt;ref name="Levin98"/&gt; Ecosystems are broadly categorized as [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]], [[Freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]], atmospheric, or [[Marine ecosystem|marine]]. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are [[technoecosystems]], which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;

=== Food webs ===
{{Main|Food web}}
{{See also|Food chain}}

[[File:Chesapeake Waterbird Food Web.jpg|thumb|right|Generalized food web of waterbirds from [[Chesapeake Bay]]]]

A food web is the archetypal [[ecological network]]. Plants capture [[solar energy]] and use it to synthesize [[simple sugars]] during [[photosynthesis]]. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing [[herbivores]], and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal [[trophic species]] to a top consumer is called the [[food chain]]. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of [[concept map]] or a [[heuristic]] device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.&lt;ref name="O'Neill86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt;

Food webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web [[Microcosm (experimental ecosystem)|microcosm]] studies are extrapolated to larger systems.&lt;ref name="Worm03"/&gt; Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web.&lt;ref name="McCann07"/&gt; Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Wilbur97"/&gt;

Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., [[omnivores]]) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., [[predator|primary predators]]). Theoretical and empirical studies identify [[Random#In biology|non-random]] emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time.&lt;ref name="Emmerson"/&gt; Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability.&lt;ref name="Kraus03"/&gt; Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Egerton07b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shurin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards83"/&gt;

=== Trophic levels ===
{{Main|Trophic level}}

[[File:TrophicWeb.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.05|A trophic pyramid (a) and a food-web (b) illustrating [[ecological relationship]]s among creatures that are typical of a northern [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] terrestrial ecosystem. The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of trophic categories are shown to the right of the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees. Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) pyramid of numbers, 2) pyramid of biomass, or 3) pyramid of energy.&lt;ref name="Odum05"/&gt;{{rp|598}}]]

A trophic level (from Greek ''troph'', τροφή, trophē, meaning "food" or "feeding") is "a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level (according to [[ecological pyramid]]s) nearer the abiotic source."&lt;ref name="Hariston93"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or [[trophism]] among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the [[Relative species abundance|abundance]] or biomass at each level.&lt;ref name="Duffy07"/&gt; When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a 'pyramid of numbers'.&lt;ref name="Elton27" /&gt;

Species are broadly categorized as [[autotrophs]] (or [[primary producers]]), [[heterotrophs]] (or [[consumer]]s), and [[Detritivore]]s (or [[decomposers]]). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or [[chemosynthesis]]. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production).&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including [[primary consumers]] (strict herbivores), [[Trophic dynamics|secondary consumers]] ([[carnivorous]] predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators).&lt;ref name="David03"/&gt; Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.&lt;ref name="Oksanen91"/&gt;

Trophic levels are part of the [[holistic]] or [[complex systems]] view of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Loehle88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulanowicz79"/&gt; Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system.&lt;ref name="Li00"/&gt; While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to "reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete, homogeneous trophic levels is fiction."&lt;ref name="Polis96"/&gt;{{rp|815}} Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but "above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores."&lt;ref name="Thompson07"/&gt;{{rp|612}}

=== Keystone species ===
{{main|Keystone species}}
[[File:Sea otters holding hands, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sea otter]]s, an example of a keystone species]]
A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the [[food-web]]. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.&lt;ref name="Fisher06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Libralato06"/&gt;

[[Sea otter]]s (''Enhydra lutris'') are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of [[sea urchins]] that feed on [[kelp]]. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure.&lt;ref name="Mills93"/&gt; Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'').&lt;ref name="Anderson95"/&gt; While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a [[Conservation biology|conservation]] tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.&lt;ref name="Mills93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polis00"/&gt;

== Ecological complexity ==
{{Main|Complexity}}
{{See also|Emergence}}

Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This [[biocomplexity]] stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or [[ecotones]] spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. "What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one."&lt;ref name="Novikoff45"/&gt;{{rp|209}} Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured in the expression (coined by Aristotle) 'the sum is greater than the parts'.&lt;ref name="Schneider01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Molnar04"/&gt;{{Cref2|E}}

"Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric."&lt;ref name="Loehle04"/&gt;{{rp|3}} From these principles, ecologists have identified [[emergence|emergent]] and [[Self-organization#Self-organization in biology|self-organizing]] phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level.&lt;ref name="Lovelock03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum1977"/&gt; Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history.&lt;ref name="Holling01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter01"/&gt; Long-term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. These studies are managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network (LTER).&lt;ref name="urlWelcome to ILTER — ILTER"/&gt; The longest experiment in existence is the [[Park Grass Experiment]], which was initiated in 1856.&lt;ref name="Siverton06"/&gt; Another example is the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest|Hubbard Brook study]], which has been in operation since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbardbrook.org/ |title=Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study Front Page |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324131250/http://www.hubbardbrook.org/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holism ===
{{Main|Holism}}

Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. Holism addresses the [[Biological organisation|biological organization]] of life that [[Systems biology|self-organizes]] into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non-reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an [[ecosystem]], cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts.&lt;ref name="Liu09"/&gt; "New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed."&lt;ref name="Odum05"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to [[reductionistic]].&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikkelson10"/&gt; Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from [[mysticism]] that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the [[biomolecular]] properties of the exterior shells.&lt;ref name="Wilson88"/&gt;

== Relation to evolution ==
{{main|Evolutionary ecology}}

Ecology and evolutionary biology are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences. [[Natural selection]], [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[Developmental biology|development]], [[adaptation]], [[populations]], and [[heredity|inheritance]] are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as [[phylogenetics]] or the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system of taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="Miles93"/&gt; The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="TREE"&gt;{{cite web | editor-last=Craze | editor-first=P. | title=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | publisher=Cell Press, Elsevier, Inc | url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | date=2 August 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724103422/http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | archivedate=24 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock03" /&gt; While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes,&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt; and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Yoshida | first=T | title=Rapid evolution drives ecological dynamics in a predator–prey system | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6946/abs/nature01767.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015001148/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6946/abs/nature01767.html | archivedate=15 October 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioural ecology ===
{{Main|Behavioural ecology}}

[[File:Chameleon spectra.jpg|left|upright=1.45|thumb|Social display and colour variation in differently adapted species of [[chameleons]] (''Bradypodion'' spp.). Chameleons change their skin colour to match their background as a behavioural defence mechanism and also use colour to communicate with other members of their species, such as dominant (left) versus submissive (right) patterns shown in the three species (A-C) above.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Fox08"/&gt;]]

All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, including memory and communication.&lt;ref name="Karban08"/&gt; Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile [[sperm]] of plants, mobile [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]] swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by [[weevils]], the mating dance of a [[salamander]], or social gatherings of [[amoeba]].&lt;ref name="Tinbergen63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamner85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strassmann00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakurai85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson61"/&gt;

Adaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavecol.com/pages/society/welcome.html |title=Behavioral Ecology |publisher=International Society for Behavioral Ecology |accessdate=15 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410105207/http://www.behavecol.com/pages/society/welcome.html |archivedate=10 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.&lt;ref name="Gould82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson00"/&gt;

[[File:Common jassid nymphs and ants02.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Symbiosis:''' [[Leafhopper]]s (''Eurymela fenestrata'') are protected by [[meat ant|ants]] (''Iridomyrmex purpureus'') in a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship. The ants protect the leafhoppers from predators and in return the leafhoppers feeding on plants exude honeydew from their anus that provides energy and nutrients to tending ants.&lt;ref name="Eastwood04"/&gt;]]

Predator-prey interactions are an introductory concept into food-web studies as well as behavioural ecology.&lt;ref name="Ives04"/&gt; Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency.&lt;ref name="Begon05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krebs93"/&gt; For example, "[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk"&lt;ref name="Webb10"/&gt; or "[t]he optimal [[Escape distance|flight initiation distance]] occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk."&lt;ref name="Cooper10"/&gt;

Elaborate sexual [[display (zoology)|displays]] and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals. The [[birds-of-paradise]], for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during [[courtship]]. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by [[sexual selection]] as an advertisement of quality of traits among [[suitors]].&lt;ref name="Kodric-Brown84"/&gt;

=== Cognitive ecology ===

Cognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[neurobiology]], primarily [[cognitive science]], in order to understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework.&lt;ref name=Palacios&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biology Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=95–99 |year=2003 |title=An "enactive" approach to integrative and comparative biology: Thoughts on the table |author=Adrian G Palacios, Francisco Bozinovic |url=http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |doi=10.4067/S0716-97602003000100008 |pmid=12795209 |last2=Bozinovic |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623182048/http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Until recently, however, cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings.

=== Social ecology ===
{{main|Social ecology (academic field)}}

Social ecological behaviours are notable in the [[social insects]], [[slime moulds]], [[social spider]]s, [[human society]], and [[naked mole-rat]]s where [[eusocialism]] has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates&lt;ref name="Strassmann00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman95"/&gt; and evolve from kin and group selection. [[Kin selection]] explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are [[Cloning|clones]] that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; In contrast, [[group selection]]ists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members survive better than groups with predominantly selfish members.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson07"/&gt;

Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a [[host (biology)|host]] and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate.&lt;ref name="Page91"/&gt; Relationships [[Interspecific interaction|within a species]] that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called [[mutualisms]]. Examples of mutualism include [[fungus-growing ants]] employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the [[fig wasp]] and [[yucca moth]] pollination complex, [[lichen]]s with fungi and photosynthetic [[algae]], and [[coral]]s with photosynthetic algae.&lt;ref name="Herre99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert90"/&gt; If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called [[symbiosis]]. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with [[arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for [[nutrients|mineral nutrients]].&lt;ref name="Kiers06"/&gt;

Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called [[commensalism]]; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain | first1=B. R.|year=1985|title=Physiological and ecological controls on carbon sequestering in terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=219–232|doi=10.1007/BF02187200}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called [[parasitism]]. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or [[propagule]]s, denying the services of a beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast.&lt;ref name="Bronstein01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin10"/&gt; Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The [[Red Queen Hypothesis]], for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.&lt;ref name="Boucher82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=King | first1=K.

=== Biogeography ===
{{Main|Biogeography}}

Biogeography (an amalgamation of ''biology'' and ''geography'') is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time.&lt;ref name="Parenti90"/&gt; The ''[[Journal of Biogeography]]'' was established in 1974.&lt;ref name="JBiog"&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal of Biogeography - Overview | publisher = Wiley | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2699/homepage/ProductInformation.html | accessdate = 16 March 2018 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130209095040/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2699/homepage/ProductInformation.html | archivedate = 9 February 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, [[Island biogeography|the theory of island biogeography]], published by the Robert MacArthur and [[Edward O. Wilson]] in 1967&lt;ref name="MacArthur67" /&gt; is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory.&lt;ref name="Wiens04"/&gt;

Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies.&lt;ref name="Parenti90" /&gt; Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as [[Animal migration|migration]] and [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]].&lt;ref name="Wiens04" /&gt; and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called [[Allopatric speciation|vicariance biogeography]] and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography.&lt;ref name="Morrone95"/&gt; There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Svennin08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landhäusser09"/&gt;

==== r/K selection theory ====
{{Main|r/K selection theory}}

A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory,{{Cref2|D}} one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain [[Life history theory|life-history evolution]]. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to [[population densities|population density]]. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for rapid population growth. These early phases of [[population growth]] experience ''density-independent'' forces of natural selection, which is called ''r''-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called ''K''-selection.&lt;ref name="Reznick02"/&gt;

In the ''r/K''-selection model, the first variable ''r'' is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable ''K'' is the carrying capacity of a population.&lt;ref name="Begon05" /&gt; Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An ''r''-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of [[fecundity]] in ''r''-selected species. Many kinds of insects and [[invasive species]] exhibit ''r''-selected [[Phenotypic trait|characteristics]]. In contrast, a ''K''-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting ''K''-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.&lt;ref name="MacArthur67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pianka72"/&gt;

=== Molecular ecology ===
{{Main|Molecular ecology}}

The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]]. The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication ''[[Molecular Ecology]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref name="MolEcol"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Molecular Ecology | editor-last=Rieseberg | editor-first= L. | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/(ISSN)1365-294X | journal = Molecular Ecology }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular ecology]] uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, [[John Avise]] also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, ''Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution''.&lt;ref name="Avise94"/&gt; Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and [[nematode]]s. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology.&lt;ref name="Avise94"/&gt; For example, molecular ecology revealed [[promiscuous]] sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in [[tree swallow]]s previously thought to be socially [[monogamous]].&lt;ref name="Obryan07"/&gt; In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called [[phylogeography]].&lt;ref name="Avise00"/&gt;

Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Human ecology is an [[interdisciplinary]] investigation into the ecology of our species. "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three."&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross04"/&gt;

The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the [[Anthropocene]]. The unique set of circumstances has generated the need for a new unifying science called [[coupled human and natural systems]] that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology.&lt;ref name="Liu09" /&gt; Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in [[social capital|social]]-[[natural capital]], which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from [[ecosystem services|ecosystem goods and services]]. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.&lt;ref name="Liu09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEA05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="de Groot02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aguirre09"/&gt;

Ecology is an employed science of restoration, repairing disturbed sites through human intervention, in natural resource management, and in [[environmental impact assessment]]s. Edward O. Wilson predicted in 1992 that the 21st century "will be the era of restoration in ecology".&lt;ref name="Wilson92"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Wilson | first1=E.

== Relation to the environment ==
{{main|Natural environment}}

The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked, and contains [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason57"/&gt; Like ecology, the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of nature. Environment "includes the physical world, the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation."&lt;ref name="Kleese01"/&gt;{{Rp|62}} The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation, including [[abiotic]] factors such as temperature, radiation, light, chemistry, [[climate]] and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells, organisms, members of the same species ([[conspecific]]s) and other species that share a habitat.&lt;ref name="Campbell06"/&gt;

The distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of [[thermodynamics]], for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated [[materialism|material]] parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or ''holocoenotic'' system as it was once called. This is known as the [[dialectical]] approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or [[umwelt]]). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

=== Disturbance and resilience ===
{{Main|Resilience (ecology)}}

Ecosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances over time and geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation.&lt;ref name="Hughes10"/&gt; Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods,&lt;ref name="Levin92"/&gt; and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity.&lt;ref name="Hughes10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling73" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Folke04"/&gt; Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting as a kind of regenerative insurance.&lt;ref name="Folke04"/&gt;

=== Metabolism and the early atmosphere ===

{{quote box
| quote = Metabolism – the rate at which energy and material resources are taken up from the environment, transformed within an organism, and allocated to maintenance, growth and reproduction – is a fundamental physiological trait.

}}

The Earth was formed approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Allègre95"/&gt; As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by [[hydrogen]] to one composed mostly of [[methane]] and [[ammonia]]. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of [[Redox|reducing and oxidizing]] gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.&lt;ref name="Wills01"/&gt;

[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|left|thumb|The [[leaf]] is the primary site of [[photosynthesis]] in most plants.]]

Throughout history, the Earth's atmosphere and [[biogeochemical cycles]] have been in a [[dynamic equilibrium]] with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt06"/&gt; The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic [[methanogen]] microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). [[Anoxygenic photosynthesis]] reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting [[hydrogen sulfide]] into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + h''v'' → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S). Early forms of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the ''[[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation]]'') did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1&amp;nbsp;billion years prior.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catling05"/&gt;

=== Radiation: heat, temperature and light ===
{{Anchor|Sunlight}}&lt;!-- E.g. in [[Neritic zone]] --&gt;
The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and [[primary production]]. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of [[solar radiation]]. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of [[temperature]] greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of [[biodiversity]] and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. [[Poikilotherms]], for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, [[homeotherms]] regulate their internal body temperature by expending [[food energy|metabolic energy]].&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

There is a relationship between light, primary production, and ecological [[energy budget]]s. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of [[electromagnetic energy]] of different [[wavelength]]s. [[Radiant energy]] from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts as a catalyst for [[genetic mutation]].&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt; Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through [[photosynthesis]]. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] are [[autotrophs]]. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as [[potential energy]] in the form of biochemical [[Enthalpy|enthalpic]] bonds.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

=== Physical environments ===

==== Water ====
{{Main|Aquatic ecosystem}}
{{quote box
| quote = Wetland conditions such as shallow water, high plant productivity, and anaerobic substrates provide a suitable environment for important physical, biological, and chemical processes. Because of these processes, wetlands play a vital role in global nutrient and element cycles.

| width = 25%
| align = right}}
Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (an environment with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration below 2&amp;nbsp;mg/liter) and eventually completely [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] where [[anaerobic bacteria]] thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral composition]] of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles.&lt;ref name="Cronk01"/&gt; Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces ([[aerenchyma]]) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants ([[halophytes]]) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and [[osmoregulation|osmoregulating]] their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in [[Estuary|estuarine]], [[brackish]], or [[ocean]]ic environments. Anaerobic soil [[microorganism]]s in aquatic environments use [[nitrate]], [[Manganese|manganese ions]], [[ferric|ferric ions]], [[sulfate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and some [[organic compounds]]; other microorganisms are [[facultative anaerobes]] and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the [[Reduction potential|oxidation-reduction]] potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by methanogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name="Cronk01"/&gt; The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form [[electrochemical gradient]]s that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.&lt;ref name="Evans99"/&gt;

==== Gravity ====

The shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of [[tectonic plates]] as well as influencing [[geomorphic]] processes such as [[orogeny]] and [[erosion]]. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth ([[gravitropism]]), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the [[biomechanics]] and size of animals.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves.&lt;ref name="Swenson08"/&gt; The [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular systems]] of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).&lt;ref name="Garnter10"/&gt;

==== Pressure ====

Climatic and [[osmotic pressure]] places [[physiological]] constraints on organisms, especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths.&lt;ref name="Neri" /&gt; These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen08"/&gt; [[Xylem|Water transportation]] by plants is another important [[ecophysiology|ecophysiological]] process affected by osmotic pressure gradients.&lt;ref name="Strook08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockman95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmermann02"/&gt; [[Fluid pressure|Water pressure]] in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin|dolphins,]] and [[seal (animal)|seals]] are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences.&lt;ref name="Kastak98"/&gt; Differences between [[hagfish]] species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.&lt;ref name="Nishiguchi10"/&gt;

==== Wind and turbulence ====

[[File:Grassflowers.jpg|thumb|The architecture of the [[inflorescence]] in grasses is subject to the physical pressures of wind and shaped by the forces of natural selection facilitating wind-pollination ([[anemophily]]).&lt;ref name="Friedman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harder09"/&gt;]]

[[Turbulent forces]] in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global [[trade winds]]. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; For example, wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence, mixing the [[water column]] and influencing the environmental profile to create [[thermally layered zones]], affecting how fish, algae, and other parts of the [[aquatic ecosystem]] are structured.&lt;ref name="Shimeta95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Etemad01"/&gt; Wind speed and turbulence also influence [[evapotranspiration rates]] and energy budgets in plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Cronk01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf96"/&gt; Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the [[westerlies]] come into contact with the [[coastal]] and interior mountains of western North America to produce a [[rain shadow]] on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called [[orographic lift]] and can cause precipitation.{{clarify|this sounds as if the rain would fall on the leeward side of the mountains, which can't be right|date=August 2012}} This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the [[xeric]] ecosystems (e.g., of the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]] in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.&lt;ref name="Daubenmire75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele05"/&gt;

{{multiple image

Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. By approximately 350 million years ago (the end of the [[Devonian period]]), photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17%, which allowed combustion to occur.&lt;ref name="Lenton00"/&gt; Fire releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression.&lt;ref name="Lobert93"/&gt; While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time,&lt;ref name="Garren43"/&gt; [[Charles F. Cooper (ecologist)|Charles Cooper]] brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cooper60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper61"/&gt;

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native North Americans]] were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials.&lt;ref name="Wagtendonk07"/&gt; Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment.&lt;ref name="Boerner82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goubitz03"/&gt; Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'') cannot [[germination|germinate]] until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called [[serotiny]].&lt;ref name="Neeman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flematti04"/&gt; Fire plays a major role in the persistence and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Holling73"/&gt;

==== Soils ====
{{main|Soil ecology}}

Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet. It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The [[decomposition]] of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing [[minerals]] and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the [[pedosphere]] where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the [[detritivore]]s that regulate soil formation.&lt;ref name="Coleman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson09"/&gt; Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called [[bioturbation]]. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil [[microorganisms]] are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils.&lt;ref name="Phillips09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Phillips | first1=J.

Other events, such as the [[Tree#Evolutionary history|evolution of trees]] and the [[Evolutionary history of life#Colonization of land|colonization of land]] in the Devonian period played a significant role in the early development of ecological trophism in soils.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davic04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasiotis03"/&gt;

==== Biogeochemistry and climate ====
{{Main|Biogeochemistry}}
{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Climate}}

Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials are regulated, flow, and [[recycling (ecological)|recycled]] through the environment.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt; This research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements ([[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[sulfur]], and [[phosphorus]]; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.&lt;ref name="Falkowoski08"/&gt;

The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year.&lt;ref name="Grace04"/&gt; There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic [[outgassing]], the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref name="Pearson00"/&gt;

In the [[Oligocene]], from twenty-five to thirty-two million years ago, there was another significant restructuring of the global [[carbon cycle]] as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations below 550 ppm.&lt;ref name="Pagani05"/&gt; The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, [[biodiversity loss]], agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of [[permafrost]] are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle, because methane is a [[greenhouse gas]] that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a 100-year time scale.&lt;ref name="Zhuan07"/&gt; Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name="Liu09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Erwin09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Erwin | first1=D.

Ecology has a complex origin, due in large part to its interdisciplinary nature.&lt;ref name="Egerton01"/&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] were among the first to record observations on natural history. However, they viewed life in terms of [[essentialism]], where species were conceptualized as static unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an [[Idealism|idealized type]]. This contrasts against the modern understanding of [[Theoretical ecology|ecological theory]] where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role in the origins of adaptations by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benson00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sober80"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sober | first1=E. | title=Evolution, population thinking, and essentialism | journal=Philosophy of Science | volume=47 | issue=3 | pages=350–383 | jstor=186950 | doi=10.1086/288942| year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early conceptions of ecology, such as a balance and regulation in nature can be traced to [[Herodotus]] (died ''c''. 425 BC), who described one of the earliest accounts of [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] in his observation of "natural dentistry". Basking [[Nile crocodile]]s, he noted, would open their mouths to give [[sandpiper]]s safe access to pluck [[leech]]es out, giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the crocodile.&lt;ref name="Egerton01" /&gt; Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical development of ecology. He and his student [[Theophrastus]] made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations, biogeography, physiology, and on their behaviour, giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche.&lt;ref name="Hughes85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes75"/&gt;

Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developed in the 1700s, through the published works of microscopist [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723) and botanist [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] (1688?–1732).&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Biogeographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769–1859) was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients, where species are replaced or altered in form along [[environmental gradient]]s, such as a [[cline (biology)|cline]] forming along a rise in elevation. Humboldt drew inspiration from [[Isaac Newton]] as he developed a form of "terrestrial physics". In Newtonian fashion, he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species-to-area relationships.&lt;ref name="Kingsland04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins01"/&gt;  Natural historians, such as Humboldt, [[James Hutton]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (among others) laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="McIntosh85"&gt;{{cite book | last1=McIntosh | first1=R.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] indepedently introduced the term a year later, in his book ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' (1866). Haeckel was a zoologist, artist, writer, and later in life a professor of comparative anatomy.&lt;ref name="Stauffer57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friederichs58"/&gt;

Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory. Some mark Haeckel's definition as the beginning;&lt;ref name="Hinchman07"/&gt; others say it was [[Eugenius Warming]] with the writing of [[Plantesamfund|Oecology of Plants: An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities]] (1895),&lt;ref name="Goodland75"/&gt; or [[Carl Linnaeus]]' principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="Egerton07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormandy78"/&gt; Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature.&lt;ref name="Egerton07"/&gt; His works influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus' phrase on the ''economy or polity of nature'' in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Stauffer57" /&gt; Linnaeus was the first to frame the [[balance of nature]] as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin's work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.&lt;ref name="Kormandy78" /&gt;

[[File:Darwin EcoExperiment.JPG|thumb|The layout of the first ecological experiment, carried out in a grass garden at [[Woburn Abbey]] in 1816, was noted by Charles Darwin in ''The Origin of Species''. The experiment studied the performance of different mixtures of species planted in different kinds of soils.&lt;ref name="Hector02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinclair26" /&gt;]]

From Aristotle until Darwin, the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging. Prior to ''The Origin of Species'', there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment.&lt;ref name="Benson00"/&gt; An exception is the 1789 publication ''Natural History of Selborne'' by [[Gilbert White]] (1720–1793), considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology.&lt;ref name="May99"/&gt; While [[Charles Darwin]] is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution,&lt;ref name=Darwin/&gt; he was one of the founders of [[soil ecology]],&lt;ref name="Meysman06"/&gt; and he made note of the first ecological experiment in ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name="Hector02"/&gt; Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Acot97"/&gt;

=== Since 1900 ===
Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the 19th century (around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest). The scientist [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] may have first introduced the term "[[oekology]]" (which eventually morphed into [[home economics]]) in the U.S. as early 1892.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = [[Whitcomb &amp; Barrows]] | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, ecology transitioned from a more [[metaphysics|descriptive form]] of [[natural history]] to a more [[scientific method|analytical form]] of ''scientific natural history''.&lt;ref name="Kingsland04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt; [[Frederic Clements]] published the first American ecology book in 1905,&lt;ref name="Clements05"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Clements | first1=F.

This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of [[seral development]] that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by [[Henry Gleason]],&lt;ref name="Simberloff80"/&gt; who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations.&lt;ref name="Gleason26"/&gt;

The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an [[idealism|idealistic form]] of holism.&lt;ref name="Levins80"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levins |first1=R. |last2=Lewontin |first2=R. |title=Dialectics and reductionism in ecology |journal=Synthese |volume=43 |pages=47–78 |year=1980 |url=http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00413856 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510183920/http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson88" /&gt; The term "holism" was coined in 1926 by [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements' superorganism concept.&lt;ref name="Foster08"/&gt;{{Cref2|C}} Around the same time, [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book ''Animal Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Elton27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elton|first=C.

Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text.&lt;ref name="Allee32"/&gt; [[Alfred J. Lotka]] brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.

In 1942, [[Raymond Lindeman]] wrote a landmark paper on the  [[Trophic dynamics#Trophic dynamics|trophic dynamics]] of ecology, which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis. Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems. [[Robert MacArthur]] advanced mathematical theory, predictions, and tests in ecology in the 1950s, which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical ecologists.&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook77"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cook | first1=R.

{{Cnote2|A|In Ernst Haeckel's (1866) footnote where the term ecology originates, he also gives attribute to {{lang-grc|χώρας|khōrā |χωρα}}, meaning "dwelling place, distributional area" - quoted from Stauffer (1957).}}
{{Cnote2|B|This is a copy of Haeckel's original definition (Original: Haeckel, E. (1866) Generelle Morphologie der Organismen. Allgemeine Grundzige der organischen Formen- Wissenschaft, mechanisch begriindet durch die von Charles Darwin reformirte Descendenz-Theorie. 2 vols. Reimer, Berlin.) translated and quoted from Stauffer (1957).}}
{{Cnote2|C|Foster &amp; Clark (2008) note how Smut's holism contrasts starkly against his racial political views as the father of [[apartheid]].}}
{{Cnote2|D|First introduced in MacArthur &amp; Wilson's (1967) book of notable mention in the history and theoretical science of ecology, ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''.}}
{{Cnote2|E|Aristotle wrote about this concept in ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (Quoted from [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.mb.txt The Internet Classics Archive] translation by [[W. D. Ross]]. Book VIII, Part 6): "To return to the difficulty which has been stated with respect both to definitions and to numbers, what is the cause of their unity? In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something beside the parts, there is a cause; for even in bodies contact is the cause of unity in some cases, and in others viscosity or some other such quality."''}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51928">The use of [[psychoactive substance]]s is one of the most perplexing human behaviors. [[Psychoactive drug]]s can relieve the symptoms of [[mental disorder]]s (e.g. [[lithium]]) or cause harm to individuals and societies (e.g. [[heroin]]). Psychoactive drugs can induce pleasure, increase energy (e.g. [[chocolate]], [[coffee]]), relieve pain ([[Aspirin]]), or can impose a large [[social burden]] in the form of chronic illness (e.g. [[tobacco]]) and be a cause of mortality.

Why do humans seek out and at times even develop addictions to drugs that harm them? A number of attempts have been made to understand drug use and addiction from an evolutionary perspective. '''Evolutionary models of drug use''' are unique in that they emphasize the effect drugs had on [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] over human evolution.

== Hijack hypothesis ==

The dominant paradigm of drug abuse focuses on human [[neurobiology]] and suggests that drug use is the result of reward-related behavior and that [[drug addiction]] is a consequence of drug interference with [[natural reward system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wise|first1=Roy A|title=Addiction Becomes a Brain Disease|journal=Neuron|date=April 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=27–33|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81134-4|pmid=10798389|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81134-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, this tradition postulates that the chemical compounds humans seek out increase brain dopamine levels and thereby effectively usurp [[Mesolimbic pathway|the mesolimbic pathway,]] a system originally intended to motivate/reward fitness enhancing behaviors such as those that increase access to food and sex.&lt;ref name="Neuronal Reward 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Wolfram|title=Potential Vulnerabilities of Neuronal Reward, Risk, and Decision Mechanisms to Addictive Drugs|journal=Neuron|date=February 2011|volume=69|issue=4|pages=603–617|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Ideas concerning the neural bases of motivation and reinforcement in behavior can be traced back to the 1950s. In 1953, Olds and Milner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milner|first=Peter M.|title=Brain-stimulation reward: A review.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0084275|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie|volume=45|issue=1|pages=1–36|doi=10.1037/h0084275}}&lt;/ref&gt; published findings implicating a brain region, specifically a cluster of [[Dopamine|dopamine neurons]], with reward-based learning. Drugs of abuse were later discovered to increase dopamine in the region of the brain associated with reward-based-learning (see: [[brain stimulation reward]]).

=== Proximate Mechanisms ===

==== Molecular Pathways ====
Research on the molecular pathways of addiction suggests that drugs of abuse, despite their diverse chemical substrates, converge on a common circuitry in the brain’s limbic system. Specifically, drugs are thought to activate the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic dopamine pathway]], facilitating dopamine transmission in the [[nucleus accumbens]], via disinhibition, excitation, uptake blockade, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagen|first=E.H.|last2=Sullivan|first2=R.J.|last3=Schmidt|first3=R.|last4=Morris|first4=G.|last5=Kempter|first5=R.|last6=Hammerstein|first6=P.|title=Ecology and neurobiology of toxin avoidance and the paradox of drug reward|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306452209001729|journal=Neuroscience|volume=160|issue=1|pages=69–84|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.01.077}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce a dopamine-like, yet dopamine independent effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nestler|first=Eric J|title=Is there a common molecular pathway for addiction?|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nn1578|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=11|pages=1445–1449|doi=10.1038/nn1578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emotional Pathways ====
The hijack model of drug abuse explains that drugs that elicit positive emotion mediate incentive motivation in the [[nucleus accumbens]] of the brain. Put another way, drugs of abuse act on ancient and evolutionarily conserved neural mechanisms associated with positive emotions that evolved to mediate incentive behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|date=3 October 1997|title=Psychoactive Drug Use in Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Science|volume=278|issue=5335|pages=63–66|doi=10.1126/science.278.5335.63|last1=Nesse|first1=R. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lende|first1=Daniel H.|last2=Smith|first2=E. O.|title=Evolution meets biopsychosociality: an analysis of addictive behavior|journal=Addiction|date=April 2002|volume=97|issue=4|pages=447–458|doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00022.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychoactive drug]]s induce emotions that in human evolutionary history signaled increases in [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durrant|first1=Russil|last2=Adamson|first2=Simon|last3=Todd|first3=Fraser|last4=Sellman|first4=Doug|title=Drug use and addiction: evolutionary perspective|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|date=13 November 2009|volume=43|issue=11|pages=1049–1056|doi=10.3109/00048670903270449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive emotions such as [[euphoria]] and excitation are tools chosen by natural selection to help direct the behavior and physiology of an individual towards an increase in [[Darwinian fitness]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saah|first1=Tammy|title=The evolutionary origins and significance of drug addiction|journal=Harm Reduction Journal|date=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1186/1477-7517-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the environment of evolutionary adaptation, humans would feel positive euphoric emotions in response to a successful foraging session or in the event of a successful breeding. Many psychoactive substances provide this same feeling and yet do not produce fitness benefits.

===== Example: Alcohol =====
Researchers&lt;ref name="saah" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Frone|first2=Michael R.|last3=Russell|first3=Marcia|last4=Mudar|first4=Pamela|year=1995|title=Drinking to regulate positive and negative emotions: A motivational model of alcohol use|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.990|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=5|pages=990–1005|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.990|pmid=7473043|last1=Cooper|first1=M. Lynne}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown how emotional disposition is correlated with problematic use of alcohol, wherein if the reason for alcohol consumption is positive, the user is thought to drink to enhance positive feelings with greater control of the substance than if the user’s emotional disposition prior to alcoholic consumption was negative. In these cases, the individual is drinking to cope and is shown to have less control over his/her own use. Alcohol mediates negative feelings by their suppression but also encourages the habituated continuance of positive emotion. Recovering alcoholics often report that the reason for relapse is often related to the impulse to compensate for negative feelings, resulting in a motivation to cope and therefore drink.

=== Evolutionary Mismatch ===
Despite being harmful, drugs such as [[nicotine]], [[cocaine]], [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], THC, and [[opium]] artificially stimulate the emotions and neural circuits involved in the [[mesolimbic reward system]] thus encouraging [[Recreational drug use|drug consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/22/9/3306.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs of abuse are harmful, why do they  increase dopamine like sugar and sex do? The hijack hypothesis suggests that drugs are effective hijackers of neural reward circuitry (e.g. the mesolimbic dopamine system) because they are [[Evolutionary mismatch|evolutionarily novel]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Specifically proposing that modern-day drug concentrations, methods of delivery, and the existence of certain drugs themselves were not available until recently on an evolutionary time scale, and thus human biology has been slow to adapt and is presently mismatched and susceptible.

To explain how drugs increase dopamine and cause positive emotions while at the same time lowering reproductive fitness, researchers posited that evolutionarily novel drugs hijack the brain’s mesolimbic dopamine system and generate a false positive signal of a fitness benefit as well as inhibiting negative effects, to signal a lack of negative fitness consequences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=R. J|last2=Hagen|first2=E. H|last3=Hammerstein|first3=P.|title=Revealing the paradox of drug reward in human evolution|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2008|volume=275|issue=1640|pages=1231–1241|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1673|pmc=2367444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern drug addiction fundamentally indicates a false increase of fitness, leading to increasing drug abuse to continue gain, even if the gain is realized as being false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eosmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Smith-Evolution-Substance-Abuse.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; That these drugs create a signal in the brain that indicates, falsely, the arrival of a huge fitness benefit which changes behavioral propensities so that drug seeking increases in frequency and displaces adaptive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/22/9/3306.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the hijack hypothesis suggest that the paradox of drug reward is due to this [[evolutionary mismatch]], that extant access to psychoactive drug concentrations and products are unmatched by those that existed in the past.

== The paradox of drug reward ==

Why do humans seek out and consume drugs that harm them? The paradox of drug reward refers to the puzzling ability of drugs to induce both aversive and rewarding effects.&lt;ref name="Sullivan 1231–1241"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Roger J.|last2=Hagen|first2=Edward H.|last3=Hammerstein|first3=Peter|date=2008-06-07|title=Revealing the paradox of drug reward in human evolution|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1640/1231|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=275|issue=1640|pages=1231–1241|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1673|issn=0962-8452|pmc=2367444|pmid=18353749}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite contention on the particulars of dopamine induced reward and behavior, there is agreement that dopamine plays an instrumental role in the processing of reward-related stimuli and that drug induced dopamine stimulation explains at least some part of drug abuse phenomena. And still, almost all major recreational drugs are plant [[secondary metabolite]]s or a close chemical analog.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007" /&gt; The secondary plant compounds from which psychoactive drugs are derived are a form of interspecies defense chemicals that evolved to deter and/or mitigate consumption of the plant soma by [[herbivore]]s/insects. The compounds from which psychoactive drugs are derived evolved to punish herbivore consumption, not reward it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Tony|last2=Amit|first2=Zalman|date=1987-01-01|title=Conditioned taste aversion induced by self-administered drugs: Paradox revisited|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763487800052|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=11|issue=1|pages=107–130|doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(87)80005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human-Plant Coevolutionary History ===
Animals evolved to exploit plant tissues and energy stores and in response plants developed a number of defenses, including neurotoxins. The presence and concentration of these toxins vary by plant tissue, with leaves and organs central to reproduction and energy conservation displaying high toxin concentrations (e.g. pistils/stamens and storage organs) and absent in tissue central to seed dispersion (e.g. fruit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plant-animal interactions : an evolutionary approach|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Science|isbn=978-0-632-05267-7|edition=4. [print.].|location=Oxford [u.a.]|last1=Pellmyr|first1=ed. by Carlos M. Herrera; Olle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power and effectiveness of plant neurotoxic substances has been shaped by ~400 million years of evolution.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt; Plant derived neurotoxins are not evolutionarily novel and human neurophysiology recognizes plant toxins and activates specialized xenobiotic defenses that involve genes, tissue barriers, neural circuits, organ systems and behaviors to protect against them.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt;

==== Herbivore Defense Mechanisms ====
Drug toxicity and aversion exist in humans and are at odds with the theory of drug reward. Chronic drug use is harmful in humans and the human brain has evolved defenses to prevent, not reinforce, drug abuse. In response to the evolution of plant chemical defenses, [[Herbivore adaptations to plant defense|herbivores have co-evolved a number of countermeasures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Agrawal|first2=Anurag A.|date=November 2002|title=Herbivore Offense|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=33|issue=1|pages=641–664|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150443|last1=Karban|first1=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; including (1) compounds that prevent or attenuate induction of plant chemical defenses; (2) detoxification mechanisms, including enzymes and symbiotic relationships with microbes to detoxify or extract nutrients from plant defenses, and cellular membrane carrier proteins for toxin transport; and (3) chemosensors and aversive learning mechanisms that permit selective feeding on less toxic tissues.

==== Human Defense Mechanisms ====
Human and plant neurotoxin coevolution is evidenced by features of the [[xenobiotic]] defense network. Tobacco activates defense mechanisms which researchers suggests it is recognized as toxic not a reward. Nicotine activates [[Bitter taste evolution|bitter taste receptors]] in the mouth and gut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Payne|first2=T J|last3=Ma|first3=J Z|last4=Chen|first4=G|last5=Li|first5=M D|date=4 June 2008|title=Bitter taste receptor gene polymorphisms are an important factor in the development of nicotine dependence in African Americans|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|volume=45|issue=9|pages=578–582|doi=10.1136/jmg.2008.057844|last1=Mangold|first1=J E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingesting 4–8&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotine causes burning of the mouth and throat, nausea, aversion, vomiting and diarrhea. In higher doses the effects are more robust and can result in weakness, confusion, dizziness, convulsions, and coma. If consumed in high enough amounts, [[Nicotine poisoning|acute nicotine toxicity]] can trigger failure of the respiratory system and induce death in human adults within minutes.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt; First-time users of tobacco especially report a variety of unpleasant effects upon administration of nicotine, including nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal distress, headache, and sweating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46244009/s0376-8716_2896_2901327-020160605-7112-1jw4da4.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1493538409&amp;Signature=cKY8VBhWk74%2B7Up%2BB6TDw8nyVlo%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMood_and_physiological_effects_of_subcut.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, when taken with the fact that nicotine is a plant toxin that evolved to deter herbivores,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |title=Naturally Occurring Bioactive Compounds |chapter=Importance of plant secondary metabolites for protection against insects and microbial infections |series=Advances in Phytomedicine |volume=3 |pages=251 |doi=10.1016/S1572-557X(06)03011-X |isbn=9780444522412 |last1=Wink |first1=Michael |editor-first=Mahendra |editor-last=Rai |editor-first2=María Cecilia |editor-last2=Carpinella}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests instead that the human body naturally recognizes tobacco as a toxic substance, and not a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verendeev|first=Andrey|last2=Riley|first2=Anthony L.|title=The role of the aversive effects of drugs in self-administration|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00008877-201309000-00005|journal=Behavioural Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=5 and 6|pages=363–374|doi=10.1097/fbp.0b013e32836413d5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, research has found genetic evidence that humans have had a long evolutionary history to plant neurotoxins. Sullivan et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007" /&gt; has noted that humans, like other mammals, have ‘inherited’ the cytochrome P450 system, which functions to detoxify chemicals found in the environment, including plant neurotoxins. The ubiquity of CYP genes in humans worldwide, including CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, which metabolize nicotine, as well as other drugs, might suggest an evolutionary history with humans and plant neurotoxins.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007" /&gt; The mammalian body has also evolved to develop defenses against overtoxicity, such as e[[Drug metabolism|xogenous substance metabolism]] and vomiting reflexes.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt;

== Neurotoxin regulation hypothesis ==

The [[neurotoxin]] regulation model of human drug use proposes that during the course of human evolution, plant consumption played a key role. The hypothesis suggests that the compulsory consumption of both the nutrients and neurotoxins in plants selected for a system capable of maximizing the benefits of plant energy extraction while mitigating the cost of plant toxicity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hagen|first1=E.H.|last2=Sullivan|first2=R.J.|last3=Schmidt|first3=R.|last4=Morris|first4=G.|last5=Kempter|first5=R.|last6=Hammerstein|first6=P.|title=Ecology and neurobiology of toxin avoidance and the paradox of drug reward|journal=Neuroscience|date=April 2009|volume=160|issue=1|pages=69–84|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.01.077|pmid=19233250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt; To do this, humans evolved a defense system in which plant consumption is mediated by cues of toxicity in a manner sensitive to the individual’s toxicity threshold, maintaining blood toxin concentrations below a critical level.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hagen|first1=Edward H.|last2=Roulette|first2=Casey J.|last3=Sullivan|first3=Roger J.|title=Explaining Human Recreational Use of ‘pesticides’: The Neurotoxin Regulation Model of Substance Use vs. the Hijack Model and Implications for Age and Sex Differences in Drug Consumption|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2013|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence for Toxin Regulation ===
Research on herbivores supports the notion of a regulation pathway. Plant toxin concentration informs mammalian herbivore food choices, with herbivores moderating toxicity by capping daily plant intake to accommodate blood toxin concentrations. This mechanism exists across herbivore species and remains static in response to a range of plant toxins, even those that are evolutionarily novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torregrossa|first1=Ann-Marie|last2=Dearing|first2=M. Denise|title=Nutritional toxicology of mammals: regulated intake of plant secondary compounds|journal=Functional Ecology|date=February 2009|volume=23|issue=1|pages=48–56|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01523.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in laboratory conditions, mice have been shown to moderate administration of drugs regardless of dose per injection or the number of lever presses required.&lt;ref name="Sugar addiction"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmed|first1=Serge H.|last2=Guillem|first2=Karine|last3=Vandaele|first3=Youna|title=Sugar addiction|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|date=July 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=434–439|doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e328361c8b8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example: Nicotine ====
Evidence of toxin regulation exists across drug types and is present in the case of [[nicotine]]. In humans, self-administration of nicotine is moderated such that steady blood concentrations of the toxin are maintained.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Caroline|title=Evolutionary and neuropsychological perspectives on addictive behaviors and addictive substances: relevance to the &amp;quot;food addiction&amp;quot; construct|journal=Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation|date=December 2014|pages=129|doi=10.2147/SAR.S56835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt; Moreover, though nicotine is a potent neurotoxin, lethal overdoses are rare and smoking behavior is couched around titration, with number of cigarettes smoked directly tied to changes in nicotine blood concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherer|first1=Gerhard|title=Smoking behaviour and compensation: a review of the literature|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=5 July 1999|volume=145|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1007/s002130051027|pmid=10445368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, although typical doses of recreational drugs are often only marginally below the lethal dose, overdose remains rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gable|first1=Robert S.|title=Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances|journal=Addiction|date=June 2004|volume=99|issue=6|pages=686–696|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00744.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, drug consumption is metered. Thus, proponents of the neurotoxin regulation model of drug use suggest it is highly unlikely that toxin consumption is controlled by the system that motivates and rewards the consumption of [[macronutrients]]. Arguing that If drugs and sugar (and other energetically dense foods) stimulate dopamine in the mesolimbic reward system with the same degree of efficiency, then, the drug overdose rates should be comparable in scale to the incidence of obesity.

=== Evidence of human brain and plant neurotoxin coevolution ===
The neurotoxin regulation hypothesis proposes that drug use is not novel because human brains and plant neurotoxins [[Coevolution|coevolved]]. Genetic evidence suggests that humans have had regular exposure to plant drugs throughout our evolutionary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1673|title=Revealing the paradox of drug reward in human evolution|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=275|issue=1640|pages=1231|year=2008|last1=Sullivan|first1=R. J|last2=Hagen|first2=E. H|last3=Hammerstein|first3=P.|pmc=2367444}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archeological]] evidence indicates the presence of psychoactive plants and drug use in early hominid species about 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name=saah/&gt; [[Paleogenetics|Paleogenetic]] evidence suggests that the first time human ancestors were exposed and adapted to substantial amount of dietary ethanol, was approximately 10 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrigan|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Uryasev|first2=Oleg|last3=Frye|first3=Carole B.|last4=Eckman|first4=Blair L.|last5=Myers|first5=Candace R.|last6=Hurley|first6=Thomas D.|last7=Benner|first7=Steven A.|title=Hominids adapted to metabolize ethanol long before human-directed fermentation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 January 2015|volume=112|issue=2|pages=458–463|doi=10.1073/pnas.1404167111|bibcode=2015PNAS..112..458C|pmc=4299227}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurobiological]] evidence appears to corroborate this story. The fit of [[allelochemicals]] within the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] indicates some coevolutionary activity between mammalian brains and psychoactive plants, meaning they interacted ecologically and therefore responded to one another evolutionarily.&lt;ref name=saah/&gt; This would have only been possible with mammalian [[Central nervous system|CNS]] exposure to these allelochemicals, therefore to ancient mammalian psychotropic substance use. For example, the mammalian brain has evolved receptor systems for plant substances, such as the opioid receptor system, not available to the mammalian body itself.

=== Neurotoxin regulation hypothesis versus hijiack hypothesis ===
The neurotoxin regulation model of drug use is a response to proponents of the hijack hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt; Largely this is because the neurobiological reward model of drug use sees interactions between plant neurotoxins and human reward systems as novel and rewarding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuronal Reward 2011"/&gt;

The neurotoxin regulation hypothesis emphasizes the [[evolutionary biology]] of plant-human coevolution and maintains that [[Secondary metabolite|secondary plant metabolites]], including [[alkaloid]]s like nicotine, morphine, and cocaine, are potent [[neurotoxin]]s that evolved to deter and punish herbivore consumption of the plant soma not encourage/reward it. Researchers highlight that it is evolutionarily disadvantageous for plants to produce toxins that plant predators (e.g. humans) are attracted to, and that it runs contrary to evolutionary logic that plant predators (e.g. humans) would evolve neurobiological systems unprotected from plant toxin consumption.&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Proponents of the hijack hypothesis outline a path to addiction that involves drugs co-opting neural reward systems intended for food. However, research on murine models has shown that when the concentration is sufficiently high, sugar operates as a more robust reward than even [[cocaine]]. In laboratory conditions, where rats are presented with both a sugar and cocaine sipper, they choose sugar.&lt;ref name="Sugar addiction" /&gt; Researchers use&lt;ref name="Sugar addiction" /&gt; these findings to suggest that sugar reward might generate a stronger dopamine stimulation than cocaine and also may make use of neural mechanisms beyond dopamine stimulation.

Alternative mechanisms explain continued tobacco use: The majority of first time users of cigarettes report adverse reactions, including nausea, dizziness, sickness, and headache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eissenberg|first1=Thomas|last2=Balster|first2=Robert L|title=Initial tobacco use episodes in children and adolescents: current knowledge, future directions|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|date=May 2000|volume=59|pages=41–60|doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(99)00164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by DiFranza et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiFranza|first1=Joseph R.|last2=Savageau|first2=Judith A.|last3=Fletcher|first3=Kenneth|last4=Ockene|first4=Judith K.|last5=Rigotti|first5=Nancy A.|last6=McNeill|first6=Ann D.|last7=Coleman|first7=Mardia|last8=Wood|first8=Constance|title=Recollections and repercussions of the first inhaled cigarette|journal=Addictive Behaviors|date=February 2004|volume=29|issue=2|pages=261–272|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2003.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 69% of subjects rated inhaling their first cigarette as bad, and nearly three-quarters (72%) reported that their first cigarette made them not want to smoke again. Given the above, opponents of the reward model of drug use suggest it is likely that a mechanism other than a false perception of an increased fitness benefit via hijacking of the brain’s [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic dopamine system]], is leading to continued tobacco use.

== Pharmacophagy hypothesis ==

Throughout the course of [[human evolution]], the importance of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive plant substances]] for health has been enormous. Since our earliest ancestors chewed on certain herbs to relieve pain, or wrapped leaves around wounds to improve healing, natural products have often been the only ways of treating disease and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ji|first1=Hong-Fang|last2=Li|first2=Xue-Juan|last3=Zhang|first3=Hong-Yu|title=Natural products and drug discovery. Can thousands of years of ancient medical knowledge lead us to new and powerful drug combinations in the fight against cancer and dementia?|journal=EMBO Reports|date=20 February 2009|volume=10|issue=3|pages=194–200|doi=10.1038/embor.2009.12|pmid=19229284|pmc=2658564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants provide fitness benefits. Upwards of 25% of all pharmaceutical drugs are from plant-derived sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maridass|first1=M|title=Origins of plant derived medicines|journal=Ethnobotanical Leaflets|date=2008|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1078&amp;context=ebl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US National Cancer Institute has identified over 3,000 plants that are effective against cancer cells. Almost all major recreational drugs are [[Secondary metabolite|secondary plant compounds]] or a close chemical analog.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt; It is well established that in both present and past contexts plants have been used for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2007"/&gt;

A core premise of [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]] is that a trait cannot evolve unless it contributes to an individual’s reproductive fitness. Proponents of the pharmacophagy hypothesis/medicinal model of drug use suggest that pharmacophagy, the consumption of pharmacological substances for medicinal purposes, evolved in the backdrop of human-plant coevolution as a means of self-medication. Theorists propose that the reason humans learned to ignore the cues of plant toxicity (e.g. bitter taste) and consumed potentially lethal substances with little to no energetic content because ingesting the bioactive compounds of plants in small amounts was therapeutic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt;

Though the long-term health costs of drug use are undeniable, proponents of the medicinal model of drug use suggest it is possible that regulated consumption of plant neurotoxins was selected for. In this regard, researchers have argued that the human brain evolved to control and regulate intake of psychoactive plant toxins in order to promote [[Fitness (biology)|reproductive fitness]]. Broadly, theorists suggest that plant toxins were deliberately ingested by human ancestors to combat [[macroparasite]]s (e.g. parasitic worms) and/or to ward off disease carrying vectors (e.g. mosquitos).

=== Nicotine as an anthelminthic ===
For example, researchers have recently sought to understand why humans began using tobacco in spite of the consequences and adverse reactions commonly associated with its use. Hagen and colleagues&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; propose that, as in other species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=I. T.|title=An Ecologically Motivated Analysis of Plant-Herbivore Interactions in Native Tobacco|journal=Plant Physiology|date=1 December 2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=1449–1458|doi=10.1104/pp.010762}}&lt;/ref&gt; humans began using tobacco and other plant toxins as a way of controlling infection by parasitic diseases, including [[helminths]]. Tobacco, as well as arecoline and cannabis, two other plant neurotoxins that are widely used as recreational drugs in humans, have been found to be toxic to parasitic worms that affect humans and other mammals, as well as plants.&lt;ref name="Casey J 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roulette|first1=Casey J.|last2=Mann|first2=Hayley|last3=Kemp|first3=Brian M.|last4=Remiker|first4=Mark|last5=Roulette|first5=Jennifer W.|last6=Hewlett|first6=Barry S.|last7=Kazanji|first7=Mirdad|last8=Breurec|first8=Sébastien|last9=Monchy|first9=Didier|last10=Sullivan|first10=Roger J.|last11=Hagen|first11=Edward H.|title=Tobacco use vs. helminths in Congo basin hunter-gatherers: self-medication in humans?|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=September 2014|volume=35|issue=5|pages=397–407|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern anthelminthics function as well by targeting [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAChRs) on [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] muscle cells of parasites, producing paralysis and expelling the parasite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Köhler|first1=Peter|title=The biochemical basis of anthelmintic action and resistance|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|date=April 2001|volume=31|issue=4|pages=336–345|doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(01)00131-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same receptors which are targeted by nicotine (Roulette et al., 2014). Moreover, it has also been found that nicotine is equally or more effective than commercial anthelmintics at killing leeches, including those that infect humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bahmani|first1=Mahmoud|last2=Farkhondeh|first2=Tahereh|last3=Sadighara|first3=Parisa|title=The anti-parasitic effects of Nicotina tabacum on leeches|journal=Comparative Clinical Pathology|date=27 January 2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=357–359|doi=10.1007/s00580-012-1413-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Roulette et al. (2014)&lt;ref name="Casey J 2014"/&gt; found in a study comparing male smoking prevalence and parasite load among Aka [[hunter-gatherer]]s that treatment with commercial anthelmintics was associated with a decrease in [[cotinine]] concentrations (a measure of current tobacco use), thereby supporting their theory that humans regulate the amount of tobacco used in response to current helminth infection. The study also found that men with higher initial tobacco use also had lower worm burdens one year later, suggesting that nicotine not only eliminates parasites, but also protects from reinfection.

== Sexual selection hypothesis ==

Some evolutionary psychological theories concerning drug use suggest individuals consume drugs to increase reproductive opportunities. Drug use can increase reproductive fitness because drug use can (1) advertise biological quality, sexual maturity, or availability, (2) decrease inhibitions in mating contexts, and/or (3) enhance associative learning behaviors that in turn increase mating opportunities. See Richardson et al., 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=George B.|last2=Chen|first2=Ching-Chen|last3=Dai|first3=Chia-Liang|last4=Swoboda|first4=Christopher M.|last5=Nedelec|first5=Joseph L.|last6=Chen|first6=Wei-Wen|title=Substance use and mating success|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=January 2017|volume=38|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review.

=== Costly Signaling ===

==== Advertising biological quality ====
Researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polderman|first1=Tinca J C|last2=Benyamin|first2=Beben|last3=de Leeuw|first3=Christiaan A|last4=Sullivan|first4=Patrick F|last5=van Bochoven|first5=Arjen|last6=Visscher|first6=Peter M|last7=Posthuma|first7=Danielle|title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies|journal=Nature Genetics|date=18 May 2015|volume=47|issue=7|pages=702–709|doi=10.1038/ng.3285}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that because variation in drug use susceptibility is in part due to genetic factors, drug consumption could potentially be a costly and [[Signalling theory|honest signal]] of biological quality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borkowska|first1=Barbara|last2=Pawlowski|first2=Boguslaw|title=Recreational Drug Use and Fluctuating Asymmetry: Testing the Handicap Principle|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=October 2014|volume=12|issue=4|pages=147470491401200|doi=10.1177/147470491401200407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zahavi|first=Amotz|title=Mate selection—A selection for a handicap|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022519375901113|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=205–214|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis being that humans engage in substance use despite health costs in part to evidence that they can afford to do so. To test the effects substance use had on indicators of mating success researchers tested the effect an individual’s [[fluctuating asymmetry]] had on the propensity/likelihood to use drugs and found no significant results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Advertising sexual maturity ====
Hagen et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Edward H 2013"/&gt; suggest that individuals use drug substances to signal maturity. They point out that sexually selected cues of quality often emerge in adolescence (e.g. the peacock’s tail) and reliably signal developmental maturity. The [[Teratology|teratogenic]] effects of drugs of abuse are well documented, as is the fact that psychoactive substances are most harmful for individuals who are developmentally immature. Although this hypothesis remains untested, evidence in support comes from age at onset of drug use. Unequivocally, tobacco consumption does not occur prior to age 11 and in most all cases, this aligns with age at onset of drug use, as cigarette addicts report having first smoked in adolescence. Hagen et al. suggest the reason drug use most often occurs in adolescent populations is due to the developmental maturity of the adolescent nervous system as well as the increases competition to compete for mates. Consistent with these notions, researchers have found that adolescents with alcohol use disorders were more sexually active, had more sexual partners, and initiated sexual activity at slightly albeit younger ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Susan L|last2=Pollock|first2=Nancy K|last3=Martin|first3=Christopher S|last4=Lynch|first4=Kevin G|title=Risky sexual behaviors among adolescents with alcohol use disorders|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|date=September 1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–181|doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decreasing inhibitions ===
Another possible explanation to the prevalence of substance use is that it contributes to mating success by altering brain functions that lower inhibitions. Generally, people seem to believe substance use will enhance their social behaviors in ways conducive to mating success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fromme|first1=Kim|last2=Stroot|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Kaplan|first3=David|title=Comprehensive effects of alcohol: Development and psychometric assessment of a new expectancy questionnaire.|journal=Psychological Assessment|date=1993|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–26|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.5.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that many drug types inhibit prefrontal cortex neural activity, the area of the brain responsible conducting long term gains and short term costs.

C|title=The incentive sensitization theory of addiction: some current issues|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=12 October 2008|volume=363|issue=1507|pages=3137–3146|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary Approaches to Age and Sex Differences in Drug Use ==
Drug use is not evenly distributed in the population. Research has shown that the prevalence of substance use problems varies in fairly reliable ways according to age, sex, and sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, and across drug categories—including alcohol, coffee, cannabis, and nicotine—men make up the primary drug demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Degenhardt|first=Louisa|last2=Chiu|first2=Wai-Tat|last3=Sampson|first3=Nancy|last4=Kessler|first4=Ronald C.|last5=Anthony|first5=James C.|last6=Angermeyer|first6=Matthias|last7=Bruffaerts|first7=Ronny|last8=Girolamo|first8=Giovanni de|last9=Gureje|first9=Oye|date=2008-07-01|title=Toward a Global View of Alcohol, Tobacco, Cannabis, and Cocaine Use: Findings from the WHO World Mental Health Surveys|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050141|journal=PLOS Medicine|volume=5|issue=7|pages=e141|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050141|issn=1549-1676|pmc=2443200|pmid=18597549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that the prevalence of substance use disorders is highest among young adults (ages 18–29),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00048670903270449|doi=10.3109/00048670903270449}}&lt;/ref&gt; and among individuals of low socioeconomic status.

=== Sex differences ===
[[Life history theory|Life history]] predicts that men, especially if they are young, are most likely to engage in drug use because they are most likely to engage in risky behavior and discount the future. Young men have the most to gain from risk-taking behavior because competition for mates, status, and resources is greatest during late adolescence and young adulthood. As men age, they are more likely to develop long-term [[Pair bond|pair-bonds]], accrue status, and have children, thus as men age life history theory predicts a decrease in risk taking behavior and a reallocation of energy to parenting rather than mating. Average age at drug initiation, occurs in adolescence (ages 15–25) and supports this shift. In contrast, life history theory predicts that women are less prone to engage in risk-taking behavior because they experience less variance in reproductive success and have more to lose from risk taking and more to gain from focusing effort on parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=Michael R.|last2=Mueller|first2=Laurence D.|date=1993-03-01|title=Stearns, Stephen C., 1992.

==== ''The fetal protection hypothesis:'' ====
Almost all major recreational drugs are secondary plant compounds or a close chemical analog &lt;ref name="Sullivan 1231–1241"/&gt; and are thus teratogenic, substances known to cause congenital abnormalities and other reproductive harms (e.g. nicotine, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide). Give sex-specific vulnerabilities and fitness costs, the fetal protection hypothesis proposes that selection for increased drug avoidance could have evolved in women to protect them from harming their developing fetuses and nursing infants.&lt;ref name="Hagen"/&gt;

'''Ancestral Women and Conditions''': In the [[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptation]] (EEA), selection pressures shaping avoidance of or defenses against teratogenic substances would have been high. Evidence from evolutionary anthropology suggest ancestral women, similar to women in extant hunter gatherer populations, experienced high fertility and high infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wishard|first=Gwendolyn|date=2012-08-01|title=The evolution of childhood: relationships, emotion and mind|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13698036.2012.692860|journal=Infant Observation|volume=15|issue=2|pages=209–214|doi=10.1080/13698036.2012.692860|issn=1369-8036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, high fertility is characterized by short inter-birth intervals, early age at first birth, and periods of breastfeeding spanning upwards of two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marlowe|first=Frank W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Hunter-gatherers and human evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20046/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=54–67|doi=10.1002/evan.20046|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given such high reproductive costs, it is likely the fitness cost of ingesting neurotoxins is higher for women than men.

Changes in xenobiotic metabolism in women using birth control also suggest hormonally mediated influences. Specifically, changes in hepatic drug elimination for CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2A6 are similar in pregnant women and non-pregnant women using hormonal contraception. Furthermore, in women across the [[menstrual cycle]], smoking topography variables (e.g. total number of cigarettes smoked, mean puff volume, etc.) seem to be mediated by estradiol and progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schiller|first=Crystal Edler|last2=Saladin|first2=Michael E.|last3=Gray|first3=Kevin M.|last4=Hartwell|first4=Karen J.|last5=Carpenter|first5=Matthew J.|date=2012-08-01|title=Association between ovarian hormones and smoking behavior in women|journal=Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=251–257|doi=10.1037/a0027759|issn=1936-2293|pmc=3660106|pmid=22545725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In various studies, regular smokers have been shown to produce approximately one-third less estrogens (including estradiol) during the postovulatory menstrual phase than non-smoking counterparts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17042">The '''Groves Classification''' is a numbering system to enable the shape of any [[academic dress|academic gown or hood]] to be easily described and identified. It was devised by Nicholas Groves to establish a common terminology for hoods and gown to remedy the situation of individual universities using differing terms to describe the same item. As such it is used in same manner as an heraldic blazon whereby a textual description enables a coat of arms to be drawn. The system was first described in the Burgon Society's annual in 2001 and adopted as standard by robe makers and scholars of academic dress.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'&gt;{{Citation | surname=Groves| given=Nicholas | author-link= | title=Towards a Standard Terminology for Describing Academic Dress | journal=The Burgon Society Annual |volume=1 |issue= | year=2001 | pages=9–12 | url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/library/trans/annual2001.pdf }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Groves Classification included a standardization for shapes and patterns of hoods and gowns worn by graduates and undergraduates. Further information was given regarding the use of different fabrics and standardization of colors, but the focus was placed on gowns and hoods which are explained further below.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'/&gt;

The Classification undergoes periodic revision as new hood and gown patterns emerge.

===Hoods===
Hoods in the Classification are divided into three different types as summarised in the table below. Unlike the gowns and robes, these are based on the shape of the hood rather than the degrees for which they are worn.

*'''[f]''' full shape hoods are those that have a [[cape]], a [[cowl]] and a [[liripipe]].
*'''[s]''' simple shape hoods have only a cowl and a liripipe.
*'''[a]''' Aberdeen shape hoods have only a cape and a vestigial cowl.

===Gowns===
Gowns in the Groves system are divided into three classes. These generally follow the shapes associated with each different [[academic degree]] in the British educational system. 
*[b] [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] gowns typically have large open sleeves
*[m] [[master's degree|master's]] gowns typically have long closed sleeves with armhole at elbow level
*[d] [[doctoral degree|doctor's]] robes vary in shape widely between institutions and are all classed as [d].

==Changes==
The Groves classification system was first published in 2001. Since that time, it has been adapted and changed to include newly devised academic dress and revisions of existing schemes.&lt;ref name='Burgon Annual'/&gt; The Burgon Society maintains a comprehensive listing of system shapes on its website. In addition to those included above, the current list classifies undergraduate gowns in use throughout the United Kingdom and academic headwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/design/groves.php|title=The Design of Academical Dress|publisher=The Burgon Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fourteen stages.JPG|thumb|Fourteen stages on the path to liberation]]
{{Jainism}}
'''{{IAST|Guṇasthāna}}''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "levels of virtue") are the fourteen stages of spiritual development and growth through which a soul gradually passes before it attains [[Moksha (Jainism)|''moksha'']] (liberation).&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jainism]], it is a state of soul from a complete dependence on ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' to the state of complete dissociation from it. Here the word ''virtue'' does not mean an ordinary moral quality, but it stands for the nature of soul — knowledge, belief and conduct.

== Overview ==
The fourteen ''Gunasthāna'' represents the soul's gradual manifestation of the innate qualities of knowledge, belief and conduct in a more and more perfect form.{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=95}}&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p. 186–219&lt;/ref&gt; Following are the stages of spiritual development:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r5opAwAAQBAJ|title=Acarya Pujyapada's Istopadesa – the Golden Discourse|isbn=9788190363969|author1=Jain|first1=Vijay K|date=2014-03-26|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p. 274–85&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fourteen stages==

;1. Mithyadristi
The first stage signifies gross ignorance.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=117}} If at this stage, a person meditates on his existence, there is a temporary suspension of the following:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=41, 118}}
*The first three energies of ''darsanamohaniya karma'' (which obstructs right belief)
#''mithyātva''
#''samyaga mithyātva''
#''samyak prakriti''
* The ''anantdnubandhi'' (intensest) type of anger, pride, deceit and greed

;2. Sasādana

This ''gunasthāna'' represents the mental state of the soul in the process or act of falling from right faith. Here ''sā'' means "with" and sādana means "exhausted", hence that which is characterised by exhausted faith.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=118}}

;3. Misradrsti
''Misra'' literally means mixed. At this stage, a person hovers between certainty and doubt on Right belief.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=118}}

;4 Avirata samyagdrishti
When doubts of an individual are removed, he/she reaches this stage and becomes a ''samyagdrishti'' (true believer). The doubts may have been removed by meditation or the instruction of a spiritual teacher.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}}

;5. ''Deśavirata''
''Deśa'' means partial and ''virata'' means vow i.e. observance of the partial vows in pursuit of Right conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}}

;6. Pramatta virata (slightly imperfect vows)
First step of life as a ''[[Jain muni]]'' (monk).{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}} The stage of complete self-discipline, although sometimes brought into wavering through negligence.

;7. Apramatta virata (perfect observance of vows)

;8. Apurva Karana
The stage of one in whom the passions are still occurring in a gross form.

;9. Annivrtti Karaņa (advanced thought activity)
The stage of one who practices the process called ''annivrtti karaņa''  and in whom however the passions are still occurring.

;10. Sukshma sāmprāya
The stage of one in whom the passions occur in a subtle form.

;11. Upaśānta-kasaya
The stage of one who has suppressed every passion but still does not possess omniscience.

;12. Kshina Moha (Destruction of delusion)
The stage of who has annihilated every passion but does not yet possess omniscience. According to the Jain text, ''[[Gommatsāra]] Jīvakanda'':{{quote|That possessionless saint (Nirgrantha), all of whose deluding, passions (Moha Kashaya) are destroyed, and whose thought is clear like the water kept in a pure vessel of crystal Jewel is said by the non-attached (Conquerors) (to be in the 12th stage of) destroyed-delusion, or delusionless (Kshina Kashaya).|Gommatsāra (62){{sfn|Jaini|1927|p=46}}}}

;13. Sayoga Kevali
''Sa'' means "with" and yoga refers to the three channels of activity, i.e., mind, speech and body.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=120}} ''Kevali'' is a term used to refer the omniscient beings (''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihantas]]''). This stage is characterised by the destruction of all inimical (''ghātiā'') ''karmas'' and attainment of omniscience.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}} 

;14. Ayoga Kevali
This is the last stage on the Path, and is followed by the soul's destruction of the ''aghātiā karmas''. Those who pass this stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}}

==The destruction of causes of bondage==
The whole scheme of ''gunasthana'' in [[Jain philosophy]] is devised in a logical order according to the principle of decreasing sinfulness and increasing purity. At the first stage, all the five causes of bondage — Irrational beliefs (''[[mithyatva]]''), non-restraint (''avirati''), carelessness (''pramada''), passions (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kashaya]]'') and activities of mind, speech and body (''[[yoga]]'') — are in full operation.&lt;ref name="Kuhn, Hermann 2001 p. 87–88"&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Irrational beliefs (''mithyatva'') are partially suppressed in the second and third stages, and are fully eliminated in the fourth stage. In stages five and six, non-restraint (''avirati'') is gradually eliminated in stages. From the seventh stage onwards, carelessness is removed and only passions and activity exercise their influence. From the eleventh to the thirteenth all the passions are eliminated and only activity is present. On the last stage, there is no activity, hence no binding of karma.&lt;ref name="Kuhn, Hermann 2001 p. 87–88"/&gt;

==The destruction of karmas==
Out of the four [[ghatiya karma]]s, darsana mohiniya karma (perception deluding karma) is destroyed first in the fourth stage of ''gunasthana''. Caritra mohiniya karma (conduct deluding karma) is destroyed next in the twelfth gunasthana. The remaining three ghatiya karmas (knowledge obstructing karma, perception obstructing karma and energy obstructing karma) are destroyed in the 13th stage and the rest four [[aghatiya karma]]s (life-span determining, body determining, status determining and feeling producing karmas) are destroyed in the 14th or the last stage of gunasthana.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''center of the Universe''' is a concept that lacks a coherent definition in modern [[astronomy]]; according to standard [[cosmology|cosmological]] theories on the [[shape of the universe]], it has no center.

Historically, the center of the Universe had been believed to be a number of locations. Many mythological cosmologies included an ''[[axis mundi]]'', the central axis of a flat Earth that connects the Earth, heavens, and other realms together. In the 4th century BCE Greece, the [[geocentric model]] was developed based on astronomical observation, proposing that the center of the Universe lies at the center of a spherical, stationary Earth, around which the sun, moon, planets, and stars rotate. With the development of the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in the 16th century, the sun was believed to be the center of the Universe, with the planets (including Earth) and stars orbiting it.

In the early 20th century, the discovery of other [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and the development of the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] led to the development of cosmological models of a [[Cosmological principle|homogeneous, isotropic Universe]] (which lacks a central point) that is [[Metric expansion of space|expanding at all points]].

==Outside astronomy==
{{Nature timeline}}
In religion or mythology, the ''[[axis mundi]]'' (also cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, columna cerului, center of the world) is a point described as the center of the world, the connection between it and Heaven, or both.
[[File:Mt. Hermon from Manara(GllSprng 319PAN).jpg|thumb|left|Mount Hermon in Lebanon was regarded in some cultures as the ''axis mundi''.]]
[[Mount Hermon]] was regarded as the axis mundi in [[Caananite]] tradition, from where the [[sons of God]] are introduced descending in [[1 Enoch]] (1En6:6).&lt;ref name="Bautch2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelley Coblentz Bautch|title=A Study of the Geography of 1 Enoch 17-19: "no One Has Seen what I Have Seen"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPNFEtWNrQC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=25 September 2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131033|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] regarded several sites as places of earth's ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) stone, notably the oracle at [[Delphi]], while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic [[world tree]] and in [[Mount Olympus]] as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]] and [[Mount Sinai]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has [[Mecca]], said to be the place on earth that was created first, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]). In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.  In addition to the [[Kun Lun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[Peaches of Immortality|peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.
[[File:1581 Bunting clover leaf map.jpg|thumb|left|A 1581 map depicting Jerusalem as the center of the world.]]
Sacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. "Every temple or palace--and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence--is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stupa]] of [[Hinduism]], and later [[Buddhism]], reflects [[Mount Meru]]. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a [[cross]], with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. [[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the [[maypole]], derived from the [[Saxons]]' [[Irminsul]], and the [[totem pole]] among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] also represent world axes. The [[calumet (pipe)|calumet]], or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Symbols.'' Editions Robert Lafont S. A. et Editions Jupiter: Paris, 1982. Penguin Books: London, 1996. pp.148-149&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mandala]] creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times some Christians thought of [[Jerusalem]] as the center of the world (Latin: ''umbilicus mundi'', Greek: ''Omphalos''), and was so represented in the so-called [[T and O map]]s. Byzantine hymns speak of the Cross being "planted in the center of the earth."

==Center of a flat Earth==
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Flammarion engraving]] (1888) depicts a traveller who arrives at the edge of a Flat Earth and sticks his head through the [[firmament]].]]
The [[Flat Earth]] model is a belief that the [[Earth]]'s shape is a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] covered by a [[firmament]] containing heavenly bodies. Most pre-scientific cultures have had conceptions of a Flat Earth, including [[ancient Greece|Greece]] until the [[Classical Greece|classical period]], the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] civilizations of the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] until the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Iron Age India|India]] until the [[Gupta period]] (early centuries AD) and [[China]] until the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} It was also typically held in the aboriginal cultures of the [[Americas]], and a flat Earth domed by the [[firmament]] in the shape of an inverted bowl is common in pre-scientific societies.&lt;ref&gt;"Their cosmography as far as we know anything about it was practically of one type up til the time of the white man's arrival upon the scene. That of the Borneo Dayaks may furnish us with some idea of it. 'They consider the Earth to be a flat surface, whilst the heavens are a dome, a kind of glass shade which covers the Earth and comes in contact with it at the horizon.'"
Lucien Levy-Bruhl, ''Primitive Mentality'' (repr. Boston: Beacon, 1966) 353;
"The usual primitive conception of the world's form ... [is] flat and round below and surmounted above by a solid firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl." H. B. Alexander, ''[[The Mythology of All Races]]'' 10: North American (repr. New York: Cooper Square, 1964) 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Center" is well-defined in a Flat Earth model.  A flat earth would have a definite geographic center.  There would also be a unique point at the exact center of a spherical [[firmament]] (or a firmament that was a half-sphere).

==Earth as the center of the Universe==
{{main article|Geocentric model}}
The Flat Earth model gave way to an understanding of a [[Spherical Earth]]. [[Aristotle]] (384&amp;ndash;322&amp;nbsp;BCE)  provided observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth, namely that different stars are visible in different locations, travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon, and the shadow of Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is round, and spheres cast circular shadows while discs generally do not.

This understanding was accompanied by models of the Universe that depicted the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[star]]s, and [[naked eye planets]] circling the spherical Earth, including the noteworthy models of [[Aristotle]] (see [[Aristotelian physics]]) and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Copernican heliocentrism diagram-2.jpg|thumb|left|The heliocentric model from Nicolaus Copernicus' ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'']]
Heliocentrism, or heliocentricism,&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science'' (National Academy of Sciences, 1998), p.27; also, Don O' Leary, ''Roman Catholicism and Modern Science: A History'' (Continuum Books, 2006), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Copernican heliocenterism held that the Sun itself was the center of the entire Universe.   As it is modernly understood, Heliocenterism refers to the much narrower concept that the sun is the center of the Solar System, not the center of the entire Universe.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[astronomy|astronomical]] model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of our [[Solar System]]. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ({{lang|el|[[wikt:ἥλιος|ἥλιος]]}} ''[[helios]]'' "sun" and {{lang|el|[[wikt:κέντρον|κέντρον]]}} ''kentron'' "center").

The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BCE by  [[Aristarchus of Samos]],&lt;ref name="Dreyer1906"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dreyer |first=J.L.E. |date=1906 |title=History of the planetary systems from Thales to Kepler |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/n148/mode/2up |pages=135–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linton2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Linton |first=C.M. |date=2004 |title=From Eudoxus to Einstein: A History of Mathematical Astronomy |series=E-Libro |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139453790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA205 |page=38,205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The work of Aristarchus's in which he proposed his heliocentric system has not survived.  We only know of it now from a brief passage in [[Archimedes]]'s ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but had received no support from most other ancient astronomers.

[[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' major theory of a heliocentric model was published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''), in 1543, the year of his death, though he had formulated the theory several decades earlier. Copernicus' ideas were not immediately accepted, but they did begin a paradigm shift away from the Ptolemaic geocentric model to a heliocentric model. The [[Copernican revolution]], as this paradigm shift would come to be called, would last until [[Isaac Newton]]’s work over a century later.

[[Johannes Kepler]] published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of [[Tycho Brahe]].&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite book

On 7 January 1610 Galileo used his telescope, with optics superior to what had been available {{cn|date=March 2018}}  before. He described "three fixed stars, totally invisible&lt;ref name=invisible&gt;''i.e.'', invisible to the naked eye.&lt;/ref&gt; by their smallness", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.&lt;ref name="Drake1978"&gt;{{cite book |title=Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography |first=Stillman |last=Drake |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1978 |pages=146, 152, 157–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these "stars" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days he concluded that they were [[orbit]]ing Jupiter:&lt;ref name=moonconclusion&gt;In ''Sidereus Nuncius'',[http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=3&amp;VOLPAG=81 1892, 3:81] {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo stated that he had reached this conclusion on 11 January.&lt;ref name="Drake1978"/&gt; He had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest [[natural satellite|satellites]] (moons). He discovered the fourth on 13 January.

His observations of the satellites of Jupiter created a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian Cosmology]], which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth,&lt;ref name="Drake1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Linton2004p38"&gt;{{cite book |last=Linton |first=C.M. |date=2004 |title=From Eudoxus to Einstein: A History of Mathematical Astronomy |series=E-Libro |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139453790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA38 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing.&lt;ref name="Drake1978"/&gt;{{clarify|a bit of an overstatement here.

Newton made clear his [[heliocentric]] view of the solar system&amp;nbsp;– developed in a somewhat modern way, because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233–274 in R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989) ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume, 2A', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233].&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line" (Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).&lt;ref&gt;Text quotations are from 1729 translation of Newton's ''Principia'', Book 3 (1729 vol.2) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233 at pages 232–233].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milky Way's galactic center as center of the Universe==

Before the 1920s, it was generally believed that there were no galaxies other than our own (see for example [[Great Debate (astronomy)|The Great Debate]]). Thus, to astronomers of previous centuries, there was no distinction between a hypothetical center of the galaxy and a hypothetical center of the universe.

[[Image:Pic iroberts1.jpg|thumb|Great Andromeda Nebula by [[Isaac Roberts]] ''(1899)'']]
In 1750 [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]], in his work ''An original theory or new hypothesis of the Universe'', correctly speculated that the [[Milky Way]] might be a body of a huge number of stars held together by [[gravitation|gravitational forces]] rotating about a [[Galactic Center]], akin to the solar system but on a much larger scale. The resulting disk of stars can be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk.&lt;ref name="our_galaxy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=J. C.|title=Our Galaxy|url=http://physics.gmu.edu/~jevans/astr103/CourseNotes/ECText/ch20_txt.htm|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a treatise in 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]] elaborated on Wright's idea about the structure of the Milky Way.

The 19th century astronomer [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]] proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which the stars of the universe revolved around a point in the [[Pleiades]].

==The nonexistence of a center of the Universe==
In 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis]] observed a nova within what then was called the "[[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] Nebula". Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that novas in Andromeda were drastically fainter than novas in the Milky Way.  Based on this, Curtis was able to estimate that Andromeda was 500,000 [[light-years]] away. As a result, Curtis became a proponent of the so-called "island Universes" hypothesis, which held that objects previously believed to be [[spiral galaxy|spiral nebulae]] within the Milky Way were actually independent galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 | volume=100 | page=6
 | bibcode=1988PASP..100....6C
 | doi=10.1086/132128
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Great Debate (astronomy)|the Great Debate]] between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Curtis took place, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula (M31) was an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in our own Galaxy, as well as the significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst Öpik]] presented a very elegant and simple astrophysical method to estimate the distance of M31. His result put the Andromeda Nebula far outside our Galaxy at a distance of about 450,000 [[parsec]], which is about 1,500,000 [[lightyear|ly]].&lt;ref&gt;

 | doi=10.1086/142680
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate about whether other galaxies exist in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of M31. These were made using the 2.5&amp;nbsp;metre (100&amp;nbsp;in) [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our Galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from our own. This proved the existence of other galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanding Universe===
Hubble also demonstrated that the [[redshift]] of other galaxies is approximately proportional to their distance from the Earth ([[Hubble's law]]). This raised the appearance of our galaxy being in the center of an expanding Universe, however, Hubble rejected the findings philosophically:

{{quote|...if we see the nebulae all receding from our position in space, then every other observer, no matter where he may be located, will see the nebulae all receding from his position. However, the assumption is adopted. There must be no favoured location in the Universe, no centre, no boundary; all must see the Universe alike. And, in order to ensure this situation, the cosmologist, postulates spatial isotropy and spatial homogeneity, which is his way of stating that the Universe must be pretty much alike everywhere and in all directions."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last=Hubble | first=E. P.
 | date=1937
 | title=The observational approach to cosmology
 | publisher=Oxford University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The redshift observations of Hubble, in which galaxies appear to be moving away from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us, are now understood to be a result of the [[metric expansion of space]]. This is the increase of the distance between two distant parts of the Universe with time, and is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. As Hubble theorized, all observers anywhere in the Universe will observe a similar effect.

===Copernican and cosmological principles===
The [[Copernican principle]], named after Nicolaus Copernicus, states that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = H. Bondi | authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1952 | page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the geocentric [[Ptolemaic system]].

The [[cosmological principle]] is an extension of the Copernican principle which states that the Universe is homogeneous (the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the Universe) and isotropic (the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the Universe). A homogeneous, isotropic Universe does not have a center.&lt;ref name="livio"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Accelerating Universe: Infinite Expansion, the Cosmological Constant, and the Beauty of the Cosmos|last= Livio|first= Mario|authorlink= Mario Livio|date= 2001|publisher= John Wiley and Sons|page= 53|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4EidS6_VVNYC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=cosmological+principle+%22center+of+the+universe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Eyt3T5HFGuzy2gXsm_C1Bg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBjgU|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''holonomic brain theory''', developed by neuroscientist [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]] initially in collaboration with physicist [[David Bohm]], is a model of human [[cognition]] that describes the brain as a [[hologram|holographic]] storage network.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt; Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain's fine-fibered dendritic webs, which are different from the more commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandervert/&gt; These oscillations are waves and create [[wave interference]] patterns in which memory is encoded naturally, and the waves may be analyzed by a [[Fourier transform]].&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandervert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berger D.H., Pribram K.H. | year = 1992 | title = The Relationship between the Gabor elementary function and a stochastic model of the inter-spike interval distribution in the responses of the visual cortex neurons | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 191–194 | doi=10.1007/bf00201026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K.H. | year = 2004 | title = Consciousness Reassessed | url = | journal = Mind and Matter | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 7–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabor, Pribram and others noted the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of information in a hologram, which can also be analyzed with a Fourier transform.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabor1972/&gt; In a hologram, any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information.

==Origins and development==
In 1946 [[Dennis Gabor]] invented the hologram mathematically, describing a system where an image can be reconstructed through information that is stored throughout the hologram.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K.

Gabor also developed a mathematical model for demonstrating a [[holographic associative memory]].&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kelly M. A. |author2=Blostein D. |author3=Mewhort D. J.

Karl Pribram had worked with psychologist [[Karl Lashley]] on Lashley's [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] experiments, which used lesions to determine the exact location of specific memories in primate brains.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke&gt;{{cite journal | author = Forsdyke D.

On the other hand, Pribram removed large areas of cortex, leading to multiple serious deficits in memory and cognitive function. Memories were not stored in a single neuron or exact location, but were spread over the entirety of a neural network. Lashley suggested that brain interference patterns could play a role in perception, but was unsure how such patterns might be generated in the brain or how they would lead to brain function.&lt;ref name=Pribram2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram H.H. | year = 2011 | title = Recollections | url = | journal = Neuroquantology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 370–374 | doi=10.14704/nq.2011.9.3.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later an article by neurophysiologist [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] described how a wave could be generated at the branching ends of pre-synaptic axons. Multiple of these waves could create interference patterns. Soon after, [[Emmett Leith]] was successful in storing visual images through the interference patterns of laser beams, inspired by Gabor's previous use of Fourier transformations to store information within a hologram.&lt;ref&gt;Emmett N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks (1965). Photography by Laser. ''Scientific American'' Volume 212, Issue 6, June 1, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; After studying the work of Eccles and that of Leith,&lt;ref name=Pribram2011/&gt; Pribram put forward the hypothesis that memory might take the form of interference patterns that resemble laser-produced holograms.&lt;ref&gt;K. Pribram (1969). The Neurophysiology of Remembering.

Pribram, karlhpribram.com&lt;/ref&gt; and realized that, since a hologram could store information within patterns of interference and then recreate that information when activated, it could serve as a strong metaphor for brain function.&lt;ref name=Pribram2011/&gt; Pribram was further encouraged in this line of speculation by the fact that DeValois and DeValois&lt;ref&gt;DeValois and DeValois, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; established "the spatial frequency encoding displayed by cells of the visual cortex was best described as a [[Fourier transform]] of the input pattern."&lt;ref name=Pribram87&gt;"Pribram, 1987"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hologram optical setup.jpg|thumbnail|Diagram of one possible hologram setup.]]
A main characteristic of a [[Holography|hologram]] is that every part of the stored information is distributed over the entire hologram.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both processes of storage and retrieval are carried out in a way described by [[Fourier transform]]ation equations.&lt;ref name=Srivastava&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srivastava V., Edwards S. F. | year = 2004 | title = A mathematical model of capacious and efficient memory that survives trauma | url = | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 333 | issue = 1–4| pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a part of the hologram is large enough to contain the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]], that part can recreate the entirety of the stored image, except with more unwanted changes, called [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]].&lt;ref name=Gabor1972&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gabor D | year = 1972 | title = Holography, 1948–1971 | url = | journal = Science | volume = 177 | issue = 4046| pages = 299–313 | doi=10.1126/science.177.4046.299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogy to this is the broadcasting region of a radio antenna. In each smaller individual location within the entire area it is possible to access every channel, similar to how the entirety of the information of a hologram is contained within a part.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Another analogy of a hologram is the way sunlight illuminates objects in the visual field of an observer. It doesn't matter how narrow the beam of sunlight is. The beam always contains all the information of the object, and when conjugated by a lens of a [[camera]] or the eyeball, produces the same full three-dimensional image. The Fourier transform formula converts spatial forms to spatial wave frequencies and vice versa, as all objects are in essence [[vibration|vibratory]] structures. Different types of lenses, acting similarly to [[Lens (optics)|optic lenses]], can alter the frequency nature of information that is transferred.

This non-locality of information storage within the hologram is crucial, because even if most parts are damaged, the entirety will be contained within even a single remaining part of sufficient size. [[Karl H. Pribram|Pribram]] and others noted the similarities between an optical hologram and [[memory]] storage in the human brain. According to the holonomic brain theory, memories are stored within certain general regions, but stored non-locally within those regions.&lt;ref name=Globus/&gt;&lt;ref name=LH&gt;{{cite journal | author = Longuet-Higgins H. C. | year = 1968 | title = Holographic model of temporal recall [50] | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5123| page = 104 | doi=10.1038/217104a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the brain to maintain function and memory even when it is damaged.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;&lt;ref name=Srivastava/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baev/&gt; It is only when there exist no parts big enough to contain the whole that the memory is lost.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; This can also explain why some children retain normal intelligence when large portions of their brain—in some cases, half—are removed. It can also explain why memory is not lost when the brain is sliced in different cross-sections.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Holomouse2.jpg|thumbnail|A single hologram can store 3D information in a 2D way. Such properties may explain some of the brain's abilities, including the ability to recognize objects at different angles and sizes than in the original stored memory.]]

Pribram proposed that neural holograms were formed by the diffraction patterns of oscillating electric waves within the cortex.&lt;ref name=Baev&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baev K.V. | year = 2012 | title = Solution of the Problem of Central Pattern Generators and a New Concept of Brain Functions | url = | journal = Neurophysiology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 414–432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the difference between the idea of a holonomic brain and a holographic one. Pribram does not suggest that the brain functions as a single hologram. Rather, the waves within smaller neural networks create localized holograms within the larger workings of the brain.&lt;ref name=Vandervert&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vandervert L. R. | year = 1995 | title = Chaos theory and the evolution of consciousness and mind: A thermodynamic-holographic resolution to the mind-body problem | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 107–127 | doi = 10.1016/0732-118X(94)00047-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This patch holography is called holonomy or windowed Fourier transformations.

A holographic model can also account for other features of memory that more traditional models cannot. [[Hopfield network|The Hopfield memory model]] has an early memory saturation point before which memory retrieval drastically slows and becomes unreliable.&lt;ref name=Srivastava&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srivastava V., Edwards S. F. | year = 2004 | title = A mathematical model of capacious and efficient memory that survives trauma | url = | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 333 | issue = 1–4| pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, holographic memory models have much larger theoretical storage capacities. Holographic models can also demonstrate associative memory, store complex connections between different concepts, and resemble forgetting through [[lossy compression|"lossy storage."]]&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kelly M. A. |author2=Blostein D. |author3=Mewhort D. J. K. | year = 2013 | title = Encoding structure in holographic reduced representations | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 79–93 | doi=10.1037/a0030301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The synaptodendritic web===
[[File:Blausen 0843 SynapseTypes.png|thumb|A Few of the Various Types of Synapses]]
In classic brain theory the summation of electrical inputs to the [[dendrite]]s and soma (cell body) of a [[neuron]] either inhibit the neuron or excite it and set off an [[action potential]] down the [[axon]] to where it [[synapse]]s with the next neuron. However, this fails to account for different varieties of synapses beyond the traditional axodendritic (axon to dendrite). There is evidence for the existence of other kinds of synapses, including serial synapses and those between dendrites and soma and between different dendrites.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Many synaptic locations are functionally bipolar, meaning they can both send and receive impulses from each neuron, distributing input and output over the entire group of dendrites.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K. H. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum holography: Is it relevant to brain function? | url = | journal = Information Sciences | volume = 115 | issue = 1–4| pages = 97–102 | doi = 10.1016/S0020-0255(98)10082-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes in this dendritic arbor, the network of teledendrons and dendrites, occur due to the oscillations of polarizations in the membrane of the fine-fibered dendrites, not due to the propagated nerve impulses associated with action potentials.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Pribram posits that the length of the delay of an input signal in the dendritic arbor before it travels down the axon is related to mental awareness.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter the delay the more unconscious the action, while a longer delay indicates a longer period of awareness. A study by David Alkon showed that after unconscious [[Classical Conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]] there was a proportionally greater reduction in the volume of the dendritic arbor, akin to synaptic elimination when experience increases the automaticity of an action.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Pribram and others theorize that, while unconscious behavior is mediated by impulses through nerve circuits, conscious behavior arises from microprocesses in the dendritic arbor.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;

At the same time, the dendritic network is extremely complex, able to receive 100,000 to 200,000 inputs in a single tree, due to the large amount of branching and the many dendritic spines protruding from the branches.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Furthermore, synaptic [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] and [[depolarization]] remains somewhat isolated due to the resistance from the narrow dendritic spine stalk, allowing a polarization to spread without much interruption to the other spines. This spread is further aided intracellularly by the [[microtubules]] and extracellularly by [[neuroglia|glial cells]]. These polarizations act as waves in the synaptodendritic network, and the existence of multiple waves at once gives rise to interference patterns.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;

===Deep and surface structure of memory===
Pribram suggests that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the retrieval mechanism.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no phase lead or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Here phase lead and lag act to enhance sensory discrimination, acting as a frame to capture important features.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; These [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning.

==Recent studies==
While Pribram originally developed the holonomic brain theory as an analogy for certain brain processes, several papers (including some more recent ones by Pribram himself) have proposed that the similarity between hologram and certain brain functions is more than just metaphorical, but actually structural.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others still maintain that the relationship is only analogical.&lt;ref name=Velmans&gt;{{cite journal | author = Velmans M | year = 2003 | title = Is the world in the brain, or the brain in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 427–429 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x03420098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that the same series of operations used in holographic memory models are performed in certain processes concerning temporal memory and [[optomotor response]]s. This indicates at least the possibility of the existence of neurological structures with certain holonomic properties.&lt;ref name=Borsellino&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borsellino A., Poggio T. | year = 1972 | title = Holographic aspects of temporal memory and optomotor responses | url = | journal = Kybernetik | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 58–60 | doi=10.1007/bf00288785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have demonstrated the possibility that [[biophoton]] emission (biological electrical signals that are converted to weak electromagnetic waves in the visible range) may be a necessary condition for the electric activity in the brain to store holographic images.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These may play a role in cell communication and certain brain processes including sleep, but further studies are needed to strengthen current ones.&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown the correlation between more advanced cognitive function and [[homeothermy]]. Taking holographic brain models into account, this temperature regulation would reduce distortion of the signal waves, an important condition for holographic systems.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and alternative models==
Pribram's holonomic model of brain function did not receive widespread attention at the time, but other quantum models developed since, including brain dynamics by Jibu &amp; Yasue and Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics. Though not directly related to the holonomic model, they continue to move beyond approaches based solely in classic brain theory.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Globus /&gt;

===Correlograph===
In 1969 scientists D. Wilshaw, O. P. Buneman and [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|H. Longuet-Higgins]] proposed an alternative, non-holographic model that fulfilled many of the same requirements as Gabor's original holographic model. The Gabor model did not explain how the brain could use Fourier analysis on incoming signals or how it would deal with the low signal-noise ratio in reconstructed memories. Longuet-Higgin's correlograph model built on the idea that any system could perform the same functions as a Fourier holograph if it could correlate pairs of patterns. It uses minute pinholes that do not produce diffraction patterns to create a similar reconstruction as that in Fourier holography.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like a hologram, a discrete correlograph can recognize displaced patterns and store information in a parallel and non-local way so it usually will not be destroyed by localized damage.&lt;ref name=Willshaw&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Willshaw D. J. |author2=Buneman O. P. |author3=Longuet-Higgins H. C. | year = 1969 | title = Non-holographic associative memory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 222 | issue = 5197| pages = 960–962 | doi=10.1038/222960a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then expanded the model beyond the correlograph to an associative net where the points become parallel lines arranged in a grid. Horizontal lines represent axons of input neurons while vertical lines represent output neurons. Each intersection represents a modifiable synapse. Though this cannot recognize displaced patterns, it has a greater potential storage capacity. This was not necessarily meant to show how the brain is organized, but instead to show the possibility of improving on Gabor's original model.&lt;ref name=Willshaw/&gt; P. Van Heerden countered this model by demonstrating mathematically that the signal-noise ratio of a hologram could reach 50% of ideal. He also used a model with a 2D neural hologram network for fast searching imposed upon a 3D network for large storage capacity. A key quality of this model was its flexibility to change the orientation and fix distortions of stored information, which is important for our ability to recognize an object as the same entity from different angles and positions, something the correlograph and association network models lack.&lt;ref name=VanHeerden&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1970 | title = Models for the brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5228| pages = 177–178 | doi=10.1038/225177a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Holographic models of memory and consciousness may be related to several brain disorders involving disunity of sensory input within a unified consciousness, including [[Charles Bonnet Syndrome]], Disjunctive Agnosia, and [[Schizophrenia]]. Charles Bonnet Syndrome patients experience two vastly different worlds within one consciousness.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"&gt;G.G. Globus; C.P. O’Carroll, "Nonlocal neurology: Beyond localization to holonomy," Irvine, April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They see the world that psychologically normal people perceive, but also a simplified world riddled with [[Pseudohallucination]]. These patients can differentiate these two worlds easily. Since dynamic core and global workspace theories insist that a distinct area of the brain is responsible for consciousness, the only way a patient would perceive two worlds was if this dynamic core and global workspace were split.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"/&gt; But such does not explain how different content can be perceived within one single consciousness since these theories assume that each dynamic core or global workspace creates a single coherent reality.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"/&gt; The primary symptom of Disjunctive Agnosia is an inconsistency of sensory information within a unified consciousness. They may see one thing, but hear something entirely incompatible with that image. Schizophrenics often report experiencing thoughts that do not seem to originate from themselves, as if the idea was inserted exogenously. The individual feels no control over certain thoughts existing within their consciousness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">In [[mathematics]], the '''horizontal line test''' is a test used to determine whether a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is [[injective]] (i.e., one-to-one).&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals|year=2003|publisher=Brook/Cole|location=Toronto ON|isbn=0-534-39330-6|pages=64|url=http://www.stewartcalculus.com/media/8_home.php|edition=5th.|authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician)|accessdate=15 July 2012|quote=Therefore, we have the following geometric method for determining whether a function is one-to-one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In calculus==
A ''horizontal line'' is a straight, flat line that goes from left to right. Given a function &lt;math&gt;f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. from the [[real numbers]] to the real numbers), we can decide if it is [[injective]] by looking at horizontal lines that intersect the function's [[graph of a function|graph]]. If any horizontal line &lt;math&gt;y=c&lt;/math&gt;  intersects the graph in more than one point, the function is not injective. To see this, note that the points of intersection have the same y-value (because they lie on the line &lt;math&gt;y=c&lt;/math&gt;) but different x values, which by definition means the function cannot be injective.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

{| border="1"
|-
| align="center"|[[Image:Horizontal-test-ok.png]]&lt;br&gt;
Passes the test (injective)
| align="center"|[[Image:Horizontal-test-fail.png]]&lt;br&gt;
Fails the test (not injective)
|}

Variations of the horizontal line test can be used to determine whether a function is [[surjective]] or [[bijective]]:
*The function ''f'' is surjective (i.e., onto) [[if and only if]] its graph intersects any horizontal line at '''least''' once.
*''f'' is bijective if and only if any horizontal line will intersect the graph '''exactly''' once.

==In set theory==
Consider a function &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; with its corresponding [[graph of a function|graph]] as a subset of the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;X \times Y&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the horizontal lines in &lt;math&gt;X \times Y&lt;/math&gt; :&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y_0) \in X \times Y: y_0 \text{ is constant}\} = X \times \{y_0\}&lt;/math&gt;. The function ''f'' is [[injective]] [[if and only if]] each horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. In this case the graph is said to pass the horizontal line test. If any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function fails the horizontal line test and is not injective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zorn|first=Arnold Ostebee, Paul|title=Calculus from graphical, numerical, and symbolic points of view|year=2002|publisher=Brooks/Cole/Thomson Learning|location=Australia|isbn=0-03-025681-X|pages=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D48RplvmxVUC&amp;q=horizontal+line+test#search_anchor|edition=2nd|quote=No horizontal line crosses the f-graph more than once.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''human condition''' is "the characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of [[human]] existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and mortality".&lt;ref&gt;"[[wikt:human condition|human condition]]" entry at [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very broad topic which has been and continues to be pondered and analyzed from many perspectives, including those of [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].

As a [[terminology|literary term]], "the human condition" is typically used in the context of ambiguous subjects such as the [[meaning of life]] or [[morality|moral concerns]].&lt;ref name="lit"&gt;[http://learn.lexiconic.net/humancondition.htm The human condition in literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some perspectives==

Each [[major religious groups|major religion]] has definitive beliefs regarding the human condition. For example, [[Buddhism]] [[Four Noble Truths|teaches]] that life is a perpetual cycle of [[dukkha|suffering]], death, and rebirth from which humans can be liberated via the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Meanwhile, [[Christianity]] teaches that humans are born in a [[original sin|sinful condition]] and are [[Christian views on hell|doomed]] in the [[afterlife]] unless they receive [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Philosophers have provided many perspectives. An influential ancient view was that of the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' in which [[Plato]] explored the question "what is justice?" and postulated that it is not primarily a matter among individuals but of [[society]] as a whole, prompting him to devise a [[utopia]]. Two thousand years later [[René Descartes]] declared "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" because he believed the human mind, particularly its faculty of [[reason]], to be the primary determiner of [[truth]]; for this he is often credited as the father of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA511 ''History of Western Philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7&lt;/ref&gt; One such modern school, [[existentialism]], attempts to reconcile an individual's sense of disorientation and confusion in a universe believed to be [[absurdism|absurd]].

Many works of literature provide perspective on the human condition.&lt;ref name="lit"/&gt; One famous example is [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] monologue "[[All the world's a stage]]" that pensively summarizes seven phases of human life.

Psychology has many theories, such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and the notion of [[identity crisis]]. It also has various methods, e.g. the [[logotherapy]] developed by [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]] to discover and affirm human meaning. Another method, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], has become a widespread treatment for [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driessen Ellen |author2=Hollon Steven D | year = 2010 | title = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Mood Disorders: Efficacy, Moderators and Mediators | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 537–55 | doi=10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.005 | pmid=20599132 | pmc=2933381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1859, when [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', the biological [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]] has been significant. The theory posits that the human [[species]] is related to all others, living and extinct, and that [[natural selection]] is the primary survival factor. This has provided a basis for new beliefs, e.g. [[social Darwinism]], and for new [[technology]], e.g. [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladki A, Kaczanowski S, Szczesny P, Zielenkiewicz P |title=The evolutionary rate of antibacterial drug targets |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=14 |pages=36 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23374913 |url= |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-36 |pmc=3598507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==

Notable uses of the term "the human condition" include  [[André Malraux]]'s novel ''[[Man's Fate]]'', [[René Magritte]]'s painting ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La Condition Humaine]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]]'s [[The Human Condition (book)|political philosophy]], and [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s [[The Human Condition (film series)|film trilogy]].

'''iPhone art''' is a form of [[Interactive art]] that takes place on the screen of the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], or [[iPod Touch]]. It is distinct from pictorial works of art produced with an iPhone using paint apps such as [[Brushes]] or [[ArtRage]].

iPhone Art evolved from screen-based interactive art that formerly appeared on PC computer screens or on wall-mounted displays in galleries and museums. Due to the portability and ease of distribution with the [[iTunes App Store]], these forms of art are currently experiencing a renaissance as interactive works of art from the 1990s and 2000s are adapted to the iPhone and iPad, some even becoming bestsellers in the Entertainment and Music categories where these apps normally appear, since there is currently no Art category in the iTunes App Store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/us/20bciart.html For Digital Artists, Apps Provide New Palette, Reyhan Harmanci, New York Times, August 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[David Hockney]], Corliss Blakely and Meri Aaron Walker (iPhoneArtGirl) have held art exhibits with art made exclusively on their iPads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hockney's latest Paris art show, 'Fleurs fraiches,' shows off his iPhone 'Brushes' creations|url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/10/david_hockneys_latest_paris_ar.html|publisher=www.cleveland.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician [[Damon Albarn]] recorded the entirety of the new [[Gorillaz]] album, [[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]], on his iPad with various apps while on his North American tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gorillaz - The Fall|url=http://thefall.gorillaz.com/|publisher=thefall.gorillaz.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iPhone art may pose a threat to traditional gallery distribution of [[digital art]] because individual artist can distribute their apps directly to the general public without working through a gallery dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snibbe.com/blog/2010/05/19/art99 Art Wants to be Ninety-Nine Cents by Scott Snibbe, blog posting May 19, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''initial algebra''' is an [[initial object]] in the [[F-algebra|category of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebras]] for a given [[endofunctor]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. This initiality provides a general framework for [[mathematical induction|induction]] and [[recursion]]. 

For instance, consider the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;1+(-)&lt;/math&gt; on the category of sets, where &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is the one-point (singleton) set, the terminal object in the category. An algebra for this endofunctor is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''carrier'' of the algebra) together with a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;X\to X&lt;/math&gt;. The set of [[natural number]]s is the carrier of the initial such algebra: the point is zero and the function is the successor map. 

For a second example, consider the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;1+\mathbf{N}\times(-)&lt;/math&gt; on the category of sets, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers. An algebra for this endofunctor is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/Math&gt; together with a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}\times X\to X&lt;/math&gt;. The set of finite [[List (computing)|list]]s of natural numbers is the initial such algebra. The point is the empty list, and the function is [[cons]], taking a number and a finite list, and returning a new finite list with the number at the head.

In categories with binary coproducts, the definitions just given are equivalent to the usual definitions of a [[natural number object]] and a [[list object]], respectively.

==Final coalgebra==
Dually, a '''final coalgebra''' is a [[terminal object]] in the [[F-coalgebra|category of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebras]]. The finality provides a general framework for [[coinduction]] and [[corecursion]].

For example, using the same functor &lt;math&gt;1+(-)&lt;/math&gt; as before, a coalgebra is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; together with a [[truth-value]]d test function &lt;math&gt;p\colon X \to 2&lt;/math&gt; and a [[partial function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt; whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] is formed by those &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;p(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} \cup \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the natural numbers extended with a new element &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the carrier of the final coalgebra in the category, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the test for zero: &lt;math&gt;p(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(n+1) = p(\omega) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the predecessor function (the [[Inverse function|inverse]] of the successor function) on the positive naturals, but acts like the [[Identity function|identity]] on the new element &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;f(n+1) = n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(\omega) = \omega&lt;/math&gt;. This set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} \cup \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt; that is the carrier of the final coalgebra of &lt;math&gt;1+(-)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the set of [[conatural numbers]].

For a second example, consider the same functor &lt;math&gt;1 + \mathbf{N}\times(\mathord{-})&lt;/math&gt; as before. In this case the carrier of the final coalgebra consists of all lists of natural numbers, finite as well as [[Infinite list|infinite]]. The operations are a test function testing whether a list is empty, and a deconstruction function defined on nonempty lists returning a pair consisting of the head and the tail of the input list.

== Theorems ==
* Initial algebras are minimal (i.e., have no proper subalgebra).
* Final coalgebras are [[Simple algebra|simple]] (i.e., have no proper quotients).

== Example ==

Consider the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1+X&lt;/math&gt;. Define
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{zero} \colon 1 &amp;\longrightarrow\mathbf{N} \\
  * &amp;\longmapsto 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; 
and
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{succ}\colon \mathbf{N}&amp;\longrightarrow\mathbf{N} \\
  n &amp;\longmapsto n + 1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[natural number]]s together with the function &lt;math&gt;[\operatorname{zero},\operatorname{succ}]\colon 1+\mathbf{N} \to \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is an initial &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. The initiality (the [[universal property]] for this case) is not hard to establish; the unique [[homomorphism]] to an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;(A, [e,f])&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;e\colon 1 \to A&lt;/math&gt; an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\colon A \to A&lt;/math&gt; a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, is the function sending the natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f^n(e)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;f(f(\dots(f(e))\dots))&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-fold application of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

== Use in computer science ==

Various finite [[data structures]] used in [[Mathematical programming|programming]], such as [[List (computing)|list]]s and [[tree]]s, can be obtained as initial algebras of specific endofunctors.
While there may be several initial algebras for a given endofunctor, they are [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] [[up to]] [[isomorphism]], which informally means that the "observable" properties of a data structure can be adequately captured by defining it as an initial algebra.

To obtain the [[datatype|type]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt; of lists whose elements are members of set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, consider that the list-forming operations are:

*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nil}\colon 1 \to \mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cons}\colon A \times \mathrm{List}(A) \to \mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Combined into one function, they give:

*&lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{nil},\mathrm{cons}]\colon (1 + A \times \mathrm{List}(A))\to \mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

which makes this an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra for the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1+(A\times X)&lt;/math&gt;. It is, in fact, ''the'' initial &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. Initiality is established by the function known as ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|foldr]]'' in [[functional programming|functional]] [[programming language]]s such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML programming language|ML]].

Likewise, [[binary tree]]s with elements at the leaves can be obtained as the initial algebra

*&lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{tip},\mathrm{join}]\colon A + (\mathrm{Tree}(A) \times \mathrm{Tree}(A)) \to \mathrm{Tree}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Types obtained this way are known as [[algebraic data type]]s.

Types defined by using [[least fixed point]] construct with functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an initial [[F-algebra|&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]], provided that [[parametricity]] holds for the type.&lt;ref name=free-rectypes&gt;Philip Wadler: [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/free-rectypes/free-rectypes.txt Recursive types for free!] University of Glasgow, July 1998. Draft.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] way, similar relationship exists between notions of [[greatest fixed point]] and terminal [[F-coalgebra]], with applications to [[coinductive]] types.  These can be used for allowing [[Actual infinity|potentially infinite]] objects while maintaining [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strong normalization property]].&lt;ref name=free-rectypes/&gt; In the strongly normalizing [[Charity (programming language)|Charity]] programming language (i.e. each program terminates), coinductive data types can be used achieving surprising results, e.g. defining [[Lookup table|lookup]] constructs to implement such [[Computability theory (computer science)|“strong”]] functions like the [[Ackermann function]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cockett: Charitable Thoughts ([ftp://ftp.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/pub/projects/charity/literature/papers_and_reports/charitable.ps ps]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [ftp://ftp.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/pub/projects/charity/literature/papers_and_reports/charitable.ps.gz ps.gz]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">'''''Jus inter gentes''''', is the body of [[treaty|treaties]], U.N. conventions, and other [[international agreements]].  Originally a [[Roman law]] concept, it later became a major part of [[public international law]]. The other major part is ''[[jus gentium]]'',  the [[Law of Nations]] (municipal law).&lt;ref&gt;Also referred to in the [[United States]] [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]], Article I, Section 8, Clause 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Jus inter gentes'', literally, means "law between the peoples".&lt;ref&gt;These are [[cognate]], in the [[English language]] to justice, international, and gentiles, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is ''not'' the same as ''jus gentium'', argues Francisco Martin and his co-authors in "International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law" (2006),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521858861&amp;ss=exc Treaties, Cases, and Analysis], Francisco Martin, et al. 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-521-85886-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; because ''jus inter gentes'' includes internationally recognized [[human rights]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3329">'''Laughter-induced syncope''' is an unusual but recognized form of situational [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting) likely to have a similar pathophysiological origin to tussive syncope. One reported case occurred while a patient was watching the television show ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and was given the name '''Seinfeld syncope'''.&lt;ref name="pmid9328725"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox SV, Eisenhauer AC, Hreib K |title=Seinfeld syncope |journal=Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn |volume=42 |issue=2 |page=242 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9328725|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0304(199710)42:2&lt;242::AID-CCD41&gt;3.0.CO;2-M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few case reports of this syndrome in the literature. Patients, as in this case, might present initially to the [[Emergency department|ED]], and [[laughter]] should be considered among the numerous differentials for syncope.

Laughter-induced syncope should not be confused with [[cataplexy]], a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions, particularly laughter. Unlike syncope, there is no loss of consciousness in cataplexy, which affects some sufferers of [[narcolepsy]].

To date there have been few cases of laughter-induced syncope documented in medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shear Hilarity Leading to Laugh Syncope in a Healthy Man|author=Bloomfield and Jazrawi|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2005|volume=293|pages=2863–2864|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/293/23/2863.2.extract|doi=10.1001/jama.293.23.2863-b|pmid=15956630|last2=Jazrawi|first2=S|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]] and [[systems design]] a '''loosely coupled''' system is one in which each of its [[Software component#Component Definition|component]]s has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components. Subareas include the [[Coupling (computer programming)|coupling]] of classes, interfaces, data, and services.&lt;ref&gt;''Loosely Coupled: The Missing Pieces of Web Services'' by [[Doug Kaye]]&lt;/ref&gt; Loose coupling is the opposite of [[tight coupling]].

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services. Components in a loosely coupled system are less constrained to the same platform, language, operating system, or build environment.

If systems are decoupled in time, it is difficult to also provide [[transactional integrity]]; additional coordination protocols are required. [[Data replication]] across different systems provides loose coupling (in availability), but creates issues in maintaining [[data consistency|consistency]] ([[data synchronization]]).

== In integration ==
Loose coupling in broader [[distributed system]] design is achieved by the use of transactions, queues provided by [[message-oriented middleware]], and interoperability standards.&lt;ref&gt;Pautasso C., Wilde E., [http://www2009.eprints.org/92/1/p911.pdf Why is the Web Loosely Coupled?], Proc. of WWW 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Four types of autonomy, which promote loose coupling, are: ''[[reference autonomy]]'', ''time autonomy'', ''format autonomy'', and ''platform autonomy''.&lt;ref&gt;F. Leymann [http://esocc2016.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Leymann-Keynote-ESOCC-2016.pdf Loose Coupling and Architectural Implications], ESOCC 2016 keynote&lt;/ref&gt;

Loose coupling is an architectural principle and design goal in [[service-oriented architecture]]s; eleven forms of loose coupling and their tight coupling counterparts are listed in:&lt;ref&gt;N. Josuttis, SOA in Practice. O'Reilly, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-596-52955-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* physical connections via mediator,
* [[asynchronous communication]] style,
* simple common types only in [[data model]],
* weak type system,
* [[data-centric]] and self-contained messages,
* distributed control of process logic,
* [[dynamic binding (computing)|dynamic binding]] (of service consumers and providers),
* platform independence,
* business-level compensation rather than system-level transactions,
* deployment at different times,
* implicit upgrades in versioning.
[[Enterprise Service Bus]] (ESB) middleware was invented to achieve loose coupling in multiple dimensions;&lt;ref&gt;M. Keen et al, [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246346.html?Open Patterns: Implementing an SOA using an Enterprise Service Bus], IBM, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however, overengineered and mispositioned ESBs can also have the contrary effect and create undesired tight coupling and a central architectural hotspot.

[[Event-driven architecture]] also aims at promoting loose coupling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-eda-extends-soa-and-why-it-is.html How EDA extends SOA and why it is important] Jack van Hoof&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods for decreasing coupling ===
Loose coupling of interfaces can be enhanced by publishing data in a standard format (such as [[XML]] or [[JSON]]).

Loose coupling between program components can be enhanced by using standard data types in parameters. Passing customized data types or objects requires both components to have knowledge of the custom data definition.

Loose coupling of services can be enhanced by reducing the information passed into a service to the key data. For example, a service that sends a letter is most reusable when just the customer identifier is passed and the customer address is obtained within the service.  This decouples services because services do not need to be called in a specific order (e.g. GetCustomerAddress, SendLetter).

Loose coupling of application integration in business process automation contexts can be increased by following a presentation layer integration model in which automation applications interact with underlying automated applications through the presentation layer or graphical user interface.

== In programming ==
Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one component has of another. Loose coupling in computing is interpreted as [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] vs. non-encapsulation.

An example of tight coupling occurs when a dependent class contains a pointer directly to a concrete class which provides the required behavior.  The dependency cannot be substituted, or its "signature" changed, without requiring a change to the dependent class.  Loose coupling occurs when the dependent class contains a pointer only to an interface, which can then be implemented by one or many concrete classes.  The dependent class's dependency is to a "contract" specified by the interface; a defined list of methods and/or properties that implementing classes must provide.  Any class that implements the interface can thus satisfy the dependency of a dependent class without having to change the class. This allows for extensibility in software design; a new class implementing an interface can be written to replace a current dependency in some or all situations, without requiring a change to the dependent class; the new and old classes can be interchanged freely.  Strong coupling does not allow this.

This is a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagram illustrating an example of ''loose'' coupling between a dependent class and a set of concrete classes, which provide the required behavior:

[[File:Loose Coupling Example.JPG]]

For comparison, this diagram illustrates the alternative design with ''strong'' coupling between the dependent class and a provider:

[[File:Strong Coupling Example.JPG]]

=== Other forms ===
Computer programming languages having notions of either functions as the core module (see [[Functional programming]]) or functions as objects provide excellent examples of loosely coupled programming. Functional languages have patterns of [[Continuation]]s, [[Closure (computer programming)|Closure]], or generators. See [[Clojure]] and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] as examples of function programming languages. Object-oriented languages like [[Smalltalk]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] have code blocks, whereas [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] has agents. The basic idea is to objectify (encapsulate as an object) a function independent of any other enclosing concept (e.g. decoupling an object function from any direct knowledge of the enclosing object). See [[First-class function]] for further insight into functions as objects, which qualifies as one form of first-class function.

So, for example, in an object-oriented language, when a function of an object is referenced as an object (freeing it from having any knowledge of its enclosing host object) the new function object can be passed, stored, and called at a later time. Recipient objects (to whom these functional objects are given) can safely execute (call) the contained function at their own convenience without any direct knowledge of the enclosing host object. In this way, a program can execute chains or groups of functional objects, while safely decoupled from having any direct reference to the enclosing host object.

Phone numbers are an excellent analog and can easily illustrate the degree of this decoupling.

For example: Some entity provides another with a phone number to call to get a particular job done. When the number is called, the calling entity is effectively saying, "Please do this job for me." The decoupling or loose coupling is immediately apparent. The entity receiving the number to call may have no knowledge of where the number came from (e.g. a reference to the supplier of the number). On the other side, the caller is decoupled from specific knowledge of who they are calling, where they are, and knowing how the receiver of the call operates internally.

Carrying the example a step further, the caller might say to the receiver of the call, "Please do this job for me. Call me back at this number when you are finished." The 'number' being offered to the receiver is referred to as a "Call-back". Again, the loose coupling or decoupled nature of this functional object is apparent. The receiver of the call-back is unaware of what or who is being called. It only knows that it can make the call and decides for itself when to call. In reality, the call-back may not even be to the one who provided the call-back in the first place. This level of indirection is what makes function objects an excellent technology for achieving loosely coupled programs.

=== Measuring data element coupling ===
The degree of the loose coupling can be measured by noting the number of changes in [[data element]]s that could occur in the sending or receiving systems and determining if the computers would still continue communicating correctly.  These changes include items such as:
# Adding new data elements to messages
# Changing the order of data elements
# Changing the names of data elements
# Changing the structures of data elements
# Omitting data elements

'''Market moving information''' is a term used in [[stock market]] investing, defined as information that would cause any reasonable investor to make a buy or sell decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2579510|title = Reasonable Investor(s)|last = |first = |date = 2015|journal = Boston University Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes referred to as [[material information]].

When a public company insider fails to publicly disclose material, market moving information to everyone and only to certain parties, that is called [[selective disclosure]], an act that is prohibited by the SEC's [[Regulation FD]].

Many types of events can be considered market moving information.  A bad freeze in Florida can cause the price of orange juice to increase.  An expected drought in the Midwest might cause corn or soybean prices to rise on fears of poor crop outputs and limited supplies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Maxwellisation''' is the legal practice in [[Civil procedure in England and Wales|English]] and [[Scots civil procedure|Scots]] law that allows persons who are to be criticised in an official report to respond prior to publication, based on details of the criticism received in advance.

The process takes its name from the publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. In 1969, Maxwell was criticised in a report by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] as "unfit to hold the stewardship of a public company". Maxwell took the matter to court, where the DTI was said by the judge to have "virtually committed the business murder" of Maxwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maxwellisation|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-2073483/30-SECOND-GUIDE-MAXWELLISATION.html|work=Thisismoney.co.uk|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell v Department of Trade and Industry [1974] QB 523&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid any repeat of Mr Justice Forbes' ruling, official policy was altered to ensure prior notice would be given of critical findings. Relevant witnesses are shown the specific extracts of reports relating to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation on Inquiries (Scotland) Rules: Scottish Inquiries Under the Inquiries Act 2005|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/14163951/2|work=The Scottish Government|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of the process being applied, including the 1997 report into the [[Guinness share-trading fraud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTI Inquiries|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970604/debtext/70604-04.htm|work=4 June 1997|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Iraq Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chilcot |first=John |title=Letter to David Cameron |date=13 July 2012 |url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/96313/2012-07-13-Letter-Chilcot-to-Cameron.pdf |work=Iraq Inquiry |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">In philosophy, '''metaphysical necessity''', sometimes called '''broad logical necessity''',&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leftow, ''God and Necessity'' (2012). {{ISBN|0191654876}}, 9780191654879&lt;/ref&gt; is one of many different kinds of [[wikt:necessity|necessity]], which sits between logical necessity and nomological (or physical) necessity, in the sense that logical necessity entails metaphysical necessity, but not vice versa, and metaphysical necessity entails physical necessity, but not vice versa.  A [[proposition]] is said to be ''necessary'' if it could not have failed to be the case.  Nomological necessity is necessity according to the laws of physics and logical necessity is necessity according to the laws of logic, while metaphysical necessities are necessary in the sense that the world could not possibly have been otherwise.  What facts are metaphysically necessary, and on what basis we might view certain facts as metaphysically but not logically necessary are subjects of substantial discussion in contemporary philosophy.

The concept of a metaphysically necessary being plays an important role in certain arguments for the existence of God, especially the [[ontological argument]], but metaphysical necessity is also one of the central concepts in late 20th century [[analytic philosophy]].  Metaphysical necessity has proved a controversial concept, and criticized by [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[J. L. Mackie]], and [[Richard Swinburne]], among others.

Metaphysical necessity is contrasted with other types of necessity.  For example, the philosophers of religion [[John Hick]]&lt;ref&gt;John Hick (1961): Necessary Being. - ''Scottish Journal of Theology'', 1961: 353-369.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William L. Rowe]]&lt;ref&gt;William L. Rowe (1998): ''The Cosmological Argument''. Fordham Univ Press, 273 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished the following three:
# factual necessity (existential necessity): a factually necessary being is not causally dependent on any other being, while any other being is causally dependent on it.
# causal necessity (subsumed by Hicks under the former type): a causally necessary being is such that it is logically impossible for it to be causally dependent on any other being, and it is logically impossible for any other being to be causally independent of it.
# [[Logical truth|logical necessity]]: a logically necessary being is a being whose non-existence is a logical impossibility, and which therefore exists either timeless or eternally in all possible worlds.
While many theologians (e.g. [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]) considered God to be a logically or metaphysically necessary being, Richard Swinburne argued for factual necessity, and [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that God is a causally necessary being. Because a factually or causally necessary being does not exist by logical necessity, it does not exist in all logically possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Nash (1983): ''The Concept of God''. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Swinburne used the term "ultimate brute fact" for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swinburne (2004): ''The Existence of God''. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

== A priori and necessary truths == 
In [[Naming and Necessity]],&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. 1980. ''Naming and Necessity''. [[Harvard University Press]]: 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argued that there were [[a posteriori]] truths, such as Hesperus is Phosphoros, or Water is H20, that were nonetheless metaphysically necessary.

A '''motion picture content rating system''' is designated to [[Content rating|classify films]] with regard to suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of mature content. A particular issued rating can be called a '''certification''', '''classification''', '''certificate''' or '''rating'''. Ratings typically carry age recommendations in an advisory or restrictive capacity, and are often given in lieu of [[censorship]]. In some jurisdictions the legal obligation of administering the rating may be imposed on [[movie theater]]s.

In countries such as Australia and Singapore, an official government body decides on ratings; in other countries, such as the United States, it is done by industry committees with little if any official government status. In most countries, however, films that are considered morally offensive have been censored, restricted, or banned. Even if the film rating system has no legal consequences, and a film has not explicitly been restricted or banned, there are usually laws forbidding certain films, or forbidding minors to view them.

The influence of specific factors in deciding a rating varies from country to country. In countries such as the United States, films with strong sexual content tend to be restricted to older viewers, though those same films are very often considered suitable for all ages in countries such as France and Germany. In contrast, films with violent content which would be rated leniently in the United States and Australia are often subject to high ratings and sometimes even censorship in countries such as Germany and Finland.

Other factors may or may not influence the classification process, such as being set within a [[non-fictional]] historical context, whether the film glorifies violence or drug use, whether said violence or drug use is carried out by the protagonist, with whom the viewer should empathize, or by the antagonist. In Germany, for example, films depicting explicit war violence in a real war context (such as the Second World War) are handled more leniently than films with purely fictional settings.

A film may be produced with a particular rating in mind. It may be [[Re-edited film|re-edited]] if the desired rating is not obtained, especially to avoid a higher rating than intended. A film may also be re-edited to produce an alternate version for other countries.

* Advisory categories
** General ('''G''') – ''General''. The content is very mild in impact. The G classification is suitable for everyone.
** Parental Guidance ('''PG''') – ''Parental guidance recommended''. The content is mild in impact. It is not recommended for viewing or playing by persons under 15 without guidance from parents or guardians.
** Mature ('''M''') – ''Recommended for mature audiences''. The content is moderate in impact. Children under 15 may legally access this material because it is an advisory category. However, M classified films and computer games may include classifiable elements such as violence and nudity of moderate impact that are not recommended for children under 15 years.
* Restricted categories
** Mature Accompanied ('''MA15+''') – ''Not suitable for people under 15. Under 15s must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian''. The content is strong in impact.
** Restricted ('''R18+''') – ''Restricted to 18 years and over''. The content is high in impact. Despite this category being legally restricted, in Queensland the restriction is not applicable to persons under 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Industry/Journey/Documents/Resources/CLS%20-%20Cinema%20Managers%20Factsheet%20-%20December%2012%20update.pdf |title=CLS - Cinema Managers Factsheet - December 12 update |publisher=Australian Classification Board |location=Australia |language=English |format=PDF |publication-date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adult film categories
** Restricted ('''X18+''') – ''Restricted to 18 years and over''. This classification is a special and legally restricted category which contains only sexually explicit content. That is, material which shows actual sexual intercourse and other sexual activity between consenting adults. X18+ films are only available for sale or hire in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
** '''RC''' – ''Refused Classification''. Banned from sale or hire in Australia and cannot be legally imported. Films are rated RC if their content is very high in impact and exceeds the guidelines.

Films intended to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification provided they do not contain material that would result in an "M" rating or higher if submitted for classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is it exempt? |publisher=Australian Classification Board |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Industry/Journey/Pages/Exemptions/Step1.aspx |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only two classifications for films publicly exhibited in Belgium issued by the Inter-Community Commission for Film Rating ({{lang-nl|Intergemeenschapscommissie voor de Filmkeuring}}; {{lang-fr|Commission Intercommunautaire de Contrôle des Films}}). Films are prohibited to minors under the age of 16 unless passed by the commission. There is no mandatory rating system for video formats but 90% of video distribution abides by the voluntary Belgium Video Federation.

Film ratings in Canada are a provincial responsibility, and each province has its own legislation, rules and regulations regarding rating, exhibition and admission. Ratings are required for theatrical exhibition, but not all provinces require classification for home video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Ratings – Theatrical Classification |publisher=[[Motion Picture Association – Canada]] |url=http://www.mpa-canada.org/theatrical-classification/ |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past there was a wide range of rating categories and practices in the various provinces; however, the seven rating systems—with the exception of Quebec—now all use categories and logos derived from the [[Canadian Home Video Rating System]] (CHVRS).&lt;ref name="canada classification boards"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Classification Boards |publisher=[[Motion Picture Association – Canada]] |url=http://www.cmpda.ca/?q=content/film-classification-boards |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523033902/http://www.cmpda.ca/?q=content%2Ffilm-classification-boards |archivedate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FSK Ratings Dec 2008.gif|thumb|right|The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (FSK) ratings.]]
The [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft]] (Voluntary Self-Regulation of the Film Industry, FSK) has a film ratings system under which films are classified. All the ratings contain the phrase "gemäß §14 JuSchG" (in accordance with §14 of the Youth Protection Law), signifying that they are legally binding for minors. Cinemas may legally exhibit films without a classification but minors are prohibited from such screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alterseinstufungen und FSK-Kennzeichen |language=German |trans-title=Age ratings and FSK mark |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/index.asp?SeitID=508&amp;TID=72 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Ohne Altersbeschränkung (FSK 0)''': no age restriction (white sign)
* '''Freigegeben ab 6 Jahren (FSK 6)''': released to ages 6 and older, nobody under this age admitted (yellow sign)
* '''Freigegeben ab 12 Jahren (FSK 12)''': released to ages 12 and older; children who are at least age 6 may be admitted with parental accompaniment (green sign)
* '''Freigegeben ab 16 Jahren (FSK 16)''': released to ages 16 and older, nobody under this age admitted (blue sign)
* '''Keine Jugendfreigabe (FSK 18)''': "''no youth admitted''", adults only. (red sign)
* '''Infoprogramm''' or '''Lehrprogramm''': "educational programming". This rating is not issued by the FSK, but may be self-applied to films seeking to educate their audience (e.g. documentaries, instructional films, etc.). Films with this rating may be sold without any age restriction provided they do not contain any material "evidently harmful to the development of children and youths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Informationsblatt zum neuen Jugendschutzgesetz ab 01.04.2003 |language=German |trans-title=Information sheet about the new Youth Protection Act from 01.04.2003 |date=1 April 2003 |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/media_content/555.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSK rating also limits the time of the day in which the movie may be aired on free-to-air TV stations to a time frame between 22:00 (FSK 16) or 23:00 (FSK 18) and 6:00. Stations are permitted to broadcast films not approved for audiences under 12 at their own discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gültigkeit der FSK-Kennzeichen für das Fernsehen – Sendezeitschienen |language=German |trans-title=Validity of the G-mark for television – Airtime rails |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/index.asp?SeitID=1295&amp;TID=72 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Censorship in Malaysia}}
Historically, film censorship in Malaysia was carried out by police under the Theatre Ordinance 1908. In 1954 the [[Film Censorship Board of Malaysia|Film Censorship Board]] (LPF) was created to censor films distributed across Malaysia in accordance with the Cinematograph Films Act 1952, and later the Film Censorship Act 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Censorship Board – Introduction|url=http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-pengenalan|publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]|location=Malaysia|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822011400/http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-pengenalan|archivedate=22 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia's motion picture rating system was introduced in 1953, initially classifying films either for General Audiences (''Tontonan Umum'') or For Adults Only (''Untuk Orang Dewasa Sahaja''), and in 1996 these classifications were changed to U and four different 18 categories. In mid-April 2010, the four 18 categories were deprecated, and was simplified to just '''18'''. In late 2008, the PG13 classification was introduced, which was changed to P13 in 2012.&lt;ref name="Malaysia ratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Censorship Board – Film Classification|url=http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-klasifikasi-filem|publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]|location=Malaysia|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113035653/http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-klasifikasi-filem|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Lulus Bersih'' (Passed Clean [i.e. without cuts])
* ''Lulus Dengan Pengubahan'' (Passed with Edits/Cuts)

==Poland==
Ratings in Poland are not set by any board or advisory body. Prior to 1989 the applicable age ratings were "no age limit", "over 7", "over 12", "over 15" and "over 18" and were set by The General Committee of Cinematography. Since 1989 there is no official classification system, with age ratings being self-prescriptive and set by the distributors. In case of television, the supervisory body – [[Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji]] (KRRiT, The National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television) can impose fines upon those responsible for improper rating of a broadcast, or lack of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Lucyna |last=Kirwil |title=Age or Content Based Film Ratings: A Solution Discussed in Poland |date=3–5 September 2003 |conference=European Conference of Film Classification |publisher=Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen |url=http://fsf.de/data/hefte/pdf/Veranstaltungen/Archiv/2003_European_Conference/poland_abstract_ppp_.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film classification in Singapore was introduced on 1 July 1991 and comes under the jurisdiction of the Board of Film Censors (BFC), currently part of the [[Info-communications Media Development Authority]] (IMDA). There were three ratings originally: G (General), PG (Parental Guidance) and R (Restricted to 18 years and above). Prior to then films were either approved or effectively banned. Since then, there have been several alterations to the ratings over the years. In September 1991, a Restricted (Artistic) (R(A)) rating was introduced to replaced the previous R-rating so as to allow the screening of certain art-house films which would otherwise have been banned without said rating, with an increased age restriction set at 21 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_15_2004-12-27.html&lt;/ref&gt; The R(A) rating has since been replaced by NC16 (No Children under 16), M18 (Mature 18) and R21 (Restricted 21). A PG13 (Parental Guidance 13) rating, introduced in 2011, is the latest rating to be introduced. The G, PG and PG13 ratings are advisory while NC16, M18 and R21 carry age restrictions. Video ratings are mostly the same as the cinema ratings, except only go up to M18. Some titles, such as documentaries, children's programmes and sports programmes may be exempt from classification on video, but all titles must be classified for public theatrical exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulations &amp; Licensing: Content Standards &amp; Classification – Film &amp; Videos |publisher=[[Media Development Authority]] |location=Singapore |url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/FilmsAndVideos/Pages/default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315080305/http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/FilmsAndVideos/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Board of Film Censors|title=Classification Guidelines |publisher=[[Media Development Authority]] |location=Singapore |url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/Documents/Films%20and%20Videos/Classification_Guidelines_15072011.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724013050/http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/Documents/Films%20and%20Videos/Classification_Guidelines_15072011.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A motion picture rating system was proposed in the Film and Video Act of 2007, and was passed on December 20, 2007 by the [[Council for National Security|Thai military]]-appointed [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Legislative Assembly]], replacing laws which had been in place since 1930. The draft law was met with resistance from the film industry and independent filmmakers. Activists had hoped for a less-restrictive approach; however, films are still subject to censorship, or can be banned from release altogether if the film is deemed to "undermine or disrupt social order and moral decency, or might impact national security or the pride of the nation".&lt;ref name=Rithdee&gt;{{cite news |last=Rithdee |first=Kong |title=Thailand passes controversial film act |date=20 December 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/thailand-passes-controversial-film-act-1117978081 |accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BBFC ratings.JPG|thumb|right|UK film classification certificates. Uc is deprecated.]]
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) classifies films to be publicly exhibited in the United Kingdom, although statutory powers remain with local councils which can overrule any of the BBFC's decisions. Since 1984, the BBFC also classifies films made commercially available though a home video format. If the BBFC refuses a classification this effectively amounts to a ban (although local councils retain the legal right to overturn it in the case of cinema exhibition). The BBFC's regulatory powers do not extend to the Internet, so a film they have banned on physical media can still be made available via [[streaming media]]/[[video on demand]]. Videos designed to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification; exempt films may be marked as "E", but this is not an official label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the BBFC |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQs |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc/faqs |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''U (Universal)''' - Suitable for all. A U-rated film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over.
* '''PG (Parental Guidance)''' - General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG-rated film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older.
* '''12A''' - Cinema release suitable for 12 years and over. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A-rated film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult.
* '''12''' – Video release suitable for 12 years and over. Video recordings with this rating are not to be supplied to anyone below that age even if under supervision.
* '''[[15 (British Board of Film Classification)|15]]''' - Suitable only for 15 years and older. No-one under 15 is allowed to see a 15-rated film at the cinema or buy/rent a 15-rated video.

* '''[[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 (Restricted 18)]]''' - Adult works for licensed premises only. The R18 category is a special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults.

{{moresources|date=November 2007}}
{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Mura'''''|[[wikt:斑|斑]]}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning "unevenness; irregularity; lack of uniformity; nonuniformity; inequality",&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'' (2003), 5th edition, Tokyo: Kenkyusha, p. 2536.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key concept in the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) as one of the three types of waste (''[[muda (Japanese term)|muda]]'', ''mura'', ''[[muri (Japanese term)|muri]]'').&lt;ref name = emiliani-better-thinking&gt;{{cite book | title = Better thinking, better results: case study and analysis of an enterprise-wide lean transformation | first1 = Bob  | last1 = Emiliani  | first2 = David | last2 = Stec | first3 = Lawrence  | last3 = Grasso  | first4 = James | last4 = Stodder | location =  Kensington, Conn  | publisher = Center for Lean Business Management | year = 2007 | edition = 2nd | ISBN = 978-0-9722591-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waste reduction]] is an effective way to increase profitability. [[Toyota]] adopted these three Japanese words as part of their product improvement program, due to their familiarity in common usage.

Mura, in terms of business/process improvement, is avoided through [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just-In-Time]] systems which are based on keeping little or no inventory. These systems supply the production process with the right part, at the right time, In the right amount, using [[first-in, first-out]] (FIFO) component flow. Just-In-Time systems create a “pull system” in which each sub-process withdraws its needs from the preceding sub-processes, and ultimately from an outside supplier. When a preceding process does not receive a request or withdrawal it does not make more parts.  This type of system is designed to maximize [[productivity]] by minimizing storage overhead.

For example:
# The assembly line “makes a request to,” or “pulls from” the Paint Shop, which pulls from Body Weld. 
# The Body Weld shop pulls from Stamping. 
# At the same time, requests are going out to suppliers for specific parts, for the vehicles that have been ordered by customers. 
# Small buffers accommodate minor fluctuations, yet allow continuous flow.
 
If parts or material defects are found in one process, the Just-in-Time approach requires that the problem be quickly identified and corrected.

== Implementation ==

[[Production leveling]], also called [[heijunka box|heijunka]], and frequent deliveries to customer are key to identifying and eliminating Mura. The use of different types of [[Kanban]] to control inventory at different stages in the process are key to ensuring that "pull" is happening between sub-processes. Leveling production, even when different products are produced in the same system, will aid in scheduling work in a standard way that encourages lower costs.

It is also possible to smooth the workflow by having one operator work across several machines in a process rather than have different operators; in a sense merging several sub-processes under one operator. The fact that there is one operator will force a smoothness across the operations because the workpiece flows with the operator. There is no reason why the several operators cannot all work across these several machines following each other and carrying their workpiece with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A study of the Toyota Production System |author= [[Shigeo Shingo]] |publisher=Productivity Press |year= 1989 |page= 157|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This multiple machine handling is called "multi-process handling" in the Toyota Production System.

== Limitations, critiques and improvements ==

Some processes have considerable [[lead time]].  Some processes
have unusually high costs for waiting or downtime.  When this is
the case, it is often desirable to try to predict the upcoming demand
from a sub-process before pull occurs or a card is generated.  The smoother
the process, the more accurately this can be done from analysis of
previous historical experience.

Some processes have asymmetric cost.  In such situations, it may
be better to err away from the higher cost error.  In this case,
there appears to be waste and higher average error, but the waste
or errors are smaller ones and in aggregate leads to lower costs / 
more customer value.

For example, consider running a call center. 
It may be more effective to have low cost call center operators wait for 
high value clients rather than risk losing high value clients by making
them wait.  Given the asymmetric cost of these errors - particularly if
the processes are not smooth - it may be prudent to have what seems like
a surplus of call center operators that appear to be "wasting" call center
operator time, rather than commit the higher-cost error of losing the
occasional high value client.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17937">The '''N170''' is a component of the [[event-related potential]] (ERP) that reflects the neural processing of [[Face perception|faces]].

When potentials evoked by images of faces are compared to those elicited by other visual stimuli, the former show increased negativity 130-200 ms after stimulus presentation. This response is maximal over occipito-temporal electrode sites, which is consistent with a source located at the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Inferior temporal gyrus|inferior-temporal]] gyri, confirmed by [[electrocorticography]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghuman|first=Avniel Singh|last2=Brunet|first2=Nicolas M.|last3=Li|first3=Yuanning|last4=Konecky|first4=Roma O.|last5=Pyles|first5=John A.|last6=Walls|first6=Shawn A.|last7=Destefino|first7=Vincent|last8=Wang|first8=Wei|last9=Richardson|first9=R.

==History==
The N170 was first described by [[Shlomo Bentin]] and colleagues in 1996,&lt;ref name=bentinEtAl1996 /&gt; who measured ERPs from participants viewing faces and other objects. They found that human faces and face parts (such as eyes) elicited different responses than other stimuli, including animal faces, body parts, and cars.

Earlier work performed by Botzel and Grusser and first reported in 1989&lt;ref name=botzelGrusser1989 /&gt; also attempted to find a component of the ERP that corresponded to the processing of human faces. They showed observers line drawings (in one experiment) and black-and-white photographs (in two additional experiments) of faces, trees, and chairs. They found that, compared to the other stimulus classes, faces elicited a larger positive component approximately 150 ms after onset, which was maximal at central electrode sites (at the top of the head). The topography of this effect and lack of lateralization led to the conclusion that this face-specific potential did not arise in face-selective areas in the occipital-temporal region, but instead in the [[limbic system]]. Subsequent work referred to this component as the vertex positive potential (VPP).&lt;ref name=jeffreys1996 /&gt;

In an attempt to rectify these two apparently conflicting results, Joyce and Rossion&lt;ref name=joyceRossion2005 /&gt; recorded ERPs from 53 scalp electrodes while participants viewed faces and other visual stimuli. After recording, they re-referenced the data to several commonly used reference electrode sites, including the nose and [[mastoid process]]. They found that the N170 and VPP can be accounted for by the same [[Electric dipole|dipole arrangement]] arising from the same neural generators, and therefore reflect the same process.

==Functional sensitivity==
Three of the most studied attributes of the N170 include manipulations of face inversion, facial race, and emotional expressions.

It has been established that inverted faces (i.e., those presented upside-down) are more difficult to perceive&lt;ref name=yin1969 /&gt; (the [[Thatcher effect]] is a good illustration of this). In their landmark study, Bentin et al. found that inverted faces increased the latency of the N170 component.&lt;ref name=bentinEtAl1996 /&gt; Jacques and colleagues further studied the timecourse of the [[face inversion effect]] (FIE) using an adaptation paradigm.&lt;ref name=jacquesEtAl2007 /&gt; When the same stimulus is presented multiple times, the neuronal response decreases over time; when a different stimulus is presented, the response recovers. The conditions under which a "release from adaptation" occurs therefore provides a way to measure stimulus similarity. In their experiment, Jacques et al. found that the release from adaptation is smaller and occurs 30 ms later for inverted faces, indicating that the neuronal population encoding face identity require additional processing time to detect the identity of inverted faces.

In an experiment examining the effects of race on the N170's amplitude, it was found that an "Other-Race Effect" was elicited in conjunction with face inversions.  Vizioli and colleagues examined the effect of face recognition impairment while subjects process same race (SR) or other race (OR) pictures.&lt;ref name=vizioliEtAl2010 /&gt; The research team devised a N170 experiment based on the premise that visual expertise plays a critical role in inversion, hypothesizing that viewers' greater level of expertise with SR faces (holistic processing) should elicit a stronger FIE compared to OR face stimuli. The authors recorded EEGs from Western Caucasian and East Asian subjects (two separate groups) who were presented with pictures of Western Caucasian, East Asian and African America faces in upright and inverted orientations. All the facial stimuli were cropped to remove external features (i.e. hair, beards, hats, etc.). Both groups displayed a later N170 with larger amplitude (over the right hemisphere) for inverted than upright same-race (SR) faces, but showed no inversion effect for OR and AA photo stimuli. Moreover, no race effects were observed in regard to the peak amplitude of the N170 for upright faces in both groups of participants. The results also found no significant latency differences among the races of stimuli, but facial inversion did increase and delay the N170 amplitude and onset respectively. They conclude that the subjects' lack of experience with inverted faces makes processing such stimuli more difficult than pictures shown in their canonical orientation, regardless of what race the stimulus is.

Besides modulation by inversion and race, emotional expressions have also been a focus of N170 face research. In an experiment conducted by Righart and de Gelder, ERP results show that the early stages of face processing may be affected by emotional scenes when categorizations of fearful and happy facial expressions are made by subjects.&lt;ref name=righardDeGelder2008 /&gt; In this paradigm subjects had to view color pictures of happy or fearful faces that were centrally overlaid on pictures of natural scenes. And in order to control for low level features, such as color and other items that could care meaning, all the scene pictures were scrambled by randomizing the position of pixels across the image. The final results of the experiment show that emotion effects were associated with the N170 in which there was a larger (negative) amplitude for faces when they appeared in a fearful context then when placed in happy or neutral scenes. In fact, left occipito-temporal distributed N170 amplitudes were dramatically increased for intact fearful faces when they appeared in a fearful scene, though levels were not as high when a fearful face was presented in a happy or neutral scene. Similar results did occur in regard to intact happy faces, but the amplitudes were not as high as those related to fearful scenes or expressions.&lt;ref name=blauEtAl2007 /&gt; Righart and de Gelder conclude that information from task-irrelevant scenes is rapidly combined with the information from facial expressions, and that subjects use context information in the early stage of processing when they need to discriminate/categorize facial expressions.

Results from a study conducted by Ghuman and colleagues using direct neural recordings from the [[fusiform face area]] using [[electrocorticography]] showed that while the N170 displays a very strong response to faces when compared to other visual images, the N170 is not sensitive to the identity of the face.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead, they showed that which face a person is viewing can be decoded from the activity between 250–500 ms, consistent with the hypothesis that identity processing begins with the N250.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=James W.|last2=Curran|first2=Tim|last3=Porterfield|first3=Albert L.|last4=Collins|first4=Daniel|date=2006-09-01|title=Activation of preexisting and acquired face representations: the N250 event-related potential as an index of face familiarity|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1488–1497|doi=10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1488|issn=0898-929X|pmid=16989550}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that the N170 is important for gist-level processing of faces and face detection, processes which may set the stage for later face individuation.

==Generators==
Given the ease and rapidity with which humans can recognize faces, a great deal of neuroscientific research has endeavored to understand how and where the brain processes them. Early research on [[prosopagnosia]], or "face blindness", found that damage to the occipito-temporal region led to an impaired or complete inability for people to recognize faces. Convergent evidence for the importance of this region in face processing came through the use of [[fMRI]], which found that a region of the [[fusiform gyrus]], the "[[fusiform face area]]", responded selectively to images of faces.

Intracranial recordings in humans using [[electrocorticography]] provide very strong evidence that the fusiform face area is one of the generators of the N170,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though other regions of the face processing network may also contribute to the N170.

An investigation of the N170 undertaken&lt;ref name="itierTaylor2004" /&gt; used ERP source-localization techniques to estimate the location of the neural generator of the N170. They concluded that the N170 arose from the posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]]. However, it should be noted that these techniques are fraught with potential sources of error, and there is disagreement on the validity of inferences drawn from such findings.&lt;ref name="luck2005" /&gt;

==Faces or interstimulus variance==
In 2007, Guillaume Thierry and colleagues&lt;ref name=thierryEtAl2007 /&gt; presented evidence that called into question the face-specificity of the N170. Most earlier experiments found an N170 when the response to frontal views of faces was compared to those of other objects that could appear in more variable poses and configurations. In their study, they introduced a new factor: stimuli could be faces or non-faces, and either class could have high or low similarity. Similarity was measured by calculating the [[correlation]] between [[pixel]] values in pairs of same-category stimuli. When ERPs were compared for these conditions, they found a typical N170 effect in the low-similarity non-face vs. high-similarity face comparison. However, high-similarity non-faces showed a significant N170, while low-similarity faces did not. These results led the authors to conclude that the N170 is actually a measure of stimulus similarity, and not face processing per se.

In response to this, Rossion and Jacques&lt;ref name=rossionJacques2008 /&gt; measured similarity as above for several object categories used in a previous study of the N170. They found that faces elicited a larger N170 than other classes of objects that had similar or higher similarity values, such as houses, cars, and shoes. While it remains uncertain why Thierry et al. observed an effect of similarity on the N170, Rossion and Jacques speculate that lower similarity leads to more variance in the latency of the response. Since ERP components are measured by averaging the results from many individual trials, high latency variance effectively “smears” the response, reducing the amplitude of the average. Rossion and Jacques also offer criticism of the methodology used by Thierry and colleagues, arguing that their failure to find a difference between high-similarity faces and high-similarity non-faces was due to a poor choice of electrode sites.

[[File:Testudo horsfieldii locking into the camera.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some tortoises show negligible senescence.]]
'''Negligible senescence''' is a term coined by [[biogerontology|biogerontologist]] [[Caleb Finch]] to denote organisms that do not exhibit evidence of [[senescence]] (biological aging), such as measurable reductions in their reproductive capability, measurable functional decline, or rising death rates with age.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finch |first1=Caleb |title=Longevity, Senescence and the Genome |date=1994 |publisher=.  University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=206-247 |chapter=Negligible Senescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of species for whose organisms scientists have not detected an increase in mortality rate after maturity.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt; This may mean that the lifespan of the organism is so long that researchers' subjects have not yet lived up to the time when a measure of the species' longevity can be made. Turtles, for example, were once thought to lack senescence, but more extensive observations have found evidence of decreasing fitness with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Study of negligibly senescent animals may provide clues that lead to better understanding of the aging process&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = J | year = 2004 | title = Emerging area of aging research: long-lived animals with "negligible senescence" | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1019 | issue = | pages = 518–20 | doi=10.1196/annals.1297.096 | pmid=15247078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence [[evolution of aging|theories of aging]]. The phenomenon of negligible senescence in some animals is a traditional argument for attempting to achieve similar negligible senescence in humans by technological means.

There are also organisms{{which|date=January 2017}} that exhibit negative senescence, whereby mortality chronologically decreases as the organism ages, for all or part of the life cycle, in disagreement with the [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Late-life mortality deceleration]]). Furthermore, there are species that have been observed to regress to a larval state and regrow into adults multiple times, such as ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of '&amp;#39;Turritopsis'&amp;#39; |publisher=8e.devbio.com |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated a connection between phenomena related to negligible senescence and the general stability of an organism's [[genome]], specifically [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] processes, over its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kogan|first1=Valeria|first2=Ivan|last2=Molodtcov|first3=Leonid I.|last3=Menshikov|first4=Robert J.|last4=Shmookler Reis|first5=Peter|last5=Fedichev|title=Stability analysis of a model gene network links aging, stress resistance, and negligible senescence|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|year=2015|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13589|doi=10.1038/srep13589|pages=13589|pmid=26316217|pmc=4551969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vertebrates==
Some fish, such as some varieties of [[sturgeon]] and [[rougheye rockfish]], and some [[tortoise]]s and [[turtle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = J | year = 2001 | title = Escaping senescence: demographic data from the three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis)". | url = | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 36 | issue = 4–6| pages = 829–32 | doi=10.1016/s0531-5565(00)00243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; are thought to be negligibly senescent, although recent research on turtles has uncovered evidence of senescence in the wild.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Daniel A.|last2=Miller|first2=David A. W.|last3=Bronikowski|first3=Anne M.|last4=Janzen|first4=Fredric J.|date=2016-06-07|title=Decades of field data reveal that turtles senesce in the wild|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/23/6502|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=23|pages=6502–6507|doi=10.1073/pnas.1600035113|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4988574|pmid=27140634}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of a captured fish specimen can be measured by examining growth patterns similar to [[tree rings]] on the [[otolith]]s (parts of motion-sensing organs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = J | year = 1882 | title = Confirmation on longevity in Sebastes diploproa (pisces Scorpaenidae) from 210Pb/226Ra measurements in otoliths | url = | journal = Maritime Biology | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 209–215 | doi=10.1007/bf00394632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In plants==
In plants, [[aspen]] trees are one example of [[biological immortality]]. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the [[root]] system of the [[clonal colony]] is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. One such colony in [[Utah]], given the nickname of [[Pando (Quaking Aspen)|"Pando"]], is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the [[list of long-living organisms|oldest living colony]] of aspens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm Quaking Aspen] by the [[Bryce Canyon]] [[National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest known living non-[[Vegetative cloning|clonal]] organism was the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] of the species ''[[Pinus longaeva]]'' growing high in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] of [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] in eastern [[California]], aged {{Age as of date|4789|1957|August|5}} years.&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_longaeva.php |title= ''Pinus longaeva'' |accessdate= 2008-06-20 |publisher= Gymnosperm Database|date= March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This record was superseded in 2012 by another Great Basin bristlecone pine located in the same region as Methuselah, and was estimated to be 5062 years old. The tree was sampled by Edmund Schulman and dated by Tom Harlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm |title=OLDLIST, a database of old trees |last=Brown |first=Peter M |date=2012 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc. |access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In bacteria==
Among [[bacteria]], individual organisms are vulnerable and can easily die, but on the level of the [[Colony (biology)|colony]], bacteria can live indefinitely. The two daughter bacteria resulting from [[cell division]] of a parent bacterium can be regarded as unique individuals or as members of a biologically “immortal” colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Lin|author2=Guttman, David S.|title=A Model for Damage Load and Its Implications for the Evolution of Bacterial Aging|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=26 August 2010|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e1001076|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001076|pmid=20865171|pmc=2928801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two daughter cells can be regarded as “rejuvenated” copies of the parent cell because damaged macromolecules have been split between the two cells and diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rang|first=Camilla U.|author2=Peng, Annie Y. |author3=Chao, Lin |title=Temporal Dynamics of Bacterial Aging and Rejuvenation|journal=Current Biology|date=8 November 2011|volume=21|issue=21|pages=1813–1816|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.09.018|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010207|pmid=22036179}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[asexual reproduction]].

==Cryptobiosis==
Some rare organisms, such as [[tardigrade]]s, usually have short lifespans, but are able to survive for thousands of years — and, perhaps, indefinitely — if they enter into the state of [[cryptobiosis]], whereby their [[metabolism]] is reversibly suspended. It is hypothesized by advocates of [[cryonics]] that the human [[central nervous system]] can be similarly put into a state of [[suspended animation]] shortly before [[brain death]] to be revived at a future point in the technological development of humankind when such operation would be possible.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Obfuscation''' is the [[wikt:obscure#Verb|obscuring]] of the intended [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of [[communication]] by making the message difficult to understand, usually with [[mental confusion|confusing]] and [[ambiguity|ambiguous]] language. The obfuscation might be either unintentional or [[intention|intentional]] (although intent usually is [[connotation|connoted]]), and is accomplished with [[circumlocution]] (talking around the subject), the use of [[jargon]] (technical language of a profession), and the use of an [[argot]] ([[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] language) of limited communicative value to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Tom McArthur, Ed., (1992) p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[expository writing]], unintentional obfuscation usually occurs in [[draft document]]s, at the beginning of [[composition (language)|composition]]; such obfuscation is illuminated with [[critical thinking]] and editorial revision, either by the writer or by an editor. Etymologically, the word ''obfuscation'' derives from the Latin ''obfuscatio'', from [[wikt:obfuscate#Etymology|''obfuscāre'' (to darken)]]; synonyms include the words [[wikt:beclouding|beclouding]] and [[wikt:abstrusity#Noun|abstrusity]].

==Background==
Doctors are faulted for using [[jargon]] to conceal unpleasant facts from a patient; the American author and physician [[Michael Crichton]] said that [[medical writing]] is a "highly skilled, calculated attempt to confuse the reader". The psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]] said that medical notation is a form of multiple audience control, which allows the doctor to communicate to the pharmacist things which the patient might oppose if he or she could understand medical jargon.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957) ''Verbal Behavior'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eschew==
"Eschew obfuscation", also stated as "eschew obfuscation, espouse elucidation", is a humorous [[fumblerules|fumblerule]] used by English teachers and professors when lecturing about proper writing techniques. Literally, the phrase means "avoid being unclear" or "avoid being unclear, support being clear", but the use of relatively uncommon words causes confusion in much of the audience (those lacking the [[vocabulary]]), making the statement an example of [[irony]], and more precisely a [[heterological]] phrase. The phrase has appeared in print at least as early as 1959, when it was used as a section heading in a [[NASA]] document.&lt;ref&gt;United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ''NASA Technical Memorandum'' (1959), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier similar phrase appears in [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses]]'', where he lists rule fourteen of good writing as "eschew [[surplusage]]".

==White box cryptography==
In white-box cryptography, obfuscation refers to the protection of cryptographic keys from extraction when they are under the control of the adversary, e.g., as part of a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Chow S, Eisen P, Johnson H, et al. A white-box DES implementation for DRM applications[M]//Digital Rights Management. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2002: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network security==
In [[network security]], obfuscation refers to methods used to obscure an attack payload from inspection by network protection systems.

'''Physical information''' is a form of [[information]]. In [[physics]], it refers to the information of a [[physical system]]. Physical information is an important concept used in a number of fields of study in physics. For example, in [[quantum mechanics]], the form of physical information known as quantum information is used in many descriptions of quantum phenomena, such as [[observer (quantum physics)|quantum observation]], [[quantum entanglement]] and the [[causality|causal]] relationship between quantum objects that carry out either or both close and long-range interactions with one another.

In a somewhat general sense, the information of a given entity can be interpreted as its identity. As such, its information can be perceived to be the representation of the specification of its existence and thus, to be serving as the full description of each of the properties (real or potentialized) that are responsible for the entity’s existence. This description, of course, is one that, in a sense, is completely divorced from both any and all forms of language.

When clarifying the subject of information, care should be taken to distinguish between the following specific cases:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* The phrase '''instance of information''' refers to the specific [[Instantiation principle|instantiation]] of information (identity, form, essence) that is associated with the being of ''a particular example'' of a thing. (This allows for the reference to separate instances of information that happen to share identical patterns.)
* A '''holder of information''' is a variable or mutable instance that can have different forms at different times (or in different situations).
* A '''piece of information''' is a particular fact about a thing's identity or properties, i.e., a portion of its instance.
* A '''pattern of information''' (or ''form'') is the pattern or content of an instance or piece of information. Many separate pieces of information may share the same form. We can say that those pieces are ''perfectly correlated'' or say that they are ''copies'' of each other, as in copies of a book.
* An '''embodiment of information''' is the thing whose essence is a given instance of information.
* A '''representation of information''' is an encoding of some pattern of information within some other pattern or instance.
* An '''interpretation of information''' is a decoding of a pattern of information as being a representation of another specific pattern or fact.
* A '''subject of information''' is the thing that is identified or described by a given instance or piece of information. (Most generally, a thing that is a subject of information could be either abstract or concrete; either mathematical or physical.)
* An '''amount of information''' is a quantification of ''how large'' a given instance, piece, or pattern of information is, or how much of a given system's information content (its instance) has a given attribute, such as being known or unknown. Amounts of information are most naturally characterized in [[logarithm]]ic units.

As the above usages are all conceptually distinct from each other, overloading the word "information" (by itself) to denote (or connote) several of these concepts simultaneously can lead to confusion. Accordingly, this article uses more detailed phrases, such as those shown in bold above, whenever the intended meaning is not made clear by the context.

==Classical versus quantum information==
The instance of information that is contained in a physical system is generally considered to specify
that system's "true" ''state''.  (A [[Scientific realism|realist]] would assert that a physical system ''always'' has a true state of some sort—whether classical or quantum—even though, in many practical situations, the system's true state may be largely unknown.)

When discussing the information that is contained in physical systems according to modern [[quantum physics]], we must distinguish between classical information and [[quantum information]].  Quantum information specifies the complete quantum state [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] (or equivalently, wavefunction) of a system, whereas classical information, roughly speaking, only picks out a definite (pure) quantum state if we are already given a prespecified set of distinguishable ([[orthogonal]]) quantum states to choose from; such a set forms a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the [[vector space]] of all the possible pure quantum states (see [[pure state]]).  Quantum information could thus be expressed by providing (1) a choice of a basis such that the actual quantum state is equal to one of the basis vectors, together with (2) the classical information specifying which of these basis vectors is the actual one.  (However, the quantum information by itself does not include a specification of the basis, indeed, an uncountable number of different bases will include any given state vector.)

Note that the amount of classical information in a quantum system gives the maximum amount of information that can actually be measured and extracted from that quantum system for use by external classical (decoherent) systems, since only basis states are operationally distinguishable from each other.  The impossibility of differentiating between non-orthogonal states is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} equivalent to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  Because of its more general utility, the remainder of this article will deal primarily with classical information, although [[quantum information theory]] does also have some potential applications ([[quantum computing]], [[quantum cryptography]], [[quantum teleportation]]) that are currently being actively explored by both theorists and experimentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang, ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information'', Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantifying classical physical information==
An amount of (classical) physical information may be quantified, as in [[information theory]], as follows.&lt;ref name="shannon"&gt;Claude E. Shannon and Warren Weaver, ''Mathematical Theory of Communication'', University of Illinois Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a system ''S'', defined abstractly in such a way that it has ''N'' distinguishable states (orthogonal quantum states) that are consistent with its description, the amount of information ''I''(''S'') contained in the system's state can be said to be log(''N'').  The logarithm is selected for this definition since it has the advantage that this measure of information content is additive when concatenating independent, unrelated subsystems; e.g., if subsystem ''A'' has ''N'' distinguishable states (''I''(''A'') = log(''N'') information content) and an independent subsystem ''B'' has ''M'' distinguishable states (''I''(''B'') = log(''M'') information content), then the concatenated system has ''NM'' distinguishable states and an information content ''I''(''AB'') = log(''NM'') = log(''N'') + log(''M'') = ''I''(''A'') + ''I''(''B'').  We expect information to be additive from our everyday associations with the meaning of the word, e.g., that two pages of a book can contain twice as much information as one page.

The base of the logarithm used in this definition is arbitrary, since it affects the result by only a multiplicative constant, which determines the unit of information that is implied.  If the log is taken base 2, the unit of information is the binary digit or bit (so named by [[John Tukey]]); if we use a natural logarithm instead, we might call the resulting unit the "[[nat (unit)|nat]]."  In magnitude, a nat is apparently identical to [[Boltzmann's constant]] ''k'' or the [[ideal gas constant]] ''R'', although these particular quantities are usually reserved to measure physical information that happens to be entropy, and that are expressed in physical units such as joules per [[kelvin]], or kilocalories per mole-kelvin.

==Physical information and entropy==
An easy way to understand the underlying unity between physical (as in thermodynamic) [[entropy]] and information-theoretic entropy is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;Entropy is simply that portion of the (classical) physical information contained in a system of interest (whether it is an entire physical system, or just a subsystem delineated by a set of possible messages) whose identity (as opposed to amount) is unknown (from the point of view of a particular knower).&lt;/blockquote&gt;This informal characterization corresponds to both von Neumann's formal definition of the entropy of a mixed quantum state (which is just a statistical mixture of pure states; see [[Quantum statistical mechanics#Von Neumann entropy|von Neumann entropy]]), as well as [[Claude Shannon]]'s definition of the entropy of a [[probability distribution]] over classical signal states or messages (see [[information entropy]]).&lt;ref name="shannon" /&gt;  Incidentally, the credit for Shannon's entropy formula (though not for its use in an [[information theory]] context) really belongs to [[Boltzmann]], who derived it much earlier for use in his [[H-theorem]] of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Cercignani]], ''Ludwig Boltzmann: The Man Who Trusted Atoms'', Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Shannon himself references Boltzmann in his monograph.&lt;ref name="shannon" /&gt;)

Furthermore, even when the state of a system ''is'' known, we can say that the information in the system is still ''effectively'' entropy if that information is effectively incompressible, that is, if there are no known or feasibly determinable correlations or redundancies between different pieces of information within the system.  Note that this definition of entropy can even be viewed as equivalent to the previous one (unknown information) if we take a meta-perspective, and say that for observer ''A'' to "know" the state of system ''B'' means simply that there is a definite correlation between the state of observer ''A'' and the state of system ''B''; this correlation could thus be used by a meta-observer (that is, whoever is discussing the overall situation regarding A's state of knowledge about B) to compress his own description of the joint system ''AB''.&lt;ref name="mpf"&gt;Michael P. Frank, "Physical Limits of Computing", ''Computing in Science and Engineering'', '''4'''(3):16-25, May/June 2002. http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/physlim/plpaper.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this connection with [[algorithmic information theory]],&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Zurek, "Algorithmic randomness, physical entropy, measurements, and the demon of choice," in (Hey 1999), pp. 393-410, and reprinted in (Leff &amp; Rex 2003), pp. 264-281.&lt;/ref&gt; entropy can be said to be that portion of a system's information capacity which is "used up," that is, unavailable for storing new information (even if the existing information content were to be compressed).  The rest of a system's information capacity (aside from its entropy) might be called ''extropy'', and it represents the part of the system's information capacity which is potentially still available for storing newly derived information.  The fact that physical entropy is basically "used-up storage capacity" is a direct concern in the engineering of computing systems; e.g., a computer must first remove the entropy from a given physical subsystem (eventually expelling it to the environment, and emitting heat) in order for that subsystem to be used to store some newly computed information.&lt;ref name="mpf" /&gt;

Roy Frieden]], ''Science from Fisher Information'', Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; "physical information" is defined as the loss of [[Fisher information]] that is incurred during the observation of a physical effect. Thus, if the effect has an intrinsic information level ''J'' but is observed at information level ''I'', the physical information is defined to be the difference ''I'' &amp;minus; ''J''. This defines an ''information [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]''. Frieden's ''principle of [[extreme physical information]]'' or EPI states that extremalizing ''I'' &amp;minus; ''J'' by varying the system probability amplitudes gives the correct amplitudes for most or even all physical theories. The EPI principle was recently proven.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Roy Frieden]] and R.A. Gatenby - ''Principle of maximum Fisher information from Hardy's axioms applied to statistical systems'', ''Phys. Rev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6633">In [[mathematics]], '''pointless topology''' (also called '''point-free''' or '''pointfree topology''', or '''locale theory''') is an approach to [[topology]] that avoids mentioning points.

==Intuitively==
Traditionally, a [[topological space]] consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[point (topology)|points]] together with a ''topology'', a system of subsets called [[open set]]s that with the operations of [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] with certain properties. Point-free topology is based on the concept of a "realistic spot" instead of a point without extent. Spots can be joined (forming a complete lattice) and if a spot meets a join of others it has to meet some of the constituents, which, roughly speaking, leads to the distributive law

&lt;math&gt;b \wedge \left( \bigvee a_i\right) = \bigvee \left(b\wedge a_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formally==

The basic concept is that of a '''frame''', a [[complete lattice]] satisfying the distributive law above; frame homomorphisms respect all [[Join (mathematics)|joins]] (in particular, the [[least element]] of the lattice) and finite [[Meet (Mathematics)|meets]] (in particular, the [[greatest element]] of the lattice).

Frames, together with frame homomorphisms, form a category.

==Relation to point-set topology==
In classical topology, represented on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by the system &lt;math&gt;\Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt; of open sets, &lt;math&gt;\Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt; (partially ordered by inclusion) is a frame, and if &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous map, &lt;math&gt;\Omega(f)\colon \Omega(Y)\to\Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\Omega(f)(U)=f^{-1}[U]&lt;/math&gt; is a frame homomorphism. For [[sober space]]s such &lt;math&gt;\Omega(f)&lt;/math&gt;  are precisely the frame homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;h\colon \Omega(Y)\to\Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a [[full embedding]] of the category of sober spaces into the dual of the category of frames (usually called of the category of locales). This justifies thinking of frames (locales) as of generalized topological spaces. A frame is ''spatial'' if it is isomorphic to a &lt;math&gt;\Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt;. There are plenty of non-spatial ones and this fact turned out to be helpful in several problems.

== The theory of frames and locales ==
The theory of frames and locales in the contemporary sense initiated in late fifties ([[Charles Ehresmann]], [https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Jean+Benabou Jean Bénabou], [[Clifford Hugh Dowker|Hugh Dowker]], Dona Papert) and developed through the following decades ([[John R. Isbell|John Isbell]], [[Peter Johnstone (mathematician)|Peter Johnstone]], [http://staff.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~hsimmons/ Harold Simmons], [[:de:Bernhard Banaschewski|Bernhard Banaschewski]], [[:cs:Aleš Pultr|Aleš Pultr]], Till Plewe, Japie Vermeulen, [[Steve Vickers (computer scientist)|Steve Vickers]]) into a lively branch of topology, with application in various fields, in particular also in theoretical computer science. For more on the history of locale theory see.&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Johnstone, Elements of the history of locale theory, in: Handbook of the History of General Topology, vol. 3, pp. 835-851, Springer, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-6970-7}}, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to translate most concepts of [[point-set topology]] into the context of locales, and prove analogous theorems. From the advantages of the point-free approach let us point out, e.g. the fact that some important facts of classical topology depending on [[Axiom of choice|choice principles]] become choice-free (that is, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]], which is, a.o. appealing for computer science). Thus for instance, products of compact locales are compact constructively, or completions of uniform locales are constructive. This can be useful if one works in a [[topos]] that does not have the axiom of choice. From among other facts of advantage let us name the much better behavior of paracompactness, or the fact that subgroups of localic groups are always closed.

Another point where locale theory and topology diverge strongly is the concept of subspaces vs. sublocales: by [[John R. Isbell|Isbell]]'s density theorem, every locale has a smallest dense sublocale.This has absolutely no equivalent in the realm of topological spaces.

Substantial [[political violence]] existed in [[Germany]] from the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] through the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] until the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] to power in 1933 when a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi totalitarian state]] was formed and opposition figures were arrested.

Due to unrest left from the change of government from a monarchy, based on social standing, to a democratic republic, the people of Germany turned to riots and violence. The drastic change allowed for mobility amongst the classes and new voices to be heard. Many large cities, especially Berlin, experienced political rallies which resulted in violence from opposition. The quick overturn of leaders also influenced crises in the interwar period. Ultimately the National socialists took advantage of the radical setting of Germany but leading to this there was great amounts of political violence.

A '''push present''' is a [[gift|present]] a partner gives to the birthing mother to mark the occasion of her giving birth to their child. In practice the present may be given before or after the birth, or even in the delivery room. The giving of push presents has supposedly grown in the United States in recent years.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/fashion/06push.html?ex=1354683600&amp;en=5f57797f8bd491d0&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=A Bundle of Joy Isn't Enough?|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 6, 2007|author=[[Thomas Vinciguerra]]|accessdate=2004-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''push gift'' is any type of present loved ones give to a woman who has recently given birth to a child. There is no conclusive evidence that the present was invented by the jewelry industry to sell more goods,&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; and until recently it was passed on largely by word of mouth or peer pressure among both mothers and fathers.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,99962,00.html|date=October 14, 2003|title='Push Presents' Expected from Expectant Fathers|author= Catherine Donaldson-Evans|work=[[Fox News]].com|accessdate=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Linda Murray, the executive editor of [[BabyCenter]], "It's an expectation of moms these days that they deserve something for bearing the burden for nine months, getting sick, ruining their body. The guilt really gets piled on."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Other sources trace the development of the present to the increased assertiveness of women, allowing them to ask for a present more directly, or the increased involvement of the men in pregnancy, making them more informed of the pain and difficulty of pregnancy and labor.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Frequency==
A 2004 survey of over 30,000 respondents by BabyCenter found that 38% of new mothers received a push present, and 55% of pregnant mothers wanted one, though fewer thought it was actually expected. About 40% of both groups said the baby itself was already a present and did not wish an additional reward.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 

The popularity of push presents has been attributed in part to media coverage of celebrities receiving them. Examples include a 10 carat diamond ring given to celebrity stylist [[Rachel Zoe]] by her husband Rodger after the 2011 birth of their son, a [[Bentley]] given to [[reality TV]] star [[The Real Housewives of Orange County#Peggy Tanous|Peggy Tanous]] of ''[[The Real Housewives of Orange County]]'' by her husband Micah after the 2007 birth of their daughter, and a diamond and sapphire necklace given to singer [[Mariah Carey]] by her husband [[Nick Cannon]] after the 2011 birth of their twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metz|first=Lauren|title=Rachel Zoe Sparkles with 10 Carat Push Present|url=http://origin.www.bravotv.com/blogs/the-dish/rachel-zoe-sparkles-with-10-carat-push-present|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Bravo TV|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel Zoe: I’m Happier Than I’ve Ever Been|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2011/05/05/rachel-zoe-im-happier-than-ive-ever-been/?xid=rss-topheadlines|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=People magazine Celebrity Babies|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrity Moms &amp; The Push Presents That Made Labor Bearable|url=http://uptownmagazine.com/2012/05/celebrity-moms-the-push-presents-that-made-labor-bearable-photos/2/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Uptown|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend has generated a backlash, as some couples dislike the implicit materialism of push presents, and would prefer increased help in chores or baby care, or save the money for the child's education.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

According to [[etiquette]] expert Pamela Holland, there are no set guidelines for push presents. "The standard is that there is no standard," she said. "It does make sense to have etiquette around wedding or baby shower gifts because you're inviting other people into it. But this is far too intimate to have a rule."&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; In general it is the woman who lets her man know about push presents, not the other way around,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; although there can be peer pressure from friends to buy one on either the man or the woman.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

Analysis of conversations on parenting website the BabyCentre's online community over the last three years found that mentions of push presents had increased by 41 per cent in the past 18 months, compared to only a two per cent increase between 2011 and 2012. A poll of 1,200 BabyCentre mothers also revealed that more than a quarter (27 per cent) were expecting, or had already received, a 'push present' this year. Diamonds were the most popular gift in the form of an [[eternity ring]] with the prices spent ranging from £500 to £1475. Tablet computers, charm bracelets and designer watches and handbags were also popular gifts to celebrate a new arrival.

[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1897).svg|thumb|Rastas often claim the [[flag of Ethiopia]] as was used during Haile Selassie's reign. It combines the conquering lion of Judah, symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]
'''Rastafari''', sometimes termed '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] and related fields have classified it as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]]. There is no centralized authority in control of the movement and much heterogeneity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastas refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]], as "Rastalogy". Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God—referred to as [[Jah]]—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, [[Haile Selassie]], is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the [[Second Coming of Christ]].  Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses its attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or "Babylon". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the [[Promised Land]] of "Zion". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as "[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]". Communal meetings are known as "groundations", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter being regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.

Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement has survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.

The Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or "[[Mansions of Rastafari]]", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. The majority of practitioners are of black African descent, although a minority come from other racial groups.

==Definition==

[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} a [[new social movement]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} or as a [[social movement]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=136}} The scholar of religion Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the sociologist Ernest Cashmore as a [[cult]],{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} while scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} 
Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} the scholar of religion Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an "authentic" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}}
Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was "emerging" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71–72}}
Many Rastas themselves, however, do not regard it as a religion, instead referring to it as a "way of life".{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92}}&lt;ref name=Glazier&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen D. Glazier|authorlink1=Stephen D. Glazier|editor1-last=Juergensmeyer|editor1-first=Mark K.|editor2-last=Roof|editor2-first=Wade Clark|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761927297|page=614|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B105DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA614&amp;dq=Rastafari+spiritual%7Creligion+%22way+of+life%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Rastafari%20spiritual%7Creligion%20%22way%20of%20life%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2017|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that—for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]—Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158–160}} 

The term "Rastafari" derives from the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie; the term "Ras" means a duke or prince, while "Tafari Makonen" was his name.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=32}} It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name as the basis of their religion's name.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Many commentators—including some academic sources{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1pp=2, 103|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=152}}—refer to the movement as "Rastafarianism".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=8}} This term has also been used by some practitioners.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=187}} However, "Rastafarianism" is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of "isms" or "ians" (which they see as a typical part of "[[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]]" culture), dislike being labelled as an "ism" or "ian" themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen D. Glazier]], ''Encyclopedia of African and African-American Religions'', 2001, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as "insensitive".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=8–9}}

Rastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}}

==Beliefs==

[[File:Liberty Bell Temple 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Liberty Bell Temple in [[Los Angeles]] was established by [[Ed Forchion]]]]
Rastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as "Rastalogy".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} The scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds described Rastafari as having "a fairly cohesive worldview";{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} however, Cashmore thought that its beliefs were "fluid and open to interpretation".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=v}} Because it has no systematic theology or highly developed institutions, the sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]] stated that it was "extremely difficult to generalise" about Rastas and their beliefs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=49}} Based on his research in Ghana, the scholar of religion Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of "a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''" displaying a "shifting eclecticism".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history.{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a [[catechism]] or [[creed]] within the movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}}

Emphasis is placed on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=49–50, 63}} No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and which are [[heterodox]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}} The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma "is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma", according to Clarke.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}}

Rastafari belief is deeply influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=111|2a1=Sibanda|2y=2016|2p=183}} It accords the [[Bible]] a central place in its belief system, regarding it as a holy book,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=14|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=74|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=184}} and adopts a [[Biblical literalism|literalist interpretation]] of its contents.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} Rastas regard the Bible as an authentic account of early black history and their place as God's favoured people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} They believe that the Bible was originally written on stone in the Ethiopian language of [[Amharic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=64|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=127}} For Rastas, the Bible is therefore viewed as the key to understanding the past and the present and for predicting the future.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} It is also regarded as a source book from which they can form their religious practices.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=127}} The Bible's final book, the [[Book of Revelation]], is widely regarded as the most important part for Rastas, having a particular significance for their situation.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=73}}

However, Rastas also believe that the true meaning of the Bible has been warped, both through mistranslation into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those who wanted to deny black Africans their history.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=74|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=64|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127}} They also regard it as cryptographic, meaning that it has many hidden meanings.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=74}} They believe that its true teachings can be revealed through intuition and meditation with the "book within".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} As a result of what they regard as the corruption of the Bible, Rastas also turn to other sources that they believe shed light on black African history.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}} Common texts used for this purpose include [[Leonard Howell]]'s 1935 work ''[[The Promised Key]]'', [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]]' 1924 book ''[[Holy Piby]]'', and [[Fitz Balintine Pettersburg]] 1920s work, the ''[[Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy]]''.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}}

===Jah Rastafari and Jesus of Nazareth===

Rastafari are [[monotheism|monotheists]], worshiping a singular God whom they call [[Jah]]. Rastas view Jah in the form of the [[Holy Trinity]] – [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The term "Jah" is a shortened version of "[[Jehovah]]", the name of God in English translations of the Old Testament.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=24|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=83}}

As well as regarding Jah as a deity, Rastas also believe that Jah is inherent within each human individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=6|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=12}} This belief is reflected in the aphorism, often cited by Rastas, that "God is man and man is God".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Due to the view that God exists within everyone, Rastas believe that all members of the religion are intrinsically connected, and thereby regard statements like "you and I" as being insignificant.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=175}}
As a result, Rastas speak of "knowing" Jah, rather than simply "believing" in him.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=65}} In seeking to narrow the distance between humanity and divinity, Rastafari embraces [[mysticism]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}}  In believing that human beings have an inner divinity within themselves, Rastas help to cultivate a bastion against the uncertainty and insecurity that exists within society and societal institutions.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=12}}

[[Jesus of Nazareth]] is an important figure in Rastafari.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} However, practitioners reject the traditional depiction of Jesus present in Christianity, particularly the depiction of him as a white European, believing that this is a perversion of the truth.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=106}} They believe that Jesus was a black African and that he was a Rasta.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} Christianity is treated with suspicion out of the view that the oppressors and the oppressed cannot share the same God,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} with many Rastas taking the view that the God worshipped by most white Christians is actually [[the Devil]].{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} Rastas therefore often view Christian preachers as deceivers,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and regard Christianity as being guilty of furthering the oppression of the African diaspora,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=46}} often referring to it as having perpetrated "mental enslavement".{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=175}} One recurring saying among Rastafari is that "The Pope is Satan".{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=93}} Jesus is given particular prominence among a Rastafari denomination known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Rastas belonging to this group refer to Jesus as Yahshua and Yesus Kritos, and believe that his second coming is imminent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Accordingly, they do not share the view of other Rastas that Haile Selassie was the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}}

===Haile Selassie===

From Rastafari's origins, the religion was intrinsically linked with Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, who ruled as Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974.{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=960|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=32}} He remains the central symbolic figure in Rastafari ideology,{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=94}} and although all Rastas hold him in esteem, precise interpretations of his identity differ.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=34}} The Makonnen dynasty, of which Haile Selassie was a member, claimed descent from the Biblical figures [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]], a belief that many Rastas share.{{sfnm|1a1=Soumahoro|1y=2007|1p=44|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=960}} However, historians agree that this alleged [[Solomonic dynasty|"Solomonic" lineage]] was broken multiple times in history, and probably a 13th-century [[invented tradition]] to justify [[Yekuno Amlak]]'s new reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Briggs |first=Philip |date=2015 |title=Ethiopia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |page=46 |isbn=9781841629223 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understandings of how Haile Selassie relates to Jesus differ among Rastas.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} Many, although not all, view the Ethiopian king as [[Second Coming]] of Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2pp=961, 964}} In this, Haile Selassie is also believed to be the [[messiah]] predicted in the Biblical [[Old Testament]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=15–16, 66|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=966|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=32–33}} and as the manifestation of God in human form,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=34}} and therefore "the living God".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=65|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=264}} Some perceive him as part of a [[Trinity]], alongside God as Creator and the [[Holy Spirit]], which is sometimes referred to among Rastas as "the Breath within the temple".{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=36}} Among those Rastas claiming a link between the two figures, some point to the belief that both Jesus and Haile Selassie were descendants from the royal line of [[David]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}}  Rastas also cite their interpretation of chapter 19 in the Book of Revelation.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} 

Other Rastas see Selassie as embodying Jesus' teachings and essence but not being the reincarnated Jesus himself.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=964}} From this perspective, Haile Selassie is perceived as a messenger or emissary of God rather than a manifestation of God himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Middleton|1y=2006|1p=159|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=34}} This attitude may be more pervasive among Rastas living in Africa itself, who are more familiar with the realities of the continent's political problems.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=59}} Rastas holding to this view sometimes regard the deification of Haile Selassie as naïve or ignorant;{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=59}} there are various Rastas who went from believing that Haile Selassie was both God incarnate and the Second Coming of Jesus to seeing him as something distinct.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=968}}

[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by Rastas to be the reincarnation of Christ.]]
On being crowned, Haile Selassie was given the title of "King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastas use this title for Haile Selassie alongside others, such as "Almighty God", "Judge and Avenger", "King Alpha and Queen Omega", "Returned Messiah", "Elect of God", and "Elect of Himself".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=66}} Rastas also view Haile Selassie as a symbol of their positive affirmation of Africa as a source of spiritual and cultural heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}}

During the 1960s, many Jamaican Rastas professed the belief that Haile Selassie would never die.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=36}} The 1974 overthrow of Haile Selassie by the military [[Derg]] and his subsequent death in 1975 resulted in a crisis of faith for many Rastas.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=59|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=36–37}} Some practitioners left the movement altogether.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=63}} Others remained, and developed new strategies for dealing with the news. Some Rastas believed that Selassie did not really die and that claims to the contrary were Western misinformation.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=60|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37|3a1=Middleton|3y=2006|3p=158}} To bolster their argument, they pointed to the fact that no corpse had been produced; in reality, Haile Selassie's body had been buried beneath a toilet in his palace, remaining undiscovered there until 1992.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} To support their claim of his continued survival, some Rastas claimed that Selassie was now living under a new name, Abba Keddus or Abba Keddus Keddus Keddus.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah, ''Rastafari – The New Creation'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective within Rastafari acknowledged that Haile Selassie's body had perished, but claimed that his inner essence survived as a spiritual force.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=60|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=253|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=37}} A third response within the Rastafari community was that Selassie's death was inconsequential as he had only been a "personification" of Jah rather than Jah himself.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=60}}

During his life, Selassie described himself as a devout Christian.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}}
In a 1967 interview when a Canadian interviewer mentioned the Rastafari belief that he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=William David|title=Dread Jesus|date=1998|publisher=SPCK Publishing|isbn=978-0281051014|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; he responded by saying: "I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity." His grandson [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] has said that there is "no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement".&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacLeod|first1=Erin C.|title=Visions of Zion: Ethiopians and Rastafari in the Search for the Promised Land|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-1479882243|pages=70–71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yN9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22I+also+met+certain+Rastafarians.+I+told+them+clearly+that+I+am+a+man,+that+I+am+mortal,+and+that+I+will+be+replaced+by+the+oncoming+generation,+and+that+they+should+never+make+a+mistake+in+assuming+or+pretending+that+a+human+being+is+emanated+from+a+deity.#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20also%20met%20certain%20Rastafarians.%20I%20told%20them%20clearly%20that%20I%20am%20a%20man%2C%20that%20I%20am%20mortal%2C%20and%20that%20I%20will%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20oncoming%20generation%2C%20and%20that%20they%20should%20never%20make%20a%20mistake%20in%20assuming%20or%20pretending%20that%20a%20human%20being%20is%20emanated%20from%20a%20deity.&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} However, critics of the religion have insisted that Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

===Afrocentrism, Babylon, and Zion===

[[File:Ethiopia (Africa orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|The eastern African nation of Ethiopia is given great prominence in Rasta doctrine]]
According to Clarke, Rastafari is "concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica, while at the same time making a determined effort to create an identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}} Rastas equate blackness with the African continent and thus endorse a form of [[Pan-Africanism]].{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} Practitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient [[Israelites]]—God's chosen people in the [[Old Testament]]—and believe that black Africans or Rastas are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=129|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=17|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=111|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=38}}
Rastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of feelings of inferiority.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}

Rastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in "Babylon", a term applied to [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} For Rastas, European [[colonialism]] and global [[capitalism]] are regarded as manifestations of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=38–40}} while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=175–176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=40}} The term "Babylon" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} In the [[New Testament]], "Babylon" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}

For Rastas, Babylon is regarded as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} Rastas regard the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term "suffering" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism "Chant down Babylon".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Practitioners are often critical of Western resource extraction from Africa, seeing it as a form of exploitation akin to the Atlantic Slave Trade.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, again regarding this as a Babylonian development.{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} Rastas often expect white-dominated society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens it is seen as confirmation of the correctness of their faith, thus strengthening their convictions.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=77}}

[[File:Ethiopia - Location Map (2013) - ETH - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|left|Map of Ethiopia, the "Zion" of the Rastas]]
Rastas view "[[Zion]]" as an ideal to which they aspire.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} As with "Babylon", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} In doing so, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

By the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change in view was influenced by observation of the [[1983-1985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42}} The term "liberation before repatriation" began to be used within the movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=33|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=172|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=42}} Some Rastas seek to transform Western society so that they may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of "Ethiopia"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within "Ethiopia".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}

There is no uniform Rasta view on race.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's [[chosen people]], meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} This is similar to beliefs in [[Judaism]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Influenced by Garvey, many Rastas endorse [[black supremacy]], believing the black African race to be superior to other racial groups.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} This has opened the religion up to accusations of [[racism]] from its critics, including black Jamaicans.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=149|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=81}} Cashmore noted that there was an "implicit potential" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not "intrinsic" to the religion.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=150}} Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European could ever be a legitimate Rasta,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} while others believe that an "African" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African "attitude" or "spirit".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}}

====Salvation and paradise====

Rastafari has been characterised as a [[Millenarianism|millenarianist]] movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=7–8|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=248–249}} for it espouses the idea that the present age will come to an apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11}} With Babylon destroyed, Rastas believe that humanity will be ushered into a "new age".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=129}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that this would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} In this Day of Judgement, Babylon will be overthrown,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}} and Rastas would be the chosen few who survive.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=134}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in Daniel 2: 31–32.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}
In Rasta belief, the end of this present age would be followed by a millennium of peace, justice, and happiness in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11}} The righteous will live in paradise in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}} Those who had supported Babylon will be denied access to paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}}
The Rasta conception of salvation has similarities with that promoted in [[Judaism]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}}

Rastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to go through a process of [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's identity remaining throughout each of their incarnations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=76}}
Barrett observed some Jamaican Rastas who believed that those Rastas who did die had not been faithful to Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}}
In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=75}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional religion]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=73}}

===Morality, ethics, and gender roles===

[[File:Rasta Man Barbados.jpg|thumb|Rastaman in [[Barbados]], wearing the Rastafari colours of green, gold, red and black on a [[rastacap]].]]
Most Rastas share a pair of fundamental moral principles known as the "two great commandments".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=79}} These are love of God and love of neighbour.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=79}} Rastafari promotes the idea of "living naturally",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the "natural" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and as a result have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}}

Rastafari promotes what it regards as the restoration of black manhood, believing that men in the African diaspora have been emasculated by Babylon.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=178|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=96}} Rastafari espouses [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] principles,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=13|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=241|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=95}} and promotes the idea that women should submit to male leadership.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=96}} External observers—including scholars like Cashmore and Edmonds{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=178|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=95}}—have claimed that Rastafari accords women an inferior position to men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure during their period of [[menstruation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Rastafari mirrored the views on gender which were common in Jamaican society more broadly;{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=87}} however, it has retained its commitment to patriarchy while Jamaican society has moved toward greater gender equity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical passages, particularly those in the [[Book of Leviticus]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} and in the writings of [[Paul the Apostle]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}}

Rasta women usually wear clothing that covers their head and masks their body contours, in a manner akin to [[hijab|traditional Islamic clothing]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Long skirts are usually worn rather than trousers,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} and women are expected to cover their head while praying.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=15}} Rasta discourse legitimises this female dress code with the claim that it is necessary to prevent women attracting men; it also endorses this female dress code as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}

[[File:Rasta Shop – Seaside, Oregon.jpg|thumb|left|Rasta Shop, Oregon]]
As it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari was not monogamous.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted to have multiple female sex partners, while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=38|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88}} although there are many Rastas who are legally married.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=78–79}} Rasta men refer to their female partners as "queens",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=79|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=109}} or "empresses",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}} while the males in these relationships are known as "kingmen".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87–88}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=103–104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at home.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Rastafari typically rejects [[feminism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1pp=178–179|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87}} although since the 1970s there have been increasing numbers of Rasta women calling for greater gender equity within the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=107}} Clarke encountered Rasta women in Britain who expressed feminist sentiment and criticised [[sexism]] within the religion,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=87}} while the scholar Terisa E. Turner encountered black feminists in Kenya who were appropriating Rastafari and redefining its content to suit their political agenda.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=86}} Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}}

Both [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] are usually censured by Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=79|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=209|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=99}} and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth-rate.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=37|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=100|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=192}} Rastas also typically express [[homophobia|hostile attitudes to homosexuality]], regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural;{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=79|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3pp=180, 181, 191}} this attitude derives from [[The Bible and homosexuality|references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible]].{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} In the 1960s, the scholar Sheila Kitzinger suggested that this horror of homosexuality "may be an indication of a heterosexuality which is not markedly pronounced" among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=35}} The scholar of religion Fortune Sibanda suggested that there were likely homosexual Rastas who deliberately concealed their sexual orientation because of these attitudes.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}} Rastas typically see the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in Western society as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon as it approaches its apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=178–179}}

Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas do not typically vote and derogatorily dismiss politics as "politricks".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} Similarly, some Ghanaian Rastas were reported as refusing to vote in the [[Ghanaian general election, 2000|2000 general election]], believing that salvation would only come through livity, not political activity.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=164}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the political left that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=175–176, 179}} Most of these Jamaican practitioners have rejected both [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] as models of economic development.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=225}} Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance has been involved in campaigns promoting [[social justice]], [[environmental justice]], and democratic elections.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165–167}} In the example of Grenada, many Rastas joined the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which was formed in 1979, although Marxist-Leninist factions later turned against them.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=205}}

==Practices==

The cultural and religious practices of Rastafari are referred to as "livity" by Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}}
Rastafari has no professional priesthood,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}} There are individuals who are regarded as elders within the community.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} This is an honorific title bestowed upon those who have attained a good reputation among Rastas because of their exemplary conduct.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities among Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}}

===Grounding===

[[File:Rastafarians celebrate Marcus Garvey.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rastas in the West African country of Liberia]]
The term "grounding" is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} The elder is charged with keeping discipline in the group, and can ban those who contravene the rules that they set forth.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Most groundings contain only men, with women being excluded.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}} Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}}

One of the central activities that takes place at groundings is "[[reasoning (Rastafari)|reasoning]]".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments that are presented.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=56–57}} Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=57}} Cashmore observed that in England, Rastas arrived and left throughout the reasoning session.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=10–11}} In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

Rastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} Barrett suggested that the most common example had "all the structure of a classical ritual prayer".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} This prayer involves supplication of God, the supplication for the hungry, sick, and infants, calls for the destruction of the Rastas' enemies, and then closes with statements of adoration.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Princes shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hand unto God. Oh thou God of Ethiopia, thou God of divine majesty, thy spirit come within our hearts to dwell in the parts of righteousness. That the hungry be fed, the sick nourished, the aged protected, and the infant cared for.

The largest groundings were known as "groundations" or "grounations" in the 1950s, although were subsequently re-termed "Nyabinghi Issemblies".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=58–59}} The term [[Nyabinghi]] is adopted from the name of a mythical African queen.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=59}} Several dates are often selected for Nyabinghi Issemblies, particularly those associated with Ethiopia and Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}} These include Ethiopian Christmas (7 January), the day on which Haile Selassie visited Jamaica (21 April), Selassie's birthday (23 July), Ethiopian New Year (11 September), Selassie's coronation day (2 November).{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}} Some Rastas also organise Nyabinghi Issemblies to mark Jamaica's Emancipation Day (1 August) and [[Marcus Garvey]]'s birthday (17 August).{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}}

Nyabinghi Issemblies typically take place in rural areas, being situated in the open air or in temporary structures—known as "temples" or "tabernacles"—which are specifically constructed for the purpose.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} Any elder seeking to sponsor a Nyabinghi Issembly must have approval from other elders to do so, and requires the adequate resources to organise such an event.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=60–61}} The assembly usually lasts between three and seven days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} During the daytime, those Rastas attending the event engage in food preparation, ganja smoking, and reasoning, while at night they focus on drumming and dancing around bonfires.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}}
Nyabinghi Issemblies often attract Rastas from a wide area, including from different countries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} They establish and maintain a sense of solidarity among the Rasta community and cultivate a feeling of collective belonging.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} They also help to confirm Rastas' convictions in the veracity of Rastafari teaching.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}}

===Spiritual use of cannabis{{anchor|Cannabis}}===

{{See also|Cannabis and religion}}
[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|right|Rastafari man carrying a basket]]
Clarke stated that the "principle ritual" of Rastafari was the smoking of ganja, or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} Among the names that Rastas give to the plant are ''callie'', ''Iley'', "the herb", "the grass", and "the weed".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} When smoked in ritual contexts, Rastas often refer to it as "the holy herb".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} In addition to smoking it, Rastas also ingest cannabis in a tea, as a spice in cooking, and as an ingredient in medicine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}}
Cannabis is usually smoked during groundings,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} although some Rastas smoke it almost all of the time.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}} Others have criticised this practice, believing that use of the drug should be restricted to groundings.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}}
However, not all Rastas use ganja,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Benard|2y=2007|2p=90|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=53}} explaining that they have already achieved a higher level of consciousness and thus do not require it.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}}

Rastas argue that the use of ganja is promoted in the Bible, specifically in Genesis 1: 29, Psalms 18:8, and Revelation 22:2.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=89|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=48}} Rastas portray cannabis as the supreme herb,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}} and regard it as having healing properties.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=89|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=48, 55}} They also eulogise it for inducing feelings of "peace and love" in those taking it,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}} and claim that it cultivates a form of personal introspection that allows the smoker to discover their inner divinity, or "InI consciousness".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=49, 55}} Some Rastas express the view that cannabis smoke serves as an incense that counteracts perceived immoral practices, such as same-sex sexual relations, in society.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}}

When meeting in a grounding, Rastas typically remove their head gear first.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} Rastas most often smoke cannabis through a form of large cigarette known as a [[spliff]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=130|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56}} This is often rolled together while a prayer is offered to Jah; only once this is completed is the spliff then lit, enabling it to be smoked.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} At other times, cannabis is smoked not in a spliff but in a [[bong|water pipe]] referred to as a "chalice".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} There are different styles of chalices used by Rastas, including [[kutchie]]s, [[chillum (pipe)|chillum]]s, and [[steamer (appliance)|steamer]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} The pipe is passed in a counter-clockwise direction around the assembled circle of Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}}

[[File:Cannabis Plant.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A flowering cannabis plant]]
By the 8th century, cannabis had been introduced by Arab traders to Central and Southern Africa, where it is known as "[[Cannabis sativa|dagga]]"&lt;ref&gt;Hamid, ''The Ganjah Complex: Rastafari and Marijuana'', introduction, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; and many Rastas say it is a part of their African culture that they are reclaiming.&lt;ref&gt;''Chanting Down Babylon'', p. 130 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes also referred to as "the healing of the nation", a phrase adapted from Revelation 22:2.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Chevannes, ''Rastafari and Other African-Caribbean Worldviews'', pp. 35, 85; Edmonds, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various methods of transmission that might explain how cannabis smoking came to be part of Rastafari. One possible source was the African diasporic religion of [[Kumina]], based on the practices of [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] enslaved people and [[indentured labourers]] who were brought to Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica's [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|Saint Thomas Parish]], where a prominent early Rasta, [[Leonard Howell]], lived during the period he was developing many of Rastafari's beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}

A second possible source was the use of cannabis in various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought the use of cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} One Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} It is also possible that its adoption was also influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91–92}}

According to many Rastas, the [[Legal issues of cannabis|illegality of cannabis]] in many nations is evidence of [[persecution of Rastafari]]. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth&amp;nbsp;– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=128}}

===Music===

[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the Lion of Judah]]
Rastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} In performing it, Rastas also reaffirm their rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}

The bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}

As Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to the Rastafarians' social and political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like "Another Moses" and "Babylon Gone" reflecting this Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as "Reincarnation" and "Tribute to Marcus Garvey".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}
Rasta ideas began to feature in the lyrics of [[mento]] songs, such as [[Lord Lebby]]'s "Ethiopia".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=115}} 

1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than had previously been present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' "[[African Herbsman]]" and "Kaya", and [[Peter Tosh]]'s "Legalize It" referenced marijuana use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' "[[Rivers of Babylon]]" and [[Junior Byles]]' "Beat Down Babylon" referenced the Rastafarian belief in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Its popularity led to the emergence of "pseudo-Rastafarians", individuals who adopted the cultural trappings of Rastafari—such as dreadlocks and marijuana use—without sharing the religion's beliefs.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their faith.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two have come to be widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection between them is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]]; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}

===Language and symbolism===

{{Main|Rastafari vocabulary}}
In the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as "dreadtalk", developed among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}}
Rastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=92–93}} They believe that the [[English language]] is a tool of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=46}} and thus by formulating their own language are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the English language.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish themselves from non-Rastas,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} for whom—according to Barrett—Rasta rhetoric can be "meaningless babbling".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=103}}

[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975–1987).svg|thumb|left|Garvey adopted the three colours of the Ethiopian flag for his movement; Rastas in turn adopted the tricolour]]
When greeting one another, Rastas often say "Peace and Love".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=269}} Rastas make wide use of the pronoun "I".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=45}} The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=2, 38}} It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} For instance, Rastas use "I" in place of "me", "I and I" in place of "we", "I-ceive" in place of "receive", "I-sire" in place of "desire", "I-rate" in place of "create", and "I-men" in place of "[[Amen]]".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas refer to this process as "InI Consciousness" or "Isciousness".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as "Haile Selassie I", thus indicating their belief in his divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} Rastas also typically believe that the [[phonetics]] of a word should be linked to its meaning.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} For instance, Rastas often use the word "downpression" in place of "oppression" because oppression bears ''down'' on people rather than lifting them ''up'', with "up" being phonetically akin to the "opp-".{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=xx|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} Similarly, they often favour "livicate" over "dedicate" because "ded-" is phonetically akin to the word "dead".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}}

Rastafarians often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Red, gold, and green were used in the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] while, prior to the development of Rastafari, Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his [[United Negro Improvement Association]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=159|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143|3a1=White|3y=2010|3p=307}} According to Garvey, the red symbolises the blood of martyrs, the black symbolises the skin of Africans, and the green represents the vegetation of the land.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=160|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143}} Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the Lion of Judah, also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}

===Diet===
{{Main|Ital}}

[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast; ackee, plantain, boiled food, breadfruit, and mango-pineapple juice]]
Rastas seek to produce food "naturally",{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} eating what they call [[ital]], or "natural" food.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=141|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} This is often produced [[Organic farming|organically]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} and locally.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} Most Rastas adhere to the [[kosher|dietary laws]] outlined in the Old Testament's [[Book of Leviticus]], and thus avoid eating pork or crustaceans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=49}} Other Rastas remain totally [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=49|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} and also avoid the addition of any additives, including sugar and salt, to their food.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=141|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=49|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} Rasta dietary practices have come under ridicule from non-Rastas; in Ghana for example, where food traditionally includes a high meat content, the Rastas' emphasis on vegetable produce has led to the humorous comment from other Ghanaians that Rastas "eat like sheep and goats".{{sfn|White|2010|p=309}} In Jamaica, Rasta practitioners have commercialised ital food, for instance by selling fruit juices prepared according to Rasta custom.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=267}}

Rastafarians typically avoid food produced by non-Rastas or from unknown sources.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=85|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=142|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=48}} Rasta men also refuse to eat food prepared by a woman while she was menstruating.{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=142}} They also avoid [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=85|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=131}} [[cigarettes]],{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=131|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=48}} and hard drugs such as [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}}

===Dreadlocks===

{{Main|Dreadlocks}}
[[File:Dreadlocked rasta.jpg|thumb|right|Rasta man with tuff dreads]]
Through their use of language, dress, dreaded hair, and lifestyle Rastas seek to draw a clear boundary between themselves and non-Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} One of the "distinguishing mark[s] of the movement" is the formation of hair into [[dreadlocks]].{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} The formation of dreadlocks is Biblically inspired, legitimised by reference to the [[Book of Numbers]] (6: 5–6).{{sfnm |1a1= Clarke|1y= 1986|1p=89|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=137|3a1=Edmonds |3y= 2012|3p=43}} They are regarded as marking a covenant that the Rastas have made with God,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}} and are also regarded as a symbol of strength linked to the hair of the Biblical figure of [[Samson]].{{sfnm |1a1=Clarke|1y=1986 |1p= 90 |2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=137}}  Sometimes this dreadlocked hair is then shaped and styled, often inspired by a lion's mane symbolising Haile Selassie, who is regarded as "the Conquering [[Lion of Judah]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=90 |2a1= Edmonds |2y=2012|2pp= 44, 45}} For Rastas, the wearing of dreads is a symbolic rejection of Babylon and a refusal to conform to its norms and standards regarding grooming aesthetics.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=157|2a1=Clarke |2y= 1986 |2p= 90|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=42}} They also reflect a commitment to the Rasta idea of 'naturalness'.{{sfn|Edmonds |2012 |p=44}} Rastas are often critical of black people who straighten their hair, believing that it is an attempt to imitate white European hair and thus reflects alienation from a person's African identity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p= 44}}

There are Rastas who do not wear their hair in dreadlocks; within the religion they are often termed "cleanface" Rastas.{{sfn |Barrett|1997|p=140}} Some Rastas have also joined the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Christian organisation to which Haile Selassie belonged, and these individuals are required to not wear their hair in locks by the Church.{{sfnm |1a1= Cashmore |1y=1983|1pp=62–63|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=53}} Many Rastas also grow their beards long.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 92}}  In reference to Rasta hairstyles, Rastas often refer to non-Rastas as "baldheads",{{sfn |Edmonds|2012|p=45}} while those who are new to Rastafari and who have only just started to grow their hair into dreads are known as "nubbies".{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |p=140}} Members of the Bobo Ashanti sect of Rastas conceal their dreadlocks within turbans.{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |pp= 257–58}} The [[tam o' shanter (cap)|tam]] headdress worn by many Rastas is coloured green, red, black, and yellow to symbolise allegiance and identification with Ethiopia.{{sfn |Clarke |1986|p= 13}}

From the beginning of the Rastafari movement in the 1930s, adherents typically grew beards and tall hair, perhaps in imitation of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} The wearing of hair as dreadlocks then emerged as a Rasta practice in the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Within the oral culture of the movement, there are various different claims as to how this practice was adopted.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} One claim is that it was adopted in imitation of certain African nations, such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Somalis]], or [[Oromo people|Oromo]], or that it was inspired by the hairstyles worn by some of those involved in the anti-colonialist [[Mau Mau Uprising]] in Kenya.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} An alternative explanation is that it was inspired by the hairstyles of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[sadhus]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp= 42–43}}

It has been suggested (e.g., Campbell 1985) that the first Rasta locks were copied from Kenya in 1953, when images of the independence struggle of the feared [[Mau Mau Uprising|''Mau Mau'' insurgents]], who grew their "dreaded locks" while hiding in the mountains, appeared in newsreels and other publications that reached Jamaica. However, a more recent study by Barry Chevannes&lt;ref&gt;Barry Chevannes, 1998, ''Rastafari and Other African-Caribbean Worldviews'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; has traced the first hairlocked Rastas to a subgroup first appearing in 1949, known as Youth Black Faith.

[[File:Rastafarian Man In Rasta Cap.jpg|thumb|left|Rastafari man in rastacap]]
The wearing of dreadlocks has faced opposition from other sectors of society; in Jamaica during the mid-20th century, teachers and police officers used to cut off the dreads of Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=139}}  In the United States, several public schools and workplaces have lost lawsuits as the result of banning locks. [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] is an early example, and the victory of eight children in a suit against their [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] school was a landmark decision in favor of Rastafari rights. More recently, in 2009, a group of Rastafari settled a federal lawsuit with the Grand Central Partnership in New York City, allowing them to wear their locks in neat ponytails, rather than be forced to "painfully tuck in their long hair" in their uniform caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| via = The Associated Press |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/08/08/2009-08-08_rastafarians_win_suit_allowing_them_to_bare_dreadlocks_at_work.html |title=Rastafarians win suit allowing them to bare dreadlocks at work | work =NY daily news |date= August 8, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-01 | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreadlocks remain socially stigmatised in many societies; in Ghana for example, they are often associated with the homeless mentally ill, with such associations of marginality extending onto Ghanaian Rastas.{{sfn|White|2010|p=310}}

Dreadlocks and Rastafari-inspired clothing have also been worn for aesthetic reasons by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p= 90}} For instance, many reggae musicians who do not adhere to the Rastafari religion wear their hair in dreads.{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |p= 245}}  Many non-Rastafari of African descent wear locks as an expression of pride in their ethnic identity, or simply as a hairstyle, and take a less purist approach to developing and grooming them. The wearing of dreads also has spread among people of other ethnicities. Locks worn for stylish reasons are sometimes referred to as "bathroom locks", to distinguish them from the kind that are purely natural. Rastafari purists also sometimes refer to such dreadlocked individuals as "wolves", as in "a wolf in sheep's clothing", especially when they are seen as trouble-makers who might potentially discredit or infiltrate Rastafari.&lt;ref&gt;''Chanting Down Babylon'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of dreadlocks has also contributed to the negative view of Rastafari held by many non-Rastas, who regard it as wild and unattractive.{{sfn|Barrett |1997|p= ix}}

== History ==

The Rastafari movement developed out of the legacy of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], in which over ten million Africans were enslaved and transported from Africa to the Americas between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} On the island, the enslaved Africans were divided into a stratified system, with field workers on the lowest rung and house servants above them.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}} With slavery abolished, formerly enslaved Africans and Afro-Jamaicans became free peasants.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} In the three decades after emancipation, the [[Free Villages|Free Village]] system proliferated across Jamaica as non-conformist missionaries, particularly Baptist, purchased land from the large owners and sold it as smaller plots to former slaves.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=4}}

Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860–61.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans—who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions—to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}

===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===

[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Garvey, a prominent African nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]
According to the scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from "the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to "intellectual and conceptual frameworks" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain "fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} 

In the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29–34|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75–76|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54–56}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32–33}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}

Also spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, "Ethiopia" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as "Ethiopian"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34–35}}

Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41–42}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}

A rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to "look to Africa" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38–39}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was "legendary".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as "a great coward" who rules a "country where black men are chained and flogged."{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;E. David Cronon, ''Black Moses'', University of Wisconsin Press, Madison (1955), 1966, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} with many Rastas regarding Garvey as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari "emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the "most important" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}

===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930–1949===

[[File:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|right|Selassie I in the 1930s]]
Emperor Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Christian clergymen, among them Leonard Percival Howell, Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert, Henry Archibald Dunkley, and Hinds, claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the [[Book of Revelation]] (5:2–5; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}} Clarke stated that "to all intents and purposes this was the beginning" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}}

Over the following years, a number of street preachers—most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]—began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett |1y= 1997 |1p=81|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=9}} Howell has been described as the "First Rasta",&lt;ref&gt;''The First Rasta: Leonard Howell and the Rise of Rastafarianism'', Helene Lee, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "leading figure" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn |Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm |1a1= Clarke |1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85–86 |3a1= Edmonds |3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p= 25 |2a1= Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86 |4a1= Edmonds |4y= 2012|4pp=13–14}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm |1a1= Cashmore |1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds |3y= 2012|3pp=14–15}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}

In 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p= 47|3a1= Barrett |3y= 1997 |3p= 89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the [[Book of Revelation]] (19:11–19).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 47}}

===Subsequent development: 1950–present===

Rastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}

[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]
In the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}
Backlash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became "folk devils" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28–29|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95–98|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=29–30|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=98–99|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=19–20}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}

At the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158–160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82–83|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing_charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}

Whereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as "Uptown Rastas".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25–26}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}} 

[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta vendor in the United States, 2013]]
In the mid-1970s, the international popularity of reggae exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who—according to Cashmore—"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} The popularity of reggae led to a growth in "pseudo-Rastafarians", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but whom did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by these developments, believing that the popularity of reggae had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Through reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to break from the past and move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=King|2y=2002|2pp=105, 108–111}} Manley described Rastas as a "beautiful and remarkable people",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the "rod of correction", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=2002|2pp=91–92|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121–122}}

Enthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and then that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastafarians in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful than Rastafari at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so—[[Judith Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]—maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29–30}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} Since the mid-1990s, however, there was a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which have attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30–31}}

==Organization==

Rastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Centralised and hierarchical structures are avoided by Rastas because they want to avoid replicating the formal structures of Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52–53}} Rastas also tend to avoid hierarchic and bureaucratic structures because of the ultra-individualistic ethos that the religion promotes with its ideas about inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}}

The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santeria]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to fashion a pan-Rasta unity movement, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88–89}}

===Mansions of Rastafari===

{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}
Within Rastafari, there are distinct groups which display particular orientations.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} There are often referred to as "houses" or "mansions", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states "In my father's house are many mansions".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}

====House of Nyabinghi====
The House of Nyabinghi is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was a manifestation of God and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to make any compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Bob Marley whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}} According to Cashmore, the Nyabinghi House is "vehemently anti-white".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} It is probably the largest Rastafari group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}

====Bobo Ashanti====
The Bobo Ashanti sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/boboshanti.shtml |title=Bobo Shanti (Bobo Shanti Congress or Ethiopia Black International Congress) |publisher=BBC |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards, who served as the group's high priest, until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} Male members of the group are divided into two categories: the "priests" who conduct religious services and the "prophets" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and thus are superior to white Europeans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Bob Ashanti practitioners will often refuse to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Members of this sect are recognisable by their attire, which include long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of Bob Ashanti Rastas have lived outside the Bull Bay commune, but continue to regard the latter as a place of [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}}

====Twelve Tribes of Israel====
The Twelve Tribes of Israel sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=227|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2pp=961, 962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/twelvetribes.shtml |title=Twelve Tribes of Israel |website=BBC |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded himself as the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], one of [[Jacob]]'s twelve sons, and his followers thus refer to him as "Prophet Gad", "Brother Gad", or "Gadman".{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=962|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity in its beliefs;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Barrett stated that there was "only a thin line dividing the sect from true Christianity".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=231}} Practitioners are often dubbed "Christian Rastas" because they believe Jesus is the messiah and only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which month in the [[Hebrew calendar]] they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66–67}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Some Rastas regarded the Twelve Tribes as a heretical group for its views.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} 

The Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term "middle-class Rastas" and "uptown Rastas" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961–962}}

====Church of Haile Selassie====
The Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68–69}} In [[New York (state)|New York]], the group have established prison chaplains.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}

====Fulfilled Rastafari====
Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus Christ through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America. It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa—for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal—and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=— Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}

As of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}}
Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}}

The Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that "whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance."{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}} Benard was of the view that because of its stances on capitalism, European hegemony, and white racism, Rastafari is "easily incorporated into other nations with similar histories of European oppression".{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=90}}
According to sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], Rastafari "helped to provide many people of African descent with a deeper sense of their African identity".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}

Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In the religion's early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94–95}}

===Conversion and deconversion===

Rastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go "trodding" to meet with newly converted Rastas in order to instruct them in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On examining the Rasta movement in England during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that Rastas had not converted instantaneously to the belief system, but rather had undergone "a process of drift" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of the central importance of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}}
Rastas often claim that—rather than [[religious conversion|converting]] to the religion—they were actually always a Rasta and that their actual embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}}

They regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the "insight" to recognise the importance of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Rastas often regard themselves as being the "enlightened ones" who have "seen the light".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57–58}} English Rastas have for instance expressed criticism of black Britons who have not embraced the religion, stating that they have been "brainwashed", "misguided by European Christianity", and "blinded by Babylon".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=38}}

Some Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among the British Rastas whom he communicated with, he found that some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some of these British ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rasta belief failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to the industrialised and materialistic society in the UK.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some of British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and musical outlets insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}

===Jamaica and the Caribbean===

Barrett described Rastafari as "the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica."{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}}
As of the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of the Rastafari movement in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of these individuals were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]] in order to "drink from the source".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}

In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified themselves as Rastafari.&lt;ref name="state2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimated that in the 2000s they formed "about 5% of the population" of Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters AlertNet ([[Reuters Foundation]]):[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/countryprofiles/216645.htm?v=details Jamaica] (citing "NI World Guide 2003/2004"); ''The world guide: a view from the south'', [[New Internationalist]] Publications, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=1ETNTK_bCtTNjAevpqzXBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=qertAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=rastafarians+per+cent#search_anchor p. 312] ("Rastafarians 5 per cent")&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaica's Rasta population were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most Jamaican Rastas remain Afro-Jamaican, it has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2–3}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although since that point it attracted many middle-class members.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} By the 1980s, there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=241}} The majority are male.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} These Rastas are predominantly ex-Christians.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=3}}

During the 1970s, Rastafari ideas were spread through much of the eastern Caribbean through the growing popularity of reggae.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} Rasta ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views then prevailing in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} A number of Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}}

Reggae was introduced to Cuba in the 1970s by Jamaican students.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}} By the 1980s, underground reggae parties were being held in Havana and Santiago.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}} Foreign Rastas who were studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with this reggae scene and helped to ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}}

===Africa===

Since the founding of Rastafari, some practitioners have followed through with their belief in resettlement in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} The West African states of Ghana and Nigeria have been particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Ghana's status as the first African country to gain independence from European colonial rule (in 1957) made it an attractive place for members of the African diaspora to migrate to; its first post-independence President, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], encouraged this as part of his Pan-African ethos. Among the Caribbean immigrants to arrive in the country during the 1960s were Rastafarians, while some native Ghanaians also converting to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306–307}} When asked as to why they chose Ghana as a new home, several of the Rasta arrivals described it as the "gateway to the continent";{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} others cited its political stability and affordability as making it ideal for settlement.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=160}} For his Pan-African efforts, Nkrumah has come to be regarded as a heroic figure among many Rastas, although other Ghanaians have been critical of what they perceive as excess idolisation of the former president.{{sfn|White|2010|p=313}} The largest congregation of Ghanaian Rastas has been in southern parts of the country, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana, especially in the towns of [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]] and [[Bolgatanga]].{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154–155}} Non-Ghanaian Rastas living in the country have nevertheless complained of social ostracism, unemployment, and legal prosecution for ganja possession;{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=161}} Ghanaians who were not Rastas often accuse the Rastas of being "drop-outs", "too Western", and "not African enough".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161–162}}

[[File:Rasta Mural, Sheshemane (11417146756).jpg|thumb|left|Rasta mural in Ethiopia]]
In the 1960s, a Rasta community established itself in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available for members of the African diaspora by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}

By the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}}
Several Rastafari orders have also been established in Zimbabwe, all of which send representatives to the Rastafari Association of Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}}

At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=225}}

===Western countries===

During the 1950s and 1960s, [[British African-Caribbean people|several thousand Caribbean migrants settled in the United Kingdom]], some of whom brought Rastafari with them.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=72}} In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in [[Brixton]], South London,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=54}} and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=56}} This social structure allowed for the promotion of in-gang associations and the restrictions of contacts with Babylon.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s as a result of reggae's popularity.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=74}} In that same decade it also faced increasing opposition, being regarded as a criminal sub-culture by both much of the press,{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} and by the police, resulting in complaints of police harassment.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=74–75}} 

According to Clarke's research, the majority are from black working-class families who practiced Pentecostalism, although a small number are from white families.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=53–54}} Cashmore found that the majority of British Rastas were male and that most had few or no educational qualifications.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=76, 78}} He also found that around 50% of them were unemployed, and 45% employed in manual occupations; only 5% were in more skilled jobs or higher education.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=70}} In 1986, there were an estimated 5000 Rastas living in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=14}} Clarke believed that there were "probably fewer members" at this time then there had been at the start of the 1980s, with the movement declining following Marley's death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=61}} According to the [[2001 United Kingdom Census]] there are about 5000 Rastafari living in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/ataglance/glance.shtml |title=Rastafari at a glance |publisher=BBC |date=October 2, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke described Rastafari as a numerically small but "extremely influential" component of black British life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}}

Rastafari was also established in various continental European countries, among them the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, and France, gaining a particular foothold among black migrant populations but also attracting a growing number of white converts.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=83}}
Rasta communities were also established in two French cities that had substantial black populations, [[Paris]] and [[Bordeaux]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=98}} In the Netherlands, it attracted converts within the [[Surinamese people in the Netherlands|Surinamese migrant community]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=173}}

Rastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} As with the case in the UK, American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded their religion as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}}

===Australasia and Asia===

Rastafari attracted membership from within the [[Māori people|Maori]] population of New Zealand,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=173|2a1=Benard|2y=2007|2p=90}} and the Aboriginal population of Australia.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=173}}

A small Rasta community developed in [[Japan]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/history/history.shtml |title=Religions – Rastafari: Rastafarian history |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by a practitioner named Jah Hiro.{{sfn|King|2002|p=101}}

The '''red hartebeest''' (''Alcelaphus buselaphus caama'' or ''A. caama'') is a species&lt;ref name="WilsonReeder2005"/&gt; of [[even-toed ungulate]] in the family [[Bovidae]] found in [[Southern Africa]]. More than 130,000 individuals live in the wild. The red [[hartebeest]] is closely related to the [[tsessebe]] and the [[topi]].

''Alcelaphus buselaphus caama'' is a large African [[antelope]] of the family Bovidae, one of ten subspecies;  it is sometimes treated as a separate species, ''A. caama''. Commonly known as the red hartebeest, it is the most colorful hartbeest, with black markings contrasting against its white abdomen and behind. It has a longer face that other subspecies, with complex curving horns joined at the base.&lt;ref name= "Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256130/hartebeest hartebeest]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The average weight of a male is about 150&amp;nbsp;kg, and female is 120&amp;nbsp;kg. Their average shoulder height is 135&amp;nbsp;cm, and horns are 60&amp;nbsp;cm long. The life expectancy of a red hartebeest is around 19 years.&lt;ref name="Red Hartebeest 2012"&gt;[http://www.smj-safaris.com/redhartebeest.htm Red Hartebeest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528214156/http://www.smj-safaris.com/redhartebeest.htm |date=28 May 2013 }}. SMJ Safaris. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little [[sexual dimorphism]] is noted between males and females, showing no distinct identifiable physical features, but body size is slightly affected. Horn size, however, expresses more dimorphism between males and females, as males fight and defend themselves for sexual selection. Thus, male skull weight and circumference is slightly greater than that of the female.&lt;ref name= "Dimorphism in hartebeest"&gt;Capellini, I. (2007). "Dimorphism in the hartebeest. Sex, size and gender roles: evolutionary studies of sexual size dimorphism", pp. 124–132, DJ Fairbairn, WU Blanckenhorn &amp; T. Szekely (Eds).&lt;/ref&gt;
Hartebeests have an excellent sense of hearing and smell, although their sense of sight is poor. When alarmed, hartebeests elude confusion before running, by which they can reach a maximum speed of 55&amp;nbsp;km/h. Their evasion tactic is to run in a zigzag pattern, making it difficult for predators to catch them.&lt;ref name="Guide to the: Red Hartebeest"&gt;[http://www.ecotravel.co.za/Guides/Wildlife/Vertebrates/Mammals/Large/Red_Hartebeest.htm A Guide to the: Red Hartebeest – ''Alcelaphus buselaphus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521062448/http://www.ecotravel.co.za/Guides/Wildlife/Vertebrates/Mammals/Large/Red_Hartebeest.htm |date=21 May 2013 }}. EcoTravel.co.za 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
=== Breeding ===
''A. buselaphus'' subspecies have a [[gestation]] period of eight months, and they give birth to single calves. They typically give birth in a seasonal pattern before the summer rain begins. After birth, calves are hidden in dense vegetation before joining a group to increase their chances of survival from predators, since they are weak.&lt;ref name= "Red Hartebeest"&gt;[http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa_red_hartebeest.html "Red Hartebeest"]. Kruger National Park.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most females begin breeding after the age of two, and can conceive again 9 or 10 months after giving birth.&lt;ref name="hartebeests"&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/hartebeest.shtml Hartebeest: Alcelaphus buselaphus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522091204/http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/hartebeest.shtml |date=22 May 2013 }}. ThinkQuest. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet ===
Red hartebeests are grass feeders, which is evidenced by their long snouts, which give the advantage of an improved cropping ability to acquire and [[Mastication|masticate]] grasses more efficiently. During the rainy season in southern Africa, the grass species ''[[Andropogon]]'' is in abundance and is the main source of dietary consumption.&lt;ref name= "diet of hartebeests"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schuette, J.|author2=Leslie, D.|author3=Lochmiller, R.|author4=Jenks, J.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1998|title= Diets of hartebeests and roan antelopes in Burkina Faso: Support of the long-faced hypothesis|journal= Journal of Mammalogy|volume= 79|issue=2|pages=426–436|jstor=1382973|doi=10.2307/1382973}}&lt;/ref&gt; As grazers, their diets fluctuate seasonally, as they consume higher-quality, green primary production in wet seasons, and lower-quality sheath material in the dry seasons.&lt;ref name= "Ecology of African Grazers"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McNaughton, S. |author2=Georgiadis, N. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.17.110186.000351|title=Ecology of African Grazing and Browsing Mammals|year=1986|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=17|pages=39-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartebeests are considered less water-dependent than most alcelaphines, only needing to drink water when melons and [[tuber]]s are inaccessible.&lt;ref name="Ecology of African Grazers" /&gt;

=== Predators ===
The few carnivores preying on hartebeests in southern Africa include [[lion]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[cheetah]]s. However, hartebeests are not the primary food source of any of these species, particularly spotted hyenas. Lions only consume hartebeests for about 7% of their diets, hyenas consume hartebeests in 3.5%, cheetahs consume hartebeests in 1.75%, and leopards consume hartebeests in 6.25% of their diets. Lions typically prey on adult males, while both spotted hyenas and leopards tend to prey on young calves. These predatory habits are likely attributed to the difficulty of catching nomadic hartebeests, as well as the better success hyenas and leopards have with catching calves.&lt;ref name= "predators"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mills, M.|year= 1984|title= Prey selection and feeding habits of the large carnivores in the southern Kalahari|doi=10.4102/koedoe.v27i2.586|journal=Koedoe|volume=27|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental threats==
Hunting is always an issue to consider in rural areas, since little enforcement of animal protection laws is possible, or there can be no established regulations at all. Hunting hartebeests for survival is an ancient practice: [[persistence hunting]] in the hottest part of the day was most common, when hunters could catch the animal at its weakest point. Over the past 20 years, however, one of the only places where persistence hunting still occurs is in central Kalahari.&lt;ref name= "Hunting Hartebeests"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liebenberg, L. |year=2006|title= Hunting by modern hunter-gatherer|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1017–1026|doi=10.1086/508695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habitat and demographics ==
The red hartebeest is primarily found in [[South Africa|southwestern Africa]]. Southern Africa's dissected topography, geologic diversity, climate oscillations, and mosaic of distinct vegetation types has been the primary means for radiation and diversification amidst hartebeest species, which has led red hartebeests to vary slightly in their capacity to consume the diets they do.&lt;ref name="Ecology of African Grazers" /&gt; Most ungulates in Africa are nomadic, as they are dependent on food sources that become depleted if they stay in one place.  ''A. buselaphus'' lives in herds in open [[plain]]s and [[Shrubland|scrublands]] in the [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n climate.&lt;ref name= "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

== Evolutionary history ==
In the early 1900s, "antelope" was a very broad, ambiguous name given to most hollow-horned ruminants besides oxen, sheep, and goats. Of these antelopes found in Africa, Asia, and Europe, Africa has the most diverse populations of antelopes, with horn lengths ranging from six feet long, to a quarter of an inch.&lt;ref name= "Evolution"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Capellini, I |author2=Gosling, L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title= Habitat, primary production, and evolution of body size within the hartebeest clade|journal= Biol Journal of Linnean Society|volume= 92|pages= 431–440|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00883.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A. b. caama'', from the family Bovidae, used to be categorized as the subfamily of Bubalinae, but are now classified under the subfamily Alcelaphini.&lt;ref name= "History Antelopes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dollman, G. |year=1936|title= African Antelopes|journal= Journal of the Royal African Society|volume=35|issue=141|pages=1–28|jstor=717166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This youngest of all African bovid subfamilies dates back 5 million years ago, and has exhibited great diversification. The oldest fossil of ''Alcelaphus'' has been dated to 740,000 years ago. Besides ''Alcelaphus'', the three other genera from the Alcelaphini are [[Hirola|''Beatragus'']], [[Wildebeest|''Connochaetes'']], and ''[[Damaliscus]]''.
Over millions of years, the Alcelaphini have diversified to fill certain niches and have spread to different habitats across the continent of Africa. The genus ''Alcelaphus'' is suggested to have evolved and diversified due to climate variability over a range of habitats in the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene era]]. About 500,000 years ago, the Alcelaphini diverged into northern and southern [[clade]]s, while the northern clade diverged once more into eastern and western lineages 400,000 years ago. The species ''Alcelaphus caama'' originated from the southern clade, also including [[Lichtenstein's hartebeest|''lichtensteinii'']], in Namibia. The northern clade comprises the rest of the hartebeest complex.

Diversification of these species has been solely attributed to environmental and habitat changes due to global warming around 250 to 195 thousand years ago, and global cooling 175 to 125 thousand years ago.&lt;ref name= "Environmental Change"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Flagstad, Ø.|author2=Syversten, P.|author3=Stenseth, N.|author4=Jakobsen, K.|last-author-amp=yes|pmid=11321054|jstor=3067612|year=2001|title=Environmental change and rates of evolution: The phylogeographic pattern within the hartebeest complex as related to climatic variation|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=667–77|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1416|pmc=1088655|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution''' (S-CAR) is a division of [[George Mason University]] based near [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]] with locations in Arlington, Fairfax, and Lorton, Virginia.

== History ==
S-CAR was founded in 1981 as the Center for Conflict Analysis, later named the Center for Conflict Analysis and Resolution (CCAR) and began offering a master's degree in Conflict Analysis and Resolution in 1983.  In 1988 it became the first academic institution to grant PhD's in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and rose to the status of Institute, becoming ICAR in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scar.gmu.edu/newsletter-subject/icar-then-and-now-institute-turns-25-years-old |title=ICAR Then and Now: The Institute Turns 25 Years Old |publisher=S-CAR News, Special Issue: Point of View |date=February 2008|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, after a decade of growth and development, including the introduction of the undergraduate program and graduate certificate programs, it became the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution (S-CAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scar.gmu.edu/newsletter-subject/icar-becomes-school-reflections-past-and-looking-future |title=ICAR Becomes a School: Reflections on the past and looking to the future |publisher=S-CAR News, Volume 5, Issue 1 |date=February 2011|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Citizen's pension ==
The term ''citizen's pension'' (known also as universal pension, demogrant or categorical pension) is used to describe a social pension that realises the right to basic income in old age.&lt;ref&gt;http://larrywillmore.net/SocialPensions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen's pensions are based in law and provide cash transfers to older people subject only to tests of age and citizenship or residency, never income, assets or other pension income. A citizen's pension is not a retirement pension. There is no income test, so it is not necessary to stop working to receive it.

Some researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pension-watch.net/pensions/key-debates/key-debates/citizens-pensions/|title=Citizen's pensions - Key debates - Pension watch|author=|date=|website=www.Pension-Watch.net|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; apply the term ''citizen's pension'' to social pensions that exclude – partially or totally - older people with other pension income, irrespective of their non-pension income or wealth. "Universal minimum pension" is another description of such a scheme, which tops up small pensions and provides full, basic pensions only to those with no other pension income.

{{Antisemitism}}
'''Strasserism''' ({{lang-de|Strasserismus}} or ''Straßerismus'') is a strand of [[Nazism]] that calls for a more radical, mass-action and worker-based form of Nazism—hostile to [[Jews]] not from a racial, ethnic, cultural or religious perspective, but from an [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] basis—to achieve a [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|national rebirth]]. It derives its name from [[Gregor Strasser|Gregor]] and [[Otto Strasser]], the two Nazi brothers initially associated with this position. 

Opposed on strategic views to [[Adolf Hitler]], Otto Strasser was expelled from the [[Nazi Party]] in 1930 and went into [[exile]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] while Gregor Strasser was murdered in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] on 30 June 1934 during the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. Strasserism remains an active position within strands of [[neo-Nazism]].

== Strasser brothers ==
=== Gregor Strasser ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1721, Gregor Strasser crop.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gregor Strasser]] in 1928]]
[[Gregor Strasser]] (1892–1934) began his career in [[ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] politics by joining the ''[[Freikorps]]'' after serving in [[World War I]]. Strasser was involved in the [[Kapp Putsch]] and formed his own ''[[Völkisch movement|völkischer]] Wehrverband'' ("popular defense union") which he merged into the NSDAP in 1921. Initially a loyal supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]], he took part in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and held a number of high positions in the [[Nazi Party]]. However, Strasser soon became a strong advocate of the [[Right-wing socialism|socialist]] wing of the party, arguing that the national revolution should also include strong action to tackle poverty and should seek to build [[working class]] support. After [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Hitler's rise to power]], [[Ernst Röhm]], who headed the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), then the most important paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, called for a second revolution aimed at removing the elites from control. This was opposed by the [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative movement]] as well as by some [[Nazism|Nazis]] who preferred an ordered authoritarian regime to the radical and disruptive program proposed by the party's left-wing.

=== Otto Strasser ===
[[File:Otto Strasser crop.jpg|thumb|left|203px|[[Otto Strasser]] giving a speech shortly after his return to Germany after World War II]]
[[Otto Strasser]] (1897–1974) had also been a member of the ''Freikorps'', but he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and fought against the Kapp Putsch. Strasser joined the Nazi Party in 1925, but he nonetheless retained his ideas about the importance of socialism. Considered more of a radical than his brother, Strasser was expelled by the Nazi Party in 1930 and set up his own dissident group, the [[Black Front]], which called for a specifically [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] form of socialist revolution. Strasser fled Germany in 1933 to live firstly in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and then [[Canada]] before returning to [[West Germany]] in later life, all the while writing prolifically about Hitler and what he saw as his betrayal of [[national socialist]] ideals.

== Ideology ==
The name Strasserism came to be applied to the form of Nazism that developed around the Strasser brothers. Although they had been involved in the creation of the [[National Socialist Program]] of 1920, both called on the party to commit to "breaking the shackles of finance capital".&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, 'Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany' in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson &amp; M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Economic antisemitism|opposition to Jewish finance capitalism]], which they contrasted to "[[Producerism|productive capitalism]]”, was shared by [[Political views of Adolf Hitler|Hitler himself]], who borrowed it from [[Gottfried Feder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', first chapter (London, 1991, rev. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Populism|populist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] form of anti-capitalism was further developed in 1925 when Otto Strasser published the ''Nationalsozialistische Briefe'', which discussed notions of [[class conflict]], [[Redistribution of income and wealth|wealth redistribution]] and a possible alliance with the [[Soviet Union]]. His 1930 follow-up ''Ministersessel oder Revolution'' (''Cabinet Seat or Revolution'') went further by attacking Hitler's betrayal of the socialist aspect of Nazism as well as criticizing the notion of the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], ''The German Dictatorship'', 1973, pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Gregor Strasser echoed many of the calls of his brother, his influence on the ideology is less, owing to his remaining in the Nazi Party longer and to his early death. Meanwhile, Otto Strasser continued to expand his argument, calling for the break-up of large estates and the development of something akin to a [[Gremialismo|guild system]] and the related establishment of a ''Reich'' [[cooperative]] chamber to take a leading role in [[Planned economy|economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=[[Three Faces of Fascism]]: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1969|publisher=Mentor|location=New York|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|pages=425–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strasserism therefore became a distinct strand of Nazism that whilst holding on to previous Nazi ideals such as [[palingenetic ultranationalism]] and antisemitism, added a strong [[Criticism of capitalism|critique of capitalism]] and framed this in the demand for a more socialist-based approach to economics.

However, it is disputed whether Strasserism was a distinct form of Nazism. According to historian [[Ian Kershaw]], "the leaders of the SA [which included Gregor Strasser] did not have another vision of the future of Germany or another politic to propose". The Strasserites advocated the radicalization of the [[Nazi regime]] and the toppling of the [[Junker (Prussia)|German elites]], calling Hitler's rise to power a half-revolution which needed to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], 1991, chapter III, first section.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
=== In Germany ===
During the 1970s, the ideas of Strasserism began to be referred to more in European far-right groups as younger members with no ties to Hitler and a stronger sense of anti-capitalism came to the fore. Strasserite thought in Germany began to emerge as a tendency within the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD) during the late 1960s. These Strasserites played a leading role in securing the removal of [[Adolf von Thadden]] from the leadership and after his departure the party became stronger in condemning Hitler for what it saw as his move away from socialism in order to court business and army leaders.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'', 2003, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially adopted by the NPD, Strasserism soon became associated with more peripheral extremist figures, notably [[Michael Kühnen]] who produced a 1982 pamphlet ''Farewell to Hitler'', which included a strong endorsement of the idea. The [[Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit|People's Socialist Movement of Germany/Labour Party]] (a minor extremist movement that was outlawed in 1982) adopted the policy while its successor movement, the [[Nationalist Front (Germany)|Nationalist Front]], did likewise, with its ten-point programme calling for an "anti-materialist cultural revolution" and an "anti-capitalist social revolution" to underline its support for the idea.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, "Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany" in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Free German Workers' Party]] also moved towards these ideas under the leadership of [[Friedhelm Busse]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Husbands, "Militant Neo-Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany" in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The flag of the Strasserite movement [[Black Front]] and its symbol a crossed hammer and a sword has been used by German and other European [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] abroad as a substitute for the more infamous [[Nazi flag]] which is banned in some countries such as Germany.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== In the United Kingdom ===
Strasserism emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and centred on the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF) publication ''Britain First'', the main writers of which were [[David McCalden]], [[Richard Lawson (UK politician)|Richard Lawson]] and [[Denis Pirie]]. Opposing the leadership of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], they formed an alliance with [[John Kingsley Read]] and ultimately followed him into the [[National Party (UK, 1976)|National Party]] (NP).&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', 2004, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The NP called for British workers to seize the right to work and offered a fairly Strasserite economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;M. Walker, ''The National Front'', 1977, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the NP failed to last for very long. Due in part to Read's lack of enthusiasm for Strasserism, the main exponents of the idea drifted away.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The idea was reintroduced to the NF by [[Andrew Brons]] in the early 1980s when he decided to make the party's ideology clearer.&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', 2004, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Strasserism was soon to become the province of the radicals in the [[Official National Front]], with Richard Lawson brought in a behind-the-scenes role to help direct policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Gable|G. Gable]], 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain' in L. Cheles, R. Ferguson &amp; M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', 1992, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Political Soldier]] wing ultimately opted for the indigenous alternative of [[distributism]], but their strong anti-capitalist rhetoric as well as that of their [[International Third Position]] successor demonstrated influences from Strasserism. From this background, [[Troy Southgate]] emerged, whose own ideology and those of related groups such as the [[English Nationalist Movement]] and [[National Revolutionary Faction]] were influenced by Strasserism. He has also described himself as a post-Strasserite.

=== Elsewhere ===
[[Third Position]] groups, whose inspiration is generally more Italian in derivation, have often looked to Strasserism, owing to their strong opposition to capitalism. This was noted in France, where the student group ''[[Groupe Union Droit|Groupe Union Défense]]'' and the more recent ''[[Renouveau français]]'' both extolled Strasserite economic platforms.&lt;ref&gt;R. Griffin, ''The Nature of Fascism'', 1993, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to reinterpret Nazism as having a left-wing base have also been heavily influenced by this school of thought, notably through the work of [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]], who produced the Strasser-influenced work ''National Socialism: A Left-Wing Movement'' in 1984.

In the United States, [[Tom Metzger]] also flirted with Strasserism, having been influenced by Kühnen's pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee|M.A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'', 1997, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''subject-expectancy effect''', is a form of [[reactivity (psychology)|reactivity]] that occurs in [[scientific experiment]]s or [[medical treatment]]s when a [[research subject]] or [[patient]] expects a given result and therefore unconsciously affects the outcome, or reports the expected result. Because this effect can significantly [[bias]] the results of experiments (especially on [[human subject research|human subject]]s), [[double-blind]] methodology is used to eliminate the effect.

Like the [[observer-expectancy effect]], it is often a cause of "odd" results in many experiments. The subject-expectancy effect is most commonly found in [[medicine]], where it can result in the subject experiencing the [[placebo effect]] or [[nocebo effect]], depending on how the influence pans out.

The subject expectancy effect is also observed in [[psychotherapy]].

==Example==

An example of a scenario involving these various effects is as follows: A woman goes to her doctor with a problem. The doctor diagnoses with certainty, and then clearly explains the diagnosis and the expected route towards recovery. If he does this convincingly, calming her, removing fear and instilling hope, she will likely, through the positive expectancy, experience the placebo effect, aiding in her recovery.

On the other hand, if her doctor had had little time for her, was uncertain about the diagnosis, and had given her a [[medical prescription|prescription]], combined with a message along the lines of, "this may help sometimes", and added a message about possible horrible [[side effects]] (combined, say, with the patient having talked to a neighbor who also speaks along the same lines about the horrible side effects), then the chance of negative subject-expectancy, or [[nocebo]], becomes quite large.

A '''sublanguage''' is a [[subset]] of a [[language]]. Sublanguages occur in [[natural language]], [[programming language|computer language]], and [[relational database]]s.

==In natural language==

In [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]], [[natural language processing]], and [[machine translation]], a sublanguage is the language of a restricted domain, particularly a technical domain. In mathematical terms, "a subset of the sentences of a language forms a sublanguage of that language if it is closed under some operations of the language: e.g., if when two members of a subset are operated on, as by ''and'' or ''because'', the resultant is also a member of that subset" (Z. S. Harris ''Language and Information'', Columbia U. Press, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;34).

==In computer languages==
The term sublanguage has also sometimes been used to denote a computer language that is a subset of another language. A sublanguage may be restricted syntactically (it accepts a [[subgrammar]] of the original language), and/or semantically (the set of possible outcomes for any given program is a subset of the possible outcomes in the original language).

===Examples===
For instance, [[ALGOL 68S]] was a subset of [[ALGOL 68]] designed to make it possible to write a single-pass [[compiler]] for this ''sublanguage''.

[[SQL]] (Structured Query Language) statements are classified in various ways,&lt;ref&gt;[[SQL-92]], 4.22 SQL-statements, 4.22.1  Classes of SQL-statements "There are at least five ways of classifying SQL-statements:", 4.22.2, SQL statements classified by function "The following are the main classes of SQL-statements:"; [[SQL:2003]] 4.11 SQL-statements, and later revisions.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be grouped into sublanguages, commonly: a [[data query language]] (DQL), a [[data definition language]] (DDL), a [[data control language]] (DCL), and a [[data manipulation language]] (DML).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relational database theory==

In [[relational database]] theory, the term "sublanguage", first used for this purpose by [[Edgar F. Codd|E. F. Codd]] in 1970, refers to a [[computer language]] used to define or manipulate the structure and contents of a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS). Typical sublanguages associated with modern RDBMS's are [[Query by Example|QBE]] (Query by Example) and [[SQL]] (Structured Query Language). In 1985, Codd encapsulated his thinking in twelve rules which every database must satisfy in order to be truly relational. The fifth rule is known as the ''Comprehensive data sublanguage rule'', and states:

: ''A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for example, the fill-in-the-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings, and that is comprehensive in supporting all of the following items:''
:* ''Data definition''
:* ''View definition''
:* ''Data manipulation (interactive and by program)''
:* ''Integrity constraints''
:* ''Authorization''
:* ''Transaction boundaries (begin, commit, and rollback)''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9118">'''Telematic art''' is a descriptive of art projects using computer mediated [[telecommunications]] networks as their medium. Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Ascott, Roy.(2003).''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness.'' (Ed.) Edward A. Shanken. Berkeley, CA:University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21803-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Telematics'' was first coined by Simon Nora and [[Alain Minc]] in ''The Computerization of Society''.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Nora and Alain Minc, ''The Computerization of Society'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1980): 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Ascott]] sees the telematic art form as the transformation of the viewer into an active participator of creating the artwork which remains in process throughout its duration. Ascott has been at the forefront of the theory and practice of telematic art since 1978 when he went online for the first time, organizing different collaborative online projects.

== Pioneering experiments ==
Although Ascott was the first person to name this phenomenon, the first use of telecommunications as an artistic medium has occurred in 1922 when the Hungarian constructivist artist [[László Moholy-Nagy]] made the work ''Telephone Pictures''[https://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78747].  This work questioned the idea of the isolated individual artist and the unique art object. In 1932 [[Bertold Brecht]] emphasized the idea of telecommunications as an artistic medium in his essay 'The Radio as an Apparatus of Communication'. In this essay Brecht advocated the two-way communication for radio to give the public the power of [[Representation (politics)|representation]] and to pull it away from the control of corporate [[Mass media|media]]. Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has authored several historical accounts of telematic art, including "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 'Satellite Arts Project' by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz&lt;ref&gt;See Carl Eugene Loeffler and Roy Ascott, ''Chronology and Working Survey of Select Communications Activity'' in [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] (Journal of [[Leonardo/ISAST]], the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology), vol. 24, N° 2 , 1991, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; used satellites to connect artists on the east and west coast of the United States. This was the first time that artists were connected in a [[telematic]] way. With the support of [[NASA]] the artists produced composite images of participants, enabling an interactive dance concert amongst geographically disparate performers. An estimated audience of 25,000 saw bi-coastal discussions on the impact of new technologies on art, and improvised, interactive dance and music performances that were mixed in real time and shown on a split screen. These first satellite works emphasized the primacy of process that remained central to the theory and practice of telematic art.&lt;ref&gt;Ascott(2003): 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Ascott used [[telematics]] for the first time in 1978 when he organized a computer-conferencing project between the United States and the United Kingdom called ''Terminal Art''. For this project he used [[Jacques Vallée]]'s Infomedia Notepad System, which made it possible for the users to retrieve and add information stored in the computer’s memory. This made it possible to interact with a group of people to make "aesthetic encounters more participatory, culturally diverse, and richly layered with meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Ascott(2003): 63&lt;/ref&gt; Ascott did more similar projects like ''Ten Wings'' which was part of Robert Adrian’s ''The World in 24 Hours'' in 1982. The most important telematic artwork of Ascott is ''La Plissure du Texte''[http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_ascott.html] from 1983. This project allowed Ascott and other artists to participate in collectively creating texts to an emerging story by using computer networking. This participation has been termed as ‘distributed authorship’.&lt;ref&gt;Ascott(2003): 64&lt;/ref&gt; But the most significant matter of this project is the [[interactivity]] of the artwork and the way it breaks the barriers of time and space. In the late 1980s the interest in this kind of project using computer networking expanded, especially with the release of the [[World Wide Web]] in the early 1990s.

==French side story ==
Thanks to the [[Minitel]], France had a public telematic infrastructure more than a decade before the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1994. This enabled a different style of telematic art than the point-to-point technologies to which other locations were limited in the 1970s and 1980s. As reported by [[Don Foresta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donforesta.net/ Don Foresta] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018143723/http://www.donforesta.net/ |date=2013-10-18 }} : [http://195.194.24.18/~donforesta/mambo/images/stories/other_docs/annexe_ga2.pdf ''Chronologie historique résumée d'échanges artistiques par télécommunications.

==Pop culture and mass media ==
Telematic art is now being used more frequently by televised performers. Shows such as ''American Idol'' that are based highly form viewer polls incorporate telematic art. This type of consumer applications is now grouped under the term "[[transmedia]]".

'''Telugu language policy''' is an issue in the [[India]]n states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]], with 84 percent of the population reporting [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as their [[first language]] in Andhra Pradesh prior to the [[Telangana movement|secession of Telangana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/parta.htm|title=Census of India - Distribution of the 22 Scheduled Languages|website=www.censusindia.gov.in|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement2.aspx|title=Census of India - Statement II|website=www.censusindia.gov.in|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telugu-language advocates note a lack of incentivisation and government support for the language, and press for their [[linguistic rights]] for Telugu's greater official{{clarify|reason=official what?|date=December 2017}} in the recognition and promotion.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Present status==
Telugu and English are the two dominant languages of instruction in the schools of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, while there are also schools who use other regional languages such as Urdu as the medium of instruction. Telugu is a compulsory subject in schools in both states, with fluency in the language being a requirement for matriculation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/telangana-telugu-school-1044430-2017-09-14|title=Telugu now a mandatory subject for Telangana Class 1 to 12 school students|date=2017-09-14|website=India Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government in Andhra Pradesh is working to increase the number of English medium schools state schools, with some proposals calling for English to be the only medium of instruction in state schools, claiming that this policy reflects the growing desire of parents and that the state sector is losing pupils due to its inability to meet the increased demand for English medium schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/010517/english-medium-must-in-state-schools-says-andhra-pradesh.html|title=English medium must in state schools, says Andhra Pradesh government|date=2017-05-01|work=deccanchronicle.com/|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Andhra-Pradesh/2017-09-27/AP-mulls-over-English-medium-in-government-schools-/329362|title=AP mulls over English medium in government schools|website=The Hans India|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Telangana, the government has issued plans to mandate English-medium education in all the private schools in the state. The trend towards English-medium education has caused alarm among some Telugu-language activists who claim that the state governments are placing the language in an inferior position and depriving Telugu-speakers of their language rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Telugu-loses-out-to-English-as-medium-of-education/article14003197.ece|title=Telugu loses out to English as medium of education|last=Dayashankar|first=K.

Many educated Telugu people began travelling around the world in search of knowledge-based jobs, and have observed that many countries are prospering faster than India by imparting education in their native languages without depending on English.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Throughout India, native-language advocates are demanding less reliance on English.

==Telugu promotion==
In 2012 the Andhra Pradesh official-language commission resumed its activities, and was tasked with organizing the fourth [[World Telugu Conference]] (WTC) after a 22-year hiatus. The conference was a success, with 5,000 Telugu delegates from all over the world meeting in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newswala.com/Hyderabad-News/PM-Manmohan-Singh-lauds-Telugu-people-26582.html|title= PM Manmohan Singh lauds Telugu people|date=29 December 2012|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Behavior of Organisms''''' is [[B.F. Skinner]]'s first book and was published in May 1938 as a volume of the Century Psychology Series.&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Skinner (1938). ''The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: B.F. Skinner Foundation. {{ISBN|1-58390-007-1}}, {{ISBN|0-87411-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set out the parameters for the discipline that would come to be called the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] (EAB) and [[Behavior analysis#21st century behavior analysis|Behavior Analysis]]. This book was reviewed in 1939 by [[Ernest R. Hilgard]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest R. Hilgard (1939). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1338876&amp;pageindex=1 "Review of B.F. Skinner's ''The Behavior of Organisms''".] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' (1988), 50(2), pp. 283–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner looks at science behavior and how the analysis of behavior produces data which can be studied, rather than acquiring data through a conceptual or neural  process. In the book, behavior is classified either as respondent or operant behavior, where respondent behavior is caused by an observable stimulus and operant behavior is where there is no observable stimulus for a behavior. The behavior is studied in depth with rats and the feeding responses they exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B.F.|title=The behavior of organisms: an experimental analysis|year=1938|publisher=Appleton-Century|location=Oxford, England|pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">In mathematics and [[logic]], a '''vacuous truth''' is a [[Statement (logic)|statement]] that asserts that [[Universal quantification|all]] members of the [[empty set]] have a certain [[Property (philosophy)|property]]. For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" will be [[Truth|true]] whenever there are no [[cell phone]]s in the room. In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned ''on''" would also be vacuously true, as would the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the two: "all cell phones in the room are turned on ''and'' turned off".

More formally, a relatively [[Well-definition|well-defined]] usage refers to a [[Counterfactual conditional|conditional]] statement with a false [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]. One example of such a statement is "if [[Uluru]] is in [[France]], then the [[Eiffel Tower]] is in [[Bolivia]]". Such statements are considered vacuous because the fact that the antecedent is false prevents using the statement to infer anything about the truth value of the [[consequent]]. They are true because a [[material conditional]] is defined to be true when the antecedent is false (regardless of whether the conclusion is true).

In [[pure mathematics]], vacuously true statements are not generally of interest by themselves, but they frequently arise as the base case of proofs by [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algorithms and Data Structures: The Science of Computing|first1=Douglas L.|last1=Baldwin|first2=Greg W.|last2=Scragg|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn= 9781285225128|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETA9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has relevance in [[pure mathematics]], as well as in any other field which uses [[classical logic]].

Outside of mathematics, statements which can be characterized informally as vacuously true can be misleading. Such statements make reasonable assertions about [[Qualifier|qualified]] objects which [[Nonexistence|do not actually exist]]. For example, a child might tell their parent "I ate every vegetable on my plate", when there were no vegetables on the child's plate to begin with.

== Scope of the concept ==

A statement &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is "vacuously true" if it [[Logical form|resembles]] the statement &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is known to be false.

Statements that can be reduced ([[Mutatis mutandis|with suitable transformations]]) to this basic form include the following [[Universal quantifier|universally quantified]] statements:
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x: P(x) \Rightarrow Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where it is the case that &lt;math&gt;\forall x: \neg P(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in A: Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|empty]].
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \xi: Q(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;, where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to a [[type (type theory)|type]] that has no representatives.

Vacuous truth most commonly appears in [[classical logic]], which in particular is [[Binary decision|two-valued]]. However, vacuous truth also appears in, for example, [[intuitionistic logic]] in the same situations given above. Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; will yield vacuous truth in any logic that uses the [[material conditional]]; if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Contradiction|necessary falsehood]], then it will also yield vacuous truth under the [[strict conditional]].

Other non-classical logics (for example, [[relevance logic]]) may attempt to avoid vacuous truths by using alternative conditionals (for example, the [[counterfactual conditional]]).

== Examples ==

These examples, one from [[mathematics]] and one from [[natural language]], illustrate the concept:

"For any integer x, if x &gt; 5 then x &gt; 3."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What precisely is a vacuous truth?|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1257728}}&lt;/ref&gt; – This statement is [[Truth|true]] non-vacuously (since some [[integer]]s are greater than 5), but some of its implications are only vacuously true: for example, when x is the integer 2, the statement implies the vacuous truth that "if 2 &gt; 5 then 2 &gt; 3".

"All my children are cats" is a vacuous truth when spoken by someone without children.

{{for|the class of words|Profanity}}
'''Vulgarity''' is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined.  This judgement may refer to [[language]], [[visual art]], [[social class]]es, or [[social climber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bayley claims it can never be [[self-referential]] because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of [[sophistication]] which thereby elevates the subject above the [[:wikt:vulgar|vulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/4/298 |title=Vulgarity |author=John Bayley |journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1964 |volume=4 |pages=298–304 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/4.4.298 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, "vulgar" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country.  From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: "having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred".  In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior.  In a [[George Eliot]] novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|pages=1–10|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words.  In [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Beauchamp's Career]]'', an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is "engaged", nor "betrothed", "affianced", or "plighted".  Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as ''[[toilet]]'' eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of "[[cultural capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|page=17|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Vulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[synonym]]ous with the 'general' meaning of [[profanity]].

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is "cursing." However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, "Cursing in America" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the "dirty words" because it "allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered  taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is ''fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Robert F. "The F-Word: A Jurisprudential Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell)." Santa Clara L. Rev. 40 (1999): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cursing ===
Curse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
Religious curses may include "Damn you", "God damn you", "To hell with you". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like "Fuck you" or "Eat shit and die".

=== Profanity ===
Profanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. 

For a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
