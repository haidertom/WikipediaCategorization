'''Artificial hair integrations''', more commonly known as '''hair extensions''' or '''hair weaves''', add length and/or fullness to [[human hair]]. Hair extensions are usually clipped, glued, or sewn on natural hair by incorporating additional human or synthetic hair. These methods include tape in extensions, clip in or clip on extensions, fusion method, weaving method, and [[wig]]s.

== Background ==

A hair weave is human or artificial hair utilized for the integration with one's natural hair. Weaves can alter one's appearance for long or short periods of time by adding further hair to one's natural hair or by covering the natural hair all together with human or synthetic hairpieces. Weaving additional human or synthetic pieces can enhance one's hair by giving it volume, length and adding color without the damage of chemicals or adopting a different hair texture than that of their own. However, hair loss can occur either along the front hairline or above the ears due to the wearing of specific hair styles for a prolonged period of time, such as weaves. Such hair loss in known as ''[[traction alopecia]]''.

By the late 17th century, wigs in various shapes and sizes became a latest fashion trend. Hair weaves in particular, did not grow interest until the 1950s; even during that time celebrities had been the only ones using them. When the "long, disco-haired" era evolved there  became a widespread use of hair weave. Since that era, hair weave has only become more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireland|first=Jae|title=About Hair definitely making it a "staple in the beauty and glamour" industry|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/31175-hair-weaves|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most human hair weaves come from Asian countries like India and China.

== Installation method==
[[File:Наращивание волос HD.ogv|thumbtime=6|left|thumb|hair extension]]

'''Pinchbraid''' extensions were invented in the 1980s by Minneapolis salon [[Hair Police]]. They are individual locks of hair tied into the native hair with a durable upholstery thread.

'''Tape-in''' hair extensions last from four to eight weeks and the hair can be gently combed and washed while wearing the extensions. In addition, the extensions need to be treated with specialized shampoos, conditioners and styling products to keep them in top condition. The extensions can be easily taken off by applying glue remover and can be easily installed by using liquid adhesive or glue tape.

'''Clip-in weaves''', also known as '''''clip-in hair extensions''''', can be integrated into natural hair to add length and volume.  Clip in hair extensions can be purchased for $100 – $1000, depending on desired quality.  The clip in hair extensions most commonly come in as a long strand of one contoured piece that can be cut into multiple layers for creating separate layers on a user's head.  When the hair is purchased from a beauty supply store, it often comes with clips, which are sewn into the hair.  If bought from an online store the clips can be simply sewn on easily by the purchaser of the extensions or by a stylist. Once the clips are sewn in, it is recommended that the user clip in the hair and visit a stylist, to help create a look that is natural.

This technique is the least permanent and lacks the disadvantages such as [[traction alopecia]] associated with glue extensions. The hair weft has small [[toupée]] clips sewn onto them. Usually a set of clip-in extensions averages eight strips of human hair in varying widths from two inches to eight inches. Starting at the nape of the neck, the hair is sectioned neatly, then the weft is placed onto this section with the clips open and facing the scalp. Each clip is snapped into place. It can be helpful to lightly backcomb each section for a more secure grip. This is repeated until each clip-in weft is in place. Clip-ins can be worn for an entire day; however, some people take them off to sleep.

'''Bonding''' is a method of weaving that lasts for a shorter period of time in comparison to sew-in weaving. It involves the application of hair glue to a section of wefted hair then onto a person's natural hair; special hair adhesives are used in bonding to prevent damage to one's natural hair. This technique is commonly used and does not cause damage to the hair unless taken out without proper directions from a professional. It is advised that weave bonding be installed for up to 3 weeks because the glue begins to loosen up and lessens the attractiveness of the hair. There are 2 types of bonding methods: soft bond and hard bond. Soft bond is flexible and comfortable to wear and is made using latex/acrylic based adhesives. Hard bond is the industry term for bonding treatments whose adhesive contains cyanoacrylate, or super glue. Hard bond adhesives last longer than soft bond adhesives because it is not water based and therefore less susceptible to deterioration. Nonetheless, the hard bond adhesives are not as comfortable as the soft bond adhesive because they are rigid. These bond attachments generally last 4–6 weeks before a maintenance appointment is necessary.

'''Fusion method''' involves a machine similar to a [[hot glue gun]] used to attach human hair extensions to individual strands of one's natural hair of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch [[Square number|squared]] sections for a truly authentic look. Another option for fusion attachments is using hair which is pre-tipped with a keratin adhesive. A heat clamp is then used to melt the adhesive to attach the extension hair to the natural hair. Fusion weave allows washing hair frequently and the use of regular hair products such as [[hair gels]]. This technique is very time consuming taking 3 or more hours. They need re-positioning every 2–3 months as the natural hair grows. Due to various chemicals in the glue, which may cause [[hair loss]] and scalp [[irritation]], combined with heat, this method is more damaging to natural hair.

'''Micro ring''' (also known as ''micro-bead'' or ''micro loop'') hair extensions use small metal rings or beads (usually [[aluminum]]) and can sometimes be lined with silicone to attach the extension hair. They are fixed to small sections of natural hair and tightened using a special tool that clamps the bead around the natural hair.

The micro-beads are designed to be small enough so that they are not visible in normal use. They need re-positioning every two to three months as the natural hair grows and the micro-beads move away from the scalp.

As they do not use heat or adhesives, these hair extensions should cause less damage than some types of extensions, if placed correctly and properly taken care of.  Today, there are many sizes available for micro rings/beads from about {{convert|1.5-5.5|mm|abbr=on}}.  The sizing makes a difference on the weight of the extensions, the feel, and the visibility.  Some micro-beads are so tiny that they mimic a non surgical hair transplant.  The stylist installing the extensions should determine what size micro rings/beads are best for the client's hair length and texture, prior to installation on the head.

[[File:Closure of netting weave process.JPG|thumb|The glued netting process near completion]]
'''Netting''' is a technique which involves braiding natural tresses under a thin, breathable net that serves as a flat surface onto which stylists can weave extensions. This method requires the use of hair net or cap to be placed over the person's hair that has been braided. Netting provides more flexibility than track placement because the stylist is not limited to sewing extensions to a braid. With netting there is the option of sewing the hair wefts onto the net or gluing. This technique is not as time-consuming when compared to the other hair techniques because it takes about 2–4 hours to complete.

[[File:Lace closure.jpg|thumb|Section of a lace front used to close a weave (also called a lace or closure)]]
The most recent development in weave extensions are '''lace fronts''', which are made from a nylon mesh material formed into a cap that is then hand-ventilated by knotting single strands of hair into the tiny openings of the cap, giving the hair a more natural and authentic continuity than typical extensions. It has few variations including straight, wavy and curly. Furthermore, the extension units can be woven in or attached to a person's hairline with special adhesives. To ensure a proper fit, head measurements are taken into account with this type of weave. A lace frontal is best placed by a professional since more advanced weaving and hair extensions are used. This method is commonly used because it makes it possible to have access to a certain part of their scalp.

'''Tracking''' involves the braiding of a person's natural hair. This is one of the most commonly used methods as it is quite fast and lasts considerably longer than other techniques. However, it does not allow for regular hair maintenance. In order to prevent the hair from being bumpy or uneven, the hair is sewn horizontally or vertically across the head from one side to the other starting from the bottom. The braided hair is then sewn down and the hair weft extensions are sewn onto the braids. A weave can consist of a few tracks, or the whole head can be braided for a full head weave. With a full head weave, the braids are sewn down or covered with a net. Extensions are then sewn to the braids. The number of tracks used depends on the desired look.

== Types of hair ==

The most popular and commonly available form of hair is known as '''premium hair'''. It is sold in most beauty supply stores or online.  The roots and tips of hairs are interwoven in premium hair which causes tangling. This is due to the opposing cuticle layers catching onto one another. However, as it is the most inexpensive type of hair, it is a best seller.

Premium hair comes in two types:
*Regular premium hair: generally the least expensive type of hair. The cuticles are present in different directions and the hair is prone to tangling.
*"Tangle-free" premium hair: this is obtained by chemically removing the cuticles using an acid bath. This process reduces the friction among hairs, leaving the remaining hair tangle-free. In order to give the appearance of natural healthy hair, a laminate is applied to the hair to give it a shiny and silky look.

===Synthetic fiber===

[[Synthetic fiber]]s are made of various different materials and contain no human hair. Synthetic fibers come in weave (weft) and single strands (bulk) for braids. They do not last as long as human hair because they can be easily damaged by friction and heat. The quality of fibers varies greatly. Depending on quality, they may never look like human hair, as they can be stiff and move differently from human hair. Synthetic fibers are much less expensive than human hair. Heating appliances such as curling irons, flat irons, and [[straightening combs]] generally should never be used on most types of synthetic hair. There are some newer versions of synthetic fibers that are more resistant, human-like fibers that can be heat processed allowing for heat styling.

===Futura===
Futura is a type of synthetic fiber that can withstand heat up to 400&amp;nbsp;°F (200&amp;nbsp;°C), and can actually outlast human hair.  It is very similar to human hair given it is tangle-free and has a natural sheen. It can be straightened or curled, however, it takes longer to set and futura cannot be colored.  It is sometimes sold as a human hair blend.

===Human hair===

The human hair shaft is made up of dead, hard protein, called keratin, in three layers. The inner layer is called the [[Medulla (hair)|medulla]] and may not be present. The next layer is the [[Cortex (hair)|cortex]] and the outer layer is the [[Cuticle (hair)|cuticle]]. The cortex makes up the majority of the hair shaft. The cuticle is formed by tightly packed scales in an overlapping structure similar to roof shingles. Most hair-conditioning products attempt to affect the cuticle. There are pigment cells that are distributed throughout the cortex, giving the hair its characteristic color. The cuticle is a hard shingle-like layer of overlapping cells, some five to twelve deep, formed from dead cells that form scales which give the hair shaft strength and protect the inner structure of the hair. The hair cuticle is the first line of defense against all forms of damage; it acts as a protective barrier for the softer inner structures, including the medulla and cortex. [[File:Premium hair.JPG|thumb|A packet of 10-inch premium hair]]

The cuticle is responsible for much of the mechanical strength of the hair fiber. A healthy cuticle is more than just a protective layer, as the cuticle also controls the water content of the fiber. Much of the shine that makes healthy hair so attractive is due to the cuticle. In the hair industry, the only way to obtain the very best hair (with cuticle intact and facing the same direction) is to use the services of "hair collectors," who cut the hair directly from people's heads, and bundle it as ponytails. This hair is called virgin cuticle hair, or just cuticle hair.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Hair extensions made of true virgin, raw (cuticle hair) have the most durability and ease of use as the integrity of the hair has not been broken or altered by the method of collection. This continues to be true if this hair is then simply wefted or sewn on a track, without any processed chemical or steamed done on the hair.

====Human hair industry====

The selling of human hair for weaves, wigs, and other hair styling products is an industry that generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually and is growing as a large export economy in some Asian countries, such as India, at a rate of 10–30 percent annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/alibaba-has-hair-raising-business-plans-for-india-113120700691_1.html |title=Alibaba has hair-raising business plans for India |journal=Business Standard India |date=2013-12-07 |accessdate=2014-04-08|last1=Mookerji |first1=Nivedita }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tandfonline1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13688790801971548|title=The zombie commodity: Hair and the politics of its globalization |journal=Postcolonial Studies|volume=11|pages=63–84 |year=2008 |last1=Berry |first1=Esther R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, a large portion of the hair is sourced from Hindu temples where hair is donated for religious practices, particularly in honor of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]]. This hair is highly sought out for its 'virgin', untreated qualities, as well as its great length. From there the hair is cleaned and the color is removed before being re-dyed for international style tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Homa Khaleeli |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/28/hair-extension-global-trade-secrets |title=The hair trade's dirty secret &amp;#124; Life and style |journal=The Guardian |location=London |date= 2012-10-28|access-date=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://columbianewsservice.com/2013/02/americas-booming-market-for-human-hair/ |title=Blog Archive » America's Booming Market for Human Hair |publisher=Columbia News Service |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405141334/http://columbianewsservice.com/2013/02/americas-booming-market-for-human-hair/ |archivedate=2014-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color, texture and quality==

===Color===
'''Artificial hair colors:'''

Manufacturers of artificial hair use a standard scale to classify the hair by color. The lower the number on the package, generally, the darker the color. 1 usually denotes darkest black, and would become lighter with increasing number value, ending at the lightest blonde, then finally white. These colors vary greatly from one manufacturer to another, and certain specialty hair suppliers also create their own signature patterns and colors.

'''Human hair colors:'''

Come in an endless variety from platinum blonde to darkest natural black. True raw blonde human hair is scarce and is highly sought after.

=== Textures of human and artificial hair ===

Textures of artificial hair vary from very straight to extremely curly, or kinky. The exact names of curl patterns vary by brand, and the possibilities of curl patterns with synthetic hair are endless, but some examples of packaged textures include:
*Silky straight - straight and smooth, East Asian like hair.
*Yaki - straight, usually mimicking the texture of relaxed Afro-Caribbean hair.
*Deep wave - while generally not a true 'wave',  it can be made to look like spiral curls/3a hair.
*Loose deep wave or romance wave - looser version of the deep wave, softer, more romantic curls.
*Kinky curly (very tightly coiled "s" or "z" shaped curl pattern ) - often used to recreate the look of natural Afro-Caribbean hair.
*Wet and wavy, can be packaged as Spanish wave or Indian wave - usually human hair is used, and is either naturally curly or permanently waved to appear so. Characterized as having soft, natural-looking curls that revert to a curly state when wet, characteristic of South Asian and Latin American hair.

Textures of human hair vary from very straight to extremely curly or kinky, and all the naturally occurring textures that are in-between. The exact curl patterns vary by person and so the possibilities of curl patterns with true raw hair are endless.
*Coarse or smooth straight - Straight with or without a wave.
*Curly wave - similar to the look and feel of spiral curls/3a hair.
*Deep wave - looser version of the deep wave.
*Kinky curly (very tightly coiled "s" or "z" shaped curl pattern ) - It is often used to recreate the look of natural Afro-Caribbean hair.

===Hair preparation terminology===

* Virgin hair is hair that hasn't been colored or processed in any way and may or may not still be growing from the head. This should include any steam processes. 
* Raw hair is hair that also has not been colored or processed in any way. This includes steam processes. Some consider this to be less evasive and not actually processed as the raw or virgin undergoes a multiple day steaming process to create long-lasting curls or wave patterns without the damage of chemicals. This process guarantees consistent curls and waves that has a uniform texture. ''Premium raw or virgin hair has had absolutely no processes of any sort including steam done on the hair. This is essential as true premium raw/virgin hair has a naturally occurring texture that when matched to the owner of the raw/virgin hair extensions creates a look that is unbeatable  in look and feel.'' 
* Remy hair is the modern spelling of the word 'remis' which was derived from the French verb 'remettre', meaning 'put back'. Its historical meaning is that all hair (human or animal) in any given bundle  has been 'put back' to the original direction it grew in (i.e. there were (but are no longer) any 'upside down' (inverted) hair in any given bundle). All hair has been re-aligned root to point (tip). Over time its spelling along with its meaning has changed. Today's 'remy' meaning is that the hair was never inverted in the first place. Rather, it was cut from the donor and kept in its original grown alignment. However, this 'remy' word bears little relevance as to whether a bundle of hair is remy or not due to the majority of factories selling incorrectly labelled products. The hair gets passed on as remy due to most people, including hair professionals, being unable to detect the difference. It requires the ability to feel the cuticles which is a highly skilled and learned technique. The result is that the word 'remy' has gone wayside and if a bundle of hair is labelled as such, in reality it is likely not remy. The production of remy hair preparation requires excess labor and skill. Furthermore, 'remy' hair produced in factories has all been acid treated to remove a large portion of the cuticles. This minimizes tangling leaving the western hair supplier, and eventual client, thinking that it is 'remy', never learning how to feel the cuticles and misguided in general as to the real meaning of the word.
* Single drawn or double drawn hair may be produced from any ponytail or group of ponytails. The single drawn bundles will result in only the shortest hairs being removed from the original ponytail. The amount of shortest hairs removed depends upon the hair preparers (workers) instructions. The equipment used is a hackle and not a drawing board (or drawing mat). The single drawn hair bundle will contain a variety of different hair strand lengths, only the very shortest having been removed. It is commonplace in the hair extension industry to call any hair 'single drawn' regardless of whether it has been drawn at all. The quality of the hair itself is irrelevant to the drawing process. It is generally of a lower price bracket than double-drawn hair due to shorter hair still being contained within.
* Double drawn indicates the manual hand process of sorting any given amount of hair into its various lengths and later retying accordingly into new bundles. The equipment used is a pair of drawing boards (or drawing mats). The result being that each new bundle formed contains only the same lengths of hair strands. The term 'double' is used because the process involves drawing (pulling out) the hair from drawing boards (or drawing mats) twice. The hair is drawn first in one direction and then afterwards in the other direction. Double drawn hair will have (nearly) as many hair strands at one end as the other and appear much thicker and not wispy at the end. This process is very laborious, and therefore makes the hair very expensive. There are not many articles available to explain this precise procedure due to industry secrecy. It is commonplace in the hair extension industry to call any hair 'double drawn', even when it isn't. It is likely that hair labeled as 'double drawn' has not been drawn at all.

==Methods of integration==
[[File:Young Woman (Adriana) at Tourist Office - Cachoeira - Bahia - Brazil.JPG|thumb|A young woman with multi-colored extensions braided into her hair]]
The misnomer of 'tracks' comes from the common, long-lasting method of integrating wefts, known as the 'track and sew' method. The 'tracks' are usually cornrows, braided in the direction of how the hair will fall. Toward the face or away, with or without a part, the tracks build the foundation of how the end result will look. The wefts are then sewn onto the braids, usually with a specially made, blunt-ended needle. The needle can be curved or straight. There are many different colors of specially-made thread to choose from, depending on what color of hair you will be integrating. Darker hair lends to darker thread. It should also be noted that when the hair is braided at a high level of tension, the client is at risk for [[traction alopecia]].

Wefts may also be bonded directly to the clients hair using special bonding glue. Care must be taken not to bond the wefts directly to the scalp, as it can cause sensitivities in some clients. A [[patch test]] is frequently recommended, as per manufacturer's directions. Glue has become less popular since it was discovered that glue can cause severe and often permanent health issues such as headaches, bald spots and dermatitis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tarrant |first1=Jacqueline |title=IS HAIR GLUE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH? |url=https://blackdoctor.org/4089/is-hair-glue-hazardous-to-your-health__trashed/ |website=BlackDoctor.org |publisher=BlackDoctor |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The "invisible part" is a technique used by hair stylists that hides any evidence that the person is wearing an extension. The extension will appear as if it is growing directly from the person's scalp. This look can be achieved with either the sew-in or glue method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruddock |first1=Alma |title=How To Do “Invisible Part” Weaves – Two Methods Of Installation |url=https://blackhairinformation.com/hair-care-2/styling/invisible-part-weaves-two-methods-installation/ |website=blackhairinformation.com |publisher=Black Hair Information |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This technique allows a long lasting method of attaching commercial hair to the natural hair. Application generally takes about an hour. It will last about 8 weeks.

Bulk hair can also be bonded to the hair, using many different methods, from clips to adhesive.

In the South East Asian Region, the practical method of lengthening-re-bondage has been in use since the mid-19th century.  The lengthening-re-bondage method consists of two treatments.  The first treatment consists of re bonding and ironing.  The second treatment of lengthening-re bondage involves gentle pulling and tugging of the hair.  These two treatments are highly effective in lengthening hair without causing serious damage.

Bulk hair can also be added with thread if bonding is not suitable. This may be because the wearer has excessively oily hair or because there is a need to wash hair daily.  Adding hair extensions with thread means that damage to the natural hair can be avoided and that the hair extension attachment areas are not vulnerable to external elements like heat, oils and water.

==Shampooing and styling of integrations==
Shampooing of artificial hair integrations can be as easy as shampooing real hair, with some considerations. For instance, many manufacturers suggest using a mild shampoo, or even a wig shampoo.

Directions included with the integrations may indicate what type of shampoo to use; the methods of brushing, combing and drying that are most advisable; and what heat setting to use when drying the hair, or if it is even advisable to do so.

The same care taken when shampooing must also be used when styling artificial hair. It is often recommended that the texture of hair purchased should be the style in which the hair is worn. Using heat to [[straighten curly hair]], or to curl straight hair, damages it. The more damage the hair sustains, the shorter the lifespan of the artificial hair.

Most human hair extensions can be treated as real hair, albeit more gently. *Since human hair extensions are usually heavily processed to achieve uniform color and texture, a mild shampoo is recommended, along with a light conditioner to reduce tangling. When shampooing it is suggested that a sulfate and alcohol free product be used, since those contents cause frizz and dry out the hair. Cool water is also recommended when shampooing, to reduce or prevent matting and excessive tangling. Having to remove snarls and tangles loosens the foundation of the integrations and further damages the hair. It is best to shampoo the hair in a top down motion.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;An important factor concerning the care of true, raw (remy, virgin) human hair extensions, since this hair has had absolutely no processes, chemical or steam done, is that these extensions are simply human hair and can be simply shampooed or washed as much as desired.

'''Buda''' (or '''bouda'''), in [[Ethiopia]]n [[folk religion]], is the power of the [[evil eye]] and the ability to [[werehyena|change into a hyena]].  Buda is generally believed to be a power held and wielded by those in a different social group, for example among the [[Beta Israel]] or metalworkers.&lt;ref name="finneran"&gt;Finneran, Niall. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_3_114/ai_n6118470/ Ethiopian Evil Eye Belief and the Magical Symbolism of Iron Working.]" ''Folklore'', Vol. 114, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wagaw"&gt;Wagaw, Teshome G. ''For Our Soul: Ethiopian Jews in Israel''.  Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|20-21}}  The belief is also present in [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], and among the [[Berber people]] in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="woodward"&gt;{{cite book | author= Woodward, Ian | title=The Werewolf Delusion | year=1979 | isbn= 0-448-23170-0 | page= 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in the evil eye, or buda, is widespread in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, John W. "Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity: Faith and practices". ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]''. Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds. Washington: Library of Congress Federal Research Division, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Beta Israel, or Ethiopian Jews, are often characterized by others as possessing buda.&lt;ref name="wagaw" /&gt;{{Rp|20-21}}  Other castes such as ironworkers are often labeled as bearing the buda.&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;  In fact, the word for manual worker, ''tabib'', is also used to denote "one with the evil eye."&lt;ref name="beckwith"&gt;Beckwith, Carol, Angela Fisher, and Graham Hancock. ''African Ark''. New York: Henry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|49}}  The alleged evil power of the tabib is believed to be at a level similar to that of [[Witchcraft|witches]].&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;

Buda's alleged prevalence among outsiders correlates with the traditional belief that evil eye curses themselves are rooted in envy.  As such, those allegedly possessing the power of buda might do so because of malevolent spirits.  One study specifies that they are believed to be "empowered by evil spirit".&lt;ref name="geleta"&gt;Geleta, Amsalu Tadesse.  "[http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html Case Study: Demonization and the Practice of Exorcism in Ethiopian Churches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101104543/http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html |date=2010-01-01 }}".  Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, Nairobi, August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Niall Finneran describes how "the idea of magical creation underpins the perception of artisans in Ethiopia and in the wider African context. In many cases these skills have been acquired originally from an elemental source of evil via the paternal lineage, rather like a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian pact]]."&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;  The power of the evil eye allows its bearer to change into a [[hyena]], allowing him or her to attack another person while concealing his or her human identity.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

Some Ethiopian Christians carry an [[amulet]] or talisman, known as a ''[[kitab]]'', or will invoke God's name, to ward off the ill effects of buda.&lt;ref name="kemp"&gt;Kemp, Charles.  "[http://bearspace.baylor.edu/Charles_Kemp/www/ethiopian_refugees.htm Ethiopians &amp; Eritreans.]"  ''Refugee Health – Immigrant Health''. Waco, TX: Baylor University.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[debtera]], who is either an unordained priest or educated layperson, will create these protective amulets or talismans.&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] priests continue to intervene and perform exorcisms on behalf of those believed to be afflicted by demons or buda.  Such persons are brought to a church or prayer meeting.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;  Amsalu Geleta, in a modern case study, relates elements that are common to Ethiopian Christian exorcisms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It includes singing praise and victory songs, reading from the Scripture, prayer and confronting the spirit in the name of Jesus. Dialogue with the spirit is another important part of the exorcism ceremony. It helps the counselor (exorcist) to know how the spirit was operating in the life of the demoniac. The signs and events mentioned by the spirit are affirmed by the victim after deliverance.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exorcism is not always successful, and Geleta notes another instance in which the usual methods were unsuccessful, and the demons apparently left the subject at a later time.  In any event, "in all cases the spirit is commanded in no other name than the name of Jesus."&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

The '''Chipstone Foundation''' is a [[Wisconsin]]-based foundation dedicated to promoting American decorative arts scholarship. Originating from the private collection of Stanley and Polly Stone, the foundation uses its objects and resources to support decorative arts projects and publications at other institutions, seeking to find "newer ways to look at old things.".&lt;ref&gt;Chipstone Foundation website, www.chipstone.org, March 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1999, the Chipstone Foundation partnered with the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], thereby making many of Chipstone's significant holdings on view for public display.

The Chipstone Foundation publishes two significant annual scholarly journals: ''American Furniture'' and ''Ceramics in America''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chipstone.org/framesetpublications.html The Chipstone Journals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107102445/http://www.chipstone.org/framesetpublications.html |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also has an association with the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Together they created an academic program that explores multiple approaches to the study of American material culture by bringing together scholars from other departments at the University, including history, art, African studies, design, and literature.

The '''Chiesa del Sacro Cuore''' ("Church of the Holy Heart") is a [[Catholic]] Church located in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

== Historical hints  ==
The [[parish]] of the Holy Heart of Jesus was established by the [[bishop of Trapani]], monsignor Ricceri, on October 4, 1967.&lt;ref name=gui&gt;Carlo Cataldo: Guida Storico-Artistica dei Beni Culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare del Golfo-Salemi-Vita; Sarograf, Alcamo, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years before the Episcopal [[Curia (Catholic Church)]] of Trapani had bought a piece of land to build a Church which was to serve the new area that was expanding next to Viale Europa.

They started with a [[prefabricated]] structure, with a roof  in asbestos cement, a hall and two rooms;&lt;ref name=alpa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpauno.com/alcamo-padre-viola-traguardo-dei-60-anni-di-sacerdozio/#.V8WetzWs9Z8|author=Alpauno.com|website=alpauno.com|title=Alcamo-Padre Viola, traguardo dei 60 anni di sacerdozio|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978 they built the [[parsonage]] and other premises for the parish, but they had to wait until 1982 to start the real building which included the Church and the hall below it.

In 1987 Vincenzo Settipani, an architect, substituted Li Santi, who had died; he designed the [[mosaics]], the [[Stained Glass Windows|stained glasses]], the [[holy water stoups]], the [[Baptismal font]],the [[Ambon (liturgy)|ambon]] and the altar. They were realized by the firm Pierotti from [[Pietrasanta]] (in the [[province of Lucca]]) and by the mosaicist Fabriano Fabret; the artistic and huge wooden [[confessional]] was made by the firm Gaspare Ferrantelli.&lt;ref name=regi&gt;Vincenzo Regina: La chiesa parrocchiale del Sacro Cuore di Gesù in Alcamo e il suo primo parroco; ed. Campo, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
The Church was completed in 1991 and was consecrated in 1993.&lt;ref name=gui/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: S Chledowski Arms.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Stephen Chłędowski coat of arms:bestowed by [[Elizabeth II]] Queen of Canada]] --&gt;
This noble family traces its origins to the territorial County of Gniezno in the Voivodeship of Greater Poland. There in the administrative district of Gmina Witkowo is the village of [[Chłądowo]]. In 1692 Chłądowo (at the time called Chłędowo) was owned by the Chłędowski family. This branch of the family belongs to the [[Gryf]] Clan.  

Seweryn Chłędowski, a prominent member of the family purchased  the estates of [[Wietrzno]] in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] in 1810. From this branch Freiherr Adam von Chłędowski of the [[Bończa coat of arms|Bończa]] Clan married Ida Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen, the adopted daughter of Count Franz Simon Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen (1753–1840). From this marriage issued 2 sons Ludwig and Casimir, who received from Emperor [[Francis Joseph I]] the hereditary title of Baron and the right to use the name Chłędowski von Pfaffenhofen.

The '''[[Coat of arms]] of [[Lisbon]]''' is composed of a [[Or (heraldry)|golden]] shield with a [[Sable (heraldry)|black]] [[Argent|silver]] lined sail ship on a sea of seven wavy stripes [[Vert (heraldry)|green]] and silver. At both ends of the ship, two [[raven]]s, each pointing to the center of the shield. A golden mural crown of five towers (indicating [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[city]] status respectively) surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]] and by a white scroll with the motto "''MUI NOBRE E SEMPRE LEAL CIDADE DE LISBOA''" (most noble and always loyal city of Lisbon) in black.

The image on the coat of arms commemorates the transfer of the [[relic]]s of Saint [[Vincent of Saragossa]] from [[Cape St. Vincent]] to Lisbon.  According to legend, after he was martyred, ravens protected St. Vincent's body from being devoured by wild animals, until his followers could recover the body.  A shrine was erected over his grave, which continued to be guarded by flocks of ravens.  King [[Afonso Henriques]] (1139–1185) had the body of the saint exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to the [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora]] in Lisbon, still accompanied by the ravens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Purcell |first=Mary |title=Saint Anthony and His Times |year=1960 |publisher=Hanover House |location=Garden City, New York |pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Édouard Manet - Toter Uhu.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''''Dead Eagle Owl'''''&lt;br/&gt;[[Édouard Manet]], 1881&lt;br/&gt;97 × 64&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br/&gt;Oil&amp;nbsp;on canvas&lt;br/&gt;[[Foundation E.G. Bührle]], [[Zurich]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''''Dead Eagle Owl''''' (French: '''''Le Grand-duc''''') is an 1881 oil-on-canvas painting by [[Édouard Manet]]. One of the very few hunting [[still life]]s in Manet's oeuvre, it depicts a dead [[Eurasian eagle-owl]] hanging upside down on a board as a hunting trophy. ''Dead Eagle Owl'' is one of a series of comparable still lifes that Manet painted in the same year in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], during his recuperation from a serious illness. There are precedents for this morbid work in French still-life painting of the 18th century and Dutch still-life painting of the 17th century (i.e. [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]] and [[Jan Baptist Weenix|Weenix]]). The painting is in the collection of the [[Foundation E.G. Bührle]] in Zurich.

{{In popular culture|date=May 2018}}
"'''Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep'''" is a [[poem]] written in 1932 by [[Mary Elizabeth Frye]]. Although the origin of the poem was disputed until later in her life, Mary Frye's authorship was confirmed in 1998 after research by [[Abigail Van Buren]], a newspaper columnist.&lt;ref name="timesobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mary E. Frye|date=5 November 2004|newspaper=The Times|location=London, United Kingdom|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2077955.ece|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There have been many claimants to the poem's authorship, including attributions to traditional and Native American origins. ''[[Dear Abby]]'' author [[Pauline Phillips|Abigail Van Buren]] researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that [[Mary Elizabeth Frye]], who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, but she had been warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never had the chance to "stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on a brown paper shopping bag. Later she said that the words "just came to her" and expressed what she felt about life and death.&lt;ref name="timesobit"/&gt;

Frye circulated the poem privately, never publishing or copyrighting it. She wrote other poems, but this, her first, endured. Her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' stated that she was the author of the famous poem, which has been recited at funerals and on other appropriate occasions around the world for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary|journal=London Magazine|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was introduced to many in the United Kingdom when it was read by the father of a soldier killed by a bomb in [[Northern Ireland]]. The soldier's father read the poem on BBC radio in 1995 in remembrance of his son, who had left the poem among his personal effects in an envelope addressed 'To all my loved ones'.

The poem is common reading for funerals.

==BBC poll==
To coincide with National Poetry Day 1995, the British television programme ''The Bookworm'' conducted a poll to discover the nation's favourite poems, and subsequently published the winning poems in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Nation's Favourite Poems| year=1996| publisher=BBC Books| isbn=978-0-563-38782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book's preface stated that "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" was "the unexpected poetry success of the year from Bookworm's point of view"; the poem had "provoked an extraordinary response... the requests started coming in almost immediately and over the following weeks the demand rose to a total of some thirty thousand. In some respects it became the nation's favourite poem by proxy... despite it being outside the competition."&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Stephens. [http://www.royblakeley.name/larry_blakeley/poetry/who_did_write_Geoff_Stephens200210.pdf "Who DID Write the Nation's Favourite Poem?"] October 2002. Retrieved November 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This was all the more remarkable, since the name and nationality of the American poet did not become known until several years later. In 2004 ''[[The Times]]'' wrote: "The verse demonstrated a remarkable power to soothe loss. It became popular, crossing national boundaries for use on bereavement cards and at funerals regardless of race, religion or social status".&lt;ref name="timesobit"/&gt;

==Translations==
The poem has been translated into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: "Gråt ej vid min grav..." Translated, it reads: "Do not weep at my grave - I am not there / I am in the sun's reflection in the sea / I am in the wind's play above the grain fields / I am in the autumn's gentle rain / I am in the [[Milky Way]]'s string of stars / And when on an early morning you are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again." (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: "I am not dead. I only left".)

Every so often the poem and similar variations appear in death and funeral announcements in Swedish morning papers (such as ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' August 14, 2010). On August 29, 2010, the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' carried the following short English version: "I am thousand winds that blow / I am the diamond glints on snow / I am the sunlight, I am the rain / Do not stand on my grave and cry / I am not there / I did not die".

==Derivative works==
Several notable choral compositions, pop songs, and other creative works have been based on "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep", adapting lines from Frye's poem as lyrics.

*''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' (song by Monks of Doom): Parts of "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" are interpolated with the lyrics to the rock song "The Better Angels of Our Nature," from the 1991 [[Monks of Doom]] album ''Meridian.''
*''Requiem'' (composition by Eleanor Joanne Daley): [[Eleanor Joanne Daley]]'s ''Requiem'' (1993) includes a movement titled "In Remembrance", which uses the poem as its text. The movement has also been published as a stand-alone work.
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (Epitaph by Maria Newman): The poem was set by violinist/violist &amp; composer [[Maria Newman]] in 1998 for soprano, violin, viola &amp; piano and subsequently set in 2014 for mezzo-soprano, violin, viola &amp; piano. It is part of Newman's  song cycle, [[Songs On Motherhood]] in G Major, Op. 36, No. 2: V. In Newman's setting the poem clearly states that death is not an end, but a metamorphosis that makes possible a melding with our physical earth and metaphysical surroundings. In this final movement, the voice emerges with a prayerful plainchant, as the tutti ensemble blossoms into the movement proper.
*"The Ballad of Mairéad Farrell" (song by Seanchai and the Unity Squad): On [[Seanchai and the Unity Squad]]'s 1998 album ''Rebel Hip Hop'', the song "The Ballad of Mairéad Farrell" tells the story of [[Mairéad Farrell]], a member of the [[Irish Republican Army]], and her imprisonment and eventual death at the hands of British security forces in [[Gibraltar]]. The song uses the opening couplet from the poem, and alters the closing couplet to say, "Do not stand at my grave and cry / When Ireland lives, I do not die."
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (song by Alias Grace): On ''Embers'', the 1998 debut album by British ambient folk duo Alias Grace ([[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]] and Sandra O'Neill), the closing track is a straight setting of the original poem for piano, voice, guitar and [[Chapman Stick]].
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (composition by Paul K. Joyce): At the request of a friend who had been diagnosed with cancer, composer [[Paul K. Joyce]] wrote a song for her funeral, setting the text of "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" to music. Joyce subsequently incorporated the composition into a larger [[oratorio]] (1998) and the score for a [[BBC]] adaptation of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesnowqueenpkj.com/ |title=The Snow Queen - A magical adventure told through songs and poems.

*"Prayer" (song by Lizzie West): Songwriter [[Lizzie West]] recorded a modified version of the poem in her 2003 album ''Holy Road: Freedom Songs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

*''To All My Loved Ones'' ("Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep"): The words were set to music by songwriter [[Geoff Stephens]] and the song was first performed at the 2003 Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. It was recorded by classical singer [[Katherine Jenkins]] and released on her album ''[[Living a Dream]]''.
*''In Every Lovely Thing'' ("Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep"): In 2003 songwriter Timothy J. Erskine set a modified version of the poem including a new final stanza to music and produced a recording sung by Holly Phaneuf Erskine. The recording was re-released for download in 2017.
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (choral composition by Joseph Twist): In 2004, Australian composer [[Joseph Twist]] set the poem to music for [[a cappella]] voices (SATB div) with slight alterations to the words. This arrangement was commissioned by and subsequently dedicated to Graeme Morton and the National Youth Choir of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/workversion/twist-joseph-do-not-stand-at-my-grave-and-weep/25235 |title=Do not stand at my grave and weep : SATB choir by Joseph Twist : Work |publisher=Australian Music Centre |date=2013-05-04 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (choral song by Libera): [[Robert Prizeman]], musical director of the all-boy English vocal group [[Libera (choir)|Libera]], set this poem to music. The song used the same title as the poem and was included on Libera's 2004 album ''[[Free (Libera album)|Free]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

*"A Thousand Winds" (song by Man Arai): [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Man Arai]] translated the poem into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and composed the song "{{nihongo2|千の風になって}}" (translation: "Become A Thousand Winds"), originally sung by Man Arai himself. Other singers later covered the song, among them Japanese [[tenor]] [[Masafumi Akikawa]]. The tenor made the song popular after performing it during the [[57th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen]] on December 31, 2006. In January 2007, it became the first [[classical music]] piece to top the [[Oricon]] weekly singles chart and became the first classical music piece to top the Oricon yearly singles chart. Another version of this song appeared on [[Hayley Westenra]]'s 2008 album ''[[Hayley Sings Japanese Songs]]'' (with the title "Sen No Kaze Ni Natte").
*"The Soft Stars that Shine at Night" (choral composition by David Bedford): In 2006, several choirs in the United Kingdom commissioned a choral work from [[David Bedford]] through the organization [[Making Music (National Federation of Music Societies)|Making Music]]. The resulting piece, entitled ''The Soft Stars that Shine at Night'', was first performed in 2007. Its last movement is a setting of this poem, with slight alterations to the words.
*''Eternal Light: A Requiem'' (composition by Howard Goodall): [[Howard Goodall]]'s choral orchestral work ''Eternal Light: A Requiem'' was recorded in 2008 with the Choir of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]. "Do not stand" is in the Lacrymosa which is track 5.
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (song by Harry Manx and Kevin Breit): A song of this title, with lyrics adapted from the poem, appears on the album ''Strictly Whatever'' by the duo [[Harry Manx]] and [[Kevin Breit]]. The album was released in May 2011.

'''Empik''' (stylised as '''empík''') is a [[Poland|Polish]] commercial chain selling [[book]]s, international [[Print media|press]] and media products (including film, music, and software). The chain also owns a photo company, Empik Foto, as well as a foreign language school, Empik School.

==History ==
EMPiK chain began during Poland's communist period as KMPiK ({{lang-pl|Klub Międzynarodowej Prasy i Książki}}, the International Press and Book Club) owned by the [[Prasa-Książka-Ruch]] monopoly which financed the [[PZPR]] Party from its revenue. In 1991 it was acquired by businessmen Jacek Dębski, Janusz Romanowski (a former reserve police officer) and [[Yaron Bruckner]], and given its current name. While initially it was partially owned by the Polish state,  in 1994 it was sold completely by the [[State Treasury]] to Bruckner's [[Eastbridge N.V.]]. In May 2009 EMPiK had 134 stores in Poland and 23 stores in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;From Polish Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endre Szemerédi''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɛndrɛ ˈsɛmɛreːdi|lang}}; born August 21, 1940) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=532617|title=Magyar tudós kapta a matematika Nobel-díját|publisher=[[Népszava]]|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]], working in the field of [[combinatorics]] and [[theoretical computer science]]. He has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986. He also holds a professor emeritus status at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

Szemerédi has won prizes in mathematics and science, including the [[Abel Prize]] in 2012. He has made a number of discoveries in combinatorics and computer science, including [[Szemerédi's theorem]], the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], the [[Erdős–Szemerédi theorem]], the [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] and the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]].

==Early life==
Szemerédi was born in [[Budapest]]. Since his parents wished him to become a doctor, Szemerédi enrolled at a college of medicine, but he dropped out after six months (in an interview&lt;ref&gt;By Gabor Stockert&lt;/ref&gt; he explained it: "I was not sure I could do work bearing such responsibility.").&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{citation|first1=Martin|last1=Raussen|first2=Christian|last2=Skau|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201302/rnoti-p221.pdf|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|title=Interview with Endre Szemerédi|volume=60|year=2013|issue=2|pages=221–231|doi=10.1090/noti948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/blog/laureate/endre-szemeredi/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/16108/1/SR%2050%282%29%2016-18.pdf Sunita Chand; Ramesh Chandra Parida . ''Science Reporter'', February 2013, p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in Budapest and received his PhD from [[Moscow State University]]. His adviser was [[Israel Gelfand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=70200}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stemmed from a misspelling, as Szemerédi originally wanted to study with [[Alexander Gelfond]].&lt;ref name="ams"/&gt;

==Academic career==
Szemerédi has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986. He has held visiting positions at [[Stanford University]] (1974), [[McGill University]] (1980), the [[University of South Carolina]] (1981–1983) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1985–1986).

==Work==
Endre Szemerédi has published over 200 scientific articles in the fields of discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, arithmetic combinatorics and discrete geometry. He is best known for his proof from 1975 of an old conjecture of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]]: if a sequence of natural numbers has positive [[upper density]] then it contains arbitrarily long [[arithmetic progression]]s. This is now known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]]. One of the lemmas introduced in his proof is now known as the [[Szemerédi regularity lemma]], which has become an important lemma in [[combinatorics]], being used for instance in [[property testing]] for graphs and in the theory of [[graph limit]]s.

He is also known for the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]] in [[Incidence geometry (structure)|incidence geometry]] and the [[Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem]] in [[graph theory]]. [[Miklós Ajtai]] and Szemerédi proved the [[corners theorem]], an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the [[Szemerédi's theorem|Szemerédi theorem]]. With Ajtai and [[János Komlós (mathematician)|János Komlós]] he proved the ''ct''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/log ''t'' upper bound for the [[Ramsey number]] ''R''(3,''t''), and constructed a [[sorting network]] of optimal depth. With Ajtai, [[Václav Chvátal]], and [[Monty Newborn|Monroe M. Newborn]], Szemerédi proved the famous Crossing Lemma, that a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges, where {{nowrap|''m'' &gt; 4''n''}} has at least {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / 64''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[Crossing lemma|crossings]].  With [[Paul Erdős]], he proved the [[Erdős–Szemerédi theorem]] on the number of sums and products in a finite set. With Wolfgang Paul, [[Nick Pippenger]], and [[William T. Trotter|William Trotter]], he established a separation between [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|nondeterministic]] [[linear time]] and [[Deterministic computation|deterministic]] linear time, in the spirit of the infamous [[P versus NP problem]].

==Awards and honors==
Szemerédi has won numerous awards and honors for his contribution to mathematics and computer science. A few of them are listed here:
* Grünwald Prize (1967)
* Grünwald Prize (1968)
* [[Alfréd Rényi Prize|Rényi Prize]] (1973)
* [[George Pólya Prize]] for Achievement in Applied Mathematics (SIAM), (1975)
* Prize of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1979)
* State of New Jersey Professorship (1986)
* The [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Seminal Contribution to Research (AMS), (2008)
* The Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics for deep and pioneering work from 1975 on arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers (2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.hu/index.php?id=858&amp;tt_news=7654 Major US Maths Prize Given to HAS Full Member]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, January 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Széchenyi Prize]] of the Hungarian Republic for his many fundamental contributions to mathematics and computer science (2012)

Szemerédi is a corresponding member (1982), and member (1987) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and a member (2010) of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. He is also a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and a permanent research fellow at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] in Budapest.  He was the Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1987–88.
He is an honorary doctor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/conferences/endrehc/|title=Doctor honoris causa Endre Szemerédi|date=June 15–16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].
He was the lecturer in the Forty-Seventh Annual DeLong Lecture Series&lt;ref name=delong&gt;[http://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/delong/ DeLong Lecture Series]. Math.colorado.edu. Retrieved on March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Colorado]].  He is also a recipient of the Aisenstadt Chair at CRM,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Chaires/chairesPrec_an.shtml Aisenstadt Chair Recipients]. Crm.umontreal.ca. Retrieved on March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Montreal]]. In 2008 he was the Eisenbud Professor at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]].

In 2012, Szemerédi was awarded the [[Abel Prize]] “for his fundamental contributions to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, and in recognition of the profound and lasting impact of these contributions on [[additive number theory]] and [[ergodic theory]]”&lt;ref name=abel&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian-American Endre Szemerédi named Abel Prize winner|url=http://www.abelprize.no/nyheter/vis.html?tid=54138|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abel Prize citation also credited Szemerédi with bringing combinatorics to the centre-stage of mathematics and noted his place in the tradition of Hungarian mathematicians such as [[George Pólya]] who emphasized a problem-solving approach to mathematics.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramachandran|first=R.|title=Hungarian mathematician Endre Szemerédi gets 2012 Abel Prize|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article3025783.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szemerédi reacted to the announcement by saying that "It is not my own personal achievement, but recognition for this field of mathematics and Hungarian mathematicians," that gave him the most pleasure.&lt;ref name=nj.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellis-Nutt|first=Amy|title=Rutgers math professor's discovery earns prestigious award, $1M prize|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/rutgers_math_professors_discov.html|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=NJ.com|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''English Short Title Catalogue''' ('''ESTC''') is a [[Union catalog|union]] [[short-title catalogue]] of works published between 1473 and 1800, in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and its former colonies, notably those in North America, and primarily in [[English language|English]], drawing on the collections of the [[British Library]] and other libraries in Britain and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://estc.ucr.edu/ | title = English Short-Title Catalog (1473-1800) North America | work = University of California | accessdate = 2007-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-managed by the British Library and the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research (CBSR) at the [[University of California, Riverside]]. The database is freely searchable.

==History==
The ESTC began life as the '''Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue''', with the same abbreviation, covering only 1701 to 1800. Earlier printed works had been catalogued in [[Alfred W. Pollard|A. W. Pollard]] and [[Gilbert Richard Redgrave|G. R. Redgrave]]'s ''Short Title Catalogue'' (1st edn 1926; 2nd edn, 1976–91) for the period 1473 to 1640; and [[Donald Goddard Wing]]'s similarly titled bibliography (1945–51, with later supplements and addenda) for the period 1641 to 1700. These works were eventually incorporated into the database.

{{other uses|Exposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Narrative exposition''' is the insertion of important background information within a [[narrative|story]]; for example, information about the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]], characters' [[backstory|backstories]], prior plot events, historical context, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= |year=2009|title=Kaplan SAT Subject Test: Literature 2009–2010 Edition|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|page=60|isbn=1-4195-5261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a specifically literary context, exposition appears in the form of [[expository writing]] embedded within the narrative. Exposition is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[description]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narrative mode|narration]], as elucidated by [[Alexander Bain]] and John Genung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Carlota S.|title=Modes of Discourse: The Local Structure of Texts|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78169-5|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/?id=okPPSq1G1OQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=Bain+and+genung#v=onepage&amp;q=Bain%20and%20genung&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the rhetorical modes is present in a variety of forms, and each has its own purpose and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]]. There are several ways to accomplish exposition.

&lt;!-- THIS SECTION ACTUALLY IS ABOUT "INCLUING"—NOT "INCLUDING."  PLEASE READ THE ARTICLE BEFORE EDITING. --&gt;
'''Indirect exposition''', sometimes called '''incluing''', is a technique of [[worldbuilding]] in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to ''clue'' the readers in to the world the author is building without them being aware of it. This can be done in a number of ways: through [[Dialogue in writing|dialogues]], [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], characters' thoughts,&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51" /&gt; background details, [[in-universe]] media,&lt;ref name="Morrell 2006 64"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing|first=Jessica Page|last=Morrell |publisher=Writer's Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|page=64|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58297-393-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the narrator telling a [[backstory]].&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51"&gt;{{cite book|title=Plot|first=Ansen|last=Dibell|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, OH|year= 1988|isbn=0-89879-303-3|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|title=Building Better Plots|first=Robert|last=Kernen|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, Ohio|page=51|year=1999|isbn=0-89879-903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of saying "I am a woman", a first person narrator can say "I kept the papers inside my purse." The reader (in most English-speaking cultures) now knows the character is probably female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rachelsimon.com/wwg_exposition_v2.php The Writer's Writing Guide: Exposition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified, in the modern literary world, in the writing of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In his stories set in [[India]] like ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kiplings' [[science fiction]] stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his [[Aerial Board of Control]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=234 Rudyard Kipling Invented SF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the "Dean of Science Fiction", [[Robert A. Heinlein#Writing style|Robert Heinlein]], who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition. 

The word ''incluing'' is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author [[Jo Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Bottorff|url=http://www.lshelby.com/rasfcFAQ.html|title=rec.arts.sf.composition Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Lshelby.com|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defined it as "the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html|title=papersky: Thud: Half a Crown &amp; Incluing|publisher=Papersky.livejournal.com|date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Information dump" (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=James Scott|title=Write Great Fiction – Plot &amp; Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL1MCUXmqdcC&amp;pg=PT78|date=22 September 2004|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-684-6|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;=http://www.screenplayology.com/content-sections/screenplay-form-content/3-3/&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''idiot lecture'', characters tell each other information that needs to be explained for the purpose of the audience, but of which the characters in-universe would already be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ashmead|author2=Darrell Schweitzer|author3=George H.

[[File:"Field of the British Isles" at Salisbury Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 251484.jpg|thumb|''Field for the British Isles'' at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] in 1999 ]]

'''''Field''''' (1991) is a sculpture by [[United Kingdom|British]] artist [[Antony Gormley]]. It consists of approx. 35,000 [http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=6&amp;page=1] individual [[terracotta]] figures, each between 8 and 26&amp;nbsp;cm high, installed on the floor of a room facing the viewer. The figures were sculpted in [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], [[Mexico]] by about 60 members of a Texca family of brickmakers, under the supervision of the artist. The sculpture received a lot of media attention upon its first display, and many affectionate parodies.

''Field'' has been installed and displayed at various locations. The specific configuration is changed to suit each location, but the miniature figures are always placed to form a dense carpet with each figure looking towards the viewer. Ideally the Field is extended through a doorway or round a corner, so that the figures going out of sight leave the impression of an unlimited horde.

Several other versions of ''Field'' have subsequently been created, including
*''Amazonian Field'' (1991) made in [[Porto Velho]], [[Brazil]] (approx. 24,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=50&amp;page=1]
*''Field for the British Isles'' (1993) made in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] near [[Liverpool]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (approx. 40,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=47&amp;page=1]
*''European Field'' (1993) made in [[Östra Grevie]], [[Sweden]] (approx. 40,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=48&amp;page=1]
*''Asian Field'' (2003) made in [[Xiangshan County, Guangdong]], [[Guangdong]] province, [[People's Republic of China]] (approx. 190,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=49&amp;page=1] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034550/http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts-art-sculpture-antony-gormley-asian-field.html]
*''Field for the Art Gallery of New South Wales'' (1989) [http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=51&amp;page=1]

''Field for the British Isles'' was typical in recruiting some 100 volunteers from the pupils and their extended families, of two local schools in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]. Each volunteer was given a portion of the 30 tonnes of clay required, along with some loose instructions specifying the rough size and proportions for the figures. An accidental feature of the original Field was that Texca family involved people aged from 6 to 60 working on the figures, and Gormley felt that the involvement of three generations of a family should be continued in all the subsequent versions.

Gormley has also made several other works entitled ''Field'', but these are smaller groups of life size figures more typical of Gormley's earlier work.

In 1994, Gormley won the [[Turner prize]] with a collection of his work, including ''Field for the British Isles'', shown at the [[Tate Gallery]].

'''Frederic Lloyd''', [[OBE]] (1 July 1918 – 27 July 1995), was an English theatre manager.  Most notably, Lloyd was the General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from 1951 until its closure in 1982.

==Biography==
Lloyd was born into an ecclesiastical family near [[Oxford]], England.  During the [[Second World War]] he worked with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, the precursor of the [[Arts Council]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 23 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 he was a director of the [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and in September of that year he was appointed General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and of the [[Savoy Theatre]], in succession to Alfred Nightingale.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his D'Oyly Carte duties, Lloyd was a member of the council of management of the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and played an important part in saving the orchestra's tour of [[Americas|America]] in 1963 at a critical time in the RPO's fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1961 to 1982, Lloyd was also secretary of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust.  In 1966 he was elected President of the Theatrical Managers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 December 1966, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

With D'Oyly Carte's closure, Lloyd retired from theatre management, although he continued to sit on numerous committees.  He was chairman of the governors of the [[Royal Academy of Music]], 1980-83, and trustee and chairman of the general committee of the [[Garrick Club]], 1976-84.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  He wrote articles on [[Elgar]] and [[Beethoven]], and he collaborated with [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]] on an official history of the D'Oyly Carte Company in 1984.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

On his retirement, he moved from his London home in [[St John's Wood]] to the village of [[Strathpeffer]], Scotland, near [[Inverness]], where he became a lay-preacher at his local church.  His wife Valerie died in 1991.  They had two sons.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Lloyd died in Inverness at age 77.&lt;ref&gt;obituary: ''The Independent'' (London), 9 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''HaShir Shelanu''''' ({{lang-he|השיר שלנו}}, lit. ''Our Song'') was an [[Israel]]i daily [[comedy|comical]] [[music]]al [[telenovela]] that ran for four seasons on the [[Yes (Israel)|yes]]-5 Israeli Movie Channel (Arutz Ha'kolnoa Hayisraeli) and repeating on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]]. The last episode was broadcast in April 2007.

==General plot==
===Season 1=== 
'''118 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
Ninet ([[Ninet Tayeb]]) is a young, unknown girl from the country who comes to Tel-Aviv and works with her cousin Ronnie ([[Niv Raz]]) at his cafeteria in Yardena Tamir's ([[Alisa Rosen]]) Academy of Music. After school hours are over Ninet goes to the classroom and sings. Her talent is revealed accidentally by the music teacher, Doron Sadeh ([[Sa'ar Badishi]]) who has her enrolled in the school. Ninet falls in love with Zohar Lahat ([[Ran Danker]]) and the couple go on a rocky road towards happiness disturbed mainly by Noa Shahar ([[Efrat Boymold]]) who wants Zohar for herself. Her best friend Dana Snir ([[Aliyana Bakyer]]) and her mother Naomi ([[Hana Laslow]]) help her by driving Zohar and Ninet apart.

===Season 2===
'''100 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
Three years after graduating from the academy, Ninet and Zohar became the country's most well-known couple and they plan to get married. They have moved into the luxury "Sun and Beach" apartment complex in Tel-Aviv and, surprisingly enough, their friends from the academy have also moved into the complex. Due to the ending of the first season in which Givon ([[Guy Zo-Eretz]]) was killed while trying to murder Ninet and frame Naomi, his brother Ariel ([[Oshri Cohen]]) and sister ([[Yael Sharoni]]) are in town and plan their revenge on Ninet, Naomi and Noa. While conspiring to assassinate them, Ariel falls in love with Ninet.

===Season 3===
'''73 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
At the beginning of the third season viewers find out that the first two seasons of the show were actually a TV show called ''Her Song''. The two leading actors of ''Her Song'', Rani Aviv who played Zohar Lahat ([[Ran Danker]]) and Yonatan Barak who played Ariel Silver ([[Oshri Cohen]]), prepare to go to the army the day after they finish shooting the final episode of the second season. Rani goes to the paratroopers unit and Yonatan goes to an army band. All the other characters from the first two seasons occasionally appear under their real names. New characters join the show.

===Season 4===
'''75 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
Almost the plot of the third season. The plot mostly concerns the investigation of who tried to murder Tamara and Karin Koren. Karin Koren knows who tied to murder her by shooting her twice in the stomach when she was pregnant and shooting Tamara three times in the chest. Karin Promises Yotam  that she will not tell anyone he shot her if he starts going out with her. After Yotam shot both Karin and Tamara they stayed in the hospital asleep for six months. Tamara wakes up and does not remember anything and does not remember that ten minutes before Yotam shot her she asked Rani Aviv to marry him and he accepted, so she does not love him any more. Rani still fights over her to get her back with him. Later in the season, some people discover that the inspector for the case of the shooting of Tamara and Karin Nora Spector is Karin's mother.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12267">{{Culture of Haiti}}

'''Haitian art''' is a complex tradition, reflecting African roots with strong Indigenous American and European aesthetic and religious influences. It is an important representation of [[Haiti]]an culture and history.

Many artists cluster in ‘schools’ of painting, such as the [[Cap-Haïtien]] school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the [[Jacmel]] School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the [[Saint-Soleil]] School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.

==Painting==

===Centre d’Art d'Haïti===
The [[Centre d’Art d'Haïti]], also known as "Naïve Art" or "peinture naïve", was an art movement founded in 1944 by a group of artists which include: [[Maurice Borno]], [[Andrée Malebranche]], [[Albert Mangonès]], [[Lucien Price (artist)|Lucien Price]], and [[Georges Remponeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benson|first1=LeGrace|editor1-last=Knight|editor1-first=Franklin W.|editor2-last=Gates, Jr|editor2-first=Henry Louis|title=Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro–Latin American Biography|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-199-93580-2|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199935796.001.0001/acref-9780199935796-e-1282?rskey=lIl0DJ&amp;result=10|chapter=Malebranche, Andrée (1916–2013)}} {{subscription needed|via=[http://www.oxfordreference.com/ Oxford University Press]'s Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular artists of this movement often were influenced by [[Haitian Vodou|vaudou]] and include: [[André Pierre]], [[Hector Hippolyte]], [[Castera Bazile]], [[Wilson Bigaud]] and [[Rigaud Benoit]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802223359/http://www.discoverhaiti.com/artsynop.htm|title=A History of Haitian Art|last=|first=|date=2001|website=DiscoverHaiti.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centre d’Art d'Haïti type of artwork is often characterized by vivid colors, [[spatial composition]] and spontaneity of painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Saint Soleil School===
Saint Soleil School, also known as "Movement Saint-Soleil" was founded in 1973 as a rural arts community called Soisson-la-Montagne, in [[Pétion-Ville]], Haiti.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://okhaiti.com/saint-soleil-movement/|title=Saint Soleil Movement|last=|first=|date=2016-06-23|work=Ok Haiti|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This community was started by [[Jean-Claude Garoute]] and [[Maud Robart]] and they encouraged the academic study of painting, as well as maintaining influence by vaudou.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Saint Soleil art is characterized by abstract human forms and the heavy influence of vaudou symbolism.

After Saint Soleil School disbanded, five remaining members of the school were renamed "Cinq Soleil" and include: [[Levoy Exil]], [[Prosper Pierre Louis]], [[Louisiane Saint Fleurant]], [[Dieuseul Paul]], Denis Smith.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A second generation member is [[Magda Magloire]], the daughter of [[Louisiane Saint Fleurant]].

===Artibonite artists===
The painters of the [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]] department in north-western Haiti, where [[Hôpital Albert Schweitzer Haiti|Hôpital Albert Schweitzer]] is located, have developed their own style, which is quite recognizable.

The style began with [[Saincilus Ismaël]] (1940–2000), who was influenced by Byzantine art he had seen in books. Ismaël began to paint in 1956 after visiting the [[Centre d'Art]] in [[Port-au-Prince]]. His paintings are marked by exquisite detail. Every article of clothing, house, or tree is painted with a different intricate geometric pattern.

[[Délouis Jean-Louis]] grew up in Petite Rivière under the influence of Ismaël. Although he worked under Ismaël for 15 years, he never had formal painting lessons. He began painting to make money, but gradually began to paint carefully executed scenes from his imagination.

[[Alix Dorléus]] also learned to paint with Ismaël and Mrs. Mellon. He paints all day long and will paint anywhere he feels the spirit to motivate him. His best paintings are detailed depictions, like activity maps, of daily life in the Artibonite Valley.

[[Ernst Louizor]] is considered one of the best impressionist painters of Haiti.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Louzor was born in Port-au-Prince on October 16, 1938.  After high school (Lycee Toussaint L'Ouverture '57) he worked in the tax section of Customs.  Louizor's painting career began in 1951 when at the age of 13 he joined the Centre d'Art and studied under [[Wilmino Domond]]. He later entered the Académie des Beaux-Arts shortly after its founding in 1959 and furthered his studies with [[Georges Remponeau]]. Louzor has many disciples including his wife [[Gerda Louizor]].  He has exhibited in Europe and the U.S..

=== Diaspora outside of Haiti ===
Notable artists of Haitian descent and members of the diaspora include [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Hersza Barjon]] and [[Ernst Registre]].

===The market painting===
The market painting is a Haitian archetype, originating with Laurent Casimir. It typically depicts a Haitian market and is done in the trademark colors of Casimir red, yellow and orange. The motive is often dense with people. These paintings were mass-produced by [[Laurent Casimir]] and his apprentices in the mid-1970s, all signed by Casimir.&lt;ref name="Galerie Macondo"&gt;

 {{cite web
  | title = Galerie Macondo
  | url = http://www.artshaitian.com/Pages/haitianartcasimir.html
  | accessdate = 20 April 2013 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; This archetype is later taken up by contemporary Haitian artist like [[Jean-Louis (artist)|Jean-Louis]], many of which studied under Laurent Casimir.

==Sculpture==

There is evidence that sculpture from the [[Taíno|Tainos]] in Haiti existed in the [[Pre-Columbian era]] and they would create dolls, drawings, signs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It's speculated by researchers that these sculptures may have been representing their deities (maybe the ancestors of the [[Veve|vèvè]] in [[Haitian Vodou|vaudou]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary Haitian sculpture is made of natural materials, traditional art mediums, and recycled materials.

"Haitian Steel Drum Sculpture" – The village of [[Noailles, Haiti|Noailles]] in [[Croix-des-Bouquets]] is home to over a dozen artisan workshops producing countless pieces for over two decades. The work is created out of recycled oil drums. In August 2011, the Clinton Global Initiative along with Greif Inc., donated 40 tons of scrap metal to the artists in Croix-des-Bouquets.  After the earthquake in 2010, artists had a difficult time finding material to work from.  According to Deputy Jean Tholbert Alexis, 8,000 people in the area are directly or indirectly benefit from the villages' artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Foundation makes first loan to Haiti craft business under new program to boost economy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/clinton-foundation-makes-first-loan-to-haiti-craft-business-under-new-program/2011/08/16/gIQAtvVeJJ_story.html|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=18 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529220137/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/clinton-foundation-makes-first-loan-to-haiti-craft-business-under-new-program/2011/08/16/gIQAtvVeJJ_story.html|archivedate=29 May 2015|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Haitian flag-making===
The tradition of making flags (''drapo servis'') to decorate Vodou places of worship is a distinctive form of [[Haitian Vodou art]]. Flags most often commemorate specific spirits or saints, but the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]] has become a common subject of art flags. The use of sequins in these flags became prevalent in the 1940s, and many of today's flags  cover the entire flag in colored sequins and beads. These flags are traded as art by dealers around the world.

==2010 Haiti earthquake==
On January 12, 2010 a [[2010 Haiti earthquake|devastating earthquake]] struck Port-au-Prince and the its surrounding area and resulted in mass devastation.&lt;ref name="USGS_Haiti"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Haitian [[art world]] suffered great losses in the earthquake. Museums and art galleries were extensively damaged, among them Port-au-Prince's main art museum, [[Centre d'Art]], where many art works were destroyed. The collection at [[Collège Saint Pierre]] also was devastated, as was the collection of priceless murals in the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Port-au-Prince|Holy Trinity Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=lat124&gt;{{cite news |title=A cultural agony in a nation where art is life |author=Tracy Wilkinson |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=24 January 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-artists24-2010jan24,0,5707519.story |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some private art galleries were also severely damaged, including the Monnin Gallery in Pétion-Ville,&lt;ref name=lat124/&gt; and the Nader Art Gallery and Musée Nader in Port-au-Prince. The personal collection of Georges Nader Sr., the Nader collection was worth an estimated US$30-US$100 million. Shortly after the earthquake struck, [[UNESCO]] assigned special envoy Bernard Hadjadj to evaluate damage to artwork.&lt;ref name=wsj125&gt;{{cite news |title=Art Trove Is Among Nation's Losses |author=Pooja Bhatia |newspaper= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date= 25 January 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703837004575013022647688144?mod=WSJ_World_MIDDLENews#project%3DSLIDESHOW08%26s%3DSB10001424052748704509704575019672638040644%26articleTabs%3Darticle |accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]], led by Under Secretary [[Richard Kurin]], and with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and the Government of Haiti among others, embarked on a multiyear project and survey to help restore key Haitian cultural treasures and train local Haitians on art preservation and recovery techniques.  &lt;ref&gt;http://haiti.si.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo||秘仏|'''Hibutsu'''|extra="hidden Buddhas"}} are [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] [[icon]]s or statues concealed from public view. ''Hibutsu'' are generally located within Buddhist temples in shrines called {{Nihongo||厨子|''zushi''|extra="miniature shrines"}}. They are generally unavailable for viewing or worship, although they are brought out for specific religious ceremonies; it is also possible in some cases for the ''hibutsu'' to be viewed in exchange for an offering to the temple. Certain ''hibutsu'', such as the wooden statue of [[Gautama Buddha]] at [[Seiryō-ji]] or the [[Amitābha|Amida]] statuary at [[Zenkō-ji]], are almost never displayed, even to initiates of the temples in which they are held (such examples are known as ''zettai hibutsu'').&lt;ref name=Suzuki&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suzuki |first1=Michitaka |title=Hibutsu (Hidden Buddha): Living Images in Japan and the Orthodox Icons |url=http://ousar.lib.okayama-u.ac.jp/file/44671/rpkp_017_005_024.pdf |publisher=University of Okayama |accessdate=28 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205031053/http://ousar.lib.okayama-u.ac.jp/file/44671/rpkp_017_005_024.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are put on public display only rarely, in a ceremony called {{Nihongo||開帳|''kaichō''|extra="opening the curtain"}}.&lt;ref name=Rambelli2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rambelli|first1=Fabio|title=Secret Buddhas: The Limits of Buddhist Representation|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|date=Autumn 2002|volume=57|issue=3|jstor=3096768|pages=271–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Whilst the practice of concealing important religious artefacts within ''zushi'' or behind curtains dates to the [[Heian period]], the concept of ''hibutsu'' is slightly later. It is possible that the original practice was based on [[Shinto]] concepts, in which {{Nihongo||神|''[[kami]]''|extra="gods"}} are without physical form,&lt;ref name="Plutschow2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Plutschow|title=Matsuri: The Festivals of Japan: With a Selection from P.G. O'Neill's Photographic Archive of Matsuri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X_7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-24698-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a document from [[Kōryū-ji]] indicates that it began at that temple with the concealment of a statue of [[Guanyin|Kannon]] imported from [[Silla]] in 616 C.E. The earliest record of an actual ''hibutsu'' dates from 1106, when sources indicate the Amida statues at Zenkō-ji were briefly put on display. By the [[Edo period]] ''hibutsu'' had become a popular concept in Japanese Buddhism, and during this time ''kaichō'' ceremonies became major public events, drawing crowds of thousands.&lt;ref name=Rambelli2002/&gt; It has been noted by art historians such as Shiro Ito that ''hibutsu'' are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon; other Buddhist cultures do not have any equivalent practice.&lt;ref name=Suzuki/&gt;

The concealment of the ''hibutsu'' is intended to emphasise their potency and transcendence.&lt;ref name="ScheidTeeuwen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernhard Scheid|author2=Mark Teeuwen|title=The Culture of Secrecy in Japanese Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Lk7lt70qDcC&amp;pg=PA255|date=4 July 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-16874-3|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve to protect them from pollution by the impure influences of the mundane world,&lt;ref name=Rambelli2002/&gt; or to preserve the personal privacy of these "living" embodiments of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Suzuki/&gt;

[[Liza Dalby]]'s novel ''Hidden Buddhas'' is based on the concept of ''hibutsu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sato|first1=Hiroaki|title=Chaos will reign if hidden Buddhas die|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2010/06/06/books/book-reviews/chaos-will-reign-if-hidden-buddhas-die/#.VHhuWNKsV8E|date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7735">'''Idolatry in Judaism''' is prohibited. [[Judaism]] holds that [[idolatry]] is not limited to the worship of an [[idolatry|idol]] itself, but also worship involving any artistic representations of [[God in Judaism|God]]. In addition it is forbidden to derive benefit (''hana'ah'') from anything dedicated to idolatry.  However, [[aniconism in Judaism]] has not prevented traditions of [[Secular Jewish culture#Visual arts and architecture|Jewish art]] at various periods.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
==Judaism's view of idolatry==
Judaism had historically stood out from other faiths in the ancient world because of its strict monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel C. Harlow|editor=John Joseph Collins|title=The "Other" in Second Temple Judaism: Essays in Honor of John J. Collins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQyVt9o2SKMC&amp;pg=PA303|date=8 February 2011|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-6625-7|pages=302–}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Judaism idolatry is the ultimate betrayal of God's relationship with humanity. It is also the ultimate metaphysical error. Idolatry was also reckoned as ''avodah zerah'' (″foreign worship″). Jewish identity in the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations was shaped by the rejection of idolatry. The strict avoidance of idolatry affected Jewish daily life in terms of cuisine, coinage, socialisations and participation in games. Jewish laws's strict prohibition of idolatry meant that Jewish movements through areas containing images were inhibited. By the first century AD Jews had responded to the idolatry of non-Jews through satire and polemics. Jewish writers used the works of their own scriptures as well as the works of Greek philosophers to denounce idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel C. Harlow|editor=John Joseph Collins|title=The "Other" in Second Temple Judaism: Essays in Honor of John J.

While Jews in general abhorred idolatry, some members of the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] did engage in idolatrous actions. Such Jews often objectified Yahweh, visit and worshiped in pagan temples and abandoned their Jewish heritage. Some Jews differed with others on what defined an idolatrous practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Liong Seng Phua|title=Idolatry and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8zeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=4 December 2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-28910-0|pages=203–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Atapanus and Pseudo-Aristeas some Jews were idolatrous on the cognitive level. Evidence from papyri and inscriptions also indicate that some Jews did not object to idolatry even while they clung on to their Jewish heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Liong Seng Phua|title=Idolatry and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8zeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=4 December 2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-28910-0|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mishnah and Talmud have defined idolatry. It includes worshiping an idol in the manner of its worshipers. This is called ″customary worship″. Another criterion is worshiping the idol with acts which are for worshiping God in the Temple. These include animal sacrifice, incense burning and sprinkling blood. Performing one of these acts means the performer is dubbed an idolater. The third creterion of idolatry is prostration. this includes bowing down with at least the head or knees on the ground. Acts such as kissing, embracing and honoring are forbidden but are not considered to come under idolatry. The performer of such an act does not receive capital punishment unlike the idolater in Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moshe Halbertal|author2=Avishai Margalit|title=Idolatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UufA8HSjmMC&amp;pg=PA210|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44313-6|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avodah Zarah'' governed Jewish interactions with idolaters. this meant there were certain restrictions on business dealings with idolaters for the days in proximity to idolatrous festivals. It was forbidden to provide or take any benefit from idolatrous actions. These regulations had a strong impact on Jewish business dealings with Christians during the [[Middle Ages]]. Because Jews regarded Christians as idolaters because of Christian doctrines such as the trinity, Jews would not do business dealings with Christians on Sundays. Business dealings with Muslims were not affected because Jews regarded the Muslims as pure monotheists like themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moshe Halbertal|author2=Avishai Margalit|title=Idolatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UufA8HSjmMC&amp;pg=PA210|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44313-6|pages=210–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iqaluit''''' is a 2016 Canadian drama film directed and written by [[Benoît Pilon]] and starring [[Marie-Josée Croze]], [[François Papineau]] and [[Natar Ungalaaq]]. The film was shot in [[Iqaluit]], [[Nunavut]], which provided its title. It is about a Quebec woman (Croze) who travels to [[Northern Canada]] after her husband (Papineau) is seriously injured. She uncovers the secret relationships he had with the [[Inuit]] community, and becomes acquainted with an Inuit man (Ungalaaq) struggling with a related family crisis.

Pilon conceived of the story and planned the execution for years, though the travel and shooting conditions provided challenges. The film screened in a few film festivals before a general release. ''Iqaluit'' received some positive coverage in the Quebec press and favorable reactions from Nunavut viewers.

==Plot==
Gilles is a [[French Canadian]] working in Nunavut while his wife, Carmen, lives in Montreal and leads a career in marketing. Word reaches Carmen that Gilles has suffered a head injury, and she travels north to see him. At the hospital, she sees him die, and the authorities plan an autopsy since the cause of death is uncertain. While in Iqaluit, Carmen meets an [[Inuit]] man, Noah, who worked with Gilles and regarded him as a good friend, and learns Gilles had accumulated a collection of [[Inuit art|carvings]].

Carmen notices Noah's 20-year-old niece Ani, and his grown son Dany, and discovers Gilles had an [[adultery|affair]] with Ani. They had a son, Simigaq, though Carmen and Gilles never had any children. The affair ended after the birth of the child, with Gilles offering financial support and buying carvings to help the family. Carmen confides in Noah at the local bar, with Noah explaining he adopted Ani to rescue her from her abusive father. Carmen expresses her sorrow and anger at Gilles, after which Noah takes her to a remote location. There, he sets up a tent and fishes, but admits he has little knowledge of Inuit custom, as he was placed in a [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] as a boy. Noah's family arrive at the site in a state of panic, telling him Dany has abducted Ani and Simigaq into the wilderness, armed with a rifle. Weary of involving the [[RCMP]], Noah believes he can reason with Dany, and Carmen insists on accompanying him.

When Noah and Carmen find Dany and Ani, Dany asserts he can live on the land and evade the authorities. Carmen asks him what he did to Gilles, with Dany replying Gilles' death was an accident, but the police would never believe him. As the situation begins to de-escalate, Carmen speaks to Ani, who witnessed Gilles' death. Dany was pressing Gilles for money before accusing him and other whites of coming to the Arctic and seducing local women, including Ani. The argument led to shoving, during which Gilles tripped and fell over a cliff. After Dany is defused, the group takes boats back to the mainland, with Carmen asking Ani if Simigaq will ever know about Gilles. Ani replies she and everyone in the community will tell Simigaq about Gilles.

The Land Trust protects over 4,000 acres in more than two dozen projects along the Tennessee corridor of the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]], as well as scenic river corridors including the [[Hiwassee River]] in East Tennessee, the Duck and Harpeth Rivers in Middle Tennessee, and the [[Hatchie River]] in West Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtrusttn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hiwassee-Brochure_WEBSITE.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Land Trust for Tennessee Brochure |publisher=Lantrusttn.org |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic properties===
[[File:Glen Leven Home.jpg|thumb|Historic Glen Leven Home in Davidson County, just six miles from downtown Nashville, Tenn.]]
In 2010, protection of historic properties earned the Land Trust for Tennessee an honor award from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/resources/training/awards/2010-national-preservation-awards/the-land-trust-for-tennessee.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.VWSH0hPF_UI |title=The Land Trust for Tennessee - Preservation Leadership Forum |publisher=Preservationnation.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Trust protects multiple properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], Tennessee Century Farms, sites with critical American Indian history, and significant [[American Civil War|Civil War]] properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtrusttn.org/civil-war-sites/ |title=Civil War Sites &amp;#124; The Land Trust for Tennessee |publisher=Landtrusttn.org |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landtrusttn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtrusttn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2014-Conservation-Snapshot.pdf|title=2014 Conservation Snapshot|publisher=Landtrusttn.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonps.org/shys-hill/|title=Shy's Hill {{!}} Battle of Nashville Preservation Society, Inc.|website=www.bonps.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sites in Franklin, Nashville, Thompson's Station and New Johnsonville and Rippavilla Plantation in Spring Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://springhillhomepage.com/historic-rippavilla-plantation-is-granted-conservation-easement/|title=Historic Rippavilla Plantation now protected - Spring Hill Home Page|website=springhillhomepage.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Trust works to preserve the community character of Tennessee towns through projects such as the protection of the scenic gateways in the [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] community of Williamson County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodhomepage.com/aubrey-preston-works-to-preserve-leipers-forks-charm-cms-16190#.VaLcx_kUHVY/ |title=Aubrey Preston works to preserve Leiper's Fork's charm |publisher=Brentwood Home Page |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban open space===
In 2011, The Land Trust for Tennessee partnered with [[Karl Dean|The Office of the Mayor]] and [[The Conservation Fund]] to spearhead Nashville: Naturally, a plan that catalogues protected open space in [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] and charts the course for how to protect and connect this green infrastructure. Key land protection resulting from the plan includes: the acquisition of the former Cornelia Fort Airpark for the Shelby Bottoms Greenway and Nature Park in East Nashville; a 568-acre expansion of Beaman Park; and the 780-acre property acquisition along the Stones River in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/08/14/open-space-plan-makes-nashville-conservation-leader/31700459/|title=Open Space Plan makes Nashville conservation leader|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildlife habitat===
The Land Trust for Tennessee has completed multiple conservation projects focused on protecting wildlife habitat within farms, forests, parks, riparian corridors and wetlands. The Land Trust provides resources and educates owners of Land Trust-protected land about best practices to restore, maintain and enhance wildlife habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nooga.com/157274/twra-land-trust-for-tennessee-seek-68-acres-for-wildlife-refuge/ |title=TWRA, Land Trust for Tennessee seek 68 acres for wildlife refuge |publisher=Nooga.com |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, The Land Trust partnered with The University of the South to protect 3,000 acres of land containing portions of Lost and Champion Coves to protect wildlife habitat. This project links together large, protected tracts, including Franklin State Forest, two State Natural Areas, Buggy Top Cave and Natural Bridge, creating and conserving large-scale wildlife corridors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In 2012, The Land Trust partnered with [[Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency]] to protect migratory land for 48,000 [[Sandhill crane|Sandhill Cranes]] on a significant point on [[Trail of Tears|The Trail of Tears]] along [[Blythe Ferry]] Road in Meigs County, Tenn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/life/entertainment/story/2015/sep/09/east-green-tennessee/323936/|title='Eat Green' event benefits state land preservation, including farms|date=2017-05-10|work=timesfreepress.com|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, The Land Trust for Tennessee and its partners, including The Conservation Fund, protected 4,061 acres of forest in Sherwood, located in Franklin and Marion counties, that includes habitat for the federally threatened [[Painted snake-coiled forest snail|painted snake coiled forest snails]] and other state-listed species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Watershed protection===
The Land Trust conserves lands that border rivers, lakes and streams to create natural buffers that filter pollution to protect both groundwater and surface water quality for human and wildlife health. The Land Trust protects more than 10,000 acres within the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]] Watershed, one of the most biologically diverse inland freshwater ecosystem in North America, and land within other focal watersheds, including the Harpeth, Red, Buffalo, Watauga and Hiwassee Rivers and Oostanaula Creek.

==Strategies for land protection==
The majority of The Land Trust for Tennessee's conservation projects are completed by donated [[conservation easement]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through these legal agreements, private or public landowners continue to own their property, and limitations are placed on future development to protect conservation values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some cases, The Land Trust for Tennessee works to acquire potential parkland and wildlife habitat to transfer to government entities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Land Trust often assists in securing private dollars and works with other conservation partners to supplement state and federal resources. In other cases, The Land Trust for Tennessee also protects land through purchased conservation easements, land donations, bargain sale arrangements, and land purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.landtrusttn.org/about|title=About Us - The Land Trust for Tennessee|work=The Land Trust for Tennessee|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glen Leven Farm ==
The Land Trust owns and maintains Glen Leven Farm, a 65-acre working farm just four miles from the center of Nashville that includes a Greek Revival home built in 1857. In late 2006, the historic home and farm were left to the Land Trust by the late Susan M. West, a descendant of Thomas Thompson who acquired 647 acres through a Revolutionary Land Grant in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tommythompsonart.com/blog/23820/legendary-matriarch-of-glen-leven-mansion-smiles-down-on-historic-home/|title=Legendary Matriarch of Glen Leven Mansion Smiles Down on Historic Home &amp;#124; Tommy Thompson - Blog|date=1970-01-01|publisher=Tommythompsonart.com|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen Leven Farm sustains multiple community partnerships. Double H Farms – The Hermitage Hotel's Sustainable Farming Project maintains an heirloom garden at Glen Leven Farm to grow food for [[The Hermitage Hotel]]'s Capitol Grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eater.com/2013/12/18/6311813/nashville-chef-tyler-brown-on-farming-partnerships-and-creating-a|title=Nashville Chef Tyler Brown on Farming, Partnerships, and Creating a Beef Label|date=2013-12-18|website=Eater|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackalope Brewery of Nashville, Tenn. grows hops on a section of the farm for a seasonal brew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/food-drink/article/13061774/celebrate-halloween-and-the-harvest-at-glen-leven-farm|title=Celebrate Halloween and the Harvest at Glen Leven Farm|work=Nashville Scene|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer Beekeeper Matt Slocum maintains a honey bee sanctuary on the farm.

In 2012, the arboretum at Glen Leven Farm was established through the Nashville Tree Foundation and includes the largest mass of American Yellowwood in the United States, a White Ash, a Basswood, an American Ash, a Dogwood, a Ginkgo, a Black Walnut, a Sugar Maple, a Chinkapin Oak, a Laurel Oak, a Pecan, a Hedge Maple and a massive Trifoliate Orange tree – all winners of the Nashville Tree Foundation's Big Old Tree Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nashvilletreefoundation.org/big-old-tree-contest-previous-winners-species|title=Big Old Tree Contest Species|website=Nashville Tree Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen Leven Farm also hosts educational programs such as the Land Trust's "Nature's Classroom Field Trip Program" for school groups. The program meets state curriculum standards and exposes students to a natural, historic and agricultural landscape, providing an enriched learning experience outside of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtrusttn.org/glen-leven/|title=Glen Leven Farm &amp;#124; The Land Trust for Tennessee|date=|publisher=Landtrusttn.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwf.org/What-We-Do/Kids-and-Nature/Why-Get-Kids-Outside/Health-Benefits.aspx|title=Health Benefits - National Wildlife Federation|date=|publisher=Nwf.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization hosts group tours and community open days at Glen Leven Farm, but the property is not to regularly open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://landtrusttn.org/nationalhoneybeeday/|title=National Honey Bee Day Celebration at Glen Leven Farm - The Land Trust for Tennessee|date=2016-08-25|work=The Land Trust for Tennessee|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Foundation The Land Trust for Tennessee==
===Formation and First Projects===
The Land Trust for Tennessee was co-founded in 1999 by Jean C. Nelson (former general counsel to the Environmental Protection Agency), [[Phil Bredesen]] (Mayor of Nashville-Davidson County 1991-1999; Governor of Tennessee 2003-2011), and a group of 12 founding individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://franklinhomepage.com/leipers-fork-woman-named-second-ceo-of-the-land-trust-for-tennessee/|title=Leiper's Fork woman named second CEO of The Land Trust for Tennessee - Franklin Home Page|website=franklinhomepage.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land Trust for Tennessee's first project was a conservation easement donated by Aubrey Preston in December 1999 on his farm in Leiper's Fork in Williamson County, one of the 50 fastest growing U.S. counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitleipersfork.com/news |title=Events &amp;#124; Historic Leiper's Fork Village |publisher=Visitleipersfork.com |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/real-estate/2015/06/30/justin-timberlake-pays-williamson-county-land/29519153/|title=Justin Timberlake pays $4M for Williamson County land|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010-Present ===
In 2010, The Land Trust for Tennessee became the first land trust operating in the state to earn accreditation by The Land Trust Alliance Accreditation Commission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Founding President and CEO Jean C. Nelson announced her retirement in July 2015 as part of a planned transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2016/5/13/324121/Liz-Edsall-McLaurin-Named-CEO-Of-The.aspx|title=Liz Edsall McLaurin Named CEO Of The Land Trust For Tennessee|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liz McLaurin was named President of the Land Trust in July 2015 and was announced as CEO in May 2016.

[[File:Leda_and_the_Swan,_After_Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|Copy in the [[National Gallery]]]]
'''''Leda and the Swan''''' is a lost tempera on canvas painting by [[Michelangelo]], produced in 1530 but now only surviving in copies and variants. The work depicted the Greek myth of [[Leda and the Swan]]. 

==History==
[[File:Michelangelo, studio per la leda, casa buonarroti.jpg|thumb|The Casa Buonarroti study]]In 1512 [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]] went to Rome to reconcile with [[Pope Julius II]], who had excommunicated him in summer 1510 for his alliance with [[Louis XII of France]] against the [[Republic of Venice]]. Julius absolved him and Alfonso spent a few days in Rome before returning to Ferrara. On 11 July he visited the [[Sistine Chapel]], where Michelangelo was completing the [[Sistine Chapel Ceiling|ceiling]]. As he climbed the scaffolding he had a long and admiring conversation with Michelangelo, who promised him a painting.

Several years passed without the commission being formalised until Michelangelo had to be in Ferrara in 1529 to inspect its city walls as "governor general of fortifications" for the Florentine Republic, ready for an expected Imperial siege. On that occasion the Duke held Michelangelo to his promise and according to Condivi and [[Vasari]] he produced the work when he returned to Florence in August 1530 after the city's fall, perhaps using the time he had to spend in hiding. It was a square work in tempera, representing Jupiter as a swan making love to a reclining [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] (based on a composition from ancient Roman gems and seals), an egg and [[Castor and Pollux]] as children.

It was completed by mid-October 1530 but Alfonso described it as a "little thing" in Michelangelo's hearing and so he refused to hand it over. The work and some of the preparatory drawings were in fact acquired (either as a purchase or a gift) by [[Antonio Mini]], who took it to France in 1531. In 1532 he left it to [[Francis I of France]], who later sent it to the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]. The best known copy is attributed to [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and hangs in the [[National Gallery]] in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/after-michelangelo-leda-and-the-swan|title= National Gallery article on its copy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with others in the [[Gemäldegalerie (Dresden)]], the [[Gemäldegalerie (Berlin)]] and the [[Correr Museum]] in Venice. The [[Casa Buonarroti]] in Florence holds not only a copy but also a preparatory drawing of Leda's head, held to be by Michelangelo himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casabuonarroti.it/leda.htm|title=Page on the site of the Casa Buonarroti|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several prints of the work, the most faithful of which is thought to be the one by [[Nicolas Béatrizet]], which also shows Castor and Pollux.

; ''Collecting Cartridges: The Price Guide for Classic Video Game Collectors'': ({{ISBN|9-781545-196113}}) By Michael S. Richardson.  The Atari VCS (2600), 5200, 7800, Mattel Intellivision, Coleco Colecovision and Milton Bradley Microvision. Collecting Cartridges is much more than a book, for many it’s a passion – likely the closest thing to a time machine to our childhoods and a period of time where video game consoles were a completely new concept. It’s technology that demands a fascination, not just by those of us that lived it, but by future generations who wish to enjoy part of this very unique period of time. This guide is a work of love. It came about through the lack of any other detailed price guide that was really reflective of what classic video games, in similar conditions, were selling for. The information took years to compile, but became a personal resource being referenced regularly. There was no reason that if one person found it helpful, many others might as well. The layout of this guide is extremely simple to reference. It explains, through words and pictures, how to categorize any particular game title by its condition. The game titles are then broken down by console, publisher and name. Each title generally has multiple conditions reflective of what the same game would be bought and sold for. Most important is the fact that these prices are, in no way, arbitrary. The prices are an average of each title’s actual selling price. Formulas are used to fill in the value of each game under varying conditions. Great care has also been provided to reference the author(s) of each game. These designers were the proverbial ‘rock stars’ of the day. Part of the enjoyment of collecting is getting to know each programmer and their library of work. This guide contains an appendix which provides a very thorough cross reference. Along with historical information on each console and adding a few fond memories, this guide should be a part of any classic gamer’s library. “Don’t pay too much or accept too little. If you have anything to do with classic video game systems, you need this guide. This is the most accurate way of determining a game’s value.”  Published April 24, 2017.

{{Nihongo|'''''Lupin III'''''|ルパン三世|Rupan Sansei|lead=yes}}, also written as '''''Lupin the Third''''', '''''Lupin the 3rd''''' or '''''Lupin the IIIrd''''', is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Monkey Punch]]. It follows the escapades of master thief [[Arsène Lupin III]], the grandson of [[Arsène Lupin]], the [[gentleman thief]] of [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s series of novels.

The [[Lupin III (manga)|''Lupin III'' manga]], which first appeared in ''[[Weekly Manga Action]]'' on August 10, 1967, spawned a [[media franchise]] that includes numerous manga, two versions of an [[anime|animated]] [[Television pilot|pilot film]], six animated television series, eight theatrically-released animated films, two live-action films, six [[Original video animation|OVA]] works, [[List of Lupin III television specials|twenty-five animated television special]]s, two musicals, [[List of Lupin III soundtracks|many music CDs]], and [[List of Lupin III video games|several video games]]. Many different companies have owned the English-language distribution rights to various ''Lupin III'' properties at various times, with just the first two animated films having been released by over 10 companies alone. [[Tokyopop]] acquired the license to the original manga in 2002, and later the second series in 2004. [[Funimation Entertainment]] purchased the rights to several of the television specials and films in 2002, and the fourth television series in 2012. [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]] licensed and [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] 79 episodes of the second television series, 26 of which were broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] during 2003. [[Discotek Media]] licensed the entire first, second and fifth television series and the [[Lupin III: Strange Psychokinetic Strategy (film)|first live-action film]]; they also own the rights to several other ''Lupin'' titles, including some previously released by other companies.

Over fifty years after its creation, ''Lupin III'' remains popular, with a sixth anime series airing in 2018. Critical reception of the franchise has been largely positive across its various incarnations, with the appeal of the lead characters being noted as the primary factor of the series' success. The [[voice acting]] (in both Japanese and English versions) and soundtracks (especially those composed by [[Yuji Ohno]]) of the anime adaptations have also received similar compliments; however, several of the franchise's installments, most specifically the television specials, have been criticized for being formulaic. The manga has also been noted by fans and critics for its darker tone compared to the anime, with its explicit depictions of sex and violence, as well as its [[black comedy|black]], [[Fourth wall|fourth wall-breaking]] sense of humor, contrasting with the mostly [[family-friendly]] animated versions. For several years, issues relating to the copyright of Maurice Leblanc's intellectual property meant that the Lupin name was removed from its releases outside Japan, usually changed to "Rupan" or "Wolf". However, the copyright has since expired, allowing foreign releases to use the Lupin name.

==Premise==
{{Main article|List of Lupin III characters}}

[[Arsène Lupin III]], the grandson of the fictional [[gentleman thief]], [[Arsène Lupin]], is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is [[Daisuke Jigen]], an expert [[marksman]] who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]], a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or [[Fujiko Mine]], a [[femme fatale]] and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector [[Koichi Zenigata]] of [[Interpol]], who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.

==Production==
[[File:Lupin_III_cast.jpg|thumb|left|The main cast of ''Lupin the Third'', as drawn by Monkey Punch. From top to bottom: Lupin, Fujiko, Jigen, Goemon, Zenigata.]]

The series was created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name [[Monkey Punch]]. His inspiration for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief [[Arsène Lupin]], created by [[Maurice Leblanc]]. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the ''Lupin III'' series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention was to keep the blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was convinced by others not to do so.&lt;ref name="MM20"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Manga Mania |issn=0968-9575 |date=March 1995 |number=20 |pages=6–9 |publisher=[[Manga Entertainment|Manga Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monkey Punch combined elements of Arsène Lupin with [[James Bond]] to develop the character of Lupin III and made him a "carefree fellow". Lupin was given a red color jacket which Monkey Punch believes is a flashy, sexy color.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMpostermag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoA"&gt;{{cite AV media |work=[[Lupin the 3rd: Dead or Alive]] | title=Interview with Monkey Punch |publisher=[[Funimation]] |medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series was to be published in a magazine targeted at adults, Fujiko Mine was created to add a female presence and to fulfill a "[[Bond girl]]" role. Her name was inspired by a picture of [[Mount Fuji]], Monkey Punch added the -ko female suffix to create her first name, and chose "Mine" for her family name because of its meaning as "summit". At the beginning of the series, many of the women Lupin encounters are all named Fujiko, but are treated as different characters from chapter to chapter. Creating a new female each week was too difficult for Monkey Punch so she evolved into a single character who changes style frequently.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Otaku USA]] |last=Surat |first=Daryl |volume=6 |issue=4  |date=February 2013 |issn=1939-3318 |publisher=Sovereign Media |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jigen was based on [[James Coburn]], especially his role in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', and his name was chosen to reflect his unconventional personality. Goemon was created to give an [[oriental]] element into an otherwise western series. Despite Lupin and Goemon originally being enemies, Monkey Punch decided that they were on the same wavelength. While Lupin, Fujiko, Jigen and Goemon frequently operate together for their own goals, the author considers them not to be a true group as they have their own individual interests.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt; In the manga they operated individually, however in the anime adaptations the group tend to work together. Inspector Zenigata was conceived as Lupin's archrival to create a "human [[Tom and Jerry]]".&lt;ref name="DoA"/&gt;

When Monkey Punch began ''Lupin III'', he was already working on another series, ''Pinky Punky''. Monkey Punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both ''Lupin III'' and ''Pinky Punky'' made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this made it easy for him to write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' and [[Agatha Christie]] novels, and was also inspired by ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and the movies of [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref name="MMpostermag"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Manga Mania |issn=0968-9575 |date=May 1996 |number=34 |at=Poster Magazine Insert |publisher=[[Manga Entertainment|Manga Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2003-11-13 | title=Interview: Monkey Punch | first=Allen | last=Divers | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | date=November 13, 2003 | accessdate=July 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the characters of Lupin and Fujiko are similar to the characters of [[D'Artagnan]] and [[Milady de Winter]], and describes them as "Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other".&lt;ref name="ann interview"/&gt; Another influence on the manga was [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="DoDVD"&gt;{{cite video| people = Monkey Punch Interview (DVD Extra)| title = Lupin the 3rd: Dead or Alive| medium = DVD| publisher=[[Funimation Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.&lt;ref name="ann interview"/&gt;

Monkey Punch has said that he believes the story can never end but that if he had to, both Zenigata and Lupin would have to end as equals. They would either both fail, both win or both get very old.&lt;ref name=roughguide&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Manga |last=Yadao |first=Jason S. |publisher=[[Rough Guides]] |isbn=978-1-85828-561-0 |pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright issues==
Monkey Punch did not ask permission to use the Arsène Lupin name and at the time Japan did not enforce trade copyrights. By the time Leblanc's estate launched legal action in Japan, the name was considered to have entered into common use.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt; However, this was not the case in North America and Europe and several foreign releases of ''Lupin III'' media dropped the Lupin III title and the character himself was renamed to "Rupan" or "Wolf". In France, the series was known as ''Edgar, Detective Cambrioleur'' (Edgar, Detective Burglar) with Lupin himself renamed "Edgar de la Cambriole" (Edgar of Burglary).&lt;ref name="Lupin Tapes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/the-lupin-tapes/2010-06-06 |title=The Lupin Tapes - The Mike Toole Show |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monkey Punch has stated that using the same character design, behavior and face would be illegal, but using a name alone is not illegal.&lt;ref name="MMpostermag"/&gt; In 2012, Leblanc's original Arsène Lupin entered the [[public domain]] in France due to 70 years passing since his death in 1941, and is in the public domain for any country that enforces the [[rule of the shorter term]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/01/02-1/original-lupin-character-enters-public-domain-in-2012 |title=Original Lupin Character Enters Public Domain in 2012 |publisher=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting the manga into animation was first suggested by animator [[Gisaburō Sugii]] to Yutaka Fujioka, the founder of [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]]. This led to the creation of a [[CinemaScope]] ''[[Lupin the Third: Pilot Film|Pilot Film]]'', consisting of introductions to the manga's five lead characters, intended to generate interest in the project and secure funding. The ''Pilot Film'' was created by Sugii, [[Yasuo Otsuka]], [[Tsutomu Shibayama]] and  [[Osamu Kobayashi (animation director)|Osamu Kobayashi]], with supervision by [[Masaaki Ōsumi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media |title=Lupin The 3rd The Complete First Tv Series (Disc 1) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD|at= Episode 3 Commentary, 8:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in 1969, the project was left unsold and the ''Pilot Film'' was adapted for television when [[Yomiuri Television]] agreed to broadcast and provide funding for a televised anime adaptation of the manga in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media |title=Lupin The 3rd The Complete First Tv Series (Disc 1) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD|at= Episode 3 Commentary, 12:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Anime Classics Zettai!'', Brian Clamp and Julie Davis compare the first two anime adaptions.

Critical reception of [[Lupin III (film)|the 2014 live-action film]] was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at [[LA EigaFest]]. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were [[Ryuhei Kitamura]]'s direction, the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of the its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch’s manga. [[Shun Oguri]], [[Tetsuji Tamayama]], [[Gō Ayano]], [[Meisa Kuroki]] and [[Tadanobu Asano]] were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others viewed it as part of a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years”.&lt;ref name="Kotaku AUS"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/things-sound-grim-for-the-lupin-movie/|title= Things Sound Grim For The Lupin Movie|author=Nakamura, Toshi|date=29 August 2014|publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kotaku&gt;{{cite web|url= http://kotaku.com/lupin-iii-is-both-a-terrible-adaptation-and-a-horrible-1629442672|title= Lupin III Is Both a Terrible Adaptation and a Horrible Film|author= Eisenbeis, Richard |date=2 September 2014|publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Otaku USA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/JPop/News1/Lupin-III-2014-LiveAction-Review-5914.aspx|title= Lupin III (2014) Live-Action Review|author= Schley, Matt |date=8 September 2014|publisher=[[Otaku USA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video, which is set to the band's version of the anime's theme song, promoted the ''Lupin the Third Dance &amp; Drive official covers &amp; remixes'' CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-04/monkey-majik-makes-music-video-with-lupin-iii-anime |title=Monkey Majik Makes Music Video with Lupin III Anime |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign titled "Lupin Steal Japan" was launched that same year by NTV, TMS Entertainment, [[Namco Bandai Games]], and [[Heiwa (pachinko)|Heiwa]] — a manufacturer of [[pachinko]] machines. The project's website took suggestions on real-life objects for Lupin to steal. One such example is the [[Moai]] statue in [[Shibuya]], which was taken elsewhere for cleaning on December 7, but was replaced by the calling card of the master thief that read "Thanks for the Moai".&lt;ref name="steal japan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-12-08/lupin-steals-statue-obama-attends-afro-samurai-show |title=Lupin 'Steals' Statue, 'Obama' Attends Afro Samurai Show |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shibukei.com/headline/6578/ |title=「行方不明」のモヤイ像、戻る－ルパン三世「犯行声明」から2週間 |publisher=shibukei.com |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In celebration of the anime's 40th anniversary, the "This is the World of Lupin III" event was held at the [[Matsuya (department store)|Matsuya]] store in [[Ginza]]. From August 10 to August 22, 2011, over 300 items related to ''Lupin III'' were exhibited, including original manuscripts by Monkey Punch and animation [[cel]]s from the feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/08/08/exhibition-celebrates-40-years-of-lupin-iii-anime |title=Exhibition Celebrates 40 Years of Lupin III Anime |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year a similar exhibit was held at the [[Kitakyushu]] museum from November 3 to December 28, and another at the [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]] City Museum from October until November 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/anime_news/AJ201210290050 |title=ANIME NEWS: Kita-Kyushu museum to host 'Lupin' exhibition to celebrate 40th anniversary |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016063417/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/anime_news/AJ201210290050 |archivedate=October 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/fun_spots/AJ201310050035 |title='Lupin III--40th Anniversary of the Anime' exhibition brings all to Kawasaki |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215083435/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/fun_spots/AJ201310050035 |archivedate=February 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit then moved to [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]]'s Sunroad shopping centre from December 21, 2013 until January 21, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lupin-3rd.net/2013/12/aomori-20131225.html |title=ﾙﾊﾟﾝ展青森で堂々開催中！ |publisher=[[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] |date=December 25, 2013 |accessdate=January 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203021402/http://lupin-3rd.net/2013/12/aomori-20131225.html |archivedate=February 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Hokkaido Railway Company]] unveiled ''Lupin III''-themed trains on their [[Hanasaki Line]] between Kushiro and Nemuro station, in honor of Monkey Punch, who is a native of Hokkaido.

Animation in Malaysia (known as ''Animasi'' in [[Malay language|Malay]]) has origins in the puppetry style of ''[[wayang kulit]]'', wherein the characters are controlled by the puppeteer, or Tok Dalang. Chinese shadow play inspired German filmmaker [[Lotte Reiniger]] to create the animated [[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]] in 1926 that was based on one of the stories in the ''1001 Nights stories''. Many of the world's animators have credited Prince Achmed`s recognisable style for generating their initial interest in animation as well as in their works.

==Early Animation==

===Filem Negara Malaysia ''(Malayan Film Unit)''===
The Malayan Film Unit was created by the British colonialists in 1946 with the intent to produce documentaries and public service announcements of the government and later renamed [[Filem Negara Malaysia]]. A set designer working for the Unit named [[Anandam Xavier]] was asked to handle an animation project in 1961. Xavier set to work on the first in-country animation short subject "[[Hikayat Sang Kancil]]" until 1978, although the short would not see a release until 1983.
[[File:Hikayat Sang Kancil.jpg|thumb|A screenshot from Hikayat Sang Kancil]]

====Animated Shorts====
The coming years would see additional hand-drawn animated shorts: 1984`s ''[[Sang Kancil dan Monyet]]'' and a 1987 follow-up, ''[[Sang Kancil dan Buaya]]''; 1985`s ''[[Gagak Yang Bijak]]''; and ''[[Arnab Yang Sombong]]'' and ''[[Singa Yang Haloba]]'' both released in 1986, all written and directed by Hassan Abd. Muthalib. Live action films produced in [[Malaysia]] in the 1980s and 1990s began to feature animated sequences, particularly in the opening credit sequence of films like Mekanik, Mat Gelap and ''Yes, Tuan'', all made by [[Hassan Abd. Muthalib]].

====Animation Houses====
The surge in Malaysian animation products resulted in the founding of two animation studios: [[FilmArt]], established in 1984 and [[Lensamation]], which opened its doors in 1987. Having these production companies in the country led to the legitimisation of animation as an art form and career path, and training schools and programs were instituted. The year 1995 saw the debut of the first animated television series, ''[[Usop Sontorian]]''.
[[File:Usop Sontorian Screenshot.jpg|thumb|Usop Sontorian]]

==Modernisation and Globalisation==
The animation industry in Malaysia received some attention from [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Mahathir bin Mohamad]], the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia with plans for rapidly modernising the country. This extended to the use of digital technology in production houses, predominantly the direct-to-system method of drawing into the computer pioneered by Kamn Ismail. The first [[computer animation|computer-animated]] animation efforts in [[Malaysia]] were the 2000 film "Nien Resurrection" and an episode of the series "[[Skyland]]" conceived and produce by Young Jump Animation Sdn. Bhd. However, in the late 1990s, Kamn Ismail had already included 3D elements in his Keluang Man animation series.

This era also saw an increase in efforts to aggressively promote locally produced animation efforts. Since 2000, the Malaysian animation industry has gone far globally when [[Multimedia Development Corporation]] (MDeC) produced [[Saladin: The Animated Series]] for [[Al Jazeera Children's Channel]]. Since then, many Malaysian animation companies marketed their works to globally. Their animation has succeeded in promoting [[Malaysia]] globally by creating content that was based on [[Malaysian culture]] but having universal values.

Several Malaysian animation films and series that have hit global market are:
* [[Geng: The Adventure Begins]] ''animated film''
* [[Upin &amp; Ipin]] ''animated series''
* [[Bola Kampung]] ''animated series''
* [[BoBoiBoy]] ''animated series''

==The Role of Government==
The Government of Malaysia, through its agencies, [[Multimedia Development Corporation]] and [[Malaysia Animation Creative Content Center]] (MAC3) supports the industry by giving funding through grant scheme and providing world-class facilities to some key-players. The grants include Start-up Funds, Intellectual Property Grant Scheme and MAC3 Co-Production Fund.

===MAC3 Co-Production Fund===
This grant was launched in 2009 to support the creation and development or co-development of Intellectual Properties under the Animation, Games &amp; Computer Graphics sectors of the creative cluster.

The grant is designed to help innovative and progressive local companies to co-produce animation and game development projects with reputable partners that will contribute to the overall development of the industry in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="mac3"&gt;[http://www.mscmalaysia.my/topic/MAC3+Co-Pro+Fund MAC3 Co-Pro Fund], Background, MSC Malaysia Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign Influence on Malaysian Animation==
Some of local animation has a tendency to copy foreign elements, especially [[anime]]. This can be seen in the design of TV animation series such as Anak-anak Sidek, Edi &amp; Cici and Sang Wira. This is because, most of the animators were once trained by Japanese animators.

However, [[Kampung Boy]], based on the characters of international-known cartoonist, [[Lat]] has its own identity. It is seen as the best animation that portrays [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysian cultures]] in the eyes of its own creator. In the making of [[Kampung Boy]], [[Lat]] was actively involved on the project.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;[https://uitm.academia.edu/HassanMuthalib/Papers/459786/From_mousedeer_to_mouse_Malaysian_animation_at_the_crossroads From Mousedeer to Mouse: Malaysian Animation at the Crossroads], Hassan (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persatuan Animasi Malaysia ''(Animation Society of Malaysia)''==
[[Animation Society of Malaysia]], ANIMAS is a non-profit government organisation that promotes animation in Malaysia.

===History===
ANIMAS was officially registered as an organisation on 29 May 2007.&lt;ref name="ANIMAS"&gt;[http://animasimalaysia.org/about_us.htm Animation Society of Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215203751/http://animasimalaysia.org/about_us.htm |date=15 February 2012 }}, About Us.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea towards the foundation of ANIMAS was first discussed at the [[Hiroshima]] Animation Film Festival in 1997. [[Hassan Abd Muthalib]], the director of [[Silat Legenda]], the first feature animation film in [[Malaysia]] in 1998; [[Hisham Harun Hashim]], producer and executive producer of the first Malaysian animated film, [[Silat Legenda]] and Kamn Ismail, director of Usop Sontorian, agreed to form ANIMAS.

The idea was later discussed in 2001 during a meeting with Hassan Abd Muthalib, James Ooi and Richard Ung Kok Kee at the office of James Ooi. A series of meetings to form ANIMAS began in April 2001 and the 1st pro-tem committee met at Cempaka Sari Room, FINAS (the [[National Film Development Corporation Malaysia]]), [[Ampang Jaya|Ampang]], [[Selangor]] on 17 May 2001.

===Activities===
ANIMAS was finally officially registered only on 29 May 2007. However, even before registration, ANIMAS began to play an active role in the industry. ANIMAS was part of the main committee organising the [[Malaysia Film Festival]] and many other events. Hassan Abd Muthalib has been invited to Japan and China to present papers on the Malaysian animation industry a number of times.

In 2004, a seminar was organised with the collaboration of the [[France|French]] Embassy, [[Goethe-Institute]] Malaysia and FINAS at Balai Senilukis Negara ([[National Visual Arts Gallery (Malaysia)|National Visual Arts Gallery]]). This seminar - Animation Industry in Malaysia: Current Situation &amp; New Challenges - brought together for the first time most of the animation companies and training institutions in Malaysia. Among the foreign speakers were Ms [[Tiziana Loschi]], Director of the [[Annecy International Animation Film Festival]] (France); Gilbert Hus, a producer and Regis Ghezalbash, a producer/director (both from France); Georges LaCroix, the director of the animation series, [[Insektors]] (France) and Ulrich Wegenast, an animation academic and director (Germany).

===Collaboration===
In 2008, ANIMAS collaborated with The One Academy of Communication Design in Sunway to present Animation Veteran awards to two pioneers of animation in Malaysia – [[Goh Meng Huat]] (the first animator in Malaysia who had been with Filem Negara Malaysia) and also to actor/director, Mat Sentol (the first feature film animator). The presentation was part of the Digital Art Competition &amp; Convention held at [[Mid Valley Megamall]]. Hassan also gave a Powerpoint presentation of the history and development of the Malaysian animation industry during the event.

==Malaysian Animation Chronology==
These are the major events in the Malaysian Animation.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;[http://animasimalaysia.org/pdf_files/Dec%202008.pdf Kronologi Sejarah Animasi Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326154551/http://animasimalaysia.org/pdf_files/Dec%202008.pdf |date=26 March 2010 }}, Hassan Abd Muthalib&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holidays==
Due to Malaysia being a mainly Muslim country, most animated show have [[Ramadan]]/[[Eid al-Fitr]] specials instead of [[Christmas]].

'''Maria Sibylla Merian''' (2 April 1647{{spaced ndash}}13 January 1717&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Maria Sibylla Merian |first=Kara |last=Rogers |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Sibylla-Merian}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[German people|German]]-born [[naturalist]] and scientific [[illustrator]], a descendant of the [[Frankfurt]] branch of the Swiss [[Merian family]]. Merian was one of the first naturalists to observe insects directly.

Merian received her artistic training from her stepfather, [[Jacob Marrel]], a student of the [[still life]] painter [[Georg Flegel]]. Merian published her first book of natural illustrations in 1675. She had started to collect insects as an adolescent and at age thirteen she raised [[silk worms]]. In 1679 Merian published the first volume of a two-volume series on [[caterpillars]], the second volume followed in 1683. Each volume contained 50 plates engraved and etched by Merian. Merian documented evidence on the process of metamorphosis and the plant hosts of 186 European insect species. Along with the illustrations Merian included a descriptions of their life cycles.

In 1699 Merian travelled to [[Dutch Surinam]] to study and record the tropical insects. In 1705 she published ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium''. Few colour images of the ''New World'' were printed before 1700 and thus Merian's ''Metamorphosis'' has been credited with influencing a range of naturalist illustrators. Because of her careful observations and documentation of the [[metamorphosis]] of the [[butterfly]], she is considered by [[David Attenborough]]&lt;ref&gt;Natural Curiosities film, BBC&lt;/ref&gt; to be among the most significant contributors to the field of [[entomology]]. She was a leading entomologist of her time and she discovered many new facts about insect life through her studies.&lt;ref name="Handbuch4:35"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lepidoptera, moths and butterflies: Evolution, Systematics and Biogeography |last=Kristensen |first=Niels P. |editor= Kristensen, Niels P.|series=Volume 4, Part 35 of Handbuch der Zoologie:Eine Naturgeschichte der Stämme des Tierreiches.

==Life and career==
[[File:MatthaeusMerian.jpg|thumb|Her father Matthäus Merian, member of the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Basel [[Merian family]]. He was an [[engraver]] and ran a publishing house.]]
[[File:Maria Sibylla Merian portrait from 500DM banknote.png|thumb|Merian as depicted on a [[Deutsche Mark#Banknotes|500 DM banknote]] ]]

Maria Sibylla Merian's father, the Swiss engraver and publisher [[Matthäus Merian]] the Elder, married her mother, his second wife, Johanna Sybilla Heyne, in 1646. Maria was born within the next year in 1647, making her his 9th child. Her father died in 1650, and in 1651 her mother remarried the flower and [[still life]] painter [[Jacob Marrel]]. Marrel encouraged Merian to draw and paint. While he lived mostly in Holland, his pupil [[Abraham Mignon]] trained her. At the age of thirteen she painted her first images of insects and plants from specimens she had captured.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Headstrong: 52 Women Who Changed Science - And the World|last = Swaby|first = Rachel|publisher = Broadway Books|year = 2015|isbn = 9780553446791|location = New York|pages = 47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, she had access to many books about [[natural history]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=61875113&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717): An Early Investigator of Parasitoids and Phenotypic Plasticity|last = Todd|first = Kim|date = June 2011|journal = Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|doi = 10.1163/187498311X567794|pmid = |access-date = 10 August 2015|volume = 4|issue = 2|pages = 131–144|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding her youth, in the foreword to ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium'', Merian wrote:&lt;ref name="foreword"&gt;Foreword from ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium'' (Metamorphosis of the Insects of Surinam)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I spent my time investigating insects. At the beginning, I started with silk worms in my home town of Frankfurt. I realized that other caterpillars produced beautiful butterflies or moths, and that [[silkworms]] did the same. This led me to collect all the [[caterpillars]] I could find in order to see how they changed.}}

In May 1665, Merian married Marrel's apprentice, Johann Andreas Graff from [[Nuremberg]]; his father was a poet and director of the local high school, one of the leading schools in 17th-century Germany. In January 1668, she had her first child, [[Johanna Helena Herolt|Johanna Helena]], and the family moved to Nuremberg in 1670, her husband's home town. While living there, Merian continued painting, working on parchment and linen, and creating designs for [[embroidery]]. She also gave drawing lessons to unmarried daughters of wealthy families (her "''Jungferncompaney''", i.e. virgin group), which helped her family financially and increased its social standing. This provided her with access to the finest gardens, maintained by the wealthy and elite, where she could continue collecting and documenting insects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1675 Merian was included in [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s German Academy. Aside from painting flowers she made [[Engraving|copperplate engravings]]. After attending Standrart' school she published flower pattern books.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|author=Suzanne Le-May Sheffield|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=9781851094608|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678, she gave birth to her second daughter [[Dorothea Maria Graff|Dorothea Maria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wulf|first1=Andrea|title=The Woman Who Made Science Beautiful|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/the-woman-who-made-science-beautiful/424620/|accessdate=19 January 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other women still-life painters, such as Merian's contemporary [[Margaretha de Heer]], included insects in their floral pictures, but did not breed or study them. While women of Merian's day did collect butterflies, the amateur science of naturalism was practiced by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|authors=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1679 she published her first work on insects, the first of a two-volume illustrated book focusing on insect [[metamorphosis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1678, the family had moved to [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], but her marriage was an unhappy one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She moved in with her mother, after her stepfather died in 1681. In 1683 she traveled to [[Gottorp]] and was attracted to the [[Labadists]] community in [[Holstein]]. In 1685 Merian travelled with her mother, husband and children  to [[Friesland]] where her half-brother Caspar Merian had lived since 1677.

===Friesland===
[[File:CasparM.jpg|thumb|Her brother Caspar Merian]]
From 1685 onwards Merian, her daughters and her mother lived with the Labadist community, who had settled on the grounds of a stately home – Walt(h)a Castle – at [[Wieuwerd]] in Friesland. They stayed there for three years and Merian found the time to study natural history and Latin, the language in which scientific books were written.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"/&gt; In the moors of Friesland she observed the birth and development of [[frogs]], and collected them to dissect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|authors=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian stayed with the community until 1691.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"/&gt;

In Wieuwerd the Labadists engaged in printing and many other occupations, including farming and milling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascade1987.nl/schetsplattegrond-van-waltha-of-thetinga-state-opgetekend-door-johann-andreas-graff-echtgenoot-van-maria-sibylla-merian/ Detailson the Waltha or Thetinga estate Drawing and map of the estate by Johann Andreas Graff, Merian's husband]&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the [[religious community]] numbered around 600 with many more adherents further afield. Visitors came from England, Italy, Poland and elsewhere, but not all approved of the strict [[discipline]], [[separatism]] and [[community property]].&lt;ref name="Wolfgang Klötzer 1996"&gt;Wolfgang Klötzer (Hrsg.): Frankfurter Biographie.

In 1690, Merian's mother had died. A year later, she moved with her daughters to [[Amsterdam]]. In 1692, her husband divorced her. In Amsterdam the same year, her daughter Johanna married Jakob Hendrik Herolt, a successful merchant on Surinam, originally from [[Bacharach]]. The flower painter [[Rachel Ruysch]] became Merian's pupil.&lt;ref name="Soldiershop Publishing"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flowers, butterflies, insects, caterpillars and serpents...: From the superb engravings of Sybilla Merian and Moses Hariss|authors=Luca Stefano Cristini|publisher=Soldiershop Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9788896519752|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian made a living selling her paintings.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"/&gt; She and her daughter Johanna sold flower pictures to art collector [[Agnes Block]].

In 1699, the city of Amsterdam granted Merian permission to travel to [[Suriname]] in South America, along with her younger daughter [[Dorothea Maria Graff|Dorothea Maria]]. On 10 July, the fifty-two year old Merian and her daughter set sail. The goal of the mission was to spend five years illustrating new species of insects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to finance the mission, Maria Sibylla sold 255 of her own paintings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=32045888&amp;site=ehost-live|title = A Study of Metamorphosis|last = Reidell|first = Heidi|date = April 2008|journal = Americas|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 10 August 2015|volume = 60|issue = 2|pages = 28–35|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before departing, she wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [[Holland]], with much astonishment what beautiful animals came from the East and [[West Indies]]. I was blessed with having been able to look at both the expensive collection of Doctor [[Nicolaes Witsen|Nicolaas Witsen]], mayor of Amsterdam and director of the East Indies society, and that of Mr. [[Jonas Witsen]], secretary of Amsterdam. Moreover, I also saw the collections of Mr. [[Frederick Ruysch|Fredericus Ruysch]], doctor of medicine and professor of anatomy and botany, Mr. [[Levinus Vincent|Livinus Vincent]], and many other people. In these collections I had found innumerable other insects, but found that their origin and their reproduction is unknown, it begs the question as to how they transform, starting from caterpillars and chrysalises and so on. All this has, at the same time, led me to undertake a long dreamed of journey to Suriname.&lt;ref name="foreword"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Suriname and return to Netherlands===
Merian arrived on 18/19 September in Surinam,&lt;!--which included what later became known as the [[French Guiana|French]], [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch]] and [[British Guiana]]s,--&gt; and met with the governor [[Paulus van der Veen]]. She worked for two years,&lt;ref name="de Bray 2001, p. 48"&gt;de Bray (2001), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; traveling around the colony and sketching local animals and plants. She recorded local native names for the plants and described local uses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike other Dutch naturalists, Merian was not employed by a commercial enterprise or corporation. But her journey was partly financed by the directors of the [[Dutch West India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her subsequent publication on the expedition Merian criticised the actions of the colonial merchants, saying that "the people there have no desire to investigate anything like that; indeed they mocked me for seeking anything other than sugar in the country." Merian also condemned the merchants’ treatment of slaves. She was given a slave helper for her research and the interaction she could thus have with the Amerindian and African slaves in the colony assisted her in researching the plants and animals of Surinam. Merian also took an interest in agriculture and lamented the colonial merchants' resistance to plant or export anything other than [[sugar]]. She later showcased the vegetables and fruits that could be found in Surinam, including the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref name="BRILL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1701 [[malaria]] forced her to return to the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Back in the Netherlands Merian opened a shop. She sold specimens she had collected and engravings of plant and animal life in Suriname. In 1705, she published a book ''Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium'' about the insects of Suriname.&lt;ref name="Handbuch4:35"/&gt;

In 1715, Merian suffered a [[stroke]]. Despite being partially paralysed she continued her work.&lt;ref name="Soldiershop Publishing"/&gt; Maria Sibylla Merian died in Amsterdam on 13 January 1717 and was buried four days later at Leidse kerkhof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/Merian|access-date=23 December 2017|title=Merian, Maria Sibylla (1647-1717)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The death register lists her as a [[pauper]].&lt;ref&gt;Pieters, F. F. J. M., &amp; Winthagen, D. (1999).

Archives of Natural History, 26(1), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Dorothea published ''Erucarum Ortus Alimentum et Paradoxa Metamorphosis'', a collection of her mother's work, posthumously.

==Work==
=== Botanical art ===
Merian first made a name for herself as an [[botanical artist]]. In 1675 she started to publish a three volume series, each with 12 plates depicting flowers.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1680 she published ''Neues Blumenbuch'', combining the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawings were decorative and not all were drawn based on observation. Some of the flowers in the three-volume series appear to be based on drawings by [[Nicolas Robert]] and her step-father [[Jacob Marrel]]. Merian included insects among the flowers, again she may not have observed them all herself and some may be copies of drawings by [[Jacob Hoefnagel]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; The single flowers, wreaths, nosegays and bouquets in the three volumes would provide patterns for artists and embroiderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embroidery was at the time an essential part of the education that privileged young women received in Europe.

Merian also sold hand coloured editions of the Blumenbuch series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's process of creating her art used [[vellum]] which she primed with a white coat.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=65564703&amp;site=ehost-live|title = The Vivid Colors of Merian|last = Kopaneva|first = N.P.|date = February 2010|journal = Science First Hand|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 10 August 2015|volume = 25|issue = 1|pages = 110–123|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[guild system]] women were not allowed to paint in [[Oil paint|oil]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Merian painted with [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]] and [[gouache]], instead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Research into insects and caterpillars ===

[[File:Garden_Tiger_Moth_Maria_Sibylla_Merian.png|thumb|right|Plate 5 of ''Caterpillars'' vol 1, depicting the metamorphosis of the [[garden tiger moth]], its plant host, and [[wasp]]s.]]
Merian was one of the first naturalists to observe insects directly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Merian collected and observed live insects and created detailed drawings. In her time insects still had a reputation as "beasts of the devil" and the process of metamorphosis was largely unknown. While a handful of scholars had published empirical information on the [[insect]], [[moth]] and [[butterfly]] life cycle, the widespread contemporary believe was that they were "born of mud" by  [[spontaneous generation]]. Merian documented evidence to the contrary and described the life cycles of 186 insect species.&lt;ref name="Soldiershop Publishing"/&gt;

Merian had started to collect insects as an adolescent and kept a study journal. Aged 13 she raised [[silk worms]] and other insects. Her interest turned to moths and butterflies, which she collected and studied. While living in Nuremberg and Frankfurt Merian would travel to the surrounding countryside to search for [[caterpillar]] [[larvae]]. She recorded their food plants, the timing of their metamorphoses, and noted the behaviour she observed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not unusual for naturalists to illustrate their own research, but Merian was among the first professionally trained artists to illustrate her lifelong studies and observations.

She observed the life cycles of insects over decades, thus she made detailed drawings based on live insects in their natural environment or freshly preserved specimens. This set her apart from previous artist-naturalists such as [[Conrad Gesner]]. Her drawings and [[Engraving|engraved plates]] depict moths laying eggs, or caterpillars feeding on leaves. By drawing live insects Merian could accurately depict colours, as preserved [[Zoological specimen|specimens]] lose colour. The plates she eventually published are complex compositions. They are based on detailed studies she painted on vellum, many are preserved in her study journal. A comparison shows that she changed little and preserved the posture and colour of insects when placing them into the larger composition of her plates. In the course of her insect studies she also recorded and painted the reproductive cycle of flowers, from bud through fruit. As a trained artist Merian was concerned with colour accuracy and in ''Metamorphosis'' she recorded the plants from which pigments could be derived. The engravings she produced or supervised bear little difference from her original water colours. Some engravings were also hand-coloured by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1679 Merian published the first volume of a two-volume series on caterpillars, the second volume followed in 1683. Each volume contained 50 plates engraved and etched by Merian. Along the illustrations Merian included a description of the insects, moths, butterflies and their larvae she had observed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''Der Raupen wunderbare Verwandlung und sonderbare Blumennahrung&amp;nbsp;– The Caterpillars' Marvelous Transformation and Strange Floral Food'', was very popular in certain segments of [[aristocracy|high society]] as a result of being published in the [[German language|vernacular]]. However, her work was largely ignored by scientists of the time because the official language of science was still [[Latin]].

The title page of her 1679 ''Caterpillars'' proudly proclaimed in German:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ".....wherein by means of an entirely new invention the origin, food and development of caterpillars, worms, butterflies, moths, flies and other such little animals, including times, places and characteristics, for naturalists, artists, and gardeners, are diligently examined, briefly described, painted from nature, engraved in copper and published independently." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jan Goedart]] had described and depicted the life stages of European moths and butterflies before her, but Merian's "invention" was the detailed study of species, their life-cycle and [[habitat]]. Goedart had documented species by depicting one adult, a pupa and one larvae. Merian depicted the physical differences between male and female adults, showed wings in different positions and the different colouring on each side of the wing. She also documented the extended proboscis of feeding insects. The first plate in her 1679 ''Caterpillars'' detailed the life cycle of the [[silkworm moth]]. Starting in the right-hand corner with eggs, progressing with a hatching larva and several moults of the growing larvae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Goedart had not included eggs in his images of the life stages of European moths and butterflies, because he had believed that caterpillars were generated from water. When Merian published her study of insects it was still widely believed that insects were spontaneously generated. Merian's discoveries were made independently and supported the findings of [[Francesco Redi]], [[Marcello Malpighi]] and [[Jan Swammerdam]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Merian's depiction of insects' life cycle was innovative in its accuracy, it was her observations on the interaction of organisms that became her major contribution to the emerging field of [[ecological study|ecological studies]]. The depiction of insects and their plant hosts not only set Merian's work apart from that of the classic by Swammerdam and [[Francis Willughby]], but also the work of her countrymen and contemporaries such as [[Georg Rumphius]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Merian was the first to show that each stage of the change from caterpillar to butterfly depended on a small number of plants for its nourishment. She noted that as a consequence, the eggs were laid near these plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In her description she commented on the environmental factors that influenced the growth of insects. On caterpillars she noted that the size of their larvae increased by the day if they had enough food. "Some then attain their full size in several weeks: others can require up to two months." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Among her most significant contribution to science is the pairing of each larval lepidopteran, which she observed with a plant on which it feeds. She collected and kept caterpillars and conducted experiments to confirm her observations. She noted "caterpillars which fed on one flowering plant only, would feed on that one alone, and soon died if I did not provide it for them." She documented that some caterpillars would feed on more than one plant, but some only did so if they were deprived of their preferred host plant. Eventually the importance of the plant-host association was recognised and in the early taxonomy of moths and butterflies the species were given names that reflected the plants on which the larvae were found. Today the science of [[ecology]] focuses on understanding animals' feeding preferences and which plants play a critical role in the [[food chain]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merian in her detailed studies made several other unique observations. In relation to larvae she recorded that "many shed their skins completely three or four times". She illustrated this with a drawing showing a shed [[exoskeleton]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; She also detailed the ways in which larvae formed their [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s, the possible effects of climate on their metamorphosis and numbers, their mode of locomotion, and the fact that when caterpillars "have no food, they devour each other". Such information was recorded by Merian for specific species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

=== Research in Surinam ===

[[File:Merianananas.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate 1 of ''Metamorphosis'', [[pineapple]] and [[cockroaches]].]]

In 1699 Merian travelled to [[Dutch Surinam]] to study and record the tropical insects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The pursuit of her work in [[Suriname]] was an unusual endeavour, especially for a woman. In general, only men received royal or government funding to travel in the [[colonies]] to find new species of plants and animals, make collections and work there, or settle. Scientific expeditions at this period of time were not common, and Merian's self-funded expedition raised many eyebrows. She succeeded, however, in [[discovery (observation)|discovering]] a whole range of previously unknown animals and plants in the interior of Surinam. Merian spent time studying and classifying her findings and described them in great detail. She not only described the insects she found, but also noted their habitat, habits and uses to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her classification of butterflies and moths is still relevant today. She used [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] names to refer to the plants, which became used in Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I created the first classification for all the insects which had chrysalises, the daytime butterflies and the nighttime moths. The second classification is that of the maggots, worms, flies, and bees. I retained the indigenous names of the plants, because they were still in use in America by both the locals and the Indians.&lt;ref name=foreword /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Merian's drawings of plants, frogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etheridge|first=Kay|journal=[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]|year=2010|volume=8|pages=20–27|title=Maria Sybilla Merian's Frogs |url=http://public.gettysburg.edu/~ketherid/merianfrogs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; snakes, spiders, iguanas, and tropical beetles are still collected today by amateurs all over the world. The German word ''Vogelspinne''—(a spider of the infraorder [[Mygalomorphae]]), translated literally as ''bird spider''—probably has its origins in an engraving by Merian. The engraving, created from sketches drawn in Surinam, shows a large spider who had just captured a bird. In the same engraving and accompanying text Merian was the first European to describe both army ants and leaf cutter ants as well as their effect on other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Etheridge |first=Kay |title=Maria Sibylla Merian and the metamorphosis of natural history |journal=Endeavour |year=2011 |volume=35 |pages=16–22 |url=http://public.gettysburg.edu/~ketherid/Endeavor.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2010.10.002 |pmid=21126767 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's depictions of tropical ants were subsequently cited and copied by other artists. Her depictions of the struggle among organisms predates [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] theories on the struggle for survival and [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1705, three years after returning from her expedition, she published ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''Metamorphosis'' was first published at her own expense.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian had returned from Surinam with sketches and notes. As the word spread among scholars in Amsterdam visitors came to view her paintings of exotic insects and plants. She noted "Now that I had returned to Holland and several nature-lovers had seen my drawings, they pressured me eagerly to have them printed. They were of the opinion that this was the first and most unusual work ever painted in America." Merian with the assistance of her daughters Johanna and Dorothea put together a series of plates. She did not make the printing plates herself this time, but hired three printmakers to do the engraving. She supervised the work closely. To pay for this work she advertised for subscribers, who were willing to give her money in advance for a hand-painted deluxe edition of the ''Metamorphosis''. 12 subscribers paid in advance to receive the expensive hand painted edition, while a less expensive printed edition in black and white was also published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After her death the book was reprinted in 1719, 1726 and 1730, finding a larger audience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; It was published in German, Dutch, Latin and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian contemplated publishing the book in English, so that she could present it to the queen of England. She mused "It is reasonable for a woman to make such a gift to a person of the same sex". But nothing came of the plan.&lt;ref name="Getty Publications"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B.

''Metamorphosis'' and the tropical ants Merian documented were cited by the scientists [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur|René Antoine]], [[August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof]], [[Mark Catesby]] and [[George Edwards (naturalist)|George Edwards]]. Few colour images of the ''New World'' were printed before 1700 and thus Merian's ''Metamorphosis'' has been credited with influencing a range of naturalist illustrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=44, 45, 46 &amp; 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian also documented the medicinal use of plants and animals by the people of Surinam. She documented among others that the sap from a palm was used rubbed into itchy scalps to treat worm infections.&lt;ref name="Getty Publications"/&gt; Merian also took an interest in agriculture and among the local fruit she showcased was the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref name="BRILL"/&gt; When describing the pineapple Merian cited several standard works on natural history, which had first documented the fruit, such as ''Historia Naturalis Brasilae'' by [[Willem Piso]] and [[Georg Marggraf]], ''Hortus Malabaricus'' by [[Hendrik van Rheede]], and ''Medici Amstelodamensis'' by [[Caspar Commelin]]. While the pineapple had been drawn before, Merian's went on to become the most prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called the pineapple by its local name ''annanas'', and provided information on how the butterflies and cockroaches affected crops and agriculture in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; While documenting the botany of Surinam, Merian stayed true to her method of recording the metamorphosis of insects. Surinam's insects were shown throughout their entire lifecycle and on their plant host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her drawings of Surinam animal and plant life is so accurate that [[entomologists]] who analysed her study journal from the expedition could identify 73 percent of the [[lepidopteran]]s by their genus and 66 percent as exact species. Some of the animals and plants she drew are likely to have since become extinct. Her drawings are part of the scientific exploration by Europeans. Early [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of tropical plants relied on images or specimens. Following her return to Amsterdam the images she had made were used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] and others to identify one hundred or so new species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was no standardised scientific terminology to name plants and animals, so Merian used common everyday European words to describe Surinam's animals, such as silkworm or [[wasp]]. As such she referred to butterflies as ''summer birds''. However, based on her drawings Linnaeus classified Surinam's animals in 1735 and 1753. He used Merian's drawings to describe 56 animals and 39 plants, including the [[tarantula]]. In reference to her research Linnaeus abbreviated her name into ''Mer.sruin'' for animals from Surinam, and ''Mer.eur'' for European insects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merian was the first European women to independently go on a scientific expedition in [[South America]]. In the 19th century [[Ida Pfeiffer]], [[Alexandrine Tinne]], [[Florence Baker]], [[Mary French Sheldon]], [[Mary Henrietta Kingsley]] and [[Marianne North]] followed in her footsteps and explore the natural world of [[Africa]]. [[Margaret Fountaine]] studied butterflies on five continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Apes: A Short History|authors=Chris Herzfeld|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn= 9780300231656|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's scientific expedition of Surinam predated [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s famous South America expedition by 100 years, and that of [[Princess Theresa of Bavaria]] by 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Große Frauen: Portraits aus fünf Jahrhunderten|authors=Irma Hildebrandt|publisher=Diederichs Verlag|year=2010|isbn=9783641039721|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's publication on her expedition was later identified as a key exponent of illustrated geographical publications originating in Holland in the late 17th century, which marketed an ''exotic'' but accessible new world to Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific practice in Amsterdam ===
[[File:Merian Metamorphosis Titel.jpg|thumb|upright|Merian's major work, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium|de}}'']]
When Merian moved to Amsterdam in 1691 she made the acquaintance of several naturalists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Amsterdam was the centre of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and a nexus for science, art and trade.&lt;ref name="Kim Todd 2013 9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chrysalis: Maria Sibylla Merian and the Secrets of Metamorphosis|author=Kim Todd|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2013|isbn= 9780547538099|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When settling in, Merian found support from the artist [[Michiel van Musscher]], who lived not far away.&lt;ref name="Natalie Zemon Davis 1995 166"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took in students, one being [[Rachel Ruysch]], daughter of the anatomist and physician [[Frederick Ruysch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian became an important figure among Amsterdam's botanists, scientists and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''Caterpillars'' books were getting noticed among the scientific community in England, she continued to breed caterpillars at home and ventured into the country side surrounding Amsterdam to study ants.&lt;ref name="Natalie Zemon Davis 1995 166"/&gt; Among her friends were the director of the Amsterdam Botanical Garden [[Caspar Commelin]], the mayor of Amsterdam and president of the [[Dutch East India Company]] [[Nicolas Witsen]], the professor of medicine [[Fredericus Ruysch]], and the merchant and collector [[Levinus Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading ships brought back never seen before shells, plants and preserved animals.&lt;ref name="Kim Todd 2013 9"/&gt; But Merian was not interested in preserving, collecting or studying specimens. When she received a specimen from [[James Petiver]] she wrote to him that she was interested in "the formation, propagation, and metamorphosis of creatures, how one emerges from the other, and the nature of their diet." &lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; Nevertheless, Merian accepted contract work. She helped to illustrate the book ''The Amboinese Curiosity Cabinet'' written by [[Georg Eberhard Rumpf]]. Rumpf was a naturalists and in the course of his work for the [[Dutch East India Company]] had collected Indonesian shells, rocks, fossils and sea animals. Merian, and possibly her daughter Dorothea, helped to compile illustrations of the specimens for the book. It was published in 1705.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exotic specimens on display in Amsterdam may have inspired her to travel to Surinam, but only interrupted her study of European insects briefly. Merian continued her collection and observation activities, adding plates to her ''Caterpillars'' books and updating the existing plates. She republished the two volumes in Dutch in 1713 and 1714 under the title ''Der Rupsen''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She extended her studies into [[flies]] and rewrote the preface to her books to eradicate any mention of spontaneous generation. She explained that flies emerged from a caterpillar pupa, and suggested that flies could be born from excrement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chrysalis: Maria Sibylla Merian and the Secrets of Metamorphosis|author=Kim Todd|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2013|isbn= 9780547538099|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 plates and descriptions of European insects that appear to have been intended for a third volume were published after her death by her daughters, who combined them with the 1713 editions to one large volume. A number of ''Metamorphosis'' editions were also published posthumously by her family, to which 12 additional plates were added. All but two appear to have been Merian's work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Merian was described as lively, hardworking and courteous by a visiting scholar in 1711. Her house was full of drawings, insects, plants, fruit and on the walls were her Surinam watercolours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before Merian's death, her work was seen in Amsterdam by [[Peter the Great]]. After her death, he acquired a significant number of her paintings&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2007), pp. 228–229&lt;/ref&gt; which to this day are kept in academic collections in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maria Sibylla Merian, 1647–1717: artist and naturalist |year=1998 |publisher=[[Gerd Hatje|Verlag Gerd Hatje]] |location=Ostfildern-Ruit |isbn=3775707514 |pages=34 and 54 |editor=Wettengl, Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponyms==
[[File:Danedlion_Maria_Sibylla_Merian.png|thumb|right|Plate 8 of ''Caterpillars'', first volume. Depicting a [[Taraxacum]], with the ''[[Calliteara pudibunda]]'' moth. The Dutch common name for the moth ''Meriansborstel'' is named for Merian.]]
The universal classification system for all organisms was started by [[Carl Linnaeus]] about 30 years after Merian had published her research on Suriname. It is organised in five levels of kingdom, class, order, genus and species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"/&gt; After her death Merian became so renown among biologists that number of [[Taxon|taxa]], and two [[Genus|genera]], were named after her. Two butterflies have been named after her, the common [[postman butterfly]] ''Heliconius melpomene meriana'' and a [[split-banded owlet]] butterfly ''Opsiphanes cassina merianae''. The Cuban sphinx moth has been named ''[[Erinnyis merianae]]''. A [[Tessaratomidae|bug]] with no common name has been named ''Plisthenes merianae''. A genus of [[mantises]] has been named ''[[Sibylla (mantis)|Sibylla]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bird-eating spider ''[[Avicularia merianae]]'' was named in her honour, referencing her research on spiders. The spider ''[[Metellina merianae]]'' was named after her in 2017. The Argentine black-and-white tegu lizard has been named ''[[Salvator merianae]]''. The [[cane toad]] was named ''Rhinella merianae''. A snail with no common name was named ''Coquandiella meriana''. The Madagascan [[African stonechat]] bird was given the name ''Saxicola torquatus sibilla''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"/&gt;

A genus of exotic flowering plants was named ''Meriana''. A bulbil bugle-lily was given the name ''[[Watsonia meriana]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"/&gt;

== Modern appreciation ==
In the last quarter of the 20th century, the work of Merian was re-evaluated, validated, and reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last= Erlanger-Glozer |first=Liselotte |date=March–April 1978|title= Maria Sibylla Merian, 17th Century Entomologist, Artist, and Traveller |journal= Insect World Digest|volume= 3 |issue= 2 |pages= 12–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her portrait was printed on the [[Deutsche Mark|500 DM note]] before Germany converted to the [[euro]]. Her portrait has also appeared on a 0.40 DM stamp, released on 17 September 1987, and many schools are named after her. In the late 1980s [[Archiv]] imprint of the [[Polydor]] label issued a series of new recordings of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s piano works performed on period instruments and featuring Merian's floral illustrations.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} She was honoured with a [[Google Doodle]] on 2 April 2013 to mark her 366th birth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/google-doodle/9965980/Maria-Sibylla-Merian-Scientific-illustrator-honoured-with-Google-doodle.html|accessdate=2 April 2013|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Scientific illustrator honoured with Google doodle | location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=James|last=Lachno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewed scientific and artistic interest in her work was triggered in part by a number of scholars who examined collection of her works, such as the one in [[Rosenborg Castle]], [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Professional Women in Northern Europe, C. 1650–1850|authors=Johanna Ilmakunnas, Marjatta Rahikainen &amp; Kirsi Vainio-Korhonen|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2017|isbn=9781317146742|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a modern [[research vessel]] named [[RV Maria S. Merian|Maria S.

=== Daughters ===
Today, while Merian has experienced reinvigorated fame in the eyes of the art and science communities, some of her work has finally been accurately reattributed to her daughters, Dorothea and Johanna. [[Johanna Helena Herolt|Joanna Helena Herolt]] often did not receive credit for her artwork because they were created in collaboration with her mother. Today her works are in the process of recovery. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Similarly, [[Dorothea Maria Graff]]'s images have only recently been accredited to the German painter: Sam Segal has reattributed 30 or 91 folios in the [[British Museum]].

The '''Monomachus Crown''' ({{lang-hu|Monomakhosz-korona}}) is a piece of engraved [[Byzantine]] goldwork, decorated with [[cloisonné]] enamel, in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. It consists of seven gold plates depicting Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine IX Monomachus]], his wife [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]], her sister [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]], two dancers and two [[allegory|allegorical figures]]. The piece has puzzling aspects that have long made it the subject of scholarly debate; it was probably made in [[Constantinople]] in 1042.

It was unearthed in 1860 by a farmer in what is now called [[Ivanka pri Nitre]] in [[Slovakia]], then Nyitraivánka in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Kiss, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  If it is a crown, it is, with the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] of a few decades later (also in Budapest), one of the only two Byzantine crowns to survive with the [[kamelaukion]] of [[Constance of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"&gt;Beckwith, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Crown of Konstantinos IX Monomakhos DSCF8087 09.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The central panel, depicting [[Constantine IX Monomachus]]]]

In 1860 a farmer near Nyitraivánka discovered the treasure while plowing. The objects passed to a member of the local landowning nobility, who sold them in four transactions to the Hungarian National Museum between 1861 and 1870, the last sale posthumously via a dealer named Markovits.  Also sold were the two smaller cloisonee medallions found with the crown plaques, with busts of the [[apostle]]s [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Andrew]]. These medallions lack holes for nails, unlike the gold plates. In the view of Magda von Bárány-Oberschall and most scholars they almost certainly do not belong to the Monomachus Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Kiss, 60-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The general assumption was for long that the crown "seems almost certainly to be a female crown and was presumably a gift to the wife of a Hungarian king",&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"/&gt; or to the king himself. In 1045 the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] King [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]] married [[Anastasia of Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;Also called Agmunda, she would become the mother of King [[Solomon, King of Hungary|Solomon]]&lt;/ref&gt; a daughter of Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]],&lt;ref name=nasurus&gt;Alexander Nasarenko&lt;!--Александр Васильевич Назаренко--&gt;, [http://www.europainstitut.hu/pdf/beg15/Nazarenko.pdf "Ungarn und Rus' um das Jahr 1000."]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF-Datei; 370&amp;nbsp;kB) in Ferenc Glatz (Ed.): ''Die ungarische Staatsbildung und Ostmitteleuropa.'' Europa Institut Budapest, Budapest 2002, {{ISBN|963-202-773-6}}, S. 199&lt;/ref&gt; whose brother [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod I]] had been married to Irene (Maria), a daughter of Constantine IX since 1046.&lt;ref name=nasurus/&gt;&lt;ref name=vacor&gt;Szabolcs de Vajay, [http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01536/00007/pdf/UJ_1976_037-064.pdf "Corona Regia – Corona Regni – Sacra Corona."] (PDF-Datei; 2,56&amp;nbsp;MB) ''Ungarn-Jahrbuch. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Hungarologie'', Band 7, 1976. S. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the traditional account, Andrew or his queen would have received the crown from Constantine IX at this juncture. He was in need of a new crown, since [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] had captured the original crown (supposedly donated to king [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] by [[Pope Silvester II]] in 1000) from King [[Samuel Aba]] in 1045 after the [[Battle of Ménfő]] and had sent it back to [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Grexa, "Die Probleme der ungarischen Königskrone." in Josef Gerhard Farkas (Ed.): ''Überlieferung und Auftrag. Festschrift für Michel de Ferdinandy zum sechzigsten Geburtstag.'' Pressler, Wiesbaden 1972, {{ISBN|3-87646-025-5}}, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;  According to popular legend this was the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], or some version of it, though it seems unlikely that any elements of the present crown are that old.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josef Deér]] casts doubt on the idea that this original crown was made in Rome in ''Die heilige Krone Ungarns.'' Wien 1966, pp. 199-200; the oldest elements of the present Holy Crown are now usually dated to the 1070s.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Andrew, who had taken power near the end of September 1046, was first able to be crowned in February 1047 could by attributed to the need for a royal embassy to travel from Hungary to Constantinople and back in winter in order to bring the Manomachus crown to Hungary.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt; In 1057 the young King [[Solomon of Hungary|Solomon]] was also crowned with this crown.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt;  Other, very different, possibilities have been suggested and are covered below.

In 1057 Solomon was besieged by [[Geza I]] and escaped with the crown and treasure in the direction of [[Pozsony]] in order to seek the protection of his brother-in-law Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. Soldiers of Geza apprehended him as he was fording the [[Váh]] near Ivanka pri Nitre. Solomon had the treasure and the crown buried and barricaded himself behind the walls of Pozsony.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt; When Henry IV launched an expedition in September 1074 to restore Solomon to the Hungarian throne, the army of the Emperor abandoned him and rode along the Valley of the Váh in the direction of [[Nitra]] and [[Šintava]]. Possibly this was a futile attempt to recover the buried crown near the ford of Ivanka pri Nitre.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Grexa, '"Die Probleme der ungarischen Königskrone."

== Description ==
[[File:Танцующая Девушка с короны Константина1.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer with veil]]
The seven gold plates are 3.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide and between 10 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm tall. They have asymmetrically cut holes whose size and arrangement suggests that the plates were originally connected by a fabric or leather band. It is possible that remains of golden bands for connecting the plates were found.&lt;ref&gt;Magda von Bárány-Oberschall, "Konstantinos Monomachos császár koronája. The Crown of the Emperor Constantine Monomachos." Budapest 1937, pp. 86 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the seven plates were fastened to a fabric cap. the coarse finish of the decoration, the low purity of the gold plates and the presence of errors in the depiction of the clothing and in the inscriptions are notable.&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt;

The central and largest plate shows Emperor Constantine IX Monomachus, who was Byzantine Emperor from 1042 to 1055. A Greek inscription on the panel reads: Κῶνστάντινος Αυτοκράτο&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ρ&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ρομεον ο Μονομαχο&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ς&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''Constantine, [[Autokrator|Emperor]] of the Romans, the Monomachos''. On the plate to his right is his wife and on the plate to the left, her sister.  On the smaller panels to the right and left of the Empresses are two dancing female figures. The smallest plates depict the personifications of two [[Virtue]]s. The figures have [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] on their heads and (except for the Virtues) are surrounded by flowering vines, birds and [[cypress]]es.

The Emperor is depicted standing, with the ''[[labarum]]'' in his right hand and in his left the ''[[akakia]]'', a fabric pouch which held dust and symbolised the transience of the material world. The Emperor's crown is decorated at its peaks with three balls. The Empresses wear the same crown. They hold a sceptre in their inner hand and point to Emperor Constantine with their outer hand. He wears the ceremonial robes of a Byzantine ruler with [[ivy]] decoration and the ''[[loros]]'' and ''maniakion'', Byzantine symbols of rulership.&lt;ref name=mbomon&gt;Magda von  Bárány-Oberschall, ''Konstantinos Monomachos császár koronája.'' ''The Crown of the Emperor Constantine Monomachos.'' Budapest 1937 pp. 60–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[loros]]'' is a sash, richly decorated with gemstones, pearls and embroidery which wraps around the shoulders and hips. One end of the ''loros'' falls to his hem, the other is tied around it. The ''maniakion'' is a broad collar decorated with pearls and gemstones. The three members of the imperial family wear red shoes on their feet and stand atop a ''suppedion''. Both women wear the complete [[regalia]] of an Empress with the female version of the loros costume, including the shield-like ''thorakion'' hanging diagonally from a belt.&lt;ref name=mbomon/&gt; Zoe, who was 64 years old in 1042 is depicted in an idealised way as a young woman. Their inscriptions read: "Θέοδώρα ἡ ἐυσαιβεστατι Αυγουστα," ''Theodora the Most Pious [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' and "Ζώη οι ευσαιβαῖστάτη Αυγουστα," ''Zoe the Most Pious Augusta''. The Greek of both is full of errors.
[[File:Crown of Konstantinos IX Monomakhos DSCF8087 03.JPG|thumb|Personification of Humility (left) and Dancer (right)]]

The two smaller plates depicting dancing women are identical rather than symmetrical. Their backgrounds are also decorated with foliage, but they lack identifying inscriptions. The dancers wave their veils over their heads and bend their right leg sharply backwards.&lt;ref name=mbomon/&gt; The idea that they are professional dancers may be contradicted by the haloes on their heads, which indicates that they belong to the sacred realm.  However, sacred dancing is rare in Christianity, at least before the Renaissance, and the [[iconography]] is most unusual in a context to do with public imperial ceremony and coronation, where the Byzantines placed great stress on the emperor as God's agent on earth.&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"/&gt;

Two even smaller panels each depict a female figure with a halo on a plain golden background, with [[cypress]]es on either side of them, symbolising the [[Garden of Eden]]. According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of "η αλιθηα" (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and "η τα&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;π&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;ινοσις" (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility).&lt;ref name=mbomon/&gt; Sincerity holds a cross in one hand and points to her mouth, while Humility crosses her arms over her chest.

John Beckwith saw in the crown a change in style from the enamels of the previous century: "All the figures are visualized in terms of pattern rather than form; the sense of space and depth so typical of the tenth-century enamels has been jettisoned for intricate detail and superficial charm."&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"/&gt;

== Authenticity and function ==
In 1937 Magda von Bárány-Oberschall investigated the enameled gold plates. The size of the crown formed from the plates led her to argue that it had to be a Byzantine consort's crown from the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=mbomono&gt;Magda von Bárány-Oberschall: Konstantinos Monomachos császár koronája. The Crown of the Emperor Constantine Monomachos. Budapest 1937&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Crown of Konstantinos IX Monomakhos DSCF8087 06.JPG|thumb|The crown from behind]]
In 1994, the [[Greeks|Greek]] Byzantinist [[Nicolas Oikonomidès]] expressed the view that the Monomachus Crown might be a nineteenth-century forgery. He was led to this opinion by the plain design, coarse finish and the erroneous and unusual captions, when combined with the circumstances of the discovery and plausible models for a forgery. In all these respects the crown contrasts strongly with the Holy Crown of Hungary. He suspected the forger came from [[Venice]], without however being able to put a name to him.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Tinnefeld: [http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/html/da512.htm Nicolas Oikonomidès, La couronne dite de Constantin Monomaque, Travaux et Mémoires (Centre de Recherche d'Histoire et Civilisation de Byzance) 12 (1994) S.  241–262,] ''Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters Jahrgang'' 51. 1995, Heft 2, Besprechungen und Anzeigen, Nr. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article, "The State of Research into the Monomachos Crown and Some Further Thoughts,"&lt;ref name=kiss&gt;Etele Kiss, "The State of Research into the Monomachos Crown and Some Further Thoughts." in Olenka Z. Pevny (Ed.):  ''Perceptions of Byzantium and Its Neighbours (843–1261).'' New York 2000, {{ISBN|0-300-08929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses Nicolas Oikonomidès' theory in detail and largely argues against it, Etele Kiss of the Hungarian National Museum mentioned that the crown could have been made for the emperor, to be presented in a [[Roman Triumph|triumphal procession]], thus explaining the presence of the dancers, one area of debate.  Another problem is that the seven plates form a circle with a diameter of ca. 22&amp;nbsp;cm, too small even for a woman's head, and the plain plaques, lacking jewelled surrounds, are unlike other Byzantine crowns.

Already in 1997, Henry Maguire had argued that the plaques were intended to be sewn to a leather or cloth backing, and suggested a belt, for which there are some sources, or diadem.  He related the dancers to a "chorus of graces" supposed, at least in Byzantine [[rhetoric]], to form a ring around the emperor, dancing and singing his praises. The motifs of birds and plants are metaphors for the virtues of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Timothy Dawson elaborated on these arguments, proposing that the crown was actually a ceremonial armband, a grand version of an ''[[Armilla (military decoration)|armilla]]'' given to soldiers as an [[Roman military decorations and punishments|award]].&lt;ref name=dawres&gt;Dawson&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' of [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] written a century earlier describes how the emperor was presented with a crown on returning after a victory, which he then wore on his right arm. Dawson suggested that the most likely recipients in Constantine IX's reign were Stephanos Pergamos, a court [[eunuch]] who was a surprising success as a general, for his victory over [[George Maniakes]] at the Battle of Ostrobos on 2 February 1043, or the emperor himself on the same occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, 188-189&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Psellos]] records that the emperor sat between the two empresses to view the procession, which the placement of the plaques may reflect.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, 189&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[armill]] is a medieval variation, more often part of coronation regalia, which may also be relevant. 

The triumph of Stephanos Pergamos was approved by the Emperor at the last moment&lt;ref&gt;[[Zonaras]], 17.22.19&lt;/ref&gt; and Dawson argued that rushed production could explain the coarse finish and spelling errors; if it was given to Pergamos, the lower quality and relative plainness of the piece are explicable. The same would apply to the depiction of the emperor, odd on a piece he would wear himself, as is the depiction of a figure representing Humility.&lt;ref name="Dawson, 190"&gt;Dawson, 190&lt;/ref&gt; If it belonged to the emperor, or came to do so when Pergamos' possessions were later confiscated, then after the celebrations it would have been stored in the Imperial treasure chamber and then later sent to Hungary as a diplomatic gift.  Alternatively it may have escaped Byzantium in the wake of the downfall of Pergamos. Another possibility is that it is simply loot from the Crusaders' [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople in 1204]], or the [[Latin Empire|period of Latin rule]] thereafter. All these are speculative accounts.&lt;ref name="Dawson, 190"/&gt;

'''''Mound of Butter''''' is a [[still life]] painting of a mound of [[butter]], by the 19th-century French [[Realism (arts)|realist]] painter [[Antoine Vollon]] made between 1875 and 1885. The painting is in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]], with the ''[[New York Times]]'' calling it one of "Washington’s Crown Jewels".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/impressionism-masters-shine-in-intimate-setting-at-the-legion-of-honor/Content?oid=2752862 |title=Impressionism masters shine in intimate setting at The Legion of Honor |last=Gallagher |first=Lauren |date=April 3, 2014 |website=The San Francisco Examiner |access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/01/16/arts/0116-COLLECTIONS_9.html|title=Washington's Crown Jewel|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2009|website=www.nytimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painter==
Throughout his career, Vollon was best known as a painter of [[still life]]s, this including his [[landscape art|landscape]]s and [[figure painting|figure]]s. He was part of the French Realist movement, and in his lifetime achieved celebrity status, earning a number of prestigious awards such as the [[Legion of Honor]], and declared "the Chardin of his day" (alluding to the French master of still life paintings, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]]). In the late nineteenth century, Vollon's paintings maintained popularity, and thus many of his works are in private collections today. French writer [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]] and fellow American painter [[William Merritt Chase]], for example, collected his various artworks.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildenstein.com/exhibits/vollon/|title=Antoine Vollon : A Painter's Painter|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.wildenstein.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224222256/http://www.wildenstein.com/exhibits/vollon/|archive-date=24 Dec 2014|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vollon was a member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], and his works were present at the [[Paris Salon]] for over thirty years, together with other realist [[French painters]] like [[Charles-François Daubigny]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Eugène Boudin]], but Vollon is not quite as celebrated or remembered today as his other French Realist colleagues such as Corot and Fantin-Latour.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Painting==
The painting is a great example of Vollon's [[still life]] art, depicting a mound of butter, coloured in rich, deep yellow colour (presumably from the [[carotene]] of the fresh plants that [[grazing]] [[cows]] commonly eat on [[Field (agriculture)|barn fields]]). At the time when Antoine Vollon lived, it was usual to purchase the butter from the farmer, handmade. 

Typically, after milking, the cream is to be collected, [[churned]] and the butter lumps are [[knead|kneaded]] by hand or worked with a spatula to get rid of the [[moisture]] from it, because the high amounts of buttermilk would shorten its [[food conservation|storage life]]. Back then, butter was usually stored wrapped in a [[cheesecloth]], in a cool place. In the painting, the butter mound's cloth is falling loosely over a couple of [[egg]]s beside it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE3DC1E30F937A15751C1A9629C8B63|title=Art in Review; Antoine Vollon|last=|first=|date=December 24, 2004|website=www.nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting also has thick marks layered on top of the artist's [[brush]]-work, probably meant to illustrate the marks after the [[butter knife]] was used to spread butter with; or the [[wooden]] [[spatula]], used to spread the butter with and also used in producing the butter. Kitchen scenes, [[food preparation]], and depiction of everyday objects were a usual subject for still lifes in Vollon's time.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1938534 |title= Mound of Butter: Antoine Vollon |publisher=The Art of JAMA |accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolas Poussin''' ({{IPA-fr|nikɔlɑ pusɛ̃|lang}}; June 1594 – 19 November 1665) was the leading painter of the [[Classicism|classical]] [[French Baroque]] style, although he spent most of his working life in [[Rome]]. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors.  He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as [[First Painter to the King]] under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscapes in his pictures.  His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th&amp;nbsp;century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] and [[Paul Cézanne]].

Details of Poussin's artistic training are somewhat obscure. Around 1612 he traveled to Paris, where he studied under minor masters and completed his earliest surviving works. His enthusiasm for the Italian works he saw in the royal collections in Paris motivated him to travel to Rome in 1624, where he studied the works of Renaissance and Baroque painters—especially [[Raphael]], who had a powerful influence on his style. He befriended a number of artists who shared his classicizing tendencies, and met important patrons, such as Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]] and the antiquarian [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]]. The commissions Poussin received for modestly scaled paintings of religious, mythological, and historical subjects allowed him to develop his individual style in works such as ''The Death of Germanicus'', ''The Massacre of the Innocents'', and the first of his two series of the ''[[Seven Sacraments (Poussin)|Seven Sacraments]]''.

He was persuaded to return to France in 1640 to be First Painter to the King but, dissatisfied with the overwhelming workload and the court intrigues, returned permanently to Rome after a little more than a year. Among the important works from his later years are ''Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun'', ''Landscape with Hercules and Cacus'', and ''The Seasons''.

==Biography==
=== Early years – Les Andelys and Paris ===
Nicolas Poussin's early biographer was his friend [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]],&lt;ref&gt;His ''Lives of the Painters'' was published in Rome, 1672.&lt;/ref&gt; who relates that Poussin was born near [[Les Andelys]] in [[Normandy]] and that he received an education that included some Latin, which would stand him in good stead.  Another early friend and biographer, [[André Félibien]], reported that "He was busy without cease filling his sketchbooks with an infinite number of different figures which only his imagination could produce."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; His early sketches attracted the notice of [[Quentin Varin]], who passed some time in Andelys, but there is no mention by his biographers that he had a formal training in Varin's studio, though his later works showed the influence of Varin, particularly by their storytelling, accuracy of facial expression, finely painted drapery and rich colors.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents apparently opposed a painting career for him, and In or around 1612, at the age of eighteen, he ran away to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived in Paris during the regency of [[Marie de Medici]], when art was flourishing as a result of the royal commissions given by Marie de Medici for the decoration of her palace, and by the rise of wealthy Paris merchants who bought art. There was also a substantial market for paintings in the redecoration of churches outside Paris destroyed during the [[French Wars of Religion]], which had recently ended, and for the numerous convents in Paris and other cities. However, Poussin was not a member of the powerful guild of master painters and sculptors, which had a monopoly on most art commissions and brought lawsuits against outsiders like Poussin who tried to break into the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His early sketches gained him a place in the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the [[Flanders|Flemish]] painter [[Ferdinand Elle]], who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin.&lt;ref name="Keazor_12"&gt;Keazor 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved next to the studio of [[Georges Lallemand]], but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin.&lt;ref name="Keazor_12"/&gt; Moreover, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, in which several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the ''valet de chambre'' of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of [[Giulio Romano]] and especially of [[Raphael]], whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson et al. 1992, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He first tried to travel to Rome in 1617 or 1618, but made it only as far as Florence, where, as his biographer Bellori reported, "as a result of some sort of accident, he returned to France."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, he began making paintings for Paris churches and convents. In 1622 made another attempt to go to Rome, but went only as far as Lyon before returning. In the summer of the same year, he received his first important commission: the Order of [[Jesuits]] requested a series of six large paintings to honor the canonization of their founder, Saint [[Francis Xavier]]. The originality and energy of these paintings (since lost) brought him a series of important commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Giambattista Marino]], the court poet to [[Marie de Medici]], employed him to make a series of fifteen drawings, eleven illustrating [[Metamorphoses (poem)|Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']]&lt;ref name="Brigstocke"&gt;Brigstocke.&lt;/ref&gt; and four illustrating battle scenes from Roman history. The "Marino drawings", now at [[Windsor Castle]], are among the earliest identifiable works of Poussin.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers 2009, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; Marino's influence led to a commission for some decoration of Marie de Medici's residence, the [[Luxembourg Palace]], then a commission from the first Archbishop of Paris, [[Jean-François de Gondi]], for a painting of the death of the Virgin (since lost) for the Archibishop's family chapel at the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].  Marino took him into his household, and, when he returned to Rome in 1623, invited Poussin to join him. Poussin remained in Paris to finish his earlier commissions, then arrived to Rome in the spring of 1624.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Poussin was thirty when he arrived in Rome in 1624. The new Pope, [[Urban VIII]], elected in 1623, was determined to maintain the position of Rome as the artistic capital of Europe, and artists from around the world gathered there. Poussin could visit the churches and convents to study the works of [[Raphael]] and other Renaissance painters, as well as the more recent works of [[Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]] and [[Caravaggio]] (whose work Poussin detested, saying that Caravaggio was born to destroy painting).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the art of painting nudes at the Academy of [[Domenichino]], and frequented the Academy of Saint Luke, which brought together the leading painters in Rome, and whose head in 1624 was another French painter, [[Simon Vouet]], who offered lodging to Poussin.&lt;ref&gt;In a census of 1624 (Friedlaender)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poussin became acquainted with other artists in Rome and tended to befriend those with classicizing artistic leanings: the French sculptor [[François Duquesnoy]] whom he lodged with in 1626; the French artist [[Jacques Stella]]; [[Claude Lorraine]]; Domenichino; [[Andrea Sacchi]]; and joined an informal academy of artists and patrons opposed to the current [[Baroque]] style that formed around [[Joachim von Sandrart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=721350&amp;partId=1 The British Museum: Collection online]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rome also offered Poussin a flourishing art market and an introduction to an important number of art patrons. Through Marino, he was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]], the brother of the new Pope, and to [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], the Cardinal's secretary and a passionate scholar of ancient Rome and Greece, who both later became his important patrons. The new art collectors demanded a different format of paintings;  instead of large altarpieces and decoration for palaces, they wanted smaller-size religious paintings for private devotion or picturesque landscapes, mythological and history paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early years of Poussin in Rome were difficult. His patron Marino departed Rome for Naples in May 1624, shortly after Poussin arrived, and died there in 1625. His other major sponsor, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, was named a papal legate to Spain and also departed soon afterwards, taking Cassiano dal Pozzo with him. Poussin became ill with [[syphilis]], but refused to go to the hospital, where the care was extremely poor, and he was unable to paint for months. He survived by selling the paintings he had for a few ecus. Thanks to the assistance of a chef, Jacques Dughet, whose family took him in and cared for him, he largely recovered by 1629, and in 1630 he married Anne-Marie Dughet, the daughter of Dughet.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; His two brothers-in-law were artists, and [[Gaspard Dughet]] later took Poussin’s surname.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1958, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo returned to Rome in 1626, and by their patronage Poussin received two major commissions. In 1628, with a commission from Cardinal Barberini, he completed his first masterwork, ''The Death of Germanicus'' ([[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]). It was partly inspired by the reliefs of the Meleager sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;The Meleager sarcophagus seen by Poussin is that now in the Capitoline Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1628 he received an even more prestigious commission to paint an altarpiece, the ''Martyrdom of St. Erasmus'', for the Erasmus Chapel of the Vatican (now in the Vatican Pinacoteca). This commission was originally given to [[Pietro da Cortona]], but when negotiations broke down between the Vatican and [[Guido Reni]] for another painting in the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, da Cortona replaced Reni and Poussin was given Holy Sacrament commission.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Poussin drew upon the original design of Pietro da Cortona but painted the work in his own style.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1958, pp. 55, 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Martyrdom of St. Erasmus'' was the only Vatican commission Poussin received, but it established his reputation as a major painter.  With the departure of Vouet from Rome in 1627, Poussin became the most prominent French painter in Rome. Until 1630, he had painted rapidly ("with the fury of a demon", Marino recorded)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and produced large numbers of pictures of variable quality. Thereafter, he renounced seeking commissions for large decorative works, which were prestigious but required competitions and came with many restrictions, and concentrated instead on painting for art patrons and collectors, for whom he could work more slowly and develop his own subjects and style. In 1632 he bought a life interest in a small house on Via Paolina for his wife and himself and entered his most productive period.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Cardinal Barberini, his notable patrons in this period included Cassiano dal Pozzo, for whom he painted the first series of ''Sacraments''; the Chanoine Gian Maria Roscioli, who bought several important works, including ''The Young Pyrrhus Saved''; Cardinal Rospigliosi, for whom he painted the second version of ''The Shepherds of Arcadia''; [[Innocent X|Cardinal Luigi Omodei]], for whom he produced the ''Triumphs of Flora'' (c. 1630–32, [[Louvre]]); [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], for whom he painted the ''Massacre of the Innocents'', and the jewel thief and art swindler, Fabrizio Valguarnera, who bought ''[[The Plague at Ashdod]]'' and commissioned ''The Empire of Flora''.  He also received his first commissions from France; first from the Marechal de Crequi, the French envoy to Italy, then a commission from [[Cardinal de Richelieu]] for a series of ''Bacchanales''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As the work of Poussin became well-known in Rome, he received invitations to return to Paris for important royal commissions, proposed by Sublet de Noyers, the Superintendent of buildings for [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].  When Poussin declined, Noyers sent his cousins, Roland Fréart de Chambray and Paul Fréart, to Rome to persuade Poussin to come home, offering him the title of First Painter to the King, plus a substantial residence at the Tuileries Palace. Poussin yielded, and in December 1640 he was back in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correspondence of Poussin to Cassiano dal Pozzo and his other friends in Rome show that he was appreciative of the money and honors, but he was quickly overwhelmed by a large number of commissions, particularly since he had taken the habit of working slowly and carefully. His new projects included ''The Institutions of the Eurcharist'' for the chapel of the [[Chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], and ''The Miracle of Saint Francis-Xavier'' for the altar of the church of the novitiate of the Jesuits. In addition, he was asked to the ceilings and vaults for the Grand gallery of the Louvre, and to paint a large allegorical work for the study of Cardinal Richelieu, on the theme ''Time Defending Truth from the Attacks of Harmony and Discord'', with the figure of "Truth" clearly standing for Cardinal Richelieu. He was also expected to provide designs for royal tapestries and the front pieces for books from the royal printing house.  He was also subjected to considerable criticism from the partisans of other French painters, including his old friend Simon Vouet. He completed a painting of the ''Last Supper'' (now in the Louvre), eight cartoons for the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]] tapestry manufactory, drawings for a proposed series of [[grisaille]] paintings of the ''Labors of Hercules'' for the Louvre, and a painting of the ''Triumph of Truth'' for Cardinal Richelieu (now in the Louvre).  He was increasingly unhappy with the court intrigues and the overwhelming number of commissions. In the autumn of 1642, when the King and court were out of Paris in [[Languedoc]], he found a pretext to leave Paris and to return permanently to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
When he returned to Rome in 1642, he found the art world was in transition. Pope Urban VIII died in 1644, and the new Pope, [[Innocent X]], was less interested in art patronage, and preferred Spanish over French culture. Poussin's great patrons, the Barberinis, departed Rome for France. He still had a few important patrons in Rome, including Cassiano dal Pozzo and the future Cardinal Camillo Massimi, but began to paint more frequently for the patrons he had found in Paris. Cardinal Richelieu died in 1632, and Louis XIII died in 1643, and Poussin's Paris sponsor, Sublet de Noyer, lost his position, but Richelieu's successor, [[Cardinal Mazarin]], began to collect Poussin's works. In October 1643, Poussin sold the furnishings of his house in the Tuileries in Paris, and settled for the rest of his life in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1647, [[André Félibien]], the secretary of the French Embassy in Rome, became a friend and painting student of Poussin, and published the first book devoted entirely to his work. His growing number of French patrons included the Abbé Louis Fouquet, brother of [[Nicolas Fouquet]], the celebrated superintendent of finances of the young Louis XIV.  In 1655 Fouquet obtained for Poussin official recognition of his earlier title as First Painter of the King, along with payment for his past French commissions. To thank Fouquet, Poussin made designs for the baths Fouquet was constructing at his chateau at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important French patron of Poussin in this period was [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]], who came to Rome in 1643 and stayed there for several months. He commissioned from Poussin some of his most important works, including the second series of the ''[[Seven Sacraments (Poussin)|Seven Sacraments]]'', painted between 1644 and 1648, and his  ''Landscape with Diogenes''.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1649 he painted the ''Vision of St Paul'' for the comic poet [[Paul Scarron]], and in 1651 the ''Holy Family'' for the [[Créquy family|duc de Créquy]]. Landscapes had been a secondary feature of his early work;  in his later work nature and the landscape was frequently the central element of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He lived an austere and comfortable life, working slowly and apparently without assistants. The painter [[Charles Le Brun]] joined him in Rome for three years, and Poussin's work had a major influence on Le Brun's style. In 1647, his patrons Chantelou and Pointel requested portraits of Poussin. He responded by making two self-portraits, completed together in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He suffered from declining health after 1650, and was troubled by a worsening tremor in his hand, evidence of which is apparent in his late drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, in his final eight years he painted some of the most ambitious and celebrated of his works, including ''The Birth of Bacchus'', ''Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun'', ''Landcape with Hercules and Cacus'', the four paintings of ''The Seasons'' and ''Apollo in love with Daphé''. 

His wife Anne-Marie died in 1664, and thereafter his own health sank rapidly. On 21 September he dictated his will, and he died in Rome on 19 November 1665 and was buried in the church of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Each one of Poussin's paintings told a story. Though he had little formal education, Poussin became very knowledgeable in the nuances of religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the ''affetti'', or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his self-portraits, Poussin never painted contemporary subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, David.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Religion was the most common subject of his paintings, as the church was the most important art patron in Rome and because there was a growing demand by wealthy patrons for devotional paintings at home. He took a large part of his themes from the [[Old Testament]], which offered more variety and the stories were often more vague and gave him more freedom to invent.  He painted different versions of the stories of [[Eliazer]] and [[Rebecca]] from the [[Book of Genesis]] and made three versions of ''Moses saved from the waters''. The [[New Testament]] provided the subject of one of his most dramatic paintings, "The Massacre of the Innocents", where the general slaughter was reduced to a single brutal incident. In his ''Judgement of Solomon'' (1649), the story can be read in the varied facial expressions of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

His religious paintings were sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ in the sky in his painting of Saint-Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of [[Simon Vouet]] for having "Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy". Poussin responded that "he could not and should not imagine a Christ, no matter what he is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to look him in the face".&lt;ref&gt;Félibien cited by Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of his religious works were the two series called ''[[Seven Sacraments (Poussin)|The Seven Sacraments]]'', representing the meaning of the moral laws behind each of the principal ceremonies of the church, illustrated by incidents in the life of Christ.  The first series was painted in Rome by his major early patron, [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], and was finished in 1642. It was viewed by his later patron, [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]], who asked for a copy.  Instead of making copies, Poussin painted an entirely new series of paintings, which was finished by 1647. The new series had less of the freshness and originality of the first series, but was striking for its simplicity and austerity in achieving its effects; the second series illustrated his mastery of the balance of the figures, the variety of expressions, and the juxtaposition of colors.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Classical Greek and Roman mythology, history and literature provided the subjects for many of his paintings, particularly during his early years in Rome. His first successful painting in Rome, ''The Death of Germanicus'', was based upon a story in the ''Annals'' of [[Tacitus]]. In his early years he devoted a series of paintings, full of color, movement and sensuality, to the Bacchanals, colorful portrayals of ceremonies devoted to the god of wine [[Bacchus]], and celebrating the goddesses [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Flora (deity)|Flore]]. Many of his mythological paintings featured gardens and floral themes; his first Roman patrons, the Barberini family, had one of largest and most famous gardens in Rome.

Another of his early major themes was the ''Rape of the Sabine Women'', recounting how the King of Rome, [[Romulus]], wanting wives for his soldiers, invited the members of the neighboring Sabine tribe for a festival, and then, on his signal, kidnapped all of the women. He painted two versions, one in 1634, now in the Metropolitan Museum, and the other in 1637, now in the Louvre. He also painted two versions illustrating a story of Ovid in the ''Metamorphoses'' in which Venus mourning the death of [[Adonis]] after a hunting accident, transforms his blood into the color of the [[anemone]] flower.

Throughout his career, Poussin frequently achieved what the art historian [[Willibald Sauerländer]] terms a "consonance ... between the pagan and the Christian world".&lt;ref name="Sauerländer_2016"&gt;Sauerländer 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''The Four Seasons'' (1660–64), in which Christian and pagan themes are mingled: ''Spring'', traditionally personified by the Roman goddess [[Flora (deity)|Flora]], instead features Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden; ''Summer'' is symbolized not by [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] but by the biblical [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]].&lt;ref name="Sauerländer_2016"/&gt;

In his later years, his mythological paintings became more somber, and often introduced the symbols of mortality and death. The last painting he was working on before his death was ''Apollo in love with Daphne'', which he presented to his patron, the future Cardinal Massimi, in 1665.  The figures on the left of the canvas, around Apollo, largely represented vitality and life, while those on the right, around Daphne, were symbols of sterility and death.  He was unable to complete the painting because of the trembling of his hand, and the figures on the right are unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Poetry and allegory===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Besides classical literature and myth, he drew often from works of the romantic and heroic literature of his own time, usually subjects decided in advance with his patrons.  He painted scenes from the epic poem ''Jerusalem Delivered'' by [[Torquato Tasso]] (1544–1595), published in 1581, and one of the most popular books in Poussin's lifetime.  His painting ''Renaud and Armide'' illustrated the death of the Christian knight Arnaud at the hands of the magician Armide. who, when she saw his face, saw her hatred turn to love. Another poem by Tasso with a similar theme inspired ''Tancred and Hermiene''; a woman finds a wounded knight on the road, breaks down in tears, then finds the strength through love to heal him.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 94–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegories of death are common in Poussin's work,  One of the best-known examples is ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'', a subject he painted in about 1630 and again in the late 1630s. Idealized shepherds examine a tomb inscribed with the title phrase, "Even in [[Arcadia (paradise)|Arcadia]] I exist", reminding that death was ever-present.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fertile source for Poussin was Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi, who wrote moralistic theatrical pieces which were staged at the Palace Barberini, his early patron. One of his most famous works, [[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|''A Dance to the Music of Time'']], was inspired by another Rospigliosi piece.  According to his early biographers Bellori and Felibien, the four figures in the dance represent the stages of life: Poverty leads to Work, Work to Riches, and Riches to Luxury; then, following Christian doctrine, luxury leads back to poverty, and the cycle begins again. The four women who dance represent the different stages and are distinguished by their different clothing and headdresses, ranging from plain to jeweled. In the sky over the dancing figures, the chariot of Apollo passes, accompanied by the Goddess Aurora and the Hours, a symbol of passing time.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poussin is an important figure in the development of [[Landscape art|landscape]] painting. In his early paintings the landscape usually forms a graceful background for a group of figures, but later the landscape played a larger and larger role and dominated the figures, illustrating stories, usually tragic, taken from the Bible, mythology, ancient history or literature.  His landscapes were very carefully composed, with the vertical trees and classical columns carefully balanced by the horizontal bodies of water and flat building stones, all organized to lead the eye to the often tiny figures. The foliage in his trees and bushes is very carefully painted, often showing every leaf.  His skies played a particularly important part,  from the blue skies and gray clouds with bright sunlit borders (a sight often called in France "a Poussin sky") to illustrate scenes of tranquility and the serenity of faith, such as the ''Landscape with Saint Jean at Patmos'', painted in the late 1630s before his departure for Paris; or extremely dark, turbulent and threatening, as a setting for tragic events, as in his ''Landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe'' (1651). Many of his landscapes have enigmatic elements noticeable only with closer inspection; for example, in the center of the landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe, despite the storm in the sky, the surface of the lake is perfectly calm, reflecting the trees.{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=109–127}}

Between 1650 and 1655, Poussin also painted a series of paintings now often called "townscapes",  where classical architecture replaces trees and mountains in the background. The painting ''The Death of Saphire'' uses this setting to illustrate two stories simultaneously; in the foreground, the wife of a wealthy merchant dies after being chastised by St. Peter for not giving more money to the poor; while in the background another man, more generous, gives alms to a beggar.{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=109–127}}

==Style and method==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Throughout his life Poussin stood apart from the popular tendency toward the decorative in French art of his time. In Poussin's works a survival of the impulses of the [[Renaissance]] is coupled with conscious reference to the art of [[classical antiquity]] as the standard of excellence. Rejecting the emotionalism of Baroque artists such as [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]], he emphasized the cerebral.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was clarity of expression achieved by ''disegno'' or ‘nobility of design’ in preference to ''colore'' or color.&lt;ref&gt;Pace.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1620s and 1630s, he experimented and formulated his own style. He studied the Antique as well as works such as [[Titian]]’s [[Bacchanal]]s (''[[The Bacchanal of the Andrians]]'', ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'', and ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'') at the [[Casino di Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi|Casino Ludovisi]] and the paintings of [[Domenichino]] and [[Guido Reni]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1958, pp. 54–59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to the warm and atmospheric style of his early paintings, Poussin by the 1630s developed a cooler palette, a drier touch, and a more stage-like presentation of figures dispersed within a well defined space.&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt; In ''The Triumph of David'' (c. 1633–34; [[Dulwich College]] Picture Gallery), the figures enacting the scene are arranged in rows that, like the architectural facade that serves as the background, are parallel to the picture plane.&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt; The violence of ''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' (c. 1638; Louvre) has the same abstract, choreographed quality seen in ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' (1639–40).&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt;

Contrary to the standard studio practice of his time, Poussin did not make detailed figure drawings as preparation for painting, and he seems not to have used assistants in the execution of his paintings.&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt; He produced few drawings as independent works, aside from the series of drawings illustrating Ovid's Metamorphoses he made early in his career. His drawings, typically in pen and [[ink wash]], include landscapes drawn from nature to be used as references for painting, and composition studies in which he blocked in his figures and their settings. To aid him in formulating his compositions he made miniature wax figures and arranged them in a box that was open on one side like a theatre stage, to serve as models for his composition sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Rosenberg]] described Poussin as "not a brilliant, elegant, or seductive draughtsman. Far from it. His lack of virtuosity is, however, compensated for by uncompromising rigour: there is never an irrelevant mark or a superfluous line."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Pierre. "Poussin Drawings from British Collections. Oxford". ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 133, no. 1056, 1991, pp. 210–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the years following Poussin's death, his style had a strong influence on French art, thanks in particular to [[Charles LeBrun]], who had studied briefly with Poussin in Rome, and who, like Poussin, became a court painter for the King and later the head of the French Academy in Rome. Poussin's work had an important influence on the 17th-century paintings of [[Jacques Stella]] and [[Sébastien Bourdon]], the Italian painter [[Pier Francesco Mola]], and the Dutch painter [[Gerard de Lairesse]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
A debate emerged in the art world between the advocates of Poussin's style, who said the drawing was the most important element of a painting, and the advocates of Rubens, who placed color above the drawing.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 604. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], Poussin's style was championed by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in part because the leaders of the Revolution looked to replace the frivolity of French court art with Republican severity and civic-mindedness. The influence of Poussin was evident in paintings such as ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons|Brutus]]'' and ''[[Death of Marat]]''. [[Benjamin West]], an American painter of the 18th century who worked in Britain, found inspiration for his canvas of ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' in Poussin's ''The Death of Germanicus''.&lt;ref&gt;Facos 2011, pp. 32, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century brought a resurgence of enthusiasm for Poussin. One of his greatest admirers was [[Ingres]], who studied in Rome and became Director of the French Academy there. Ingres wrote, "Only great painters of history can paint a beautiful landscape. He (Poussin) was the first, and only, to capture the nature of Italy. By the character and taste of his compositions, he proved that such nature belonged to him; so much so that when facing a beautiful site, one says, and says correctly, that it is "Poussinesque".{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|page=149}} 

Another 19th-century admirer of Poussin was Ingres' great rival, [[Eugène Delacroix]]; he wrote in 1853: "The life of Poussin is reflected in his works; it is in perfect harmony with the beauty and nobility of his inventions...Poussin was one of the greatest innovators found in the history of painting. He arrived in the middle of the school of mannerism, where the craft was preferred to the intellectual role of art. He broke with all of that falseness".{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=147–148}} 

[[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] appreciated Poussin's version of classicism. "Imagine how Poussin entirely redid nature, that is the classicism that I mean. What I don't accept is the classicism that limits you. I want that a visit to a master will help me find myself. Every time I leave a Poussin, I know better who I am."{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=147–148}}  Cézanne was described in 1907 by [[Maurice Denis]] as "the Poussin of Impressionism".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 4 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Seurat]] was another [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] artist who admired the formal qualities of Poussin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, Jean. (1973). ''Impressionism''. Paris: Hachette Réalités. p. 273. {{ISBN|2010066235}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 20th century, some art critics suggested that the analytic [[Cubist]] experiments of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] were also founded upon Poussin's example.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkin.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Picasso based a series of paintings on Poussin's ''The Rape of the Sabine Women''. [[André Derain]],&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, Elizabeth; Jennifer Mundy (1990). ''On Classic Ground: Picasso, Léger, de Chirico and the New Classicism 1910–1930''. London: Tate Gallery. pp. 93–93. {{ISBN| 1-854-37043-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Hélion]],&lt;ref&gt;Hélion, Jean (2004). ''Jean Hélion''. London: Paul Holberton Pub. pp. 20–21. {{ISBN|1-903470-27-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Balthus]],&lt;ref&gt;Rewald, Sabine (1984). ''Balthus''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, publ. p. 82. {{ISBN|0870993666}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Hugo]] were other modern artists who acknowledged the influence of Poussin. [[Markus Lüpertz]] made a series of paintings in 1989–90 based on Poussin's works.&lt;ref&gt;Keazor 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The finest collection of Poussin's paintings today is at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.  Other significant collections are in the National Gallery in London; the National Gallery of Scotland; the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]; the [[Château de Chantilly|Musée Condé, Chantilly]]; the [[Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg; and the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.

"'''Octopus's Garden'''" is a song by [[the Beatles]] written and sung by [[Ringo Starr]] (credited to his real name Richard Starkey) from the Beatles' 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]''. [[George Harrison]], who assisted Starr with the song, commented: "'Octopus's Garden' is Ringo's song. It's only the second song Ringo has ever written, mind you, and it's lovely." He added that the song gets very deep into the listener's consciousness "...because it's so peaceful. I suppose Ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it."&lt;ref name='Marks2009'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicbyday.com/abbey-road-the-beatles-in-their-own-words/574/ |title=Abbey Road: The Beatles In Their Own Words |accessdate=18 September 2009 |last=Marks |first=Marvin |date=23 August 2009 |work=Music by Day |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jsjD06AO?url=http://www.musicbyday.com/abbey-road-the-beatles-in-their-own-words/574/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the last song released by the Beatles featuring Starr on lead vocals.

==Composition==
The idea for the song came about when Starr was on a boat belonging to comedian [[Peter Sellers]] in [[Sardinia]] in 1968. He ordered [[fish and chips]] for lunch, but instead of fish he got [[squid]] (it was the first time he'd eaten squid, and he said, "It was OK. A bit rubbery. [[Tastes like chicken|Tasted like chicken]].")&lt;ref&gt;[[The Beatles Anthology|''Anthology'']] book (2000, p. 312)&lt;/ref&gt; The boat's captain then told Starr about how [[octopus]]es travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects with which to build gardens.&lt;ref name="interviewdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/dba11road.html |title=Abbey Road |publisher=The Beatles Interview Database |accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr's songwriting was further inspired by his desire to escape mounting hostility among the Beatles; he would later admit that he had "just wanted to be under the sea, too." Uncredited assistance in developing the song's chord changes was provided by Harrison, who can be seen helping Starr work the song out on piano, with Lennon later joining in with drums, in the ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spizer|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Spizer|title=The Beatles on Apple Records|publisher=498 Productions|year=2003|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song, which contains the lyrics "Oh what joy for every girl and boy/Knowing they're happy and they're safe,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianhartzog.com/beatles/beatles-song-lyrics-to-octopuss-garden.htm |title=The Beatles-"Octopus's Garden" Song Lyrics |publisher=Brianhartzog.com |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes thought of as being a song for children,&lt;ref&gt;George Harrison,{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/octopuss-garden|title=Octopus's Garden|publisher=beatlesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; like "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]"  or "[[All Together Now]]". It has also been performed by the [[Muppets]] several times in various episodes of their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id = f9uo98lORhw|title =Classic Sesame Street - Octopus's Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
The basic instrumental [[multitrack recording|track]] was recorded 26 April 1969, with the Beatles lineup of two [[electric guitar]]s (Harrison and Lennon, the latter using his fingerstyle technique as on "[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]", "[[Dear Prudence]]", etc.){{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, [[bass guitar]] (McCartney) and [[drum kit|drums]] (Starr). Starr also provided a temporary guide vocal. (Take 2 of the recording, featuring this guide vocal, Starr singing the first verse three times, is track 14 on disc 2 of ''[[Anthology 3]]''.) In the absence of [[George Martin]], the Beatles themselves were listed as producer, with Martin's apprentice [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] present in the [[control room]] to assist. Thirty-two takes were required before the Beatles were satisfied with the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewisohn |first=Mark |title=The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions |publisher=Hamlyn |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-681-03189-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The backing vocals by McCartney and Harrison during the guitar solo were put through [[Audio level compression|compressors]] and [[Audio level compression#Limiting|limiters]] to create a gurgling sound. Starr added the sound of bubbles being blown into a glass of milk using a straw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Venue/8313/discography/a_12.htm |title=DM Beatle's Site: Abbey Road (UK, 1969) |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kn5MMwun?url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Venue/8313/discography/a_12.htm |archivedate=25 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upv.es/~ecabrera/abbey.html |title=Only Some Northern Songs in Abbey Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-release==
The song was remixed in 2006 for the Beatles album ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'', which contained remixes of classic Beatles songs.  The remix begins with Starr's vocals over the orchestration from "[[Good Night (Beatles song)|Good Night]]", then transitions into the original instrumental backing track on the line "I'd ask my friends...", with sound effects from "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" added in the background.  During the guitar solo, the drum track is replaced with that of "[[Lovely Rita]]".

The track, in its original form, is also available on the compilation ''[[1967-1970]]''.

==Book==
Starr wrote ''[[Octopus's Garden (book)|Octopus's Garden]]'', a 2014 children's book based on the song. The book, which consists of the song's lyrics, is illustrated by Ben Cort.&lt;ref name="Octopus's Garden"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starr|first1=Ringo|last2=Cort|first2=Ben|title=Octopus's Garden|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Octopuss-Garden/Ringo-Starr/9781481403627|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|v7ErlAgTju8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A CD is included with the book, including an introduction by Starr, a new version of the song, the lyrics spoken as prose, and an instrumental version of the song.

==Other versions==
[[Jim Henson|Jim Henson's]] [[Muppets]] made three video cover versions of the song, on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', episode 19 in 1969, ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in March 1970, and ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' episode 312 in 1978, which was performed by [[Robin the Frog]], [[Kermit the Frog]] and [[Miss Piggy]].

In the PBS educational show ''[[Zoom (1972 TV series)|Zoom]]'', the cast from Season 5 did a version of the song.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Reparata and the Delrons]] released the song as a single in 1972 on Dart records, backed with "Your Life Is Gone". It used vocal effects and ocean-themed sound effects to mimic the style of their 1968 UK hit, "[[Captain of Your Ship]]". It was re-released in 1976, with the A- and B-sides reversed, and credited to Reparata (no Delrons).

[[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] adds adapted lyrics from "Octopus's Garden" to the end of their song "[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]" during some of his live performances. The phrase "I'd like to be under the sea" is in the refrain of one of Oasis' most popular b-sides, "Take Me Away". Also, the refrain from the chorus of "Octopus's Garden" can be heard about forty seconds from the end of ''[[The Masterplan (song)|The Masterplan]]'', also by Oasis.

The song was covered and recorded by Canadian children's musician [[Raffi (musician)|Raffi]] for the 1985 album ''[[One Light, One Sun]]''.

[[The Punkles]] did a punk cover on their fourth album ''For Sale'' sung by their drummer Markey Starkey.

In 1999, [[Melissa Joan Hart]] did an electropop cover for her film ''[[Sabrina Down Under]]''.

A [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] with [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]" circulated on the Internet in 2007, as ''Glass Octopus''.

The comedy team at [[CollegeHumor]] created a parody tribute to the band entitled "[http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1913069 Ringo Wants to Sing More]". The video was posted on their website on 24 June 2009.

Leah Erbe performed the cover of "Octopus's Garden" on the Motion Picture Soundtrack for ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DFJVFE IMAX: Under The Sea]''. The soundtrack was released by New Line Records on 1 April 2010.

==Popular culture==
There is a cocktail named after the song,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnonedrinks.com/drinks/by_category/cocktails-2/o.html |title=Cocktail Recipes at Bar None : O |publisher=Barnonedrinks.com |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains vermouth and gin.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]", Linda McCartney mentions that they like hanging out in Apu's "garden in the shade" when they are in Springfield, which is a lyric from the song.

In the 2009 romantic comedy film ''[[(500) Days of Summer]]'', Summer Finn ([[Zooey Deschanel]]) remarks that "Octopus's Garden" is the greatest Beatles song ever. Tom Hanson ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) tells Summer that no one loves Ringo Starr, to which Summer replies "That's what I love about him".

In the 2007 comedy film ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'', Ringo Starr ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) refers to his "song about an octopus", which is followed by a crude remark from John Lennon ([[Paul Rudd]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841046/quotes |title=Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007) - Memorable quotes |publisher=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osman Hamdi Bey''' (30 December 1842{{spaced ndash}}24 February 1910) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administrator, intellectual, art expert and also a prominent and pioneering painter. He was also an accomplished [[archaeologist]], and is regarded as the pioneer of the [[curator|museum curator]]'s profession in [[Turkey]]. He was the founder of [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]] and of ''Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts'' ([[:tr:Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi|Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi]] in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), known today as the [[Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts]].

==Early life==
Osman Hamdi was the son of [[Ibrahim Edhem Pasha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Shaw, Wendy M. K. |title= Possessors and possessed: museums, archaeology, and the visualization of history in the late Ottoman Empire |publisher= University of California Press |year= |page= 2003 |isbn= 0-520-23335-2 |quote=(Osman Hamdi)…His father, Ibrahim Edhem, was born in the Greek Orthodox village of Sakiz.

[[File:Osman hamdi genclik.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Osman Hamdi in his youth]]

Osman Hamdi went to primary school in the popular [[Istanbul]] quarter of [[Beşiktaş]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; "''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''".&lt;/ref&gt; after which he studied Law, first in Istanbul (1856) and then in [[Paris]] (1860). However, he decided to pursue his interest in painting instead, left the Law program, and trained under [[France|French]] [[orientalism|orientalist]] painters [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Gustave Boulanger]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendy M.K. Shaw, Possessors and Possessed: Museums, Archaeology, and visualisation of history in the late Ottoman Empire. University of California Press 2003, p. 98 {{ISBN|0-520-23335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his nine-year stay in Paris, the international capital of fine arts at the time, he showed a keen interest for the artistic events of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom J. and Blair, S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009 Vol. 3, p.361&lt;/ref&gt;

His stay in Paris was also marked by the first ever visit by an [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan]] to [[Western Europe]], when [[Abdülaziz|Sultan Abdülaziz]] was invited to the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]] by [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]]. He also met many of the [[Young Ottomans]] in Paris, and even though he was exposed to their liberal ideas, he did not participate in their political activities, being the son of an Ottoman [[pasha]] who was loyal to the [[sultan]] and did not challenge the old [[absolute monarchy|absolutist system]]. Osman Hamdi Bey also met his first wife Marie, a French woman, in Paris when he was a student. After receiving his father's blessings, she accompanied him to Istanbul (Constantinople) when he returned in 1869, where the two got married and had two daughters.

Once back in Turkey, he was sent to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of [[Baghdad]] as part of the administrative team of [[Midhat Pasha]] (the leading political figure and reformer among the [[Young Ottomans]] who enacted the [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Ottoman Constitution]] in 1876, Midhat Pasha served as the [[Grand Vizier]] between [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|1876–1877]], before being replaced by İbrahim Edhem Pasha, Osman Hamdi Bey's father.)&lt;ref name="W. Shaw, p. 98"&gt;W. Shaw, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, Osman Hamdi returned to Istanbul, as the vice-director of the Protocol Office of the Palace. During the 1870s, he worked on several assignments in the upper echelons of the Ottoman bureaucracy.

==Career==
{{double image|right|Eşi Naile Hanım - Osman Hamdi.jpg|109|Osman Hamdi Bey - Naile Hanım Portresi , Portrait of Naile Hanım - Google Art Project.jpg|120|Two portraits by Osman Hamdi Bey of his second wife Marie, who later took the name Naile Hanım.&lt;ref name=Posta&gt;[http://www.posta.com.tr/pazarpostasi/HaberDetay/Asik-oldugu-iki-kadinin-adi-da-Marie-ydi---.htm?ArticleID=46171 "Aşık olduğu iki kadının adı da Marie'ydi..."], Posta.com.tr, 11 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of his first wife was also Marie, and both of them were [[France|French]].&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt; From his first wife Marie, whom he met in [[Paris]], he had two daughters named Fatma and Hayriye.&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt; From his second wife Marie (Naile Hanım), whom he met in [[Vienna]], he had three daughters named Melek, Leyla and Nazlı, and one son named Edhem.&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt;|}}

Osman Hamdi exhibited three paintings at the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 Paris Exposition Universelle]].&lt;ref name="W. Shaw, p. 98"/&gt; None seem to have survived today, but their titles were ''Repose of the Gypsies'', ''Black Sea Soldier Lying in Wait'', and ''Death of the Soldier''.
An important step in his career was his assignment as the director of the Imperial Museum (Müze-i Hümayun) in 1881. He used his position as museum director to develop the museum and rewrite the antiquities laws and to create nationally sponsored archaeological expeditions. In 1882, he instituted and became director of the [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University|Academy of Fine Arts]], which provided Ottomans with training in aesthetics and artistic techniques without leaving the empire.&lt;ref&gt;W. Shaw, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he oversaw the promulgation of a Regulation prohibiting historical artifacts from being smuggled abroad ''(Asar-ı Atîka Nizamnamesi)'', a giant step in constituting a legal framework of preservation of the antiquities. Representatives or middlemen of 19th-century European Powers routinely smuggled artifacts with historical value from within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (which then comprised the geographies of [[ancient Greek]] and [[Mesopotamian]] civilizations, among others), often resorting to shadily obtained licenses or bribes, to enrich museums in European capitals.

He conducted the first scientific based archaeological researches done by a Turkish team. His digs included sites as varied as the [[Commagene]] tomb-sanctuary in [[Nemrut Dağı]] in southeastern [[Anatolia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1886.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/items/show/76325|title=Le Tumulus de Nemroud-Dagh : voyage, description, inscriptions ... {{!}} 1886 - Collections patrimoniales numérisées de Bordeaux Montaigne|website=1886.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a top tourist's venue in Turkey and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] today, within the [[Adıyaman Province]]), the [[Hekate]] [[sanctuary]] in [[Lagina]] in southwestern Anatolia (much less visited, and within the [[Muğla Province]] today), and [[Sidon]] in [[Lebanon]]. The [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] he discovered in Sidon (including the one known as the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]], although this sarcophagus is thought to contain the remains of either [[Abdalonymus]], King of [[Sidon]]; or [[Mazaeus]], a Persian noble who was also the governor of [[Babylon]]) are considered among the worldwide jewels of archaeological findings. To lodge these, he started building what is today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]] in 1881. The museum officially opened in 1891 under his directorship.

Throughout his professional career as museum and academy director, Osman Hamdi continued to paint in the style of his teachers, Gérôme and Boulanger.

==''The Tortoise Trainer''==
His 1906 painting, ''[[The Tortoise Trainer]]'', broke a record in Turkey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/osman-hamdis-lost-masterpiece-in-auction-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=65652&amp;NewsCatID=385|title=Osman Hamdi’s 'lost' masterpiece in auction|access-date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by being sold for the amount of 3.5 million [[dollars]] in December 2004. The painting expresses a sarcastic [[innuendo]] on the painter's own view of his style of work compared to those of his collaborators and apprentices, and is also a reference to the historical fact of tortoises having been employed for illuminative and decorative purposes, by placing candles on the shell, in evening outings during the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]] in the early 18th century. The painting was acquired by the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation and is currently on display at the [[Pera Museum]] in [[İstanbul]], which was established by this foundation.

Modern researchers have identified  the animals portrayed are ''[[Testudo graeca]] ibera'', a variety of the Spur-thighed tortoise. A reproduction of the painting appeared on the cover of the ''[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]'' issue in which the paper about the identification was published.&lt;ref&gt;Bettelheim, Matthew P. and Ertan Taskavak. 2006. "The Tortoise and the Tulip – Testudo graeca ibera and Osman Hamdi's ''The Tortoise Trainer''". ''[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]''. 6(2): pp 11–15. The paper is mentioned, and the magazine cover is shown, at [http://www.t-ad.net/ishbh/pub.html ISHBH publication list]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CampusMartius1907.JPG|left|thumb|Old Detroit Opera House on Campus Martius in 1907]]
During the late 1980s the great old [[motion picture]] screens and live performance stages began to be restored. The [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]], [[Detroit Opera House]] (formerly the Grand Circus Theatre; Broadway Capitol Theatre; Paramount Theatre; Capital Theatre), and [[The Fillmore Detroit]] (formerly the State Theater; Palms Theater) are notable restorations. The Fillmore Detroit is the site of the annual [[Detroit Music Awards]] held in April. Other venues were modernized and expanded such as [[Orchestra Hall, Detroit|Orchestra Hall]], the home of the world-renowned [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]. Next to the Detroit Opera House is the restored 1,700-seat [[Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts]] (1928) at 350 Madison Avenue, designed by William Kapp and developed by [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]]. The [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] contains the renovated 1,150-seat [[Detroit Film Theatre]]. Smaller sites with long histories in the city were preserved by physically moving the entire structure. In a notable preservation, the [[Gem Theatre (Detroit)|Gem Theatre]] and  [[Century Theatre (Detroit)|Century Theatre]] were moved (off their foundation) to a new address across from the Music Hall Center in order to construct [[Comerica Park]]. Detroit's 1,571-seat [[Redford Theatre]] (1928), with its Japanese [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], is home to the Motor City Theatre Organ Society (MCTOS).&lt;ref name=DetroitInteriors&gt;{{cite web |author = AIA Detroit Urban Priorities Committee |date = January 10, 2006 |url = http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/lookinside.aspx |title = Top 10 Detroit Interiors |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723121710/http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/lookinside.aspx |archive-date = July 23, 2008 |publisher = Model D Media |access-date = November 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RedfordTheatre&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/16098.htm |title = Redford Theatre Building |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606135050/http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/16098.htm |archive-date = June 6, 2011 |publisher = Michigan State Historic Preservation Office |access-date = January 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Wayne State University]]’s  [[Hilberry Theatre (Wayne State University)]] in [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], the only graduate [[repertory theater]] in the nation, Detroit has enjoyed a resurgence in theatrical productions and attendance. In the 2000s, shows ranging from touring musicals to local theater happen nightly and the theaters have sparked a significant increase in nightlife; [[hospitality]] ventures serving the area have increased accordingly. With its sports venues and casinos, the Detroit Theater District has helped revitalized high rise residential areas like those surrounding [[Grand Circus Park Historic District|Grand Circus Park]] and its nearby ''Foxtown'', [[Greektown Historic District|Greektown]], the [[Cultural Center Historic District|Cultural Center]] and [[New Center Detroit|New Center]] area anchored by the 2,089-seat [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theatre]].&lt;ref name=AIADetroit/&gt;

'''''Prometheus''''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|ə|ˈ|m|iː|θ|i|ə|s}} {{Respell|prə|MEE|thee-əs}}) is a 2012 [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]], written by [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[Damon Lindelof]] and starring [[Noomi Rapace]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Guy Pearce]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Logan Marshall-Green]], and [[Charlize Theron]]. It is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship ''Prometheus'' as it follows a [[star map]] discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human species.

Development of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]]. Scott and director [[James Cameron]] developed ideas for a film that would serve as a [[prequel]] to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. In 2002, the development of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' took precedence, and the project remained dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the ''Alien'' films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of ''Alien'' but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares "strands of ''Alien''{{'}}s DNA, so to speak", and takes place in the same [[fictional universe|universe]], ''Prometheus'' explores its own mythology and ideas.

''Prometheus'' entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that the film required were developed. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2011, with an estimated $120–130&amp;nbsp;million budget. The project was shot using [[3D film|3D]] cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and on location in England, Iceland, Spain, and Scotland. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards.

''Prometheus'' was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in [[North America]]. The film received praise for the aesthetic design and the acting, especially Fassbender's performance as the android David, while plot elements that remained unresolved or predictable were the main source of criticism. The film grossed over $403 million worldwide.  A sequel, ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'', was released in May 2017.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! --&gt;
As a spacecraft departs a planet, a [[humanoid]] alien drinks an [[iridescent]] liquid, causing its body to dissolve. As its remains cascade into a waterfall, the alien's DNA falls apart and recombines.

In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a [[star chart|star map]] in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the "Engineers." Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel ''Prometheus,'' to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] while the [[android (robot)|android]] David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.

The ''Prometheus'' lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to ''Prometheus'', but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.

Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to ''Prometheus'', but Vickers refuses to let him aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]], is pregnant. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard ''Prometheus.'' He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as "Father".

A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the ''Prometheus'' and kills several crew members before he is killed. The ''Prometheus''{{'}} captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the ''Prometheus'' into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an [[ovipositor]] down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.

In the lifeboat, an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Deacon|alien creature]] bursts out of the Engineer's chest.

*[[Noomi Rapace]] as Elizabeth Shaw:
:Rapace described Shaw, an archaeologist, as a believer in God with a very strong faith, and said that, "In the middle of the movie, things happen and she changes into more of a warrior. And in the end, she's such a survivor."&lt;ref name="colliderrapaceinterview"/&gt; To aid her [[method acting]], she developed a complete backstory for Shaw,&lt;ref name="CastRapace6"/&gt; and worked with a dialect coach to achieve a British accent.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}} She also asked her make-up artist to apply extra blood and sweat during filming to more accurately portray her character.&lt;ref name="CastRapace10"/&gt; Rapace said, "I was out there filming for about six months and it was super-intense, my body was in so much pain sometimes but it was absolutely amazing."&lt;ref name="Filming9"/&gt; She dismissed comparisons to the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]]'s [[Ellen Ripley]].&lt;ref name="CastRapace5"/&gt; Rapace came to director Ridley Scott's attention for her performance as [[Lisbeth Salander]] in the 2009 drama film ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]''. She met Scott in August 2010,&lt;ref name="CastRapace1"/&gt; and by January 2011 she had secured the role.&lt;ref name="Cast1"/&gt; Actresses [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Carey Mulligan]], and [[Abbie Cornish]] were all considered for the role during development.&lt;ref name="CastRapace2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastRapace3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastRapace4"/&gt; [[Lucy Hutchinson (actress)|Lucy Hutchinson]], who was eight years old in 2012, portrays Shaw as a child.&lt;ref name="Lucy"/&gt;
*[[Michael Fassbender]] as [[David 8|David]]:
: David is an [[android (robot)|android]] that acts as the ship's butler and maintenance man. It is designed to be indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy".&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiscWonderCon12"/&gt; Writer [[Damon Lindelof]] stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?"&lt;ref name="CastFass2"/&gt; Fassbender said, "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance".&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of ''Alien'' (1979) and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), and instead studied the [[replicant]]s in Scott's 1982 science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', with a focus on [[Sean Young]]'s character Rachael, whose "vacancy" and longing for a soul interested him.&lt;ref name="CastFass5"/&gt; Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the [[HAL 9000]] computer in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref name="CastFass5"/&gt; the "funny walk and economy of movement" of Olympic diver [[Greg Louganis]],&lt;ref name="Sequel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastFass4"/&gt; and the performances of [[David Bowie]] in ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', [[Dirk Bogarde]] in ''[[The Servant (1963 film)|The Servant]]'', and [[Peter O'Toole]] in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.&lt;ref name="Marketing40"/&gt; David's blond hair was modeled on that of [[T. E. Lawrence]].{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=72}} Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast,&lt;ref name="CastFass1"/&gt; despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt;
*[[Charlize Theron]] as Meredith Vickers:
:Vickers is a Weyland Corporation employee who is sent to monitor the expedition.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=67}} Theron described the character as "a suit who slowly sheds [her] skin through the film",&lt;ref name="CastTheron2"/&gt; and also as "somewhat of a villain&amp;nbsp;... [who] definitely has an agenda".&lt;ref name="CastTheron3"/&gt; She stated "Vickers is pragmatic, and desperately wants to control the situation."&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; Scott wanted the character to lurk in the background of scenes watching other characters instead of being the focus. Theron said that this helped layer her character because "you're just so suspicious of her, instantly."{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}} The similarities between the appearances and mannerisms of Vickers and David were intended to raise the possibility that David was based on Vickers's DNA, or that Vickers is an android herself.&lt;ref name="CastTheron6"/&gt; After Theron was cast in the role, she developed three new scenes with Scott and Lindelof to expand her character.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; Physical action scenes, some of which involved her running through sand in {{convert|30|lb|kg|adj=on}} boots were a problem for Theron.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}} It was intended that Theron would portray Shaw, but a prior commitment to ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' prevented her involvement. When that film was delayed, she was able to rejoin ''Prometheus''.{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2012|pp=7–8}} [[Michelle Yeoh]] and [[Angelina Jolie]]&lt;ref name="Cast1"/&gt; were considered for the role.&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt;
*[[Idris Elba]] as Janek:
:Janek is the captain of the ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="CastElba1"/&gt; Elba described the character as "a longshoreman and a sailor", with a military background.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=66}} He said, "[being the captain is] his life and the crew is his responsibility,"&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; and "he's a realistic, pragmatic character. He has to get involved&amp;nbsp;... in a film with huge ideas, you need a character like this, who can go 'Wait&amp;nbsp;... why are we doing this?{{' "}}.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=66}}
*[[Guy Pearce]] as Peter Weyland:
:Weyland is the billionaire founder and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Weyland Corp.&lt;ref name="MarketingTED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastPearce4"/&gt; Lindelof described him as having a massive ego and suffering from a [[god complex]].&lt;ref name="MarketingTED"/&gt; Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement the most difficult part of the role.&lt;ref name="CastPearce5"/&gt; [[Max von Sydow]] was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt;
*[[Logan Marshall-Green]] as Charlie Holloway:
:Holloway is an archaeologist and Shaw's love interest.&lt;ref name="CastGreen2"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=69}} Marshall-Green was cast after he was seen performing on stage "[[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-''off'' Broadway]]".{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=69}} He described Holloway as the "[[X Games]]-type scientist", and said that he liked the character's "leap-before-looking" philosophy. He also said that Holloway "doesn't want to meet his maker. He wants to stand next to his maker. He's willing to go to the edge to get that."{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=69}} Describing the character's motivation, he said: "he goes to the extreme in everything he does, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse of the [''Prometheus crew'']. I think what drives him is the thrill of the search."&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; Marshall-Green contrasted Holloway with Shaw, and said: "she's the believer. I'm the scientist. I'm the skeptic. I'm the atheist".&lt;ref name="CastGreen3"/&gt;

*[[Sean Harris]] as Fifield:
:Fifield is a geologist who has become mentally unstable after many missions.&lt;ref name="CastHarris1"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=65}} Harris described the character as "someone who can sense when things are up. He's your audience guy, going, 'Don't go in that tunnel. We should not be doing this!{{' "}}{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=65}} Fifield's bright red [[mohawk hairstyle]] was designed by Harris and Scott, based on Scott's sketch of a man with a "severe haircut".{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=65}}

*[[Rafe Spall]] as Millburn:
:Millburn is a [[biology|biologist]]. Spall auditioned for another role, but Scott wanted him to play Millburn.&lt;ref name="CastTheron5"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=70}} On his casting, Spall said "''Alien'' is one of the best films ever made, and it's a real buzz to be in a space suit on an ''Alien'' set with Ridley Scott coming and speaking to you. It's incredible. That's why I wanted to be an actor, to be in a space suit on an ''Alien'' set".&lt;ref name="pre2"/&gt;

Other cast members include [[Kate Dickie]] as the ship's medic, Ford;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=70}} [[Emun Elliott]] and [[Benedict Wong]] as, respectively, ship pilots Chance and Ravel;&lt;ref name="CastElliot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastElliot2"/&gt; and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Shaw's father.&lt;ref name="CastWilson1"/&gt; [[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]] and Daniel James portray Engineers.&lt;ref name="CastEngineer"/&gt;

==Themes==
The central theme in ''Prometheus'' concerns the [[Prometheus|eponymous Titan]] of [[Greek mythology]] who defies the gods and gifts humanity with fire, for which he is subjected to eternal punishment.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods.&lt;ref name="Theme5"/&gt; The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods—their creators—and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find God and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the ''Prometheus'' crew suffer consequences for their pursuit.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants her religious beliefs affirmed,&lt;ref name="Writing23"/&gt; and believes she is entitled to answers from God; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her [[hubris]].&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt; The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered.&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt; Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme8"/&gt; However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be "a little too on the nose."&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;

[[Artificial intelligence]], a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, is particularly evident in ''Prometheus'', primarily through the android David.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman and Nancy Kang, eds. | title = The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott | pages= 121–142 | publisher=Lexington Books | year= 2013 | isbn = 978-0-7391-7872-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; David is like humans but does not want to be like them, eschewing a common theme in "robotic storytelling" such as ''Blade Runner''. David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the ''Prometheus'' ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is underwhelmed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own.&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt;{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=60}} Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David.&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt; At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.&lt;ref name="Theme3"/&gt;

Another theme is creation and the question of "Who Am I? Who Made Me? Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?"&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme7"/&gt; Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of man, but Scott was interested in [[Greco-Roman]] and [[Aztec]] creation myths about gods who create man in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a "gardener in space" to bring life to a world.&lt;ref name="Theme8"/&gt; One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations.&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt; Scott likened the Engineers to the dark angels of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme9"/&gt;

Shaw is the only religious believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she was created by the Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers.&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt; In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that ''Prometheus'' is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.&lt;ref name="Theme10"/&gt;

Beside drawing several influences from ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s [[Govindini Murty]] noted further influences, and wrote that "[t]he striking images Ridley Scott devises for ''Prometheus'' reference everything from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'' to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' and [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]''. Scott also expands on the original ''Alien'' universe by creating a distinctly English mythology informed by Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' and the symbolic drawings of [[William Blake]]."&lt;ref name="GuideTheAtlantic"/&gt;

==Production==

===Development===
Development on a fifth film in the ''Alien'' franchise was in progress by 2002. Scott considered returning to the series he created with his 1979 science fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', to pursue a sequel that would explore the engineered origins of the series's [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien creatures]],&lt;ref name="Development15"/&gt; and the "space jockey"—the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial being]], who briefly appears in ''Alien'', as the deceased pilot of a derelict spaceship.&lt;ref name="Development1"/&gt; ''Alien'' star [[Sigourney Weaver]] also expressed interest in returning to the series.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; ''Aliens'' director [[James Cameron]] discussed the potential for a sequel with Scott, and began working with another writer on a story for the film. It was then that [[20th Century Fox]] approached Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series's monsters against the title characters of the ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' films; this project became the 2004 science fiction film ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.&lt;ref name="Development14"/&gt; After Fox confirmed that it would pursue the crossover, Cameron stopped working on his own project, believing the crossover would "kill the validity of the franchise."&lt;ref name="vespe"/&gt; In 2006, Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the ''Alien'' sequel project, believing that the series was Fox's asset, and he was unwilling to deal with the studio's attempts to influence the potential sequel.&lt;ref name="Development14"/&gt;

In May 2009, Fox said that the project was a "reboot"&lt;ref name="prometheusblueprint"/&gt; of the ''Alien'' franchise, and soon afterwards was reported as an untitled prequel to ''Alien''.&lt;ref name="Development3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott"/&gt; Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former [[Television advertisement|television advertisement director]] [[Carl Rinsch|Carl Erik Rinsch]] as director. Fox was only interested in pursuing the project if Scott directed.&lt;ref name="Development5"/&gt; By July 2009, Scott was contracted to direct the film, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was hired to write the script based on his pitched idea for a direct ''Alien'' prequel.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}}&lt;ref name="Development6"/&gt; With the director and writer in place, and pleased with Spaihts's pitch, Fox scheduled a release date for December 2011, but this was eventually canceled.&lt;ref name="Writing1"/&gt; In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and that pre-production would begin, and a filming date was set for January 2011.&lt;ref name="Development13"/&gt; Fox eventually pushed to develop the project into an original work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been hired to redevelop Spaihts's screenplay.&lt;ref name="Development7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Writing22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HomeMedia10"/&gt; In October 2010, Lindelof submitted his rewritten screenplay to Fox. Scott had initially requested a $250 million budget and an adult oriented project, but Fox was reluctant to invest this amount of money, and wanted to ensure the film would receive a lower age-rating to broaden the potential audience.&lt;ref name="prometheusblueprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development8"/&gt;

In December 2010, it was reported that the film would be called ''Paradise'',&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt; named after John Milton's poem ''Paradise Lost'', but Scott considered that this would convey too much information about the film. Fox CEO [[Thomas Rothman]] suggested ''Prometheus'', which was confirmed as the title in January 2011.&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development9"/&gt; A release date was scheduled for {{nowrap|March 9, 2012}}, but weeks later the release was postponed until {{nowrap|June 8, 2012}}.&lt;ref name="Development9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Release1"/&gt; With the name confirmed, the production team began to publicly distance the film from its ''Alien'' origins, and were deliberately vague about the connection between the films, believing it would build audience anticipation for ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="Writing22"/&gt; Scott stated that "while ''Alien'' was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of ''Alien''{{'}}s DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative."&lt;ref name="Development10"/&gt; In June 2011, Scott and Lindelof confirmed that ''Prometheus'' takes place in the same universe as the events of the ''Alien'' series.&lt;ref name="CineEurope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pre"/&gt; In July 2011, Scott stated that "by the end of the third act you start to realize there's a DNA of the very first ''Alien'', but none of the subsequent [films]."&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott" /&gt;

===Writing===
{{quote box|quote="...&amp;nbsp;We're exploring the future&amp;nbsp;... away from Earth and [asking] what are people like now?&amp;nbsp;... Space exploration in the future is going to evolve into this idea that it's not just about going out there and finding planets to build colonies. It also has this inherent idea that the further we go out, the more we learn about ourselves. The characters in this movie are preoccupied with the idea: what are our origins?"|source=—Damon Lindelof, concerning the scope of ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="scottbeams"/&gt;|width=35%|align=left}}

Spaihts met Scott in late 2009 and they discussed Scott's desire to pursue an ''Alien'' prequel. Spaihts offered his concept, including a "bridge" that would connect the story of the film's human characters to the ''Alien'' saga. Spaihts was quickly hired, which he credited to the reception of his "bridge" idea. Spaihts claimed he created the concept spontaneously, without preconception. Spaihts wrote a 20-page "extremely detailed outline"; within three and a half weeks he had completed his first draft, and he submitted it to the producers on Christmas Day, 2009. Within 12 hours, Scott returned the script with notes for changes, and Spaihts spent the Christmas holiday redrafting.&lt;ref name="Writing1"/&gt;

Spaihts was tasked with exploring unresolved mysteries from ''Alien'', such as the Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of ''Alien'' to be alien in nature, and said, "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and&amp;nbsp;... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'&amp;nbsp;... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" His solution was to link the alien mysteries to the past and future of humanity. He said: "If that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story, that story changes meaning within our life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently."&lt;ref name="Writing2"/&gt; Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float.&lt;ref name="Writing1"/&gt; By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft.&lt;ref name="Development3"/&gt; Scott said about the script, "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?"&lt;ref name="Development7"/&gt; In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.&lt;ref name="Development13"/&gt;

However, Scott instead contacted Lindelof and asked him to review Spaihts's script.{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it.&lt;ref name="Writing20"/&gt; Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the ''Alien'' films, such as the ''Alien'' creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to ''Alien'', the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series,{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} Lindelof said, "If the ending to [''Prometheus''] is just going to be the room that [[John Hurt]] walks into that's full of [alien] eggs [in ''Alien''], there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end."{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} "A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world."&lt;ref name="pre"/&gt;

[[File:Damon Lindelof by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|thumb|Writer [[Damon Lindelof]] promoting ''Prometheus'' at [[WonderCon]] in 2012. Lindelof was hired to rewrite [[Jon Spaihts]]'s original script.]]
Lindelof said that the other parts of the script were strong enough to survive without the ''Alien'' hallmarks, such as the ''Alien'' creature, which he believed had been diluted by the exposure it had received.&lt;ref name="pre"/&gt; He said, "[The producers] were just looking for someone to say to them, Hey, we don't need the ''Alien'' stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can be a part of this movie, but it shouldn't be what it's about."&lt;ref name="Writing21"/&gt; Lindelof said that the film could instead run parallel to the ''Alien'' series and that a sequel would be ''Prometheus 2'' and not ''Alien'', and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}}&lt;ref name="Writing21"/&gt; Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's ''Alien'' prequel into an original creation.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}} Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the ''Alien'' symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010.&lt;ref name="Writing22"/&gt; Inspired by ''Blade Runner'' and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that it would be possible to combine an ''Alien'' story of action and horror with "the ''Blade Runner'' thematic,"{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films. Lindelof said,

{{quote|''Blade Runner'' might not have done well [financially] when it first came out, but people are still talking about it because it was infused with all these big ideas. [Scott] was also talking about very big themes in ''Prometheus''. It was being driven by people who wanted the answers to huge questions. But I thought that we could do that without ever getting too pretentious. Nobody wants to see a movie where people are floating in space talking about the meaning of life&amp;nbsp;... That was already present in [Spaihts's] original script and [Scott] just wanted to bring it up more.{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}}}}

Scott's story concept was partially inspired by ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', [[Erich von Däniken]]'s work about the theory of [[ancient astronauts]] which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens.&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CineEurope"/&gt; Scott said, "NASA and the Vatican agree that [it is] almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way&amp;nbsp;... That's what we're looking at [in the film], at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did we humans come about."&lt;ref name="CineEurope"/&gt; Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but does not want to be anything like them, eschewing a common theme in "robotic storytelling" such as ''Blade Runner''. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=60}} For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from ''Alien''{{'}}s Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.&lt;ref name="Writing23"/&gt;

===Pre-production===
Pre-production began in April 2010. A team developed graphic designs for the film.&lt;ref name="Development3"/&gt; Scott convinced Fox to invest millions of dollars to hire scientists and conceptual artists to develop a vision of the late 21st century.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; The production of ''Prometheus'' was marked by a high degree of secrecy&lt;ref name="PrePro4"/&gt; and story details were kept "extremely under-wraps."&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt; Ridley Scott was determined to maintain the secrecy of the plot, and he required the cast to sign clauses to prevent them disclosing story details, and the cast were allowed to read the script only under supervision in Scott's production office. One exception was made when a courier flew the script to one actor outside the US, and then stood guard while the actor read it. Scott said, "I was insistent that the script not leak onto the internet, where it gets dissected out of context, which spoils it for everyone."&lt;ref name="idrisprometheus"/&gt;

In July 2011, Lindelof said that the film would rely upon [[practical effects]], and would use [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals.&lt;ref name="PrePro6"/&gt; Scott said that "you can pretty much do anything you want" with digital technology,&lt;ref name="Sequel1"/&gt; and, "[[Douglas Trumbull|Doug Trumbull]] once said to me 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper."&lt;ref name="PrePro7"/&gt; Cinematographer [[Dariusz Wolski]] convinced Scott that it would be possible to film in [[3D film|3D]] with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company [[3ality Technica]] provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation.&lt;ref name="PrePro9"/&gt; According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget.{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2012|p=8}} Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the ''Alien'' films was added in post-production using [[Color grading|color grading processes]], and the 3D equipment was based on post-[[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']] technology.&lt;ref name="PrePro8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ProPro8b"/&gt;

===Principal photography===
[[File:Iceland Dettifoss 1972-4.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Dettifoss|Dettifoss waterfall]] in Iceland was used in the film's opening scene showing an Engineer creating life.]]

Principal photography began on March 21, 2011, lasted 82 days, and had an estimated $120–130 million budget.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming10"/&gt; Filming began at [[Shepperton Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]] in England.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}}&lt;ref name="FilmingUk1"/&gt; Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the [[007 Stage]].&lt;ref name="idrisprometheus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmingUk1"/&gt; Studio space was limited and the crew had to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased the size of the 007 stage by over 30%.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

Exterior shots of the alien world were shot in Iceland,{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2011|p=43}} where filming occurred for two weeks. It commenced on July 11, 2011, at the base of [[Hekla]], an active volcano in southern Iceland. Speaking about working at the volcano, Scott said, "If one is afraid of nature in this profession then it would be best to find a different job".&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland2"/&gt; Filming also took place at [[Dettifoss]], one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe.&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland1"/&gt; The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew.&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland2"/&gt; Scott said that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented the beginning of time.&lt;ref name="Filming5"/&gt; [[Morocco]] had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 [[Arab Spring]] protests forced the change of venue.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; Alternatives including the [[Mojave Desert]] had been considered,&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland3"/&gt; but Scott explained that [[Iceland]] was ultimately chosen because "here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive".&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland2"/&gt;

In September 2011, filming moved to the [[Ciudad de la Luz]] audiovisual complex in [[Alicante]], Spain. Shooting areas included the complex's large water tank, and a nearby beach.&lt;ref name="Filming6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming7"/&gt; The complex was booked from August 22, 2011, through to December 10, 2011, and set construction occurred from August until late September.&lt;ref name="Filming6"/&gt; Approximately 250 people worked on the three-month-long Spain shoot, generating over [[Euro|€]]1 million in the local economy.&lt;ref name="Filming8"/&gt; Filming also took place in the [[Wadi Rum]] valley in Jordan.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt;

Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so the actors would know where they should be looking in any particular scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Epic]] 3D cameras set on [[Camera dolly|camera dollies]] and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a [[steadicam]], which was used only occasionally.&lt;ref name="PrePro9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming3"/&gt;

===Post-production===
Scott used the 3D footage to increase the [[stereoscopy|illusion of depth]]. Despite this being his first 3D film he found the process easy. He said, "You can literally twiddle a knob and the depth will increase", and, "the trick is not to overdo it".{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} In December 2011, Rapace undertook [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recordings]] for the film.&lt;ref name="colliderrapaceinterview"/&gt; Additional [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]] scenes were filmed during January 2012, including a one-day shoot on the [[Isle of Skye]], Scotland, and a new scene shot at a cave in the Scottish mountains.&lt;ref name="Skye"/&gt;{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=56}}&lt;ref name="PostPro21"/&gt; For dark scenes, the film was color graded to specifically compensate for the light loss of 3D glasses, to ensure the image was comparable to the 2D version.&lt;ref name="PostPro20"/&gt;

In July 2011, Scott said that he was filming ''Prometheus'' with both adult-oriented R and more accessible PG-13 [[Film rating#United States|film ratings]] in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience.&lt;ref name="PostPro1"/&gt; When asked about the rating, Scott said, "the question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference&amp;nbsp;... essentially it's kinda R&amp;nbsp;... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful."{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=77}} Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could,{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=77}} while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating.&lt;ref name="PostPro3"/&gt; On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made.&lt;ref name="Rating1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PostPro5"/&gt; According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would be the only way to gain a lower one.&lt;ref name="Editing1"/&gt; A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia3"/&gt; Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.&lt;ref name="Release6"/&gt;

===Music===
{{see also|Prometheus (soundtrack)}}

[[Marc Streitenfeld]], who had worked with Scott on earlier projects, composed the musical score for ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="Music1"/&gt; It took just over a week to record with a 90-piece orchestra at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt; Streitenfeld began writing ideas for the score after reading the script before filming commenced. He used some unusual techniques to compose the score, and said, "I actually wrote out the sheet music backwards so the orchestra played it backwards and then I digitally flipped it. So you're hearing the score as it's written, the same melody, but with a backwards sounding orchestra which gives it a kind of unusual, unsettling sound."&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt; The ''Prometheus (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'' album was released on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] on May 15, 2012,&lt;ref name="Soundtrack3"/&gt; and on CD on June 4, 2012.&lt;ref name="Soundtrack1"/&gt; It features 23 tracks by Streitenfeld and two supplemental tracks by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]].&lt;ref name="Soundtrack4"/&gt; [[Frédéric Chopin]]{{'}}s "[[Raindrop prelude]]" (1838) is also featured in the film.&lt;ref name="MusicChopin1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MusicChopin2"/&gt;

==Design==
[[Production designer]] [[Arthur Max]] led the film's design staff. His art team were tasked with deconstructing the art and visuals of ''Alien'', and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="PrePro3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Design2"/&gt; Influence was drawn from the work of ''Alien'' creature designer [[H. R. Giger]], and designers [[Ron Cobb]] and [[Chris Foss]], including their designs for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.&lt;ref name="Design2"/&gt;

===Costume design===
For the crew's space suits, Scott was inspired to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in [[Steve Jobs]]' biography about building an office out of [[Gorilla Glass]]. Scott said, "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 [vision]. Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet."&lt;ref name="MiscWonderCon12"/&gt; The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, [[Janty Yates]], used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a [[neoprene]] suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

Aboard the ship, Yates gave the characters their own distinct looks. Theron is dressed in an ice-silver, silk mohair suit. Yates said, "[Theron] is the ice queen. It was always our vision to make her look as sculptural as possible". Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career at the helm of a ship.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

===Sets and vehicles===
Arthur Max designed the sets such as the alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the ''Prometheus'' and the Engineer's ship.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}}&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them and to know where the CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks.&lt;ref name="Design30"/&gt; To create the ''Prometheus'', Max researched NASA and [[European Space Agency]] spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy."&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

The interior of the ''Prometheus'' was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a [[Fazioli]] piano.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; The ship's garage was built on the backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the interior of a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression.&lt;ref name="Design2"/&gt; Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott" /&gt;

For the scene of the ''Prometheus''{{'}} descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art director Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor [[Richard Stammers]] and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes to have a sense of grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in ''Alien''. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in ''Alien'', but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain [[Olympus Mons]] and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the ''Prometheus'', and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX1"/&gt;

===Creature effects===
[[File:Prometheus - Trilobite Adult.jpg|left|thumb|The practical model for the Adult Trilobite, featuring multiple long tentacle-like appendages and a mouth in the centre of its body]]
[[Neal Scanlan]] and [[Conor O'Sullivan (make-up artist)|Conor O'Sullivan]] developed the film's alien creatures, aiming to convey that each creature has a logical biological function and purpose. Scanlan said that much of Scott's inspiration for creature design is drawn from natural life, such as plants and sea creatures.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; Creature designer Carlos Huante chose to make the creature designs pale to contrast the black-toned, Giger-influenced aesthetic of ''Alien''. Huante designed them to be white and embryonic because the events in the film occur before Giger's influence had taken effect. Huante took influences from references Scott was using to design the pale-skinned Engineers. Huante also referenced other Giger works, national monuments, large sculptures, and the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] statue in South Dakota. Part of Huante's early design work included developing precursors to ''Alien''{{'}}s Facehugger, and a primitive ''Alien'' creature, but these were cut from the final release. When designing the Engineers, Scott and Huante referenced paintings by William Blake and [[J. M. W. Turner]], and classical sculptures.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; Scott wanted the Engineers to resemble [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] gods, and instructed designer [[Neville Page]] to reference the [[Statue of Liberty]], Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', and [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name="Design51"/&gt; The 8-foot tall, humanoid Engineers were created by applying bulky, full-body prosthetics to the actors, whose facial features were diminished by the material, and were later digitally enhanced to preserve the "godlike" physical perfection.&lt;ref name="Design50"/&gt; Scott described the Engineers as tall, elegant "dark angels".&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;

The snake-like alien dubbed the "Hammerpede" was given life through a mixture of CGI and practical effects, and the wires controlling the practical puppet were digitally removed. For a scene in which the Hammerpede is decapitated, the VFX team digitally animated and inserted the spontaneous growth of a replacement head.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX1"/&gt; During the scene in which the Hammerpede erupts from Spall's character's corpse, Scott controlled the puppet using wires. Scott did not inform Dickie about what was to occur in the scene and her screaming reaction was real. The creature's design was partially inspired by translucent sea creatures with visible arteries, veins, and organs beneath the skin's surface, and cobras. The designers gave the creature a smooth, muscular, and powerful appearance. Early designs of the "Trilobite", the tentacled offspring cut from Shaw, resembled an octopus or squid. Page redeveloped this creature as an embryo in an early state of development, with tentacles that began fused together and would gradually split, creating new tentacles, as the creature developed.&lt;ref name="DesignCreature1"/&gt; The practical creature was a remotely operated [[Animatronics|animatronic]] creation with a silicone skin.&lt;ref name="Editing1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesignCreature1"/&gt;

The mutated Fifield effects were achieved mainly through the use of make-up and prosthetics. Due to concerns that the practical effects would be unsatisfactory, the filmmakers completed an alternative version of the sequence, in which Fifield was rendered as "a digital character with elongated limbs and an engorged, translucent head, incorporating a semblance of Harris's face".&lt;ref name="Fifield1"/&gt; Three other variations of the mutated Fifield were modeled, but these were rejected as being too inhuman.&lt;ref name="Fifield2"/&gt;

For its grown form, the "Adult Trilobite", Max found inspiration from an [[arthropod]]-like creature from Earth's [[Cambrian]] period, and the alien octopus in [[Jean Giraud]]'s illustrations for the comic strip ''[[The Long Tomorrow (comics)|The Long Tomorrow]]''. Further inspiration came after Max found a formaldehyde-preserved giant squid, an image which met with Scott's approval. The film's last-unveiled creature, the "[[Proto-Xenomorph|Deacon]]", was named by Scott for its long, pointed head that he considered resembled a bishop's mitre. Scanlan aimed to represent the creature's genetic lineage, beginning with Shaw and Holloway who produce the Trilobite which impregnates the Engineer, in its design. However, the creature was given a somewhat feminine appearance, since "it was born of a female before being born of a male." Messing drew inspiration for the Deacon's birth scene from the birth of foals, and created an iridescent appearance for its skin, based on the equine placenta.&lt;ref name="DesignCreature1"/&gt; The Deacon's protruding jaw was inspired by the [[goblin shark]].&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt;

===Sound effects===
Sound effects were generated with a variety of sources including [[Pop Rocks]]—a brand of popping candy—and a parrot. The glistening ice forming on the stone cylinders discovered in the film was created by applying the popping candy to materials such as wet metal and stone that was then sprayed with water to produce the "popping, cracking" sound. Sound designer Ann Scibelli's parrot was recorded over several weeks to document her variety of vocalizations which were then used as beeps, alarms and the cries of Shaw's alien offspring.&lt;ref name="DesignSound"/&gt;

===Visual effects===
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|right|The film's star map sequence was inspired by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]]'s painting ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]''.&lt;ref name="Writing2"/&gt;]]

''Prometheus'' contains approximately 1,300 digital effect shots.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} The main effects studio was [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), which produced 420 of the shots.&lt;ref name="PostPro20"/&gt; Several other studios, including [[Weta Digital]],&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; Fuel VFX,&lt;ref name="PostPro2"/&gt; [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Luma Pictures]], Lola Visual Effects, and Hammerhead Productions, also produced effects shots for the film.&lt;ref name="PostPro10"/&gt;

The creation of life from the disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey the story of the Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring over an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX3"/&gt;

A key scene involving a large 3D hologram star map, dubbed the [[Orrery]], was inspired by the 1766 [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]] painting ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'', in which a scientist displays a mechanical planetarium by candlelight. While discussing the necessity of a star map with Spaihts, Scott mentioned that he envisaged a physical representation being similar to the painting, although he was unaware of its title and described it as "circles in circles with a candle lit image". Using Scott's description, Spaihts located an image of the painting. Spaihts said, "making the leap from a star map, to an Enlightenment painting, and then back into the far future. [Scott's] mind just multiplexes in that way".&lt;ref name="Writing2"/&gt; The Orrery was one of the most complex visual effects, contained 80–100 million polygons, and took several weeks to render as a single, complete shot.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX1"/&gt;

==Marketing==
[[File:Ridley Scott, Charlize Theron &amp; Michael Fassbender by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ridley Scott]], [[Charlize Theron]], and [[Michael Fassbender]] promoting the film at [[WonderCon]] in March 2012]]

''Prometheus''{{'}} marketing campaign began on July 21, 2011 at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], where images and footage from the film were presented by Lindelof and Theron; Scott and Rapace participated via [[satellite contribution]].&lt;ref name="scottbeams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing10"/&gt; A segment of the footage showed Theron performing naked push-ups, which attracted much attention.&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing12"/&gt; A teaser poster was released on December 14, 2011, with the tagline, "The search for our beginning could lead to our end."&lt;ref name="Marketing14"/&gt; A bootleg recording of an incomplete trailer was leaked online on November 27, 2011, but was quickly taken down by Fox.&lt;ref name="Marketing15"/&gt; The trailer was released on December 22, 2011.&lt;ref name="Marketing19"/&gt;

On March 17, 2012, Scott, in partnership with [[AMC Theatres]], hosted the premiere of the first full ''Prometheus'' trailer at the AMC Downtown Disney during [[WonderCon]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The event was streamed live via Facebook, Twitter, and the AMC Theatre website, and the trailer was posted on AMC's YouTube channel immediately after its debut.&lt;ref name="MarketingFull1"/&gt; Reactions to the trailer from WonderCon attendees, and on Twitter, were generally positive,&lt;ref name="Marketing17"/&gt; and it received nearly three million views in the three days following its release.&lt;ref name="Marketing30"/&gt; On April 10, 2012, media outlets were shown a 13-minute montage of scenes in 3D from the film's opening at the [[Vue Cinemas|Vue Cinema]] in Leicester Square, London.&lt;ref name="Marketing41"/&gt; The screening, and in particular the 3D visuals and the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, Theron, and Elba, was well received.&lt;ref name="Marketing40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing42"/&gt;

On April 29, 2012, the international launch trailer debuted in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]] during the first advertisement break of the TV show ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''. Viewers were encouraged to share their opinions about the trailer on Twitter, some of which were then shared in a live broadcast during a later break. This was the first time that viewers' tweets were used in a broadcast advertisement.&lt;ref name="Marketing50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing51"/&gt; A competition, offering viewers a chance to win tickets to the film whenever the social platform [[Zeebox]] detected the advertisement airing, was launched on that site.&lt;ref name="Marketing52"/&gt; On May 8, 2012, the advertisement became the subject of an investigation by the British broadcasting regulatory body [[Ofcom]] for allegedly breaching broadcast rules when a voiceover encouraged viewers to book tickets during the advertisement with the {{nowrap|Channel 4}} logo onscreen. The broadcast potentially broke a ruling that advertising and teleshopping must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.&lt;ref name="Marketing54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing55"/&gt;

Although marketers typically avoid promoting adult-oriented films to reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Verizon FiOS]], which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]], and placed promotional material in products shipped to customers; this was the first time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company.&lt;ref name="Marketing71"/&gt; The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them to reporters to ask at the event.&lt;ref name="Premiere"/&gt; The [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] (NECA) released a series of ''Prometheus'' action figures in September 2012.&lt;ref name="MarketingToy1"/&gt; A book, ''Prometheus: The Art of the Film'', containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.&lt;ref name="MarketingBook1"/&gt;

===Viral campaign===
[[File:Prometheus Viral 3 - David.jpg|thumb|upright|An advertisement for "David" (portrayed by Michael Fassbender) printed in newspapers. The advert highlights the viral website campaign and the film's marketing partnership with [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]].]]
A viral marketing campaign began on February 28, 2012, with the release of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the ''TED 2023'' video presents a futuristic vision of a [[TED (conference)|TED]] conference, an annual technology and design event held in [[Long Beach, California]]. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because "a guy like Peter Weyland—whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris—that he'd basically say to TED, 'If you want me to give a talk, I'm giving it in [[Wembley Stadium]].{{' "}}&lt;ref name="MarketingTED"/&gt;

TED community director Tom Rielly helped the film's producers gain approval for the use of the TED brand, which had not previously been used for promotional purposes. Rielly was involved in designing the 2023 conference, and said that the association generated millions of unique visits to the TED website.&lt;ref name="Marketing31"/&gt; The video's release was accompanied by a fictional TED blog about the 2023 conference and a tie-in website for the fictional Weyland Corporation.&lt;ref name="CastPearce1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing21"/&gt; On March 6, 2012, the Weyland website was updated to allow visitors to invest in the company as part of a game, which would reveal new ''Prometheus'' media.&lt;ref name="MarketingArg1"/&gt;

During the 2012 WonderCon, attendees at the film's panel were given Weyland Corporation business cards that directed them to a website and telephone number. After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the "David 8" android, narrated by Fassbender.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral2"/&gt; An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarketingViral4"/&gt; A full page "David 8" advertisement was placed in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''; a Twitter account operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character questions, was included.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral16"/&gt; A partnership with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the ''Prometheus'' spaceship.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral16"/&gt; Another video, "Quiet Eye", starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page.&lt;ref name="Premiere"/&gt; In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the ''Alien'' series, Shaw requests Weyland's aid to seek out alien life.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral17"/&gt; In France, the [[Saint-Martin (Paris Métro)|Saint-Martin]] [[ghost station|ghost train station]] was converted to resemble alien architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters.&lt;ref name="Marketing73"/&gt; The campaign continued after the film's release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the book.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarketingViral21"/&gt; Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.&lt;ref name="MarketingViralSep"/&gt;

At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof said that the videos originated from the question of the film's status as an ''Alien'' prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the ''Alien'' films. He also said that the videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral18"/&gt;

==Release==
The premiere of ''Prometheus'' took place on May 31, 2012, at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire cinema]] in Leicester Square, London.&lt;ref name="Release6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Premiere2"/&gt; The film was released in the United Kingdom on {{nowrap|June 1}}, 2012,&lt;ref name="Rating1"/&gt; and in North America on {{nowrap|June 8}}, 2012.&lt;ref name="Release1"/&gt; It was simultaneously released in [[IMAX]] theaters and in 3D,&lt;ref name="Release2"/&gt; and it is encoded for [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] motion seats that provide physical feedback to the audience during the film.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDBox"/&gt;

===Pre-release===
In the United Kingdom, approximately £1 million ($1.6 million) of tickets were pre-sold.&lt;ref name="BOInternational1"/&gt; 18,827 tickets pre-sold for the [[London IMAX]], the largest IMAX screen in the country, which broke the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with £293,312 ($474,687), and the highest grossing first day of pre-sales with £137,000 ($221,717).&lt;ref name="Release3"/&gt; It extended this record to 30,000 tickets sold and £470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance of high-profile IMAX releases including ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'' and ''Avatar''.&lt;ref name="Release4"/&gt;

In North America, audience tracking showed high interest among males, but low among females.&lt;ref name="ReleaseUSPre"/&gt; In the week before the film's release, predictions were conflicted on whether ''Prometheus'' or ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (the first family-oriented film of the summer),&lt;ref name="chicago1"/&gt; which were released simultaneously, would reach number 1 for that weekend. On June 6, 2012, Fandango reported that with 42% of daily sales ''Prometheus'' was beating ''Madagascar 3''. The online tracking for ''Prometheus'' surged with each additional promotional footage.&lt;ref name="boxofficecom1"/&gt; ''Prometheus'' was predicted to earn approximately $30 million, and ''Madagascar 3'' around $45 million.&lt;ref name="THR-predict"/&gt; As the weekend approached, tracking suggested a $55 million debut for ''Madagascar 3'' and $50–$55 million for ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="latimes-predict"/&gt; ''Prometheus'' was disadvantaged by ''Madagascar'' opening in 264 more theaters and its adult rating.&lt;ref name="BOM-forecast"/&gt;

===Box office===
''Prometheus'' was considered a financial success overall. After a strong start in North America, the film failed to meet the studio's expectations, but it continued to perform strongly in other territories until the end of its theatrical run.&lt;ref name="BOSuccess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess5"/&gt; ''Prometheus'' earned $126.4 million (31.4%) in North America and $276.9 million (68.6%) elsewhere for a worldwide total of $403.4 million,&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; making it the 18th highest-grossing film of 2012,&lt;ref name="BOM2012"/&gt; and at its peak it was the 155th highest-grossing film worldwide unadjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name="BOMalltime"/&gt;

&lt;!--Markets elsewhere--&gt;
''Prometheus'' was released in 15 markets between May 30 and June 1, 2012—about a week before its North American release. The earlier start in these countries was timed to avoid competition with the start of the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 UEFA European Football Championship]] the following week. On its opening day, which varies depending on the country, it earned $3.39 million in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="BOInternational2"/&gt; $2.2 million in Russia,&lt;ref name="BoInternational3"/&gt; and $1.5 million in France.&lt;ref name="BOInternational1"/&gt; The film earned $34.8 million during its opening weekend from 4,695 theaters in 15 markets, and debuted at number 1 in 14 of them, with an average of $7,461 per theater. Its overall rank for the weekend was third behind ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' and ''[[Snow White &amp; the Huntsman]]''.&lt;ref name="BOInterOpeningWeekend"/&gt; Its opening weekends in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($10.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($9.80 million), and France and the Maghreb region ($6.68 million) represented its largest takings.&lt;ref name="BOM-overseas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOInterOpeningWeekend2"/&gt; By June 8, the film had opened in a total of 50 markets, and was also successful during its opening weekends in Australia ($7.2 million) and South Korea ($4.2 million).&lt;ref name="overseas-second"/&gt; During its late August opening in Japan, the film earned $9.6 million.&lt;ref name="BOIntJAP"/&gt;

&lt;!--North America--&gt;
In North America, ''Prometheus'' earned $3.561 million in midnight showings at 1,368 theaters, including $1.03 million from 294 IMAX theaters, and went on to earn $21.4 million through its opening day.&lt;ref name="BONA1"/&gt; During its opening weekend, the film earned $51.05 million from 3,396 theaters—an average of $15,032 per theater—ranking second behind ''Madagascar 3'' ($60.4 million), which made it the second largest opening for a film directed by Scott behind his 2001 thriller ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', the third largest second-place opening, the ninth largest opening for a prequel, and the tenth largest for an R-rated film. The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25 (64%) and male (57%). 3D showings accounted for 54% of ticket sales, while IMAX contributed 18%—the majority of which was accounted for in the 3D figure.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOM-opening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BONA2"/&gt; The film closed on September 20, 2012 after 105 days (15 weeks) in release with a total gross of $126.4 million. The figure made it the number 43 highest-grossing film to never finish a week as the number 1 film.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[File:Michael Fassbender by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Fassbender in 2012. Critics were near unanimous in praise for his portrayal of the android David.]]

The film garnered a 73% approval rating from 288 critics—an [[weighted mean|average]] rating of 7/10 on the review-aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which said, "Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to ''Alien'' may not answer all of its big questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances—particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes" /&gt; [[Metacritic]] provides a score of 65 out of 100 from 42 critics, which indicates "generally favorable" reviews.&lt;ref name="Metacritic" /&gt; [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "B" on a scale of A+ to F, while audience members under 25 rated it the highest at A-.&lt;ref name="BONA1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BONA3" /&gt; Reviews frequently praised both the film's visual aesthetic and design, and Fassbender's performance as the android David received almost universal acclaim. However the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized plot elements that remained unresolved or were predictable, tempered by appreciation for the action and horror set-pieces.&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RevSum1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevSum2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevSum3"/&gt;

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s [[Todd McCarthy]] called the film's visuals vivid, stunning, and magnificent on a technical level, and praised the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, but wrote that the film "caters too much to imagined audience expectations when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected destinations."&lt;ref name="RevTHR"/&gt; ''[[Time Out London]]''{{'}}s Tom Huddleston wrote that "the photography is pleasingly crisp and the design is stunning", but that, "[t]he script feels flat&amp;nbsp;... the dialogue is lazy, while the plot, though crammed with striking concepts, simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy, confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum."&lt;ref name="RevTimeOutLon"/&gt; [[Emanuel Levy]] wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, "is not only uneven, but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver."&lt;ref name="RevLevy"/&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a "seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract." Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance "continues here the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in ''Alien''", but considered that Elba's Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does not answer them, which made the film intriguing and parallel to the "classic tradition of golden age sci-fi".&lt;ref name="RevEbert"/&gt; He later went on to name it as one of the best films of 2012.&lt;ref name="RevEbert2"/&gt;

''[[Total Film]]''{{'}}s Jonathan Crocker wrote that the plot successfully integrated itself with ''Alien''{{'}}s mythology while offering its own original ideas.&lt;ref name="RevTotalFilm"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Lisa Schwarzbaum was positive towards the cast, particularly Rapace, and the cinematography.&lt;ref name="RevEW"/&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''{{'}}s Andrew O'Hehir wrote that the film was "somber, spectacular and ponderous", but that the "portentousness and grandiosity&amp;nbsp;... is at once the film's great strength and great weakness" and criticized the characters for lacking common sense. O'Hehir also mentioned Wolski's cinematography and Max's production design.&lt;ref name="RevSalon"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[A. O. Scott]] criticized the story as weak, and argued that the narrative's twists and reversals undermine its "lofty, mindblowing potential". He said the film has no revelations, just "bits of momentarily surprising information bereft of meaning or resonance", and that Rapace is a "fine heroine, vulnerable and determined".&lt;ref name="RevNYT"/&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film critic Justin Chang wrote that the film's narrative structure was unable to handle the philosophical dimension of the plot, and that ''Prometheus'' was lazily deferring key plot points under the presumption that a sequel would be made.&lt;ref name="RevVariety"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' [[Peter Bradshaw]] wrote that ''Prometheus'' was "more grandiose, more elaborate—but less interesting" than ''Alien'', and lacked the latter's "central killer punch".&lt;ref name="RevGuardian"/&gt; Ian Nathan of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine was unimpressed by Rapace—whom he described as an unconvincing lead—and said that with "a lack of suspense, threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness can't prevent ''Prometheus'' feeling like ''Alien''{{'}}s poor relation."&lt;ref name="RevEmpire"/&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s Nick Pinkerton wrote that the film is "prone to shallow ponderousness", and that Scott "can still mimic the appearance of an epic, noble, important movie—but the appearance is all." He criticized Rapace and Marshall-Green for failing to instill interest in their characters' relationship, but added: "there are a few set pieces here that will find a place of honor among aficionados of body horror and all things clammy and viscous".&lt;ref name="RevVillageVoice"/&gt;

James Cameron said: "I enjoyed ''Prometheus''. I thought it was great. I thought it was Ridley returning to science fiction with gusto, with great tactical performance, beautiful photography, great native 3D. There might have been a few things that I would have done differently, but that's not the point—you could say that about any movie."&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

===Home media===
In North America, ''Prometheus'' DVD and Blu-ray disc releases were listed for pre-order in partnership with Amazon on June 1, 2012, a week before the film was released in theaters. A limited number of cinema tickets for the film were offered as a pre-order incentive.&lt;ref name="HomeBRay1"/&gt; In June 2012, ''[[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'' obtained the rights to the film's network television premiere.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia4"/&gt; On September 7, 2012, Fox announced that ''Prometheus'' would be the launch title of its new digital distribution initiative "Digital HD". The film was released on September 18, 2012, three weeks prior to its DVD, Blu-ray disc and [[Video on demand]] (VOD) release, for downloading and streaming through platforms including Amazon, iTunes, [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live]] in over 50 countries.&lt;ref name="HomeDigital"/&gt; The film was released on Blu-ray disc and DVD on October 9, 2012.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia2"/&gt; The Blu-ray disc edition of the film was released in a 2-disc set and a 4-disc "Collector's Edition". Both versions contain the theatrical cut of ''Prometheus'', commentary by Scott, Lindelof and Spaihts, a DVD and digital copy of the film, [[Alternate ending|alternate]] and deleted scenes, and other features. Additionally, the Collector's Edition contains the 3D version of the film and approximately 7 hours of supplemental features including a documentary on the film's production.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia5"/&gt; On October 8, 2012, it was reported that Fox had requested an extended version of the film for home media, but Scott refused to edit cut scenes back into the theatrical version of the film, which he considered his director's cut.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia10"/&gt; During its first week of sale in the United Kingdom, ''Prometheus'' was the number 1 selling film on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, outselling its nearest competitor by a factor of three.&lt;ref name="HomeUK1"/&gt; An [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] version is scheduled for release in September 2017.&lt;ref name="HomeMediaUBR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HomeMediaUBR2"/&gt;

==Sequels==
{{main|Alien: Covenant}}
Scott discussed a continuation of the series in March 2012, saying that ''Prometheus'' leaves many questions unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel.&lt;ref name="Sequel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sequel1"/&gt; In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved so that they could be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that ''Prometheus'' could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed.&lt;ref name="Sequel4"/&gt; By August 2012, a sequel was announced to be in development for release no earlier than 2014.&lt;ref name="Sequel8"/&gt; Lindelof chose not to work on the new film, citing other commitments.&lt;ref name="SequelDec2012"/&gt; Titled ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'',&lt;ref name="SequelTitle"/&gt; the sequel premiered in London, England on May 4, 2017,&lt;ref name="AlienLondon"/&gt; and was released in the United States on May 19, 2017.&lt;ref name="AlienUS"/&gt; Set eleven years after the events of ''Prometheus'',&lt;ref name="Sequel10"/&gt; ''Alien: Covenant''{{'}}s story follows the crew of the Covenant space ship who land on an uncharted and seemingly uninhabited planet. The film stars [[Katherine Waterston]],&lt;ref name="SequelWaterson"/&gt; [[Danny McBride]],&lt;ref name="SequelMcBride"/&gt; [[Demian Bichir]],&lt;ref name="SequelBelchir"/&gt; [[Jussie Smollett]], [[Amy Seimetz]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Callie Hernandez]], Alex England and [[Billy Crudup]].&lt;ref name="SequelEngland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sequeltherest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SequelBilly"/&gt; On release, ''Alien: Covenant'' earned a worldwide box office gross of $240.7 million (compared to ''Prometheus''{{'}} $403.4 million),&lt;ref name="SequelBOM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; and received generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref name="SequelMC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SequelRT"/&gt; A sequel to ''Alien: Covenant'' is in development.&lt;ref name="SequelSequel"/&gt;

In 2013, a comic book series was announced by [[Dark Horse Comics]] that serves as a spin-off to ''Prometheus''. The series, titled ''[[Fire and Stone]]'', is an ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' crossover featuring content exclusive to ''Prometheus''. The first issue of ''Fire and Stone'' was released on September 10, 2014.&lt;ref name="ComicFireStone"/&gt;

The '''Symphony in C "Roma"''' is the second of [[Georges Bizet]]'s [[symphony|symphonies]].  Unlike his [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|first symphony]], also in C major, which was written quickly at the age of 17, ''Roma'' was written over an eleven-year span, between the ages of 22 and 33 (he died at age 36). Bizet was never fully satisfied with it, subjecting it to a number of revisions, but died before finishing his definitive version.  All four movements were performed in his lifetime, but never all on the same occasion.  The full symphony in its latest revision was premiered in 1875, after his death.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=work|id=c358447|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is perhaps because of Bizet's dissatisfaction that the work is often said to be [[Unfinished symphony|"unfinished"]].  However, in the form in which it exists today, it is a complete work and is fully scored.  It has been recorded a number of times but is not often heard on the concert platform.

==Background==

Bizet won the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1857, which required him to spend the following two years studying free of charge at the French Academy in [[Rome]], followed by a year studying in [[Germany]].  He never went to Germany, but stayed in Rome until July 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67351/Georges-Bizet Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than returning to Paris straight away, he did some touring through Italy, seeing places he had not visited in his earlier travels in 1858 and 1859.  In [[Rimini]] he first planned a symphony with each of the four movements dedicated to a different Italian city – Rome (opening movement), [[Venice]] (Andante), [[Florence]] (Scherzo) and [[Naples]] (finale).&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Eric Blom ed., Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have made some early sketches at this time. When he got to Venice he learned that his mother was seriously ill, so he returned home immediately.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

By 1861 he had written the Scherzo, still generally considered the best movement of the work.  It was performed privately in November 1861, and received a public performance on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1863, conducted by [[Jules Pasdeloup]] at the [[Cirque Napoléon]], at which [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] was present.  It was poorly performed and provoked a hostile reaction from many concert subscribers.  Nevertheless, it was given another performance on 18 January at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and this time received a much more positive reaction.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

By 1866 he had written his first version of the complete work, in which the first movement was a Theme and Variations,&lt;ref name=mso/&gt; but he was dissatisfied and set about undertaking a total revision.  In 1868 he revised it yet again.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Three movements of the revised score, minus the Scherzo, were performed on 28 February 1869, under the title ''Fantaisie symphonique: Souvenirs de Rome'', again conducted by Pasdeloup.  The movements were given programmatic titles ''Une chasse dans la Forêt d'Ostie'', ''Une Procession'' and ''Carnaval à Rome''&lt;ref name=mso&gt;[http://www.buywell.com/booklets/4763520.pdf  Program Notes, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326133626/http://www.buywell.com/booklets/4763520.pdf |date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (this was the movement meant to depict Naples).  But Bizet was still not happy, and proceeded to revise it once more. By 1871 he seems to have dropped work on his revisions, being focussed on other projects.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

The full symphony in its latest known version was premiered after his death, in 1875.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; The work was published in 1880 as ''Roma'', and it probably incorporates some of his changes made in 1871.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

==Title==
In form, the work stands somewhere between a symphony and a symphonic suite.  Grove's Dictionary says: "It is not sufficiently explicit for programme music and too carelessly constructed for an abstract symphony".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Despite Bizet's description of it as a "symphony", it has often been classified in reference works as a [[suite (music)|suite]].  In some sources, it is even numbered as "Symphonic Suite No. 3".&lt;ref name=ang&gt;[http://www.mennicken-pr.com/cd/bizet_cd_en.html Ivan Anguélov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714072310/http://www.mennicken-pr.com/cd/bizet_cd_en.html |date=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reason for the alternative title is that his earlier symphony was in the same key, C major, and it was believed by some that calling his second symphonic venture a suite would be less confusing.&lt;ref name=ang/&gt;  However, this renaming could only have occurred after 1935 (60 years after Bizet's death), when the very existence of his [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|first symphony]], the Symphony in C, was made known to the world for the first time.

==The work==
''Roma'' is a very unequal work.  The Scherzo is usually singled out as its best movement, full of liveliness and grace. The outer movements contain both brilliance and academic pedantry, and the slow movement is not generally well regarded, sometimes being described as "ponderous and boring".&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  However, [[Gustav Mahler]] thought highly enough of ''Roma'' to conduct the [[Vienna]] premiere in 1898–99, and to expose American audiences to it on his 1910 tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=186948185&amp;blogId=341789205 Myspace: MY Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its actual United States premiere was on 11&amp;nbsp;November 1880 at the Metropolitan Concert Hall, conducted by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]].  The New York Times critic of the time said that, while there was much in the work to admire, it was crude in arrangement and had an air of incompleteness about it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1880/11/12/archives/amusements-bizets-roma.html New York Times, 12 November 1880]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The four movements of ''Roma'' are:
* ''Andante tranquillo'', leading to an ''Allegro agitato'' (C major)
* Scherzo – ''Allegretto vivace''
* ''Andante molto'' (F major)
* ''Allegro vivacissimo'' (Finale).

The work takes about 31 minutes to play.

==Recordings==
It has been recorded a number of times, under conductors such as Sir [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Lamberto Gardelli]], [[Louis Frémaux]], [[Michel Plasson]], [[Jean-Claude Casadesus]], [[Enrique Bátiz Campbell|Enrique Batiz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/63824/Georges_Bizet_Roma_symphony_for_orchestra_in_C_major Presto Classical]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fuat Mansurov]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073RZ4YPF Amazon]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Finale has sometimes been recorded separately, under the title "Carnaval",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=150943 Arkiv Musik]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Carnaval à Rome".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Paris/1947/lists.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:21:27 Historic Conductors on Compact Disc]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41044">'''Serbian art''' refers to the [[visual arts]] of the [[Serbs]] and their nation-state [[Serbia]]. The medieval heritage includes [[Byzantine art]], preserved in architecture, frescos and icons of the many Serbian Orthodox monasteries. In the Early modern period, Serbian visual arts began to be influenced by Western art, culminating in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the late 18th century. The beginning of modern Serbian art is placed in the 19th century.

==Prehistory==
Currently, Europe's oldest known civilization was discovered in [[Serbia]], namely [[Lepinski Vir]] and [[Vinča culture]]. In Serbia, [[Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)]] (Serbian: Археолошка налазишта/Arheološka nalazišta) are many and have the highest level of state protection under the Law on Cultural Heritage. See: [[Prehistoric sites in Serbia]] and [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe]] for artifacts and sculpture found at the archeological sites of Lepinski Vir. Here are some images of Serbian prehistory art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.ca/search?q=serbian+prehistory+art&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA791CA791&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTwIzyyO_dAhWpxYMKHXk4BJkQsAR6BAgCEAE&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman period==
Geographically Serbia was always part of the [[Roman Empire]] whether it was ruled from [[Rome]] or from [[Byzantium]]. The Roman ruins are found throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]].

==Medieval Serbian art==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
Church architecture developed under the patronage of the medieval Serbian state. The most distinctive piece of medieval Serbian architecture was the [[Studenica monastery]] founded by [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of medieval Serbia ca. 1190. This monastery also featured significant works of art including its Byzantine style [[fresco]] paintings. Its church also features extensive sculptures based on Psalms and the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]]. UNESCO added this monastery to its list of World Cultural Heritage sites in 1986. It was the model for other monasteries at [[Mileševa monastery|Mileševa]], [[Sopoćani]] and the [[Visoki Dečani]]. The influence of Byzantine art became more influential after the capture of [[Constantinople]] in 1204 in the [[Fourth Crusade]] when many Greek artists fled to Serbia. Their influence can be seen at the Church of the Ascension at [[Mileševa]] as well as in the wall paintings at the Church of the Holy Apostles at [[Peć]] and at the Sopoćani Monastery. Icons also formed a significant part of church art. The influence of Byzantine architecture reached its [[Serbian Orthodox Church#Serbo-Byzantine Style|peak]] after 1300 including the rebuilding of the [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] (ca. 1306–1307) and [[St. George]] at [[Staro Nagoričane]] as well as the [[Gračanica monastery]]. Church decorative paintings and religious arts and crafts also developed further in the period. The most noteworthy painters at the time were [[Michael Astrapas and Eutychios]] (fl. 1294-1317) and before them, '''Deacon Jovan''' and '''Rufin'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=223&lt;/ref&gt;

Icon of the Holy Virgin [[Pelagonitissa]], dating from 1421, is considered one of the last outstanding achievements of icon painting, a representation of the then still-living Byzantine iconography. Its author '''Makarije Zograf''' worked on the icon in the Church of Transfiguration in the monastery of the village [[Zrze]], near [[Prilep]], and many other Serbian monasteries during the fifteenth century. Makarije Zograf and his brother Metropolitan '''Jovan Zograf''' cared for the monastery endowment until it was transferred to Constantine, the village head (''kmet'').&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=mkYWAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=makarije+zograf&amp;dq=makarije+zograf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj57Lie0pPeAhUJwYMKHVtCC60Q6AEIXzAI&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Visoki Dečani monastery]] in [[Metohija]] was built between 1330 and 1350. Unlike other Serbian monasteries of the period, it was built with [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] features by master-builders under the monk Vitus of Kotor. Its frescoes feature 1000 portraits portraying all of the major themes of the New Testament. The cathedral features [[iconostasis]], [[Hegumen|hegumen's]] throne and carved royal sarcophagus. In 2004, UNESCO listed the Dečani Monastery on the World Heritage List.

There was a further spate of church building as the Serbian state contracted to the Morava basin in the late 14th century. Prince [[Stefan Lazarević]] was a poet and patron of the arts who founded the church at [[Manasija monastery|Resava]] at [[Morava rivers, Serbia|Morava]] with the wall paintings having a theme of parables of Christ with the people portrayed wearing feudal Serbian costumes.

Manuscripts were another significant feature of Serbian medieval art. ''Miroslav's Gospel'' features lavish calligraphy and miniatures and is a significant artwork as well as a notable work of literature. The [[Chludov Psalter]] dating from the 14th century is beautifully decorated and was probably owned by a high-ranking noble. Serbian princes were well known in the 15th century for supporting manuscripts employing [[scribe]]s and artists to create manuscripts besides icons and frescoes. [[Lovro Dobričević]] (1420-1478) of [[Kotor]] was a Venetian painter of Serbian origin, though Roman Catholic by confession, who first started to paint in the Serbian Orthodox [[Savina Monastery, Montenegro|Savina Monastery]] in Zeta and [[Serbian Despotate]] (now [[Montenegro]]) in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visit-montenegro.com/montenegro/montenegro-museum-in-the-open/monastery-savina/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 19th century, Serbian medieval art was used as inspiration for notable architect [[Andrey Damyanov]] who, between 1835 and 1878, along the [[Vardar]] and [[Morava Valley]]s and Bosnia, built around 40 churches and other buildings. &lt;ref name="balkanologie"&gt;[http://journals.openedition.org/balkanologie/1932?file=1 Journal Balkanologie] by Bernard Lory, December 2002, retrieved 3-4-2018 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting to the social demand of its Serbian sponsors, Damyanov combined simultaneously traditional elements of the 15th century Morava school with Occidental baroque elements found North of Sava river.&lt;ref name="balkanologie"/&gt;

Thanks are due to field scientist and academic [[Gabriel Millet]] who was the first to bring Serbian art to the attention of the West in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/3641241/Contribution_de_Gabriel_Millet_%C3%A0_l%C3%A9tude_de_lart_Serbe&lt;/ref&gt;The other is Serbian-American scientist [[Michael Pupin]], who gathered an international team of scholars and public figures to support the preservation of architectural heritage during and after the [[Great War]]. In 1918, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]], in Pupin's "Serbian Orthodox Church" on the medieval Serbian churches, refuted the notion that Serbian art was nothing more than a branch of [[Byzantine art]] and showed that Serbian art had an original character of its own.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- INSERT THESE IN THE TABLE [http://www.sv-luka.org/ikone/sericins.htm]https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mihajlo-Pupin-South-Slavs-Monuments-vol-I-Serbian-Orthodox-Church-New-York-and_fig1_282186492&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox fresco painting represents the peak of Serbian medieval art. Its birth went in line with the creation and development of medieval Serbian state, but unlike Serbian state it didn't cease to exist during the Ottoman occupation. While Serbian architecture has seen mixed influences of both [[Byzantine]] and [[Medieval Italy|medieval Italian states]], fresco and icon painting remained deeply rooted in solely eastern byzantine tradition. 
 
Frescos were being painted under the patronage of Serbian rulers, as the highest form of religious decorative form. Following the political expansion and military growth, the 13th and 14th century are marked as the period when the biggest amount of newly built or existing sanctuaries have been decorated, mostly by unknown artists. Studenica monastery has been built in 1196 under the patronage of [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of [[Nemanjić dynasty]], and ever since it enjoyed the care of Stefan's descendants as the ''archi-model''. Its most representative fresco, ''The Crucifixion'', was made twelve years later, in 1208, on the blue background brought into contrast with golden-yellow of Christ's bare crucified body. In the second half of 14th century an unknown artist painted monumental ''The Dormition of the Virgin'' in Sopoćani monastery, which remained the supreme achievement of byzantine painting tradition. 
 
However, the most famous Serbian medieval fresco is the ''Myrrhbearers'' (or the "White Angel")&lt;ref name="Art in the middle ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/vdjuric-medieval_art.html |title=Art in the middle ages |publisher=rastko.rs |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Mileševa monastery|Mileševa]] monastery, painted in 1235, on the southern wall of the church. It depicts [[Archangel Gabriel]] sitting on Christ's grave. The identity of its author is unknown. In the 16th century, the ''White Angel'' was over-painted with another fresco, and so was hidden until the 20th century when the fresco was restored.&lt;ref name="novosti-mileseva"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/srbija.73.html:391503-Manastir-Mileseva---crkva-Belog-andjela | title=Manastir Mileševa - crkva Belog anđela | publisher=[[Večernje novosti]] | date=5 August 2012 | accessdate=19 December 2014 |trans-title=Mileševa Monastery - the Church if the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fresco was sent as a message in the first [[Satellite television|satellite broadcast]] signal from [[Europe]] to [[United States|America]] after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], as a [[symbol]] of [[peace]] and [[civilization]].&lt;ref name="prijepolje"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.turizamprijepolje.org.rs/index.php/n-s-ir-il-sh-v-i-b-li-nd | title=Манастир Милешева и Бели Анђео | publisher=Tourist Organisation of Preijepolje | accessdate=19 December 2014 |trans-title=Mileševa Monastery and the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the same signal, containing the White Angel, was transmitted to space in an attempt to communicate with [[extraterrestrial life]] forms.&lt;ref name="52vikenda"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.srbija.travel/download/brosure/52_vikenda_smanjen.pdf | title=52 vikenda u Srbiji | publisher=Tourist Organisation of Serbia | author=Mihaljčić, Milena | year=2013 | location=Belgrade | pages=30 | isbn=978-86-6005-278-2 |trans-title=52 Weekends in Serbia | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/272313/Filaret-zinuo-na-Belog-andela | title=Filaret zinuo na Belog anđela | publisher=Vesti Online | date=25 November 2012 | accessdate=19 December 2014 | author=Lončar, R. |trans-title=Filaret Gasps at the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another notable mention is the fresco of Serbian queen [[Simonida]], in [[Gračanica monastery]], today located on the disputed territory of [[Kosovo]]. Born as Simonis Palaiologina, she was a daughter of the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] (r. 1282–1328) and [[Irene of Montferrat]], and the fourth wife of Serbian king [[Stefan Milutin]] (r. 1282–1321). Two celebrated Serbian poems were inspired by the beauty of the fresco. Two dark stains on the places where queen's eyes were supposed to be have created a common belief that her eyes were being ''carved out'' by [[Albanian people|Albanian]]s, hence the well-known strophe by [[Milan Rakić]]:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Your eyes were gouged out, oh beautiful image, 
On a pilaster at approach of night, 
Knowing that no one would witness the pillage,
An Albanian’s knife robbed you of your sight.&lt;ref&gt;''Simonida'', Kosara Gavrilović translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
However, between 1971 and 1976, during the conservation works in the monastery, it was discovered that for centuries the queen's eyes were lying under what actually was (unsuccessfully intentionally damaged) grey layer. Once the patches were removed, ''Simonida'' was shown to media with light-blue eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/terazije/ko_je_simonidi_iskopao_oci.14.html?news_id=199228 | title=Ko je Simonidi iskopao oci | publisher=Danas | accessdate=June 9, 2017 | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th centuries==
The Ottoman conquest of Serbia during the 15th century is traditionally said to have had a negative impact of the visual arts. The Serbs became part of the [[Rum Millet]] (Christian community), and were regarded a lower class ([[rayah]]). The Serbian nobility was not integrated into the Ottoman state system. The church was abolished in long periods by the Ottoman government. As the nobility and church were the main sources of patronage for architects and artists, the Early Modern period is considered an artistically less productive period in Serbian art. Despite the general trend, remarkable monuments were built. There was some resumption of artistic endeavour after the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate in 1557. '''Zograf Longin''' (1530-1600) and [[Georgije Mitrofanović]] were the leading painters of the late 16th and early 17th century. Mitrofanović's work on the church at the [[Morača Monastery]] is considered one of his best. Traditional Serbian art was beginning to show some Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]] and [[Jakov Orfelin]]. Among the icon painters working in the Byzantine tradition in Old Slavonia were '''Nikola Klisur''' (mid-17th century)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=JEpLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=nikola+klisur&amp;dq=nikola+klisur&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTibCj4ZPeAhUH7YMKHa2ZAUEQ6AEIPTAD&lt;/ref&gt;and '''Ostoja Mrkojević''' (late 17th century).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=vI4MAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=ostoja+mrkojevic&amp;dq=ostoja+mrkojevic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn0fW245PeAhUlzIMKHTp6D8AQ6AEIKzAA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baroque===
Painting of the Early Baroque did not create a homogeneous group of painters. It developed under the Russian-Ukrainian and Southern Balkans basis and the influences that had slowly arrived from Western European art centers. The first generation of Baroque painters nourished on the learnings of the Russian painter Jov Vasilievich and Vasilije Romanovich, then the trainee of the Kiev Academy of painting,[[Dimitrije Bačević]], Vasilije Ostojić, Joakim Marković, Jovan Popović, Amvrosije Janković, Dimitrije Popović, Teodor Stefanov Gologlavac, and [[Stefan Tenecki]]. The work of Balkan icon painters in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] throughout the 18th century. Teodor Simonov (born in Moschopolis) worked for the Serbian Orthodox [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] during the eight decade of the 18th century. Simonov painted the walls of the church monastery in Stolni Beograd, today's [[Székesfehérvár]] in Hungary. The works of [[Jovan Četirević Grabovan]] who completed part of his education in [[Imperial Russia]], and returned to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] to settle in [[Osijek]] in [[Slavonia]] where he developed a rich icon-painting activity. The works of others who also came originally from southern parts of the Balkans (once known as [[Old Serbia]]) such as [[Hristofor Žefarović]] and [[Janko Halkozović]], created in the spirit of the Levant Baroque, relying on the transferred experience of Italian Renaissance art and the Byzantine tradition, which resulted in a distinctive model of Baroque icons. The originator of the more direct rotation on Central European models was Joakim Marković, whose work is linked to the first portraits and [[Still life]]s, and in church painting of historical compositions and heraldic depictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО РАНОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-ranog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High Baroque art was reflected on the firmer cultural orientation towards Vienna, as well as church and school reforms. The changes are visible in the works of [[Teodor Kračun]] who in his work represents a significant step towards understanding the actual Central European art. The retrospective Orthodox heritage confronted the emphasized emotionality and the movement as a fundamental element of artistic expression. Scenes are placed in the real world, Christ and Mary are depicted according to the rules of the secular ruler iconography and rely on graphic templates from popular illustrated Bibles. The group of representatives of the High Baroque include [[Mojsej Subotić]], [[Grigorije Davidović Opšić]], [[Grigorije Jezdimirović]] and [[Lazar Serdanović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО ВИСОКОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-visokog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence and development of Late Baroque painting had been determined by the cultural and political changes of the time of Joseph II. Conceptual changes in the era of enlightened and learned man - the Enlightenment - marked the last decade of the 18th century. The learned artist, traveling the European capitals of Art, accepts and implements the ideas of the Enlightenment reforms. Among the artists who took Serbian painting of Central European Late Baroque formulation, [[Jakov Orfelin]] and [[Teodor Ilić Češljar]] stand out. They are joined by woodcarvers [[Aksentije Marković]] and [[Marko Vujatović]]. Neoclassicism as the style of the new era, based on the ideas of the Enlightenment, would not jeopardize the ruling Late Baroque conception in the first decades of the next century. Such a sequence is identified in the works of painters [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Jovan Isajlović Stari]], [[Georgije Mišković]] and Mihajlo Živković.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО КАСНОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-kasnog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the important painters were [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]], [[Teodor Ilić Češljar]], [[Pavel Đurković]], [[Dimitrije Bačević]], [[Georgije Bakalović]], [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Jovan Četirević Grabovan]], [[Jovan Pačić]], and others.

==19th century drawing and painting==

===Religious art===
Printed magazines with engravings became a popular method of communicating through art, of both religious and irreligious themes. The printing of engravings of figures of prominent Serbian rulers fitted in the ideas of continuity of Serbian statehood. Monasteries on Fruška Gora and other ones in the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] issued engraved magazines in which protector saints with monasteries were represented. Graphical arts of the 18th century were the first class documents of appearance and condition of monastery buildings before photographs. In the last decades of the 18th century, the written word suppressed visual arts as the main communication activity in religious magazines, with graphical arts becoming more and more used in illustrated books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=РЕЛИГИОЗНО СЛИКАРСТВО XIX ВЕКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/religiozno-slikarstvo-19-veka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphical arts===
In the first decades of the 19th century a new graphic technique of lithography experience a real boom in the countries of Western Europe. Serbian artists gradually introduced it to the history of national arts in the 19th century. In contrast to modest attempts of scarce individuals, the lithography becomes an important branch of Serbian art only with the emergence of [[Anastas Jovanović]]. Independent printed magazines on religious themes which prevailed in the 18th century became scarcer in the 19th century, only accounting for a part of the graphic production. As a medium very suitable for spreading political ideas, lithography dominates with national-historical themes. Sketch portraits and templates for lithography were dealt by many Serbian painters: [[Jovan Isajlović Mlađi]], [[Jovan Popović (artist)|Jovan Popović]], [[Uroš Knežević]], [[Pavle Simić]], [[Pavle Čortanović]], [[Steva Todorović]], [[Đorđe Krstić]], while being technically performed in Vienna and Pest by lithographers [[Gabriel Decker]] (1821-1855), [[Friedrich Karl Leiboldt]], [[Josef Bauer (lithographer)|Josef Bauer]] (1820-1905), [[Vincent Katzler]] (1823-1882) and others. At the end of the 19th century popular oleographs appear, as the first reproduction of popular works, most often with motifs from folk life and depictions of historical figures and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ГРАФИКА XIX ВЕКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/grafika-19-veka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassicism===
{{further|Neoclassicism}}
Under the influence of the ides of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Rationalism]], at the end of the 18th and beginning of 19th century, Serbian art came to leave baroque pictorial poetics and acceptance of the aesthetic ideals of the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]], characterized by [[eclecticism]] of different stylistic expressions, of the late baroque to neo-classical. In addition to religious painting, which was still dominant, the portrait gains increasing importance. Portraits complete the picture of the new society created in that time and point to the idea of permanent memory of individuals within the family or the wider community. The gallery of characters, in addition to church prelates and priests, senior officers, a significant places is taken by eminent members of civil society from the first decades of the 19th century: lawyers, university professors, writers, wealthy merchants, and their wives, the status shown by marked clothing and jewelry. Stylistic features of paintings of that era: a balanced composition, precise modeling, rigorous academic drawing, color of reduced register, expressed in the works of [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Arsa Teodorović]] and [[Pavel Đurković]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=НЕОКЛАСИЦИЗАМ - АРСЕНИЈЕ ТЕОДОРОВИЋ И ПАВЕЛ ЂУРКОВИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/neoklasicizam-arsenije-teodorovic-i-pavel-djurkovic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biedermeier===
{{further|Biedermeier}}
In the 1830s the Serbian art scene is added by a generation of painters who transferred Bidermeier and [[Nazarene movement|Nazarene art]] programs from Central Europe. As a stylistic expression that deeply permeated the Serbian art at that time, Biedermeir was most suitable for the wide layers of citizens that concerned about themselves, their family and home. In the changed social circumstance in which the middle class had become the bearer of social changes, the family becomes the basic unit of modern society and the main scene of private life. Awareness of family is confirmed and visualized in family portraits, in group or of some of its members. Family portraits depict the social status of the family, but at the same time they have a private character and are part of narrow family cult. In addition to portraits, Biedermeir painting is also focused on the [[Genre art]] and [[Still life]]. The most important representatives of the Biedermeier expression in Serbian painting are [[Konstantin Danil]], [[Katarina Ivanović]], [[Dimitrije Avramović]] and [[Nikola Aleksić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=БИДЕРМАЈЕР - КОНСТАНТИН ДАНИЛ И НИКОЛА АЛЕКСИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/bidermajer-konstantin-danil-i-nikola-aleksic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/en/biedermeier.html#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
{{further|Romanticism}}
In the mid-19th century Serbian artistic creativity was marked with reception of content and design of civil works (Biedermaier), but at the same time the development of a program of historicism. For the penetration of Romanticist conceptions, education and stays of Serbian painters in Vienna and Munich, as well as trips to Italy, were crucial. Social and political conditions contributed to the Romantic expression in Serbian art accomplishing its highest achievements in the late 1860s and beginning of 1870s. In stylistic and thematic view, Romanticism brought notable innovations: greater freedom of strokes and composition, warm colors complemented by the play of light and shadow. Most Serbian artists of that period reflected national-historical content in painting compositions, however, client needs kept iconography and portrait painting popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=EПОХА РОМАНТИЗМА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/epoha-romantizma.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of notable Romanticist painters include [[Katarina Ivanović]] (1811–1882), [[Đura Jakšić]] (1832–1878), [[Pavle Simić]] (1818–1876), [[Novak Radonić]] (1826–1890) and [[Steva Todorović]] (1832–1925).

===Historicism===
{{further|Historicism (art)}}
In accordance with the general ideas of Historicism, as the dominant characteristics of the culture of the 19th century in European context, the top role in the process of constituting national identity was held by events and figures from national history. They represented a representative of the golden age of the nation, which in Serbian culture of the 19th century was equated with the period of the rule of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]]. Idealization of a glorious past, regardless of whether it was based on real facts or myth, it was the main tool in the constitution and the homogenization of the nation. This idealized past was directly at the service of the glorification of the present, which emphasized the idea of rebuilding the former Serbian glory. These ideas are directly reflected in the visual art of the epoch - historical compositions, but also patriotic scenes that illustrate the events of the recent past are gaining more and more importance. They praise the nation through the idealization of events and personalities, becoming at the same time engaged means of communication with the aim to awaken national and patriotic feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ИСТОРИЗАМ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/istorizam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of notable Historicist painters include [[Đura Jakšić]] (1832–1878) and [[Pavle Simić]] (1818–1876).

===Academicism===
{{further|Academic art}}
In the last decades of the 19th century, Serbian painters began to stay at Munich as a center of education and its Academy of Fine Arts, which compared to the Viennese, was more [[avant garde]] and progressive. However, the larger number of them remained faithful to the Vienna Academy where the education system was still based on the constitutional education, traditional practices and technical skills. The highest level of Academicism in Serbian painting of the late 19th century are portraits of [[Paja Jovanović]] (1859–1957) and [[Uroš Predić]] (1857–1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=АКАДЕМИЗАМ - ПАЈА ЈОВАНОВИЋ И УРОШ ПРЕДИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/akademizam-paja-jovanovic-i-uros-predic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
{{further|Orientalism}}
Orientalism indicates interest in Oriental scenes in the visual arts of the 19th century. Napoleon's campaign in Egypt, the conquest of Algeria, as well as travel books and other literary descriptions encouraged the enthusiasm and imagination of artists. Islamic countries of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa had become the preferred travel destination for many artists. Scenes of squares, bazaars, harem and various folklore events entered European painting. Orientalism rarely had a purely documentary character and more often depicted the enthusiasm of Europeans for beauty, vividness and allure of the unknown and exotic world. The wild nature and unusual customs, combined with the gorgeous colors and light, had become a great inspiration to European artists. During a long period of education, [[Paja Jovanović]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebritic.com/?p=660281&lt;/ref&gt;along with classes at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, attended the School of historical painting of [[Leopold Müller (painter)]], famous for its oriental motifs. There is no doubt that Miller's crucial lessons determined his painting preference. Noting the increased interest of Europe to the events in the Balkans, he traveled during the holidays to Albania, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia gathering sketches and studies of the life of the Balkan peoples. Precisely these themes brought Paja Jovanović worldwide fame and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ОРИЈЕНТАЛИЗАМ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/orijentalizam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism===
{{further|Realism (art movement)}}
In the last decades of the 19th century, with Serbian painters attending the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Realism entered the Serbian art scene. In stylistic view, Realists, succeeding the Romantic agitation, brought calm and order in painting. In Serbian painting Realism never took root in the true sense, in the symbiosis of thematics and techniques. Serbian painters, taught artistically to express in a new form, return to be faced with the difficult solvable problems of adapting the conditions of an economically, socially and culturally underdeveloped environment, which was unwilling to accept new social themes which European Realism advocated. Serbian painters therefore continue to paint portraits, religious and historical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=РЕАЛИЗАМ - ЂОРЂЕ КРСТИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/realizam-djordje-krstic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
{{further|Symbolism (arts)}}
Symbolism in European painting appeared at the end of the 19th century as a reaction to the beautified world of academic realism and commercialization of art. As a formulated artistic phenomenon on a European scale it was also present at the Munich art scene, where some Serbian painters were formed. Representatives of Symbolism proclaimed turning of indirect, associative and suggestive mode of expression. They used mythological symbols, dreams and imagination as a visual language of the soul. In addition to depicting themselves, they painted mythological, religious and allegorical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СИМБОЛИЗАМ - СТЕВАН АЛЕКСИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/simbolizam-stevan-aleksic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern visual arts==
[[Cyril Kutlík]] set up the first school of art in Serbia in 1895. Many of his students went to study in Western Europe, especially France and Germany and brought back avant-garde styles. [[Nadežda Petrović]] was influenced by [[Fauvism]] while [[Sava Šumanović]] worked in [[Cubism]].

After World War I, the [[Belgrade School of Painting]] developed in the [[Belgrade|capital]] with some members such as [[Milan Konjović]] working in a Fauvist manner, while others such as [[Marko Čelebonović]] working in a style called ''Intimisme'' based on the use of colours.

Some artists chose to emigrate: thus [[Yovan Radenkovitch]] (1901–1979) left Belgrade for Paris in the 1930s, befriending [[Matisse]] and [[Vlaminck]] and adopting a style greatly inspired by [[Fauvism]], before eventually leaving Europe to show his work in New York, in 1941; meeting with considerable acclaim, he decided, in the 1950s, to settle in the USA – near [[Waterbury]], [[Connecticut]], where several of his paintings are still kept today, in [[Mattatuck Museum]].

[[Socrealism]] was the dominant school after World War II with the rise to power of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. However, that period did not last long &amp;ndash; during the 1960s, Serbian artists started to break free from the constraints of the Communists led by figures such as [[Petar Lubarda]] and [[Milo Milunović]]. The [[Mediala group]] featuring [[Vladimir Veličković]] was formed in the 1970s to promote [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] figurative painting. Serbian art was split between those basing their works on the traditions of Serbian work such as frescoes and iconography and those exploring international styles.

The first part of 21st century, with young artists like [[Jovanka Sanijenovic]] or [[Simonida Rajčević]], marks a predominance of a figurative art linked to realism – a realism «where everything is real and nothing is real – considering contemporary time as needing a return to what is real and concrete, and at the same time social and existential.&lt;ref&gt;Gordana Biba Marković, ''[http://www.domkulturecacak.org/node/474 XV Prolećni Anale]''. Dom kulture Čačak, 20 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied art and design==
[[File:Pirot kilim serbian rug.png|thumb|100px|Pirot Kilim with the ornament Rašićeva ploča]]
Applied art and design through the centuries have evolved in Serbia through crafts. The wealth of forms, the variety of materials with powerful color schemes and ornamentation folk art represented a strong stimulus for the affirmation of applied art, which in the second half of the 19th century, gets its first artists in Serbia. End of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century were marked by the work of individual personalities, each of them made a significant contribution to the development and the history of applied art in Serbia. These were people of different professions and some of them include: [[Mihailo Valtrović]], [[Vladislav Titelbah]], [[Dragiša Milutinović]], [[Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak]].

==Performance art==
[[File:artistIsPresent.jpg|thumb|right|Marina Abramović performed "The Artist Is Present" at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in March 2010.]]
[[Maga Magazinović]], philosopher and choreographer, was one of the most important figures of contemporary physical practice in Serbia before the Second World War. The emancipation of the body in her work was realized through the application of gymnastics, dance and physical education. During the '60s and '70s history of the contemporary dance developed in the framework of [[performance art]], [[body art]] and [[happening]]s. On the status of the body can meditate in the works of [[Marina Abramović]] and [[Katalin Ladik]]. The performance art of the eighties was marked by a specific attitude toward ideology. This attitude is manifested in the work within the context of using utopian socialist iconography. During the '90s performance art was focused on the fight against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sveske.ba/en/content/drugost-druge-scene-u-srbiji Drugost druge scene u Srbiji]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Abramović]] is the most prominent Serbian performance artist.  Active for over three decades, she has been described as the "grandmother of performance art." She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of her observers. Her art focuses on the theme of “confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body,” while relying on the extent of these discomforts based on the actions of her audience members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demaria|first1=Cristina|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovic|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|date=August 2004|volume=11|issue=3|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another performance artists include [[Gabrijel Savić Ra]], [[Nela Antonović]], [[Lidija Antonović]], [[Predrag Radovančević]], etc.

'''''Spaceship Earth''''' is a 350,000-pound Brazilian blue [[quartzite]] sculpture created by Finnish American artist [[Eino]].&lt;ref name='Birth'&gt;{{cite news | first=Angela | last=Hill | title=175-ton East Bay-inspired 'Earth Spaceship' needs landing pad | date=2007-03-24 | publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =Alameda Times-Star | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpture was commissioned by Brian Maxwell of [[Powerbar]] the Maxwell Family Foundation for the late environmentalist [[David Brower]] and its name was often used by Brower referring to mankind traveling through life in a common vehicle.&lt;ref name='possible'&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristin | last=Bender | title=Artist's tribute may get a home;Berkeley Marina probable site for 'Spaceship Earth,' a memorial | date=2004-07-12 | publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =Alameda Times-Star | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the sculpture is located at [[Kennesaw State University]] adjacent to the Social Science building, the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building at the [[University System of Georgia]].&lt;ref name='kennesaw'&gt;{{cite news | first=Stacey | last=Moore | title=Spaceship Earth sculpture unveiled | date=2006-10-30 | publisher=[[Kennesaw State University]] | url=http://acsdevl.kennesaw.edu/access/story.asp?sto=340 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20070620001812/http://acsdevl.kennesaw.edu/access/story.asp?sto=340 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-06-20 | work=Access Online | accessdate=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 175-ton chunk of rock was formed from 88 individual pieces of [[quartzite]] and bonded with specially made [[polyepoxide]].&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;  After these pieces were in place, Eino attached a life-size bronze model of the late Brower.  Additionally, 2,400 bronze pieces were added to the exterior to outline land masses on the earth.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;

''Spaceship Earth'' was completed in August 2006 and unveiled in October.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;  The sculpture broke apart and started spilling over just two months later.  First reports cited poor adhesive and unsound construction contributed to its demise while Eino argued that it had to have been an act of vandalism.  The sculpture was rededicated in November 2006.&lt;ref name='collapse'&gt;{{cite news | title=Earth Collapses | publisher =[[Associated Press]] | url =http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&amp;id=5723603 | accessdate = 2009-12-31 | date = 2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A few months before the November 2000 death of the first Executive Director [[Sierra Club]] and lifelong environmentalist David Brower, the founders of [[PowerBar]], Brian and Jennifer Maxwell,  commissioned the 175-ton tribute in his honor.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt; It was during a morning run with photographer Galen Rowell and PowerBar's Brian Maxwell that the tribute was conceived.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;  Shortly after Maxwell met with his friend, environmentalist and Finnish-American artist Eino, to create such a sculpture.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;

Eino was sent stone samples from a rock quarry in Brazil at the start of the project and "[he] thought, oh my, this is three times harder than marble. But immediately I understood this was the right stone. It is more permanent than anything else. No pollution can hurt it. No graffiti will harm it. It was the right stone to be here for 1,000 years."&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt; Over 175 tons of Brazilian blue quartzite was shipped and stored in a parking lot while Eino and Maxwell sought to secure a home for the sculpture.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;  Locations in Berkeley to Washington, D.C., were proposed, but all were turned down by local art commissions or city councils.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Halted' /&gt;  For nearly a year, Eino argued to have the sculpture placed in the streets of San Francisco, but the San Francisco Arts Commission’s Visual Arts Committee turned it down by saying it "not only had little or nothing to do with the city" but "was too big and did not represent Brower's ideals."&lt;ref name='Finding'&gt;{{cite news | first=Leah | last=Garchik | title=175-ton East Bay-inspired 'Earth Spaceship' needs landing pad | date=2003-08-13 | publisher=The Chronicle Publishing Co. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Home' /&gt;

Later, in 2004, Jennifer Maxwell, then the widow of Brian Maxwell, contacted the City of Berkeley to find a home for the tribute.&lt;ref name='sleepwalking'&gt;{{cite news | first=Ken | last=Coupland | title=Spaceship Earth Tries to Land A sleepwalking David Brower sculpture looks for a home | date=2004-09-15 | publisher=East Bay Express Publishing, LP | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =East Bay Express | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few members of the Berkeley Arts Commission spoke out against the sculpture's design and how it seemed to be forced on the city.  In October 2004, the commission voted 7-2 to accept the sculpture with conditions.&lt;ref name='altered'&gt;{{cite news | first=Patrick | last=Hoge | title=Panel OKs accepting altered sculpture | date=2004-10-30 | publisher=The Chronicle Publishing Co. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For final approval by the Civic Art Commission {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} sculpture could not be adorned with the bronze statue of Brower, and the Maxwell family had to pay the entire installation cost.&lt;ref name='Halted'&gt;{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Kuchinskas | title=Lost in Space | date=2005-08-03 | publisher=East Bay Express Publishing, LP | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =East Bay Express | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='altered' /&gt;  By 2005, with a push from the Mayor, the Civic Art Commission found nearly 30 different locations the sculpture could live.&lt;ref name='possible' /&gt;&lt;ref name='sleepwalking' /&gt; In August 2005, two Berkeley area commissions voted to consider another location.&lt;ref name='Halted' /&gt;  While negotiations were dragging on with bureaucrats in Berkeley, officials at [[Kennesaw State University]] contacted Eino and accepted the memorial.&lt;ref name='Home'&gt;{{cite news | title='Spaceship Earth' to land in Georgia | date=2005-11-04 | publisher=U.P.I. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =UPI | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the sculpture resides at [[Kennesaw State University]], adjacent to the Social Science building.&lt;ref name='Home' /&gt; Nearly six years after its conception, Spaceship Earth was finished and unveiled on October 20, 2006.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt; In late December 2006, only three months after its installation on campus, ''Spaceship Earth'' collapsed. The sculpture was intended to be a permanent reminder to future generations to take care of their delicate planet. After the collapse, Eino attributed the disaster to vandalism, but later reports associated the collapse with poor construction. Reconstruction was to begin in February 2007 but was delayed until July and was completed by November 2007.&lt;ref name='collapse' /&gt;

[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] composed his '''Symphony No. 1''' in [[E minor]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 1 (originally in E-flat minor), between 1861 and 1865 under the guidance of [[Mily Balakirev]]. Balakirev also premiered the work at a concert of the [[Free Music School]] in December 1865. Rimsky-Korsakov revised the work in 1884.

==Form==
The symphony is written in the traditional four movements.

# ''Largo assai—Allegro''
# ''Andante tranquillo''
# Scherzo. ''Vivace''
# ''Allegro assai''

==Overview==
===Composition===
Before meeting Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov had written, among other works, "something like the beginning of a symphony in E-flat minor."&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, ''My Musical Life'', 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces were the fruit of composition lessons with F.A. Kanille, with whom he had begun studying in the fall of 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1861, Kanille introduced him to Balakirev.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev approved of the works Rimsky-Korsakov had written thus far, encouraging him to continue work on the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; On Balakirev's advice, Rimsky-Korsakov continued writing the opening movement.&lt;ref name="rimsky22"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev subjected this music to considerable criticism; Rimsky-Korsakov incorporated his suggested changes zealously.&lt;ref name="rimsky22"/&gt; Once this movement was finished, Rimsky-Korsakov attempted to orchestrate it and was embarrassed at the results.&lt;ref name="rimsky22"/&gt; Balakirev orchestrated the first page of the movement for him.&lt;ref name="rimsky22"/&gt; From there, the process went more smoothly.&lt;ref name="rimsky22"/&gt;

By the time the navy sent Rimsky-Korsakov on a three-year world cruise in 1862, he had completed the first movement, scherzo and finale of the symphony.&lt;ref name="rimsky22"/&gt; He wrote the slow movement during a stop in England, then mailed the score to Balakirev before going back to sea.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to St. Petersburg in 1865, Balakirev suggested that Rimsky-Korsakov renew work on the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, writing a trio for the Scherzo and reorchestrating the whole work.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev conducted the successful premiere of the symphony in December, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 59, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov appeared on stage in uniform to acknowledge the applause (regulations demanded that officers remain in uniform even when off-duty). Seeing him, the audience was surprised a naval officer had written such a work.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; A second performance quickly followed in March 1866 under the baton of Konstantin Lyadov, father of the composer [[Anatoly Lyadov]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ed. Stankey Sadie, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 20 vols. (London: Macmillan, 1980), vol. 16, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="First Russian Symphony"===
As leader of "[[The Five (composers)|The Five]]," Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their "Russian" music apart from the German symphonism of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and other Western-orientated composers.&lt;ref name="figis391"&gt;Figis, Orlando, ''Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002), 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his First Symphony, [[Vladimir Stasov]] and the other nationalists dubbed it the "First Russian Symphony," even though Rubinstein had written his ''Ocean'' Symphony a dozen years before it.&lt;ref name="figis391"/&gt; These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="figis391"/&gt; "The symphony is good," fellow "Five" member [[César Cui]] wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. "We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness."&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, A.N., ''N.A. Rimskii-Korsakov: zhizn' i tvorchestvo'', vyp. 2 (Moscow, 1935), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Despite Cui's comment, a fair amount of non-Russian influence made its way into the First Symphony. Among the models Rimsky-Korsakov acknowledged were [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''Manfred'' Overture and [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Third Symphony]], [[Mikhail Glinka]]'s ''Prince Kholmsky'' and ''Jota Aragonesa'' and Balakirev's ''King Lear'' Overture.&lt;ref name="rimsky34"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Schumann's music proved especially strong.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, Francis, tr. [[Arnold Pomerans|Pomerans, Arnold J.]] and Erica Pomerans, ''A History of Russian Music: From ''Kamarinskaya ''to'' Babi Yar (Berkeley, Los Angeles and London: University of California Press), 2002, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Inexperienced in orchestration, he turned to [[Hector Berlioz]]'s treatise on orchestration&lt;ref name="rimsky34"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to advice from Balakirev.&lt;ref name="rimsky35"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; "I felt that I was ignorant of many things," Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, "but was convinced that Balakirev knew everything in the world, and he cleverly concealed from me and the others [among 'The Five'] the insufficiency of his information. But in orchestral coloring and combination of instruments he was a good practical hand, and his counsels were invaluable to me."&lt;ref name="rimsky35"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revision===
In 1884, Rimsky-Korsakov thoroughly revised his First Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; He transposed the key of the symphony itself from [[E flat minor]] to [[E minor]], to enable orchestras to play the work more easily than had previously been able and allow the work to become a repertory piece for student and amateur orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 272-273.&lt;/ref&gt; He also reversed the order of slow movement and scherzo.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''Slavonic and Romantic Music: Essays and Studies'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1968), 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">The '''Symphony No. 21''', Opus 152, subtitled ''[[Kaddish]]'', was composed by [[Mieczysław Weinberg]] in 1991. It was the last full-orchestral symphony that Weinberg completed (he died in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weinberg: Symphony No. 21, Op. 152, Kaddish|url=http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/245099|website=Presto Classical|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is dedicated to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]'s [[Holocaust]] victims.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norris|first1=Geoffrey|title=Weinberg Symphony No 21 (review)|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/weinberg-symphony-no-21|website=Gramophone Magazine|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony is a single-movement work in six sections:

'''''Tales from the Crypt''''' is a 1972 British [[horror film]] directed by [[Freddie Francis]]. It is an [[anthology film]] consisting of five separate segments, based on stories from [[EC Comics]]. It was produced by [[Amicus Productions]] and filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]], and is one of several Amicus horror anthologies made during the 1970s.

In the film, five strangers ([[Joan Collins]], [[Ian Hendry]], [[Robin Phillips]], [[Richard Greene]] and [[Nigel Patrick]]) encounter the mysterious [[Crypt Keeper]] ([[Ralph Richardson]]) in a [[crypt]], and he tells each in turn the manner of their death.

==Plot==
===Intro===
Five strangers go with a tourist group to view old [[catacomb]]s. Separated from the main group, they find themselves in a room with the mysterious Crypt Keeper ([[Ralph Richardson]]), who details how each of the strangers may die.

===...And All Through the House===
* Taken from ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'' #35

Joanne Clayton ([[Joan Collins]]) kills her husband ([[Martin Boddey]]) on [[Christmas Eve]]. She prepares to hide his body, but hears a radio announcement stating that a homicidal maniac ([[Oliver MacGreevy]]) is on the loose. She sees the killer (who is dressed in a [[Santa Claus]] costume) outside her house, but cannot call the police without exposing her own crimes.

After cleaning up her crime, Joanne finally attempts to call the police. However, her young daughter ([[Chloe Franks]]) - believing the maniac to be Santa - unlocks the door and lets him into the house, whereupon he starts to strangle Joanne to death.

===Reflection of Death===
* Taken from ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' #23

Carl Maitland ([[Ian Hendry]]) abandons his family to be with Susan Blake ([[Angela Grant]]). After they drive off together, they are involved in a car accident. He wakes up in the wrecked car and attempts to hitch-hike home, but everyone he meets reacts with horror upon seeing him. Arriving at his house, he sees his wife (Susan Denny) with another man.

He knocks on the door, but she screams and slams the door. He then goes to see Susan to find out that she is blind from the accident. She says that Carl died two years ago in the crash. Glancing at a reflective tabletop, he sees he has the face of a rotted, hideous corpse and screams in horror. Carl then wakes up and finds out that it was a dream, but the moment he does, the crash occurs as previously seen.

===Poetic Justice===
* Taken from ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'' No. 12, (March–April 1952)

Edward Elliott ([[David Markham]]) and his son James ([[Robin Phillips]]) are a snobbish pair who resent their neighbour, dustman Arthur Grimsdyke ([[Peter Cushing]]), who owns a number of dogs and entertains children in his house; James, in particular, strongly detests the old man. To get rid of what they see as a blight on the neighbourhood, they push Grimsdyke into a frenzy by conducting a [[smear campaign]] against him, first resulting in the removal of his beloved dogs (one of them returns to him), then persuading a member of the council to have him removed from his job, and later exploiting parents' paranoid fears about [[child molestation]].

On Valentine's Day, James sends Grimsdyke a number of poison-pen Valentines, supposedly from the neighbours, driving the old man to suicide. One year later, Grimsdyke comes back from the dead and takes revenge on James. The following morning, Edward finds his son dead with a note that said, "HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY--YOU WERE MEAN AND CRUEL-RIGHT FROM THE START-NOW YOU REALLY HAVE NO--!"Edward opens up the folded end of the note and realizes that the final word of that note is "HEART," represented by James's heart, which has been torn from his body while still beating.

===Wish You Were Here===
* ''Wish You Were Here'' (''The Haunt of Fear'' #22, November–December 1953), a variation on [[W. W. Jacobs]]'s famed short story "[[The Monkey's Paw]]".

Ineffective businessman Ralph Jason ([[Richard Greene]]) is close to financial ruin. His wife Enid ([[Barbara Murray]]) discovers a Chinese [[figurine]] that says it will grant three wishes to whoever possesses it; Enid decides to wish for a fortune; surprisingly, it comes true. However, Ralph is killed, seemingly in a car crash, on the way to his lawyer's office to collect it. The lawyer ([[Roy Dotrice]]) then advises Enid she will inherit a fortune from her deceased husband's life insurance plan. She uses her second wish to bring him back to the way he was just before the accident, but learns that his death was due to a heart attack immediately before the crash (caused by fright when he sees the figure of "death" following him on a motorcycle).

As she uses her final wish to bring him back alive and to live forever, she discovers too late that he was embalmed. She tries to kill him to end his pain but because she wished him to live forever, he cannot be killed. She has now trapped him in eternal pain.

===Blind Alleys===
* Taken from ''Tales from the Crypt'' No. 46 (February–March 1955)

Major William Rogers ([[Nigel Patrick]]), the mean new director of a home for the blind made up mostly of elderly and middle-aged men, makes drastic financial cuts, reducing heat and rationing food for the residents while he lives in luxury with his [[German Shepherd]], Shane. When Rogers ignores the pleas of resident George Carter ([[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]]) for help, another resident dies from the cold and a stone-faced Carter leads the others in exacting revenge. Carter and his group subdue the staff, then lock Rogers and Shane in separate rooms in the basement as they construct a small maze of narrow corridors between the two rooms. Rogers and Shane are starved, leading to the dog becoming ravenous.

After two days, Rogers' door is unlocked and he must find his way through with the lights off. He yells out in pain as Carter turns the lights on, discovering one corridor is lined with razor blades. Rogers makes it past, but finds Shane being let out from the room in front of him. He flees back towards the razors, but Carter turns the lights off and Rogers is heard screaming as the hungry dog catches up with him.

===Finale===
After completing the final tale, the Crypt Keeper reveals that he was not warning them of what would happen, but telling them what has already happened: they have all "died without repentance". Clues to this twist can be spotted throughout the film, including Joanna wearing the brooch her husband had given her for Christmas just before she killed him. The door to [[Hell]] opens and Joanna, Carl, James, Ralph, and Major Rogers all enter. "And now, who's next?" asks the Crypt Keeper, turning to face the camera as he says "Perhaps...YOU?" The scene pulls away as the entrance to the Crypt Keeper's lair is in flames.

== Production ==
[[Milton Subotsky]] of [[Amicus Productions]] had long been a fan of [[EC Comics]]' ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' and eventually persuaded his partner [[Max Rosenberg]] to buy the rights. The copyright owner, [[William Gaines]], insisted on script approval. The budget of £170,000 was higher than usual for an Amicus production, and was partly funded by [[American International Pictures]]. Peter Cushing was originally offered the part played by Richard Greene, but wanted to try something different and played the elderly Grimsdyke instead. Filming started on 13 September 1971 and finished in 1972.

== Critical reception ==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 88% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1020820-tales_from_the_crypt/|title=Tales from the Crypt (1972)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720315/REVIEWS/203150301/1023 |title=Tales from the Crypt |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=6 July 2012 |date=15 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllRovi|Allmovie]]'s review of the film was generally favourable, writing, "It has a certain magnetism about it that is hard to resist and which accounts for its enduring popularity.

== Points of interest ==
* Only two of the stories are from EC's ''Tales from the Crypt'' comic book. The reason for this, according to ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' founding editor [[Russ Jones]], is that producer Milton Subotsky did not own a run of the original EC comic book but instead adapted the movie from the two paperback reprints given to him by Jones. The story ''Wish You Were Here'' was reprinted in the paperback collection ''[[The Vault of Horror (book)|The Vault of Horror]]'' (Ballantine, 1965). The other four stories in the movie were among the eight stories reprinted in ''[[Tales from the Crypt (book)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (Ballantine, 1964).
* Richardson's hooded Crypt Keeper, more sombre than the EC original (as illustrated by [[Al Feldstein]] and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]]), has a monk-like appearance and resembles EC's GhouLunatics. In the EC horror comics, the other horror hosts (the [[The Haunt of Fear#The Old Witch|Old Witch]] and the [[Vault-Keeper (comics)|Vault Keeper]]) wore hoods, while the Crypt Keeper did not.
* The earlier Amicus anthology film ''[[Torture Garden (film)|Torture Garden]]'' features a similar ending breaking the [[fourth wall]].
* The screenplay was adapted into a tie-in novel by [[Jack Oleck]], ''Tales from the Crypt'' (Bantam, 1972). Oleck, who wrote the novel ''Messalina'' (1950), also scripted for EC's Picto-Fiction titles, ''Crime Illustrated'', ''Shock Illustrated'' and ''Terror Illustrated''. A tie-in was also written by Oleck for the later Amicus anthology film ''The Vault of Horror'', released in 1973.

== Connections to the TV series ==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}
''...And All Through the House'', ''Blind Alleys'' and ''Wish You Were Here'' were all somewhat remade into episodes for the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales From the Crypt]]'' television show. ''Blind Alleys'' and ''Wish You Were Here'' were both changed.

* ''...And All Through the House'' had the woman killing her husband so that she can take her daughter and live with her boyfriend. The episode ended with her daughter letting the axe-wielding maniac into the house as he quotes "Naughty or Nice" with the episode ending with the woman screaming. The Crypt Keeper stated that the daughter was not harmed because the escaped maniac liked older women....in pieces.

* ''Blind Alleys'' was now ''Revenge is the Nuts'' and was about a beautiful blind girl (portrayed by [[Teri Polo]]) who comes to live at a house for the blind where the sadistic director (played by ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'''s [[Anthony Zerbe]]) tries to sexually assault her. In the end, she and the other residents take their revenge on the director in the same fashion as in the original story.

* ''Wish You Were Here'' is similar to the TV series' 7th-season episode ''Last Respects'' in that both borrow plot elements from W. W. Jacobs's classic story "The Monkey's Paw", and both are directed by the original film's director [[Freddie Francis]]. Like many of the show's episodes, "Last Respects" uses the title of an existing story from the comics (''Tales From The Crypt'' #23), but does not use the story itself. The statue from the film is reverted to the original monkey's paw in the TV episode, and the story now deals with three sisters who come into possession of it. One wishes for a million pounds, and she and the second sister are in a car crash where she dies, and her life insurance policy is for one million pounds. When the third sister wishes that the dead sister was the way she was just before the crash, she learns that she was actually killed by the second sister. In a form of revenge, the third sister gives her last wish to her sister, but she did not say ''which'' sister she wanted to give it to, beating the monkey's paw at its own game. The wish is transferred to the dead sister who comes back to kill the second sister.

'''''The Bride of Abydos''''' (French - ''La Fiancée d'Abydos'') or ''Selim and Zuleika'' is the title of two works by [[Eugène Delacroix]], one in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] (pre-1849) and another in the [[Louvre]] (1843-1849).

Both works show the characters Selim and Zuleika from [[The Bride of Abydos|the poem of the same name]] by [[Lord Byron]], written after he had swum the Hellespont between Abydos and Sestos in imitation of [[Leander (mythology)|Leander]].

'''''Verre Églomisé''''' is a French term referring to the process of applying both a design and gilding onto the rear face of glass to produce a mirror finish. The name is derived from the 18th-century French decorator and art-dealer Jean-Baptiste Glomy (1711–1786), who was responsible for its revival.

Glomy’s technique was a relatively simple one of applying decorative designs in a combination of plain colour and gilding, usually to glass picture frames.  However, over time it has come to be used to describe nearly any process involving back-painted and gilded glass, however elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NSFFAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=verre+eglomise+glomy+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E9Yi6wSlsl&amp;sig=2d9lmccqCCcGJjIQPRw58E-zrC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwq77W1qHSAhWjOsAKHYZ5DGk4ChDoAQgoMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=verre%20eglomise%20glomy%20history&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of back-painting glass actually dates back to pre-Roman eras. One of the key historical periods of the art was in Italy during the 13th to 16th centuries. Small panels of glass with designs formed by engraved gilding were applied to reliquaries and portable altars. The method used is described by Cennino Cennini.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Cennini/11M.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Other practitioners include Jonas Zeuner and Hans Jakob Sprungli (1559–1637).

It has also been used throughout Europe since the 15th century, appearing in paintings, furniture, drinking glasses and similar vessels and jewellery. It is also often seen in the form of decorative panels of mirrors, clock faces, and in more recent history, as window signs and advertising mirrors.

In the gilding process, the silver, gold or other metal leaf is fixed using a gelatin adhesive which, after steaming, results in a mirror-like, reflective finish. The design can be applied by various techniques, often by reverse painting prior to gilding, or by engraving the design into the gilded layer, or even into the glass. When painting an elaborate design such as a flower, the artist’s natural methodology is reversed, with highlights applied first and the background applied last.

The metal leaf may also be applied using oil-based adhesives (goldsize varnish) to achieve a matte finish. It is to be distinguished from "sandwiched" gold glass where gold leaf is glued to a piece of glass, and often then scraped off to form a design, and a further layer of hot glass is then applied on top and fused to seal the gold inside.

In recent years the term Verre Églomisé has also been used to describe gilded and distressed mirrors which have no actual design or pattern applied, but this is taking it a further step away from its source. A better term for these would be the less exotic sounding ‘Distressed Hand-Gilded Mirror’.

[[File:VisionsBeforeMidnight.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Jonathan Cape]])]]

'''''Visions Before Midnight''''' is a selection of the television criticism written by [[Clive James]] during his first four years (1972–1976) as ''[[The Observer]]'''s weekly television critic. The selection begins with a piece on the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, and ends with a piece on the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal. It was first published in 1977. The title derives from [[Sir Thomas Browne]]: ''Dreams out of the ivory gate, and visions before midnight.''

Before being contracted by ''Observer'' editor [[David Astor]], James had previously written one piece per month on television for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' and its editor, [[Karl Miller]], had been an important influence on James. He had allowed him to, "write a column which eschewed solemnity so thoroughly that it courted the frivolous. Like [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] Karl Miller appreciated the kind of joke that unveils a problem: if your gags had a serious reason for being there, they stayed in." James explains in the preface: "Television was a natural part of my life. I loved watching it and I loved being on it. The second passion has since somewhat faded, but the first remains strong, and was very powerful at the time. I watched just about everything, including the junk. The screen teemed with unsummable activity. It was full of  visions, legends, myths, fables. T.V was scarcely something you could feel superior to. It was too various. What I had to offer was negative capability, a capability for submission to the medium. I was the first to submit myself to [[Alastair Burnet]] and find him fascinating. No critic before me had ever regarded [[David Vine]] as a reason for switching the set ''on''."

In the preface James says that the idea of publishing a selection of his television criticism had been in his mind since speaking with [[Kenneth Tynan]] at a reception at the [[Garrick Club]]. Tynan had said he hoped James would publish some of his criticism but averred that, "A television critic would have to know everything, and who knows everything?" James had been lost for an answer at the time but in the Preface replies, "It isn't necessary to know everything – just to remember that nobody else does either."

'''Überbrettl''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔyːbɐˌbʁɛtl̩}} ''[[über|super]]-cabaret'') was the first venue in [[German Empire|Germany]] for literary [[cabaret]], or [[Kabarett]], founded 1901 in [[Berlin]] by [[Ernst von Wolzogen]]. The German Kabarett concept was imported from [[French Third Republic|French]] venues like [[Le Chat Noir]] in [[Paris]], from which it kept the characteristic atmosphere of intimacy. But the German type developed its own peculiarities, most prominently its characteristic [[gallows humor|gallows humour]].&lt;ref name="Britannica97V2p702"&gt;(1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eecaAQAAMAAJ ''The new encyclopaedia Britannica''], Volume 2, p.702 quote: {{quotation|It retained the intimate atmosphere, entertainment platform, and improvisational character of the French cabaret but developed its own characteristic gallows humour. By the late 1920s the German cabaret gradually had come to feature mildly risque musical entertainment for the middle-class man, as well as biting political and social satire. It was also a centre for underground political and literary movements. [...] They were the centres of leftist of opposition to the rise of the German Nazi Party and often experienced Nazi retaliation for their criticism of the government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The distinct cabaret atmosphere was sketched by [[Otto Julius Bierbaum]] in his 1897 novel ''Stilpe'', which inspired Wolzogen in the foundation of the ''Überbrettl''. He chose the initial name both to parody [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Übermensch]]'' concept and to contrast the widespread ''Brettl'' (i.e. "(stage-)board") [[variety show]]s without further artistic ambitions. 

The venue opened in a former theatre on 18 January 1901 on Alexanderstraße No. 40, vis-à-vis the [[Alexanderplatz]] police headquarters. Victor Hollaender, the father of [[Friedrich Hollaender]], served as musical director, temporarily superseded by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], with [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]] as chief composer.  Performances included parodies written by [[Christian Morgenstern]] and the one-act play ''Episode'' by [[Arthur Schnitzler]]. They soon became very popular entailing the establishment of numerous Kabarett venues all over Berlin.

However, economical difficulties arose in the same year, when Wolzogen established another venue, the ''Buntes Theater'' ("colourful theatre"), in the [[Kreuzberg]] quarter. The great hall was lavishly decorated in an [[Art nouveau]] style by [[August Endell]], nevertheless the extensive costs combined with the remote location turned out to be fatal. In 1902 Wolzogen retired and the stage performances concentrated on trivial comedies. From 1909 onwards, the rooms were used by the ''[[Volksbühne|Freie Volksbühne]]'' theatre company.
