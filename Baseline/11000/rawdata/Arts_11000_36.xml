'''Anthony Montague Parkin''' (1943-2012, also known as A.M. Parkin, Tony Parkin, Monty Parkin) was an English artist known for his drawings, engravings and watercolours depicting daily life and nature in his home village of [[Kemsing]], [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130419220650/http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/image_galleries/monty_parkin_gallery.shtml?1 BBC preview of A.M. Parkin's work]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Parkin was born on 15 August 1943 in [[Kemsing]], Kent. He studied at Beckenham School of Art and Ravensbourne College of Art. He preferred representational drawing to the in-vogue preference for abstract art.&lt;ref name=BSA&gt;Adrian Buckley (October 2012) [http://beckenhamschoolart.org/News/in-memory-of-tony-parkin-1943-2012 "In Memory of Tony Parkin 1943 - 2012"], Beckenham School of Art. Retrieved 2014-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graham Sutherland]] sponsored A.M. Parkin's 1977 solo exhibition at the Langton Gallery in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], saying:

“When first I saw the work of A. M. Parkin six or seven years ago, I was struck at the outset by the fact that here was someone using his eyes acutely in his chosen field with obsessive attention ....Any collector of prints…would do well to start a collection of these mysterious works – so full of understanding of quiet places”.&lt;ref name=BSA /&gt;

In 1978 Parkin was chosen, by [[Quentin Crisp]], as the winner of a drawing competition (Parkin had submitted an etching of Crisp) and the prize giving was broadcast on television.&lt;ref name=BSA /&gt;

During a career spanning nearly five decades, A.M. Parkin was commissioned by the likes of [[Victor Lownes]] and [[Langton Iliffe, 2nd Baron Iliffe]].

The latter was attracted to Parkin's intricate pencil drawing style, commissioning the artist to produce a study of 'The Elm at [[Yattendon]]' in [[Berkshire]], while Lownes commissioned a pencil drawing of [[Stocks House]] in [[Hertfordshire]].

In September 1981 Parkin’s set of pencil drawings called ‘Village People’ featured on [[BBC Radio Four]]’s ‘Countryside in September’ programme. The portraits appear in A.M. Parkin’s retrospective book ‘A Village Artist’. [http://issuu.com/vinemagazine/docs/vine_oct12_issuu &lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/vinemagazine/docs/vine_oct12_issuu&lt;/ref&gt;]

Parkin’s work has been exhibited at galleries including the [[Royal Academy]] and [[The Mall Galleries]] in [[London]]. His 1985 engraving of [[Quentin Crisp]] is held at London’s [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp50109/am-parkin%20%20%20%20%20 A.M. Parkin's engraving of Quentin Crisp], npg.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

He produced a series of political postcards in the late 1980s, galvanised by opposition to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]]. Parkin refused to pay his poll tax, was taken to court, then sold the postcards at £1 apiece to pay off his court costs.&lt;ref name="indy maggie"&gt;John Windsor (2 April 1994) [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/dear-maggie-wish-you-werent-here-picture-postcards-with-political-views-of-the-early-thatcher-years-have-found-a-new-market-reports-john-windsor-1367344.html "Dear Maggie, wish you weren't here: Picture postcards with political views of the early Thatcher years have found a new market, reports John Windsor"], ''The Independent''. Retrieved 2014-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Parkin took part in the Discerning Eye exhibition at the invitation of art critic [[Brian Sewell]].

In January 2012 The Illustration Cupboard presented a collection of Parkin's original artwork for the [[Margaret Thatcher]] satirical postcards of the 1980s, including the internationally recognised "Market Forces' Sweetheart", which had been voted top political postcard of 1989 by collectors.&lt;ref name="indy maggie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illustrationcupboard.com/exhibition_details.aspx?eId=176&amp;ePage=6&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkin died on 11 June 2012, having just completed a retrospective book of his life's work.&lt;ref name=BSA /&gt;

A charitable trust to support student artists has been created by A.M. Parkin's family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505103459/http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/Artist-writer-local-historian-speaker-musician/story-16561073-detail/story.html This is Kent obituary for A.M.

[[Image:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|220px|Detail of the ''Apollon de Mantoue'' ([[Louvre Museum]])]] 
The '''Apollo of Mantua''' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm.  The type-piece, the first example discovered, is named for its location at Mantua; the type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos|Polyclitus]] but more archaic.  The Apollo held the ''cythara''  against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example (''illustration'') a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps. 

More than a dozen other replicas of the type have been found, the principal ones being those conserved in the national museums of [[Naples]] and of [[Mantua]].

The lost original would have been bronze. The name of the teacher of [[Phidias]], [[Hegias of Athens]] is sometimes invoked, but there are no surviving examples of Hegias' work to judge from.

Examples include:

:The Naples ''Apollo of Mantua'', a bronze found at [[Pompeii]], in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]], Naples (inv. 5630).

:The Louvre ''Apollo of Mantua'', formerly in the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], entered the museum in 1871.

:The [[Fogg Art Museum]] ''Apollo of Mantua'', a Roman bronze&lt;ref&gt;Spectroscopy revealed the alloy in fact to be [[brass]] (Congdon 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; head of the ''Apollo of Mantua'' type, originally about one-third lifesize.

'''Azerbaijan Photographers Union''' (APU) is the public, creative, [[non-profit]] organization, based on the principles of [[open society]], [[voluntarism (action)|voluntariness]] and [[self-government]].

It acts under the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] and Charter of the Union.

The Azerbaijan Photographers Union was registered in the Ministry of Justice of the [[Azerbaijan]] Republic on the 20 November 1998 by certificate number 1073.

At the beginning of 1990, with the collapse of the USSR, all working structures became worthless and it became apparent that there was need of an organization in which professional and amateur photographers — all those who are devoted to photographic art — would join together.

At that time a serious, uniting moment in the organization's establishment became preparation and holding of the ''Photographers of Azerbaijan'' exhibition in Nantes, France in November 1995, where 105 works by 24 photographers were presented.

After the exhibition in France, there were 3 years of debates, the charter's complying, overcoming obstacles, and the initiative group was formed to tackle this - registered the Union officially, although actually the Union already acted from 1994 on a voluntary basis, without legal status.

The main purposes and tasks of the APU are promotion to the national development of photo art, popularization of its achievements in the country and abroad, preservation and creative use of photographic heritage. With the purpose of promotion and development of photo art the Union organizes exhibitions, competitions, festivals, master classes, conferences and symposiums with the participation of the Azerbaijani and foreign photographers, as well as promotes the amateur movement.

10 years passed from the APU's establishment. During this period the members of the creative union have organized and taken part in more than 100 exhibitions, including more than 30 in foreign countries (USA, UK, France, Turkey, Germany, Belgium, Ukraine, Greece, Russia, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia etc.).

The Chairman of the Board is Mirnaib Hasanoglu.

Much traditional [[Chinese art]] was made for the imperial court, often to be then redistributed as gifts. As well as [[Chinese painting]], sculpture and [[Chinese calligraphy]], there are a great range of what may be called [[decorative arts|decorative]] or [[applied art]]s.  [[Chinese fine art]] is distinguished from [[Chinese folk art]], which differs in its style and purpose.  This article gives an overview of the many different applied arts of China.

==Calligraphy==
{{main|Chinese calligraphy}}

The Chinese imperial court collected calligraphy pieces from the most skilled calligraphers in the country. The collection contains many masterpieces made by well-known calligraphers throughout Chinese art history. Furthermore, because of calligraphy's high artistic value, calligraphy collecting was popular among several Chinese emperors in multiple dynasties.

===Snuff bottle===
{{main|Snuff bottle}}

After opium was introduced to China, snuff bottles became popular. The Chinese royalties were addicted to them, as they used opium as a long-life medicine. The design of the snuff bottles flourished because of the money that the rich poured into the industry. Many of these bottles were made by talented artisans using tiny paints brushes; they were painted from inside of the bottle, reaching down from the top of the narrow neck. They are still highly collectible up to this day.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Lacquer==

==Photography==
{{main|Photography in China}}

After the invention of photography in 1839 and the arrival of European photographers in [[Macao]], photography was soon introduced in several cities in China. At first, some people were reluctant because they thought that having the camera take a picture of them would result in their spirit being taken away. But, by the end of the nineteenth century, all major cities had photographic studios. Some affluent Chinese people even adopted photography as a hobby. Western and Chinese photographers documented ordinary street life, major wars, and prominent figures.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Ivory carving===
{{main|Ivory carving}}

Ivory was not a prestigious material in the rather strict hierarchy of Chinese art, where [[jade]] had always been far more highly regarded, and rhinoceros horn (which was not ivory) had a special auspicious meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt; But ivory, as well as bone, had been used for various items since early times when China still had its own species of elephant. Demand for ivory seems to have played a large part in their extinction, which came before 100 BC. During the [[Ming dynasty]], ivory began to be used for small statuettes of gods and others (see gallery). In the Qing dynasty, it suited the growing taste for intricate carving and became more prominently used for brush-holders, boxes, handles and similar pieces. Later on, Canton even developed large models of houses and other large and showy pieces, which remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Enormous examples are still seen as decorative centrepieces at government receptions. Figures were typically uncoloured, or just with certain features coloured in ink which was often just black, but sometimes a few other colors.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Government seals===
[[Seal knob]] (紐刻) is an art that originated in ancient China and is mainly popular in East Asian countries. It focuses or decorates on the head-part or the top-side of a seal. It is a kind of sculpture or mini-sculpture. In China, the utmost important seal of all is the imperial seal called '[[He Shi Bi]]', now lost. It was said that the green jade took the form of a round shape with inscriptions that read "Having received the Mandate from Heaven, may (the emperor) lead a long and prosperous life." (受命於天，既壽永昌) This was said to be written by the Primer [[Li Si]] for [[Qin Shi Huang]] Zhao Zheng, the Augustus Emperor of The Chinese Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Ruyi===
{{main|Ruyi (scepter)}}

[[Ruyi (scepter)|Ruyi]] is a scepter that serves primarily as a decoration. Its history began in the [[Qing dynasty]] when Ruyi scepters were given to noted visitors of the emperor. Now, they're given as birthday presents. Ruyi is made of different materials, including porcelain and jade. The term Ruyi means "may your wish be granted" or "as you wish". The unusual shape is meant to imitate the shape of a stemmed lotus flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotheborg.com/glossary/?http://www.gotheborg.com/glossary/data/ruyi.shtml ''Ruyi''] Gotheborg.com Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9309">The '''Christchurch Dragon''' is a [[legend]] associated with the town of [[Christchurch, Dorset]], on the south coast of England. The legend has its origin in a mid-12th century French manuscript written by [[Hériman of Tournai |Hermann de Tournai]], which tells how a party of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] from the [[Laon Cathedral|cathedral of Notre-Dame]] in [[Laon]], France, witnessed a five-headed [[dragon]] destroy the church and much of the town. Although well-documented, the legend is little-known in the town of its origin.

==Legend synopsis==

In Hermann de Tournai’s account, a party of nine canons on a fund-raising tour from Laon Cathedral arrive at the town of Christchurch during a torrential rainstorm. They seek shelter at the local minster church but are rejected by the dean, who claims that the doors of the newly-built church are not yet secure. In truth, the dean is concerned that their shrine and holy relics of the Virgin Mary would collect more offerings than his own altars.

Being the Saturday after [[Pentecost]], the canons have arrived on the eve of the town’s annual fair, so all the inns and lodging houses are full with merchants. However, one group of merchants kindly vacate their rooms in a newly-built lodging house. The merchants then attend mass held at the house by the canons and agree to shun the church.

That night the canons tend to a poor herdsman’s daughter who had been born with a deformed foot. The girl spends the night in prayer before the canons’ portable altar and the following morning her foot is found to be miraculously healed.

Later that morning the merchants all go to the fair. The canons depart from the town, but before they have travelled very far they are overtaken by two horsemen who tell them that the town is being set ablaze by a terrible dragon that had flown in from the sea. Eager to see this incredible spectacle, the canons race back to Christchurch.

The dragon is seen to be incredibly long and have five heads from which it breathes sulphurous flames. It is setting houses alight one by one, but the canons are astonished to find that the lodging house and herdsman’s shelter are both completely unscathed and their occupants are safe inside. The kindly merchants have also all escaped unharmed, having departed from the fair early, before the dragon had appeared. However, the church where the canons had been denied shelter has been entirely destroyed.

The uncharitable dean is seen trying to save all his most valuable possessions by loading them on board a boat on the nearby river, but the dragon then swoops down and reduces the boat and everything onboard to ashes. The repentant dean subsequently prostrates himself before the canon’s shrine and prays to be forgiven for all the wrong he had done.

==History==

The background story to the canons’ visit is described in Monodies (Book 3), a contemporary document written by [[Guibert de Nogent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monodies and On the Relics of Saints |pages=153–154|last=Guibert of Nogent|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |isbn=978-0-14-310630-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mentions the fund-raising journeys undertaken by the canons of Laon after the cathedral of Notre-Dame was badly damaged by fire during a civil uprising at Easter in 1112. In Chapter XIII Guibert refers to the burning of an unnamed English town visited by the canons, but he ascribes this to lightning heaven-sent as a punishment for the ungodly behaviour of the inhabitants and makes no mention of a dragon. 

In the mid-12th century, Herman de Laon, otherwise [[Hériman of Tournai |Hermann de Tournai]], a retired Flemish Abbot, elaborated on the canons’ English journey in De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudunensis (Of the Miracles of St Mary of Laon). Two short chapters describe the events that took place in "a town called Christikerca", though Hermann replaces Guibert de Nogent’s lightning with a five-headed dragon. Hermann’s account was reproduced in the [[Patrologia Latina]] (Vol 156, Col 979-982) published by [[Jacques-Paul Migne]] in the 19th century. 

In the early 13th century the story was retold in rhyming couplets by Prior [[Gautier de Coincy]], a French poet-composer. An illustrated manuscript of this work, Miracles de Notre-Dame et Autres Poésies de Gautier de Coinci, which features depictions of the dragon flying over the town and river (Folio 210v), is held in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].

In the early 14th century the story appeared in the Nikolaus Saga written by [[Bergr Sokkason]], an Icelandic monk and scholar. He probably had access to earlier Latin and Icelandic versions of the story. It was subsequently reproduced in other Icelandic sagas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nine Norse Studies |last=[[Gabriel Turville-Petre|Turville-Petre]]|first=Gabriel |year=1972|publisher= London: University College London, for the [[Viking Society for Northern Research]]|pages=64-78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key details of Hermann de Tournai‘s account are confirmed by the Christchurch Priory [[cartulary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Christchurch Priory Cartulary |last=Hanna |first=Katharine |year=2007 |publisher=Hampshire County Council |location= The Castle, Winchester, SO23 8UJ|isbn=1-85975-761-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bulk of which was compiled by 1372. It records that the Holy Trinity minster church was undergoing major reconstruction instigated in about 1094 by [[Ranulf Flambard]]. It also confirms that an annual fair was held a week after Pentecost on the feast day of the church, which only later became known as [[Trinity Sunday]]. It indicates that the dean in 1113 was the self-serving Peter de Oglander, who “imbued with evil intent, took away for himself all things set aside by ancient custom for the work of the church”. However, the cartulary makes no mention of the church being badly damaged during construction.

==Modern era==

In 1933 [[John Strong Perry Tatlock]], a specialist on medieval literature at the University of California, examined Hermann de Tournai’s text and asserted that he could find nothing that contradicted the presumed date of 1113 for the canons’ journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speculum, Vol. 8, No. 4: The English Journey of the Laon Canons |last=Tatlock |first=J S P |year=1933 |publisher=The Medieval Academy of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 much of Hermann de Tournai’s account was translated by English folklorist Jeremy Harte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dragon of Christchurch and Other Wonders Seen on a Journey Through the West of England in 1113 |last=Harte|first=Jeremy |year=1985 |publisher=South-Western Antiquarian Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to be the earliest translation of Hermann de Tournai’s text into English.

A more recent translation (in French) of Hermann de Tournai’s account appears in Les Miracles de Sainte Marie de Laon by Alain Saint-Denis (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Les Miracles de Sainte Marie de Laon |last= Saint-Denis |first= Alain |year=2008 |publisher=CNRS Éditions, Paris |pages=175-180 |isbn=978-2-271-06567-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Denis calculates the date of the dragon’s appearance to be Sunday 1st June 1113.

In May 2013 the 900th anniversary of the dragon’s appearance in Christchurch was commemorated by a locally organised Christchurch Dragon Festival with contributions by local schools, the Christchurch Chamber of Trade &amp; Commerce, Christchurch Library, and the Red House Museum. On 1 June 2013, the five-headed dragon was mentioned in Search for Christchurch, a poem especially written by performance poet [[Elvis McGonagall]] and read by him at the official reopening of the newly refurbished Christchurch Library and Learning Centre.

==Explanation==

There is no accepted explanation for the Christchurch Dragon. However, the references to an abnormally violent rainstorm accompanied by lightning bears a resemblance to the [[The Great Thunderstorm|Great Thunderstorm]] on Dartmoor in 1638. This has led to the speculation, supported by Christopher Chatfield, Deputy Director of the Ball Lightning Research Division of [[TORRO]] (Tornado &amp; Storm Research Organisation), that the canons of Laon may have witnessed a rare example of prolonged [[ball lightning]].

'''''Constellations''''' is a series of 23 small paintings on paper, initiated by [[Joan Miró]] in 1939 in [[Varengeville-sur-Mer]] and completed in 1941 between [[Mallorca]] and [[Mont-roig del Camp]]. The [[Fundació Joan Miró]] preserves a work of this series and ''The Morning Star,'' one of the most important pieces of the series.&lt;ref name="Miró"/&gt; The painter gave to his wife and she later donated to the Foundation.&lt;ref name="Miró"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://80.25.201.238:8081/cdm-fons-fjm/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/fons-fjm&amp;CISOPTR=6296&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=1&amp;idioma=2 | title=Morning star | accessdate=2011-10-30 | publisher=Fundació Joan Miró}} - Information about the work the Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In August 1939, a month before the outbreak of the [[World War II]], Miró, with his family escaped Paris and moved to [[Varengeville-sur-Mer]], a small town in [[Normandy]]. This sentiment of escaping is clearly reflected in this series' harmonic and poetic production. At [[Varengeville-sur-Mer]] he painted the top ten works in the series which was later called ''Constellations'', beginning with ''The Dawn'' and ''The Scale of Evasion''.

After escaping from [[France]], Miró continued the series of ''Constellations'' in [[Mallorca]], creating a more complex group of ten more. The last three were created in 1941 in his ancestral home in [[Mont-roig del Camp]]. Whilst completing this series he began the first sketches of the  ''[[Barcelona Series]]'' engravings, where he would repeat part of his imagery.

{{quote | I felt a deep desire to flee. I shut myself deliberately. The night, music and the stars began to play a role in my painting. | Joan Miró}}

== Description ==
This series is characterized by the shapes of [[star]]s, [[bird]]s and [[woman|women]]. Miró was making up his own mature language. The shapers are overlapping in different ways to create a specific colour space. This new idea was repeated constantly in the artist's work. Luckily the series are dated, allowing the sequence in chronological order.

The backgrounds of the works are all painted in soft tones, and the vast majority of works are full of intersecting black lines, with details painted in the primary colours. Miró used astral maps which were like representations of cosmic space.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Erben|Erben 2004]]: p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Punyet, grandson of the artist, said in an interview at [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]]:
{{quote | The Constellations are a sublime break. They are the way to the power. Towards the universe. They are a door to escape from a circumstantial war, from a genocide, from the brutality of nonsense. The Constellations are like saying: my only salvation in this world tragedy is the spirit, the soul that leads me to heaven. That brings me to the sublime. It is as if Miró was a nocturnal bird able to escape from the earth, leaving the sky, traveling across the sky, the stars, to the constellations, to capture them all with one hand, and draw back to earth them on a sheet of paper. | John Punyet &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.tv3.cat/elmeuavi/miro/fragments_joan%20punyet.htm | title = Fragments of interview of Joan Punyet | accessdate = 2011-10-30 | work = El meu avi | publisher = [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]] | date = | language =Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
In 2002, American percussionist/composer [[Bobby Previte]] released the album ''The 23 Constellations of Joan Miró'' on [[Tzadik Records]]. Inspired by Miró's ''Constellations'' series, Previte composed a series of short pieces (none longer than about 3 minutes) to parallel the small size of Miró's paintings. Privete's compositions for an ensemble of up to ten musicians was described by critics as "unconventionally light, ethereal, and dreamlike".&lt;Ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-23-constellations-of-joan-mir%C3%B3-mw0000014817&lt;/ref&gt; Previte's compositions had their American performance debut in 2008 with an eight-piece ensemble conducted by [[Christian Muthspiel]]. Featuring readings of Miró's letters and diaries by [[David Patrick Kelly]], the performance was reviewed in ''The New York Times'', mostly positively, which noted that large projections of the paintings behind the musicians were helpful in underlining Previte's compositions: "Some of the [[gouaches]] feature a gridlike clutter of dots and dashes that seem to allude, if obliquely, to musical notation."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/arts/music/30prev.html&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was broadcast live on [[WYNC]], which is available as a podcast.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wnyc.org/story/65629-special-podcast-23-constellations-of-joan-miro-originally-aired-nov-11-2008/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Edward''' “'''Ed'''” '''Ross''' (October 27, 1965 – July 30, 2016) was an American [[tintype]] photographer and lawyer. His photography work spanned 27 years. His last six years were devoted exclusively to wet-plate photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=Kate|title=Meet One Photographer Who is Reviving the Extraordinary Art of Tintypes|url=http://www.nerve.com/art/meet-one-photographer-who-is-reviving-the-extraordinary-art-of-tintypes|website=Nerve.com|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His focus as an artist was primarily on [[Portrait photography|nude portraits]] and [[landscape photography]].{{fact|date=December 2018}}

==History==
Ross was born in [[Ukiah, California]] to Bill and Dorothy Ross and raised in [[Davis, California]]. He attended Jesuit High School in [[UC San Diego]], studied at the [[London School of Economics]], and the [[UC Hastings]] School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Member Detail|url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/173048|publisher=The State Bar of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as senior legal counsel for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computer company in [[Cupertino, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Edward Ross - Obituary|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/obits/michael-edward-ross/|website=davisenterprise.com|accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Ross had taken photographs for 27 years, and during the last eight years of his life used the [[Collodion process]] or wet-plates for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=Kate|title=Meet One Photographer Who is Reviving the Extraordinary Art of Tintypes|url=http://www.nerve.com/art/meet-one-photographer-who-is-reviving-the-extraordinary-art-of-tintypes|website=Nerve.com|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross worked with three different cameras: a half-plate box-style camera made by Ty Guillory, an {{convert|8|×|10|in}} bellows-style camera made by Black Art Woodcraft, and a {{convert|16|×|20|in}} Chamonix. He used 'period' lenses, manufactured between 1850 and 1900, by Dallmeyer, Voigtlander, and Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jane|first1=Katherine|title=The Quite Delightful Project|url=https://quitedelightfulproject.com/journal/ed-ross-interview-2/|website=quitedelightfulproject.com|accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NUDES AND PORTRAITS BY ED ROSS|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/news/erotica/nudes-and-portraits-by-ed-ross/|website=juxtapoz.com|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Explication de Texte''''' is a [[France|French]] [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] method of [[literary analysis]] that allows for limited reader response, similar to [[close reading]] in the English-speaking literary tradition.  The method involves a detailed yet relatively objective examination of structure, style, imagery, and other aspects of a work. It was particularly advocated by [[Gustave Lanson]].  

It is primarily a pedagogical tool, similar to a formal [[book report]].

A simple format for writing an ''Explication de Texte'' is this:

[[Image:Greenstone Staff, Tairona culture.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Greenstone staff, 1550 - 1600 AD, from the [[Tairona]] culture of present-day Colombia.]]

'''Greenstone''' is a common generic term for valuable, green-hued minerals and metamorphosed [[igneous rock]]s and stones which early cultures used in the fashioning of [[hardstone carving]]s such as jewelry, statuettes, ritual tools, and various other artifacts.  Greenstone artefacts may be made of [[greenschist]], [[chlorastrolite]], [[serpentine group|serpentine]], [[omphacite]], [[chrysoprase]], [[olivine]], [[nephrite]], [[chloromelanite]] among other green-hued minerals.&lt;ref&gt;See "Glossary" in Hendon &amp; Joyce (2004, p.327); also Kipfer (2000, pp.217–218).&lt;/ref&gt;  The term also includes [[jade]] and [[jadeite]], although these are perhaps more frequently identified by these latter terms.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer (2000, pp.217–218); Pool (2007, p.150)&lt;/ref&gt; The greenish hue of these rocks generally derives from the presence of minerals such as [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[hornblende]], or [[epidote]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer218"&gt;Kipfer (2000, p.218)&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenstone minerals were presumably selected for their color rather than their chemical composition. In [[archaeology]] therefore, having a loosely applied general term is at least partially influenced by the observation that ancient cultures often used and considered these various green-hued materials as interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer (2000, pp.217–218)&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenstone objects are often found very considerable distances from the source of the rock, indicating early travel or trading networks. A polished jadeite axe head in the [[British Museum]] (4000-2000 BCE) was found in [[Canterbury, Kent]] but uses stone from the Alps of Northern Italy, and objects from other parts of the world had travelled comparable distances to their findspots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1363130&amp;partid=1 British Museum], "Axe" Acq. 1901,0206.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient China and [[Mesoamerica]] have especial reputations for the prevalence and significance of greenstone (particularly jade) usage. Greenstones also figure prominently in the indigenous cultures of southeastern [[Australia]], and among the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]] (who knew greenstone as ''[[pounamu]]'').&lt;ref name="Kipfer218"/&gt;  Neolithic Europe also used greenstone, especially for prestige versions of axe tools, not made for use; comparable jade versions of tools and weapons also appeared in the [[Olmec]] and other [[Pre-Columbian cultures]] and in early Chinese civilization.

[[File:Heroico1.jpg|thumb|300px|The original image, from which the popularized portrait was derived. By cropping out a palm tree and the profile of another man, and making other slight adjustments, Korda gave Guevara's image "an ageless quality, divorced from the specifics of time and place."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/books/21kaku.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer's Dream] by [[Michiko Kakutani]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''''Guerrillero Heroico''''' ({{lang-en|"Heroic Guerrilla Fighter"}}) is an [[icon]]ic [[photograph]] of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[revolutionary]] [[Che Guevara]] taken by [[Alberto Korda]]. It was captured on March 5, 1960, in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], at a memorial service for victims of the [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'' explosion]]. By the end of the 1960s, the image, in conjunction with Guevara's subsequent actions and eventual execution, helped solidify the charismatic and controversial leader as a cultural icon.&lt;ref name="CNNCasey"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/05/05/argentina.che.photo/ Communists, Capitalists still buy into Iconic Che Photo, Author says] by Brian Byrnes, ''[[CNN]]'', May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Korda has said that at the moment he shot the picture, he was drawn to Guevara's facial expression, which showed "absolute implacability"&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', by [[Jon Lee Anderson]], 1997, pg 465&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anger and pain.&lt;ref name="Ziff15"&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Korda would say that the photograph showed Che's firm and stoic character.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara was 31 years old at the time the photograph was taken.

Emphasizing the image's ubiquitous nature and wide appeal, the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] called the picture a symbol of the 20th century and the world's most famous photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Institute of Art, referenced at BBC News, "Che Guevara photographer dies", May 26, 2001. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1352650.stm Online at BBC News], accessed January 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of it have been painted, printed, digitized, embroidered, tattooed, silk-screened, sculpted or sketched on nearly every surface imaginable, leading the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] to say that the photograph has been reproduced more than any other image in photography.&lt;ref name="va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1541_che/index.html?page=the_exhibition.html |title=V&amp;A: The story of an image, exhibition organised by UCR/California Museum of Photography |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Green, director of the [[University of California, Riverside California Museum of Photography|UCR/California Museum of Photography]], has speculated that "Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict. There isn’t anything else in history that serves in this way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldtowin.net/reviews/Che.html |title=Che as revolutionary and icon, by Corinna Lotz |publisher=Aworldtowin.net |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history and contemporary global impact of the image is the basis for the 2008 documentary ''[[Chevolution]]'', directed by Trisha Ziff,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdtown.com/review/chevolution/dvd/7726 DVD Review: Chevolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214002912/http://www.dvdtown.com/review/chevolution/dvd/7726 |date=2010-02-14 }} by David Van Der Haeghen, ''DVD Town'', January 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; along with the 2009 book ''Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image'' by Michael Casey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/books/21kaku.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer’s Dream] by [[Michiko Kakutani]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:CheLaCoubreMarch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Che Guevara (third from left) and Fidel Castro (far left) marching to Colón Cemetery.]]
On March 4, 1960, the French freighter [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'']] suspiciously exploded in [[Havana Harbor]], killing up to 100 people and injuring several hundred more.&lt;ref name="JLA442"&gt;''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', by [[Jon Lee Anderson]], 1997, pg 442&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the blast, Guevara rushed to the harbor to board the burning ship, angrily forcing his way past those concerned for his safety following a secondary explosion.&lt;ref name="JLA442" /&gt;

The following day on March 5, President [[Fidel Castro]] blamed the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and called for a memorial service and mass demonstration at Havana's [[Colon Cemetery, Havana|Colón Cemetery]], to honor the victims.&lt;ref name="JLA442" /&gt; At the time, Guevara was Minister of Industry in the new government, and Korda was Castro's official photographer. After a funeral march along the seafront boulevard known as [[Malecón, Havana|Malecón]], Fidel Castro gave a eulogy for the fallen at a stage on 23rd street.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit"&gt;[http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2001-Caribbean-Vol-2/Obit:_Alberto_Korda_(Times_of_London) Obit: Alberto Korda] [[The Times]], May 28, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Castro gave a fiery speech, using the words ''"Patria o Muerte"'' ("Homeland or Death") for the first time.&lt;ref name="LAHT50" /&gt;  Meanwhile, at 11:20&amp;nbsp;am, Guevara came into view for a few seconds. Korda snapped just two frames of him from a distance of about {{Convert|25|–|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} before he disappeared from sight.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit" /&gt; Korda immediately realised his photograph had the attributes of a portrait.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20071007/ai_n21035836 |title=''The Making of an Icon: Forty Years'', Sunday Herald, Oct 7 2007 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= October 7, 2007|accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Korda said of this photograph, "I remember it as if it were today … seeing him framed in the viewfinder, with that expression. I am still startled by the impact … it shakes me so powerfully".&lt;ref name="va" /&gt;

[[File:KordaFilmRollChe.jpg|250px|thumb|Korda's film contact sheet. ''Guerrillero Heroico'' appears on the fourth row down, third picture over (shot horizontally).]]
[[File:KordaFilmRollChe detail.jpg|250px|thumb|The two photographs of Che from Korda's film.]]
During the rally, Korda took pictures of Cuban dignitaries and famous French [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], both admirers of Guevara at the time. Included in the film roll were shots of all the speakers and two pictures of Che's brief appearance. The classic picture appears on frame number 40 shot horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emiliobrizzi.blogspot.com/2007/02/el-guerrillero-heroico-1960.html "El Guerrillero Heroico (1960)"] by Emilio Brizzi, On Photography And More, February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The first photograph had Guevara framed alone between the silhouette of [[Jorge Masetti]] and a palm tree; the second with someone's head appearing above his shoulder. The first picture, with the intruding material cropped out and the image rotated slightly, became Guevara's most famous portrait. The editor of ''Revolución'' where Korda worked, decided to use only his shots of Castro, Sartre, and Beauvoir, while sending the Che shot back to Korda. Believing the image was powerful, Korda made a cropped version for himself, which he enlarged and hung on his wall next to a portrait of the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]],&lt;ref name="LAHT50"&gt;[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=353283&amp;CategoryId=14510 Iconic Photo of Che Guevara Now Half a Century Old] by the ''[[Latin American Herald Tribune]]'', March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and also gave copies to some others as a gift. It was not until 1986 that José Figueroa, an established photographer in his own right who printed for Korda and was his unofficially "adopted" son, suggested they try printing the full frame version of the portrait. Korda continued to print both versions of the image up until his death.&lt;ref name="introduction2005"&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/exhibitions/che/essay_002.htm Introduction: Korda's Che Moves Out into the World] by Trisha Ziff, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leica M2 Summicron 35.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Leica M2]]

To take the photograph, Korda used a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] [[Leica M2|M2]] with a 90&amp;nbsp;mm lens, loaded with [[Kodak]] [[Kodak Plus-X|Plus-X]] pan film. In speaking about the method, Korda remarked that "this photograph is not the product of knowledge or technique. It was really coincidence, pure luck."&lt;ref name="ArtH"&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/photography/Alberto-Korda.html Alberto Korda at The Art History Archive] by Brandi Leigh, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alberto Korda ==

As a lifelong [[communist]] and supporter of the [[Cuban Revolution]] until his death, [[Alberto Korda]] claimed no payment for his picture. A modified version of the portrait through the decades was also reproduced on a range of different media, though Korda never asked for [[royalties]]. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. Korda's refusal to seek royalties for the vast circulation of his photograph "helped it become the ultimate symbol of Marxist revolution and anti-imperialist struggle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2010/03/che-guevara-alberto-korda Cuba, 5 March 1960: Alberto Korda] by Ian K Smith, ''[[New Statesman]]'', April 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when in response to [[Smirnoff]] using Che's picture in a vodka commercial, Korda claimed his [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] (a form of [[copyright law]]) and sued advertising agency Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/07/cuba.mattwells After 40 Years and Millions of Posters, Che's Photographer Sues for Copyright] by Matt Wells, ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Lintas and Rex claimed that the image was in the [[public domain]]. The final result was an out of court settlement for USD $50,000 to Korda,&lt;ref&gt;Ariana Hernández-Reguant, Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism, Public Culture 2004 v. 16 pp. 1–30. pg 4&lt;/ref&gt; which he donated to the Cuban healthcare system, stating "if Che was still alive, he would have done the same."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=90 Cuba's Che Photographer Korda Dies in Paris] by Andrew Cawthorne, ''[[Reuters]]'', May 25, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

After the settlement, Korda reiterated that he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:

{{quote|"As a supporter of the ideals for which Che Guevara died, I am not averse to its reproduction by those who wish to propagate his memory and the cause of social justice throughout the world, but I am categorically against the exploitation of Che's image for the promotion of products such as alcohol, or for any purpose that denigrates the reputation of Che."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt; }}

== Giangiacomo Feltrinelli ==
Passed out to the occasional friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]] in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor [[Régis Debray]]. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by [[Che Guevara]]. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution he did not have to pay.

Upon his return to Italy, Feltrinelli disseminated thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later in 1967 after his October 9, 1967 execution, Che's ''Bolivian Diary'' with Korda's photograph on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, crediting the copyright to (c) Libreria Feltrinelli 1967 (in the lower left hand corner of the image) with no mention of Korda.&lt;ref name="introduction2005" /&gt; By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Alberto Korda later expounded that if Feltrinelli had paid him just one lira for each reproduction, that he would have received millions. However, Korda also expressed that he forgave him, because through his actions, the image became famous.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit" /&gt;

=== Milan 1967 ===
Feltrinelli's version of the image was used in October 1967 in [[Milan]], Italy, when spontaneous protests occurred in response to the news of Che's death. Italian photographer Giorgio Mondolfo later stated that "the first time I saw the picture by Alberto Korda, I was not even slightly interested in the author. I was only fifteen, and it was the picture that had drawn us – many for the first time – to gather in the streets, crying ''Che lives!''"&lt;ref&gt;The 150th Anniversary of Photography catalogue, an exhibition curated by Guiliana Scimè, Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Paris Match'' ===
''Guerrillero Heroico'' also appeared in the August 1967 issue of ''[[Paris Match]]''. Published only a few months before his eventual capture and execution, the issue featured a major article titled "Les Guerrilleros" by journalist Jean Lartéguy. Lartéguy wrote "At a time when Cuban revolutionaries want to create [[Vietnam War|Vietnams]] all over the world, the Americans run the risk of finding their own [[Algerian War|Algeria]] in Latin America."&lt;ref name="revolutionary19"&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended by asking "Where is Che Guevara?" The caption of the photograph read "The official photograph of Che Guevara; on his beret the star, the symbol of the Comandante."&lt;ref name="revolutionary19" /&gt; It is not known who provided the magazine with the image, and it was also not credited to Feltrinelli. However, with its wide circulation throughout Europe, and its status as an influential news journal, ''Paris Match'' could also be viewed as one of the original purveyors of the image.

=== Riots ===
During the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 Paris student riots]], which eventually shook the [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] government (but did not overthrow it), organizer [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit|"Danny The Red"]] utilized Fitzpatrick's rendition of Che during the protests. At this time, Che's image was picked up by the Dutch anarchist group [[Provo (movement)|"The Provos"]] in Amsterdam, who focused on triggering violent responses from authorities through non-violent means.

== Jim Fitzpatrick ==
[[File:FitzpatrickChe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original 1968 stylized image created by Jim Fitzpatrick.]]

In 1967, Irish artist [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] was also using Korda's image as a basis for creating his own stylized posters.  Fitzpatrick claims he received a copy of the photograph from the Dutch anarchist group "the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]]", who produced a magazine bearing the group's name. Fitzpatrick remembers that Provo magazine claimed the image originally came to Europe via [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Fitzpatrick's source of the image, then, would not have been Feltrinelli.&lt;ref name="introduction2005" /&gt;

{{quote|"The first image I did of Che was psychedelic, it looks like he is in seaweed. His hair was not hair, it was shapes that I felt gave it an extra dimension. That was the image I produced for the magazine and that was done before he died and that is the important thing about that image. At first it did not print. It was considered far too strong and revolutionary. I was very inspired by Che's trip to Bolivia. He went there with the intent to overthrow the intensely corrupt government, helped by the Americans at the time, and that's where he died. I thought he was one of the greatest men who ever lived and I still do in many ways. And when he was murdered, I decided I wanted to do something about it, so I created the poster. I felt this image had to come out, or he would not be commemorated otherwise, he would go where heroes go, which is usually into anonymity."| Jim Fitzpatrick, 2005&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info" /&gt;}}

To create the image Fitzpatrick made a paper negative on a piece of equipment called a grant. They were then printed in one color black and one color red, and he handpainted the star in yellow. Fitzpatrick "wanted the image to breed like rabbits" and hand printed thousands of images to give away to anyone for free in London, in addition to getting friends to pass them out while encouraging others to make their own versions. He printed about a hundred copies at a time to fulfill the demand of political groups in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands who began requesting the image. A batch was also sent to Spain, where they were seized by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s police.

Because of the high demand, Fitzpatrick formed a poster company called ''Two Bear Feet'' and produced a variety of posters in 1967 using the Korda image. All of them were created without copyright, because Fitzpatrick wanted them to be reproduced. One of these posters would be published in the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The best-known was printed on silver foil and was exhibited in an exhibition in London called "Viva Che" at the Arts Laboratory, curated by Peter Meyer. This show was originally to be held at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in 1968 and illustrates how fast the image moved from protest into the realm of fine art.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Fitzpatrick's desire for the photograph to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed "F" on the shoulder. It was not until the 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating "I’m a bit mischievous, so I never told anyone."&lt;ref name="webstudio.ie"&gt;Artist reveals his guerrilla tactics with iconic image’s secret mark, by Web Studio Ireland, October 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Fitzpatrick said that "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, I take a photo of it. I always have a chuckle when I see that little 'F'.

=== Meeting Guevara in Ireland ===

According to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while a teenage student at [[Gormanston College]] he worked a summer job at the Marine Hotel pub in [[Kilkee]], the remote town of his mother's birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans and ordered an Irish whiskey. Fitzpatrick immediately recognized him because of his interest in the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Knowing about the [[Irish settlement in Argentina|Irish diaspora and history in Argentina]], Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great-grandmother, Isabel, was from [[Galway]], with other family being from [[County Cork|Cork]].

Guevara's father also bore the Irish surname "[[Lynch (surname)|Lynch]]." Fitzpatrick describes Che as "curious" about Ireland "from a revolutionary point of view" and remarks that Che proclaimed his "great admiration" for the fact that, in his view, Ireland was the first country to "shake off the shackles of the British Empire".&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleksandramir.info/texts/fitzpatrick.html |title=A phone conversation between Aleksandra Mir and Jim Fitzpatrick, (Dublin), January 3, 2005 |publisher=Aleksandramir.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316155355/http://www.aleksandramir.info/texts/fitzpatrick.html |archivedate=March 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Che was stranded on an overnight flight from Moscow to [[Cuba]], and had touched down at [[Shannon Airport]], where the Soviet airline ''[[Aeroflot]]'' had a refueling base. Unable to depart because of thick fog, Che and his accompanying Cubans took the day off for an "unofficial" visit. It was this experience, according to Fitzpatrick, that gave him the impetus to follow the future actions of Che, including his ill-fated mission to Bolivia.&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info" /&gt;

In December 2008, Jim Fitzpatrick, along with local historian Anne Holliday and the [[Shannon Development]], announced plans to commemorate Guevara's visit to Ireland, and specifically his time spent in [[Limerick]]. Early plans are focused on an exhibition of Guevara's visit at the City Museum, followed by the creation of a "permanent mark" symbolizing his time spent at Hanratty Hotel's – White House pub in [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannonside]]. Fitzpatrick defended the move by remarking "we want to commemorate the fact Che Guevara spent some very important hours of his life here … this probably was Che's last hurrah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limerickleader.ie/features/Marking-Che-Guevaras-Limerick-link.4763656.jp Marking Che Guevara's Limerick Link] ''Limerick Leader'', December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinn Féin]] president [[Gerry Adams]] is interviewed in the 2008 documentary ''Chevolution'' about the famous photograph. As he speaks, the film shows a montage of Che murals in [[Belfast]], with Adams remarking "I suppose people from my background were drawn to that image, because of what Che Guevara represented."&lt;ref name="IrishC" /&gt;

== Cuba ==
[[File:SculptureCheGuevaraCuba.jpg|thumb|right|Plaza de la Revolución – in Havana, Cuba]]

Cuban historian Edmundo Desnoes has stated that "Che's image may be cast aside, bought and sold and deified, but it will form a part of the universal system of the revolutionary struggle, and can recover its original meaning at any moment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q-news.com/367-ShaykhChe.html "Shaykh Che Guevara"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507121101/http://www.q-news.com/367-ShaykhChe.html |date=2008-05-07 }} Q-News, July 2006, Issue 367, pg 80&lt;/ref&gt; That meaning's origin harkens back to when Korda's photograph was first published on April 16, 1961, in the daily Cuban newspaper ''Revolución'', advertising a noon conference during which the main speaker was "Dr. Ernesto 'Che' Guevara." The conference was disrupted however, when 1,300 CIA-supported counter-revolutionaries stormed the beaches of Cuba, in what became known as the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]]. The image was thus republished a second time advertising the newly convened conference on April 28, 1961. Because of this fact, it seems very likely that in the context of both of these publications, that Che could have seen the photograph that would later contribute to his iconic status.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first time Cubans on a large scale became familiar with the photograph, despite its earlier reproduction in ''Revolución'', was on hearing the news of Che's death. Upon the news of Che's execution, it was enlarged and draped on a banner down the five-story building of the Ministry of the Interior in the [[Plaza de la Revolución]] in [[Havana]]. This building where Che himself had formerly worked, served as a backdrop to [[Fidel Castro|Fidel's]] eulogy on October 18, 1967, publicly acknowledging the death of Che Guevara before a crowd of over a million mourners. José Gómez Fresquet, renowned Cuban poster maker and graphic artist, recalls how on hearing the news of Guevara's death, he immediately worked all night producing the poster to be used at the rally honoring him the next day. Korda had given Fresquet a copy of the portrait as a basis for the poster, which he created on red paper. This was the first privately produced ''Guerrillero Heroico'' to be created in Cuba. Since then the building has seen many versions of the image, and today a permanent steel outline, derived from the photograph, adorns the building.&lt;ref name="revolutionary19" /&gt;

== The United States and fame ==
''Guerrillero Heroico'' made its American debut in 1968 on [[New York City Subway]] billboards, when the image appeared in painted form by [[Paul Brooks Davis|Paul Davis]], for a poster advertising the February issue of [[Evergreen Review]].&lt;ref name="Ziff 2006 pg 22"&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 22&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Davis has stated that he was "inspired by Italian paintings of martyred saints and Christ", in his romanticised version of Che.&lt;ref name="Ziff 2006 pg 22" /&gt;

However, the fascination was not solely an American phenomenon. For instance, British journalist [[Richard Gott]] who met with Che Guevara several times expressed a similar view, by stating how he was "struck by his magnetic physical attraction, comparable to the aura of a rock star." In Gott's opinion "almost everyone had the same impression, and journalists were particularly susceptible."&lt;ref name="thehindu2006"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/05/stories/2006060506501100.htm The story of the iconic image of Che Guevara] by Richard Gott, ''The Hindu'', June 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in an August 8, 1960, cover story after meeting with Guevara displayed this view, by remarking that Che wore "a smile of melancholy sweetness that many women find devastating."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,869742,00.html Castro's Brain] by ''[[Time magazine]]'', August 8, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Argentina|Argentine]] journalist Julia Costenlos, recalls that in her view he was "blessed with a unique appeal, an incalculable enchantment that came completely naturally."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jun/03/art.art "Poster Boy"] by Richard Gott, The Guardian, June 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Ambassador K Gajendra Singh, posted in 1965 as a young diplomat in [[Algiers]], recalls his own similar personal encounter with meeting Guevara; describing him as "indisputably the dazzling star of the show" and compared shaking his hand at an economic seminar to "getting an autograph of a celebrity." According to Singh, Che's "charismatic presence in green olive fatigues and black beret" at the time embodied "the very best of the Hollywood and Bollywood stars all rolled into one"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=9324 A Meeting with Che Guevara] by K Gajendra Singh, Global Research, June 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Even under duress, ''[[The Times]]'' journalist Henry Brandon, who spoke with Guevara at the height of the [[Cuban missile crisis]], remarked that Che possessed a "genial charm" that "might have made [[Charles Boyer]] envious."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5062895.ece From the archive: Attack us at your peril, cocky Cuba warns US] ''Times'' Online, November 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In judging the enduring appeal of the image, Darrel Couturier, representative for Korda since 1997, has opined that it was "the image of a very dashing young man" and that in the "age of free love and flower power … the time was ripe for a figure" or "image that could represent this great diversity in thinking and behavior the world over." According to Couturier, this "age of religious revolution", matched with Guevara's premature death, "elevated him to almost [[martyrdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=156339 ‘Korda’s Che from Revolution to Icon’ travels to İstanbul] by Rumeysa Kiger, ''Today's Zaman'', October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"When you look closely, you can see that many iconic photographs are constructed in the same way; it is possible to copy the formula. Look at some of the most enduring images of our age … Like Che, they are shot from below against a light background, giving them a raised, Godlike quality. The angle of the shot is particularly crucial, as profiles have little impact and full frontals tend to flatten the features. The direction and intensity of the subject's gaze is also key. Che is looking past the camera, out to his vision. His line of vision has been much tinkered with by various artists, but it retains its passion even on a table mat or a screensaver. An image like this is about a sign: it's a shorthand. This particular one now stands for opposition to the establishment, freedom and revolution."| [[Alison Jackson]], photographer and filmmaker &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/print/200606120036 Che: The Artists View] by [[Alison Jackson]], ''[[New Statesman]]'', June 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As pop artists took to the image with glee, it evolved into a popular and heavily commercialized icon that often strayed far from Che’s hard-line [[Marxist]] message.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010" /&gt; British [[pop artist]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]] has referred to ''Guerrillero Heroico'' as "one of the great icons of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="guardian2004"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/11/features.review Just a Pretty Face?] by Sean O'Hagan, ''The Observer'', July 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  When converted into a stark black cut-out, Korda's photograph became easy, cheap, and fast to copy using the favored material and method of the 1960s: lith film and screen painting.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 42&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death in 1967, Che was already "a legend, the romantic epitome of worldwide rebellion" and in the wake of his perceived martyrdom, Korda's photograph went viral.&lt;ref name="Alook"&gt;A look at Che Guevara through the Lens of his Iconic Image, by Robert W.

[[File:Protest against corruption - Bucharest 2017 - Arcul de Triumf.jpg|thumb|[[2017–2018 Romanian protests|Romanian protests]] against government corruption in 2017]]
According to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], "the photograph enshrines Che as a mythic hero. Taken from below, the revolutionary leader with searching eyes and resolute expression becomes larger than life. A perspective that dominates the imagery of social realism, it bears an irresistible aura of authority, independence and defiance."&lt;ref name="va" /&gt; The V&amp;A Museum goes on to state that Korda's famous photograph first [[Apotheosis|deified]] Che and turned him into an [[icon]] of [[radical chic]]. Its story, a complex mesh of conflicting narratives, gave ''Guerrillero Heroico'' a life of its own, an enduring fascination independent of Che himself.&lt;ref name="va" /&gt; The Italian magazine ''Skime'' evokes even more praise, decreeing it "absolutely the most famous of history" while proclaiming that it "captures beauty and youth, courage and generosity, aesthetic and moral virtues of a person who possessed all the characteristics necessary to be converted into a symbol of an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] like ours, lacking in historic legends and mythic incarnations."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 41&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Richard Gott]] has also remarked that "the red star in Che's beret was up there with '[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]].{{' "}}&lt;ref name="thehindu2006" /&gt; Jonathan Green, director of the [[University of California Riverside|UCR]] photography museum, has remarked that "pop art is a rejection of traditional figuration, rhetoric, and rendition. Its egalitarian anti-art stance was the perfect corollary for Che's anti-establishment attitude."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzpatrick's graphic was later used in a 1968 painting attributed to [[Andy Warhol]] and sold to a gallery in Rome. The painting used the same graphic processes used on the acclaimed [[Marilyn Monroe]] pieces. However this painting was a forgery, created by [[Gerard Malanga]] who was in need of money. When Warhol heard of the fraud, he "authenticated" the fake, provided that all the money from sales went to him.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, David. ''"Warhol"''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1989 pg 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Michael Casey, in his 2009 book ''Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image'', notes how the universal image can be found "in all corners of the world" and theorizes that it arrived as a symbol of rebellion during an era when the world was aching for change.&lt;ref name="CNNCasey" /&gt; In defining Korda's photograph as a "brand" and "quintessential post-modern icon", Casey notes that somehow the photograph encapsulates "hope and beauty," which causes people around the globe to "invest their dreams in it."&lt;ref name="CNNCasey" /&gt; While David Kunzle, author of the book ''Che Guevara: Icon, Myth, and Message'', has opined that "The [[beret]] functions subliminally as a flattened [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisha Ziff, the curator of ''Che! Revolution and Commerce'' describes ''Guerrillero Heroico'' as a "statuesque image taken from below," which "derives from a visual language of mythologized heroes harking back to an era of socialist realism" while referencing "a classical Christ-like demeanor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/exhibitions/che/essay_001.htm Korda's Che Moves Out into the World] by Trisha Ziff, UCR exhibit introduction&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Lee Anderson]], author of ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', in the photograph Che appears "as the ultimate revolutionary icon" with "his eyes staring boldly into the future" and "his expression a virile embodiment of outrage at social injustice."&lt;ref name="guardian2004" /&gt;

The stylized image of Che Guevara, adapted from Korda's photograph, is commonly accompanied by several different symbols that add context to its inherent suggested meaning. The most common of these are the [[red star]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popicontees.com/prodimages/Che/J4-large.jpg |title=Che + red star |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715103751/http://www.popicontees.com/prodimages/Che/J4-large.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hammer and sickle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inter.kke.gr/PhotoAlbum/diafora/history/inter/che-hammer/ |title=Che + Hammer and Sickle |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082820/http://inter.kke.gr/PhotoAlbum/diafora/history/inter/che-hammer/ |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuban flag]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/15/cubabeisbol.jpg |title=Che + Cuban Flag |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the saying in Spanish ''"Hasta la Victoria Siempre"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liorkaridi.com/Travel/Cuba/Camaguey_2.jpg |title=Che Guevara + ''Hasta la Victoria Siempre'' |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Translation: "Towards Victory, Always"). The multi meaning phrase became the sign off for Che Guevara's numerous letters and speeches as a revolutionary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexlagman.com/jpgs/codexlagman_links_02.jpg Che Guevara monument in Santa Clara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305152404/http://www.codexlagman.com/jpgs/codexlagman_links_02.jpg |date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and represent the commitment to both never give up on the eventual triumph of a [[Marxist]] [[world revolution]], and the belief that this victory once it occurs, will be [[Permanent revolution|eternal]].

For decades the famous image was unhindered by [[international copyright agreements]], because Cuba was not a signatory to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. [[Fidel Castro]] described it as a "[[bourgeois]] concept" which meant that artists and advertisers were free to use Korda’s work as they pleased.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/03/05/che-the-birthday-of-a-revolutionary-brand/ Che: The Birthday of a Revolutionary Brand] by Michael J. Casey, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Legally, Cuban Law no. 156 signed on September 28, 1994, to amend part of Law no. 14 of the 1977 Copyright Act (Article 47), states that pictures taken in Cuba fall into the public domain worldwide, 25 years after their first use.&lt;ref&gt;''WIPO Guide to Intellectual Property Worldwide'', Issue 479 of WIPO publication, by the World Intellectual Property Organization, 2000, {{ISBN|92-805-0856-3}}, pg 144–147&lt;/ref&gt; As for the United States, since the image was first published in Cuba without compliance with U.S. [[copyright formalities]] and used in Cuba before February 20, 1972 (more than 25 years before Cuba signed the Berne Convention in 1997) it is also generally, although not universally, considered to be in the [[public domain]].

Despite conflicting claims about whether or not the image could have copyright established, Korda's children have sought to control commercial use of the image from [[defamation]]. Korda's daughter Diana Diaz pursued a 2003 lawsuit in France against a Paris-based press rights group [[Reporters Without Borders]], for using the Che photograph in a poster campaign decrying Cuba as "the world's largest jail", aimed at dissuading French tourists from vacationing in Cuba after the jailing of 29 dissident journalists.&lt;ref name="commondreams2005"&gt;Reuters,
"[http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/print.cgi?file=/headlines05/0829-01.htm Che's Family Plans to Fight Use of Famed Photo]", ''Common Dreams'', August 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In suing the group for 1.14 million [[euros]], Diaz's lawyer, Randy Yaloz remarked that "we are going after everyone who betrays the moral rights of my client".&lt;ref name="CubaN"&gt;Korda Daughter Sues RSF Over Image of Che, by ''Cuba News'', March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] are a separate component of [[copyright law]] that are not recognized in the U.S., but are recognized in some other countries, notably in France where Diaz filed the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Vaver"&gt;''Intellectual Property Rights: Critical Concepts in Law'', Volume 2, by D. Vaver, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-33089-0}}, pg 273–280&lt;/ref&gt; Moral rights aim to protect the integrity of a work from defamation, distortion, slander, or offensive mutilation, even if the originator no longer owns the copyright.&lt;ref name="Vaver" /&gt; However, Reporters Without Borders stopped using the image before any legal judgment was rendered.&lt;ref name="CubaN" /&gt;

Ariana Hernández-Reguant addressed the image's copyright status in 2004 in her article ''Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism''. She expressed a skeptical view towards Korda's heirs being able to establish ownership over the image, noting in reference to the lawsuits involving the image, "There was never any official ruling on whether the depiction constituted a violation of copyright." The author goes on to state that: "Korda took the picture while working for a state-run newspaper, his actual property rights would be questionable under both Cuban and international law."&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez-Reguant, Ariana. "Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism". ''Public Culture'' – Volume 16, Number 1, Winter 2004, pp. 1–29, – pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, law student Sarah Levy also addressed the potential legal status of the image in Cuba. It was her ultimate contention that "in Cuba the copyright protection in Korda's Guevara photograph would have already expired, and despite the claims of ownership from Korda's heirs, the State would now hold any rights associated with the photograph."&lt;ref name="revolution2007"&gt;''"A Copyright Revolution: Protecting the Famous Photograph of Che Guevara"'', by Sarah Levy, 13 Law and Business Review of the Americas, Am. 687. Summer of 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the more commonly disseminated stylized version of the photograph, lawyers say it will be an uphill struggle to deter non-photographic use of such a widely reproduced image, other than in countries like Italy where laws protect image rights.&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt;

Guevara's heirs also believe they have legal justification to prevent the image's "exploitation" or [[slander]]. Guevara's Cuban widow Aleida March stated in 2005 that "We have a plan to deal with the misuse. We can't attack everyone with lances like Don Quixote, but we can try to maintain the ethics of Guevara's legacy."&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt; In reference to this pronouncement, Guevara's daughter [[Aleida Guevara]] told [[Reuters]], "It will be costly and difficult because each country has different laws, but a limit has to be drawn."&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt; However, the family has not yet mounted any court challenges, and no determination of legal copyright internationally has been established.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5717">{{other people||Henry Willoughby (disambiguation)}}
'''Henry Willobie''' (or '''Willoughby''') (1575? – 1596?) is the ostensible author of a 1594 verse novella called ''[[Willobie His Avisa]]'' (in modern spelling, ''Willoughby's Avisa''), a work that is of interest primarily because of its possible connection with [[William Shakespeare]]'s life and writings.

== Life and work ==
Henry Willobie was the second son of a [[Wiltshire]] gentleman of the same name. He [[Matriculation|matriculated]] from [[St John's College, Oxford]] in December 1591 at the age of sixteen, and is probably the same Henry Willobie who graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Exeter College, Oxford]] early in 1595. He published ''Willobie his Avisa'' in 1594.

Willobie may have died before 30 June 1596, when a new edition of ''Willobie his Avisa'' was published with the addition of an "Apologie" by Hadrian Dorrell, a friend of the author, which describes him as "now of late gone to God." Dorrell alleges that he found the manuscript of ''Willobie his Avisa'' among his friend's papers, which were left in his charge when Willobie departed from Oxford on Her Majesty's service. There is no trace of any Hadrian Dorrell in the historical record, and the name may be a pseudonym, perhaps even for Willobie himself.

Several authors have suggested that Willobie was not the real author of the poem. Arthur Acheson suggested that [[Matthew Roydon]] may have been the author, arguing that the poem obliquely described Shakespeare's relationship to Jane Davenant, the mother of [[William Davenant]], who later hinted that he was Shakespeare's son. Roydon's authorship was later tentatively endorsed by G. B. Harrison,&lt;ref name = "GGG"&gt;G. B. Harrison, ''Willobie His Avisa'', 1594, ed, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1966, pp.226—29.&lt;/ref&gt; and reasserted by [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Christopher, ''Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution'' (1965), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; M. C. Bradbrook argued that it was a collaborative work written by [[Walter Raleigh]]'s circle, the so-called [[School of Night]], with which Roydon was associated.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Bradbrook, ''The School of Night: A Study in the Literary Relationships of Sir Walter Raleigh'', Russell &amp; Russell, 1965, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Willobie his Avisa'' proved extremely popular, and passed through numerous editions. In 1596 a writer called Peter Colse produced an imitation named ''Penelope's Complaint''.

== Connection with Shakespeare ==
{{main|Willobie His Avisa}}
''Willobie his Avisa'' was licensed for the press by printer [[John Windet]] on 3 September 1594. In the printed text, the poem is preceded by two [[commendatory poem]]s, the second of which, signed "Contraria Contrariis; Vigilantius; Dormitanus," contains a reference to Shakespeare's poem ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', published four months previously:

:"Yet Tarquyne pluckt his glistering grape,
:And Shake-speare paints poore Lucrece rape."

This is the earliest known printed allusion to Shakespeare by name (aside from the title pages of ''Venus and Adonis'' and ''Lucrece'').

The poem itself concerns a female character, Avisa (whose name is explained in Dorrell's "Epistle to the Reader" as an [[acronym]] for ''Amans Uxor Inviolata Semper Amanda''). Avisa tells a story alternately with her suitors, one of whom is introduced to the reader in a prose interlude signed by the author as "Henrico Willobego Italo Hispalensis". This passage contains a reference which may be to Shakespeare. It runs as follows ('H.W.' refers to Willobie, and 'A' to Avisa):

:"H. W. being suddenly infected with the contagion of a fantastical fit, at the first sight of A, ... bewrayeth the secresy of his disease unto his familiar frend W. S., who not long before had tried the courtesy of the like passion, and was now newly recovered ... he determined to see whether it would sort to a happier end for this new actor, than it did for the old player." (spelling modernized)

Then follows a dialogue between H. W. and W. S., in which the latter gives somewhat commonplace advice to the disconsolate wooer.

The use of the word "actor" and "player" in connection with the initials 'W.S.' is suggestive that the latter may refer to Shakespeare. If so, and if the poem is autobiographical, it implies that Willobie was in love with a woman who had been previously involved with Shakespeare.

The '''Musée de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire''' or '''IFAN Museum of African Arts''' in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] is one of the oldest art museums in [[West Africa]]. It was promoted by [[Léopold Senghor]], the country's first President. In December 2007, its official title was changed to '''The Théodore Monod African Art Museum''' ("Musée Théodore Monod d'Art africain"), after the French naturalist [[Théodore André Monod]], former director of IFAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausenegal.com/+Le-musee-de-l-IFAN-change-de+.html Le musée de l’IFAN change de dénomination, ausenegal.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218020238/http://www.ausenegal.com/+Le-musee-de-l-IFAN-change-de+.html |date=2008-02-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously its official name had been "''Le Musée d'Art africain de l'Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire Cheikh Anta Diop IFAN/CAD''".

The museum is part of the [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN) institute, founded 1936  under the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government in France. When IFAN was transferred to [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in 1960, the building at Place Soweto near the [[National Assembly of Senegal]] was converted into a museum. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture and part of the [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]].  As the main cultural research center of the colonies of [[French West Africa]], it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa.

The museum is one of the regular locations used in the [[Dakar Biennale]] exhibition, showing art by contemporary African and diaspora artists.&lt;ref&gt;''Assembling Africa — Dak'art 96 biennial art festival, various artists, various venues, Dakar, Senegal'', in Art in America, May 1997 accessed at [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v85/ai_19385178] March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dak'Art 2006: positions and perspectives'', in African Arts, Winter 2006 accessed at [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0438/is_4_39/ai_n17094470/pg_10] March 2, 2007&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.osiris.sn/article2324.html  DAK’ART 2006 - Yacouba Konaté, Commissaire général de la Biennale de l’art africain contemporain : « L’art numérique n’est pas décalé, mais le public a le droit d’être un peu surpris »], Babacar DIOP : Le Quotidien, 5 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13970">'''Intellectual rights to magic methods''' refers to the legal and ethical debate about the extent to which [[Property|proprietary]] or [[exclusive right]]s may subsist in the methods or processes by which [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks or illusions are performed. It is a subject of some controversy. 

On one side, many magicians argue that methods represent "[[intellectual property]]" and that publication or sharing of methods should be subject to strict codes developed by magicians' organizations. On the other side, a range of people argue that publication of information about methods should not be subject to restrictions because knowledge should be freely available. The sharing of magic methods with non-magicians or the open publication of methods is referred to in the magic community as "[[Exposure (magic)|exposure]]" and many magicians react angrily to it. 

While many magic tricks rely on traditional methods, there is also a continuing development and progress within the genre. Those who are performers and amateurs tend to take a very defensive stance against all "[[Exposure (magic)|exposure]]", while those who are creators and originators tend to care more about recent works – works with living and identifiable creators.

==Possible legal protection==
There are a number of areas of law that might provide a basis for magicians to claim ownership of certain pieces of knowledge and to prevent exposure. [[Copyright]], [[patent]], [[trade secret]] and [[trademark]] law, are the primary sources of legal protection at issue on the topic. Each type of protection has its own limitations and loopholes. 

===Copyright===
Under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], member states are free to prescribe in their national legislation that copyright is automatically granted to a work only when it is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium. In the U.S., [[United States Copyright Law|copyright law]] only protects works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Accordingly, some argue, the processes or movements required for a trick are not copyrightable within the U.S, but recordings, written descriptions, or photographs of such a performance may be copyrightable themselves.

The [[idea–expression dichotomy]] specifies that mere ideas are not entitled to copyright; only the expression of those ideas are granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright.

Another potential area of copyright protection for magic creators is through a choreography or pantomime copyright. This was successfully employed by Teller in 2014 in a case against Belgian entertainer Gerard Dogge, who had posted a YouTube video of an illusion called The Rose &amp; Her Shadow.&lt;ref name="tellercase"/&gt;

Magic illusion inventor and magician Hessel Bos also registered a magic trick as a copyright with the United States Copyright Office (registration is not essential for copyright protection but it offers additional advantages for rights holders). Bos registered his tricks by describing every movement of the magic tricks via text and photographs and then submitted these documents to the copyright office. They were approved under the Performance Art section and a certificate of registration was granted. In September 2008 Bos successfully filed a complaint under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] against America Online to remove a video from their website.

=== Patents ===
An [[invention]] or process which facilitates the performance of a magic trick is potentially [[patentability|patentable]] in the U.S. However, applying for patent protection requires the public release of information about how the device or process works. Furthermore, when a patent is obtained, it can only be used to prevent a third party from making or using the subject matter of the patent. This prevents other magicians from performing the trick but cannot be used to prevent anyone from revealing how the trick works.

Notably, in 1938, [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] was sued by magician [[Horace Goldin]] over an ad campaign which revealed one method for a ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]'' trick.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (D.N.Y. 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually dismissed by a federal court and Goldin then gave up on patenting his methods.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web

===Trade secret and contract law===
Magic methods are effectively forms of [[trade secret]] and share many characteristics of trade secrets in other business sectors. As such there is a significant body of law that falls under the headings of "[[confidentiality]]" and "[[contract law]]" that might be used to control or protect them. These measures can effectively allow a perpetual monopoly in secret information – i.e. it does not expire as would a patent or copyright.

A company or individual can protect their confidential information through non-disclosure contracts with employees or business associates.  A magician might therefore ask a partner or fellow magician to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] before sharing magic methods. That contract could then be enforced through the courts. The terms of such contracts might be subject to constraints of employment law (for example including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic and time scope). As with law generally, there will be variations across jurisdictions. 

Information which a magician has intentionally kept confidential and which is not in the [[public domain]] may also be deemed to have a legally enforceable quality of [[Trade secret#Legal development to protecting trade secrets|confidentiality]]. The exact legal definitions of circumstances in which such protection applies vary across jurisdictions, as do the remedies available.

==Court cases==
{{globalize/US|section|date=November 2017}}
Court cases provide the ultimate test for any of the possible rights outlined above and, indeed, often establish law in the form of [[case law]]. There have been a number of court cases in which magicians have sought to assert rights to magic methods and prevent publications or broadcasts. These include:

* '''1920s–1930s:'''  [[Horace Goldin]] was involved in many legal actions related to the ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]'' illusion, including a successful unfair competition claim in 1922 against the makers of a film that exposed the method,&lt;ref&gt;''Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays'', New York (Dec 1922), referenced in [https://web.archive.org/web/20151104073050/http://www.jstor.org/stable/789035 |The Yale Law Journal], Vol. 32, No. 2, p.201, and also in [http://www.cap-press.com/pdf/1605.pdf ''Advanced Torts: Cases and materials''], (Law Casebook Series), Carolina Academic Press, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and an unsuccessful unfair competition claim in 1938 against the [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] for exposing the secret in an advertisement for cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (SDNY 1938).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter case was dismissed because Goldin's 1923 patent on the illusion revealed its mechanism to the public.
* '''1943:''' Charles "Think-a-Drink" Hoffman sued Maurice Glazer for violation of his copyright and trademark rights in his "Think-a-Drink" act. The Supreme Court of Florida upheld the trademark decision for Hoffman, but held that Hoffman's act was not "dramatic" enough to qualify for Copyright Protection under the 1909 definition.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer v. Hoffman, 153 Fla. 809 (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1947:''' The Harold Lloyd Corporation sued Universal Pictures Company for copyright violation of its film "Movie Crazy." In the infringed scenes, the protagonist accidentally puts on a magician's coat and he is plagued by a series of bewildering magic effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10760655899099210600&amp;q=162+f.2d+354&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002 Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corporation, 162 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1947)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1998:''' Joseph Harrison and a number of other magicians filed an unsuccessful class-action lawsuit against SF broadcasting and Fox Broadcasting for exposing the secrets to a number of illusions on their [[Masked Magician]] special.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison v. SF Broadcasting. No. Civ. A. 98–1107. 1998 WL 355462 (E.D. La. Jun. 30, 1998). Chief Judge Sear stated, "I recognize that Plaintiffs' Petition seeks to redress the betrayal of the honor code among magicians, but such redress is not available here because no legal rights have been violated." &lt;/ref&gt; They sought relief for violation of the magicians' honor code under Louisiana's abuse of rights doctrine, but were denied because the doctrine only applies to contracts and property.
* '''1998:''' [[André Kole]] tried to sue the makers of the ''[[Masked Magician]]'' television specials to prevent exposure of the ''[[Table of Death]]'' trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Codes of practice==
The most effective protection against the public exposure of magic methods may be a matter of [[ethics]] or peer pressure. One of the largest societies of magicians in the world, the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]], has a [[Ethical code|Code of Ethics]] which states:
:''All members of the International Brotherhood of Magicians agree to oppose the willful exposure to the public of any principles of the Art of Magic, or the methods employed in any magic effect or illusion.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.magician.org/CodeOfEthics.htm 
 |title=The International Brotherhood of Magicians (anti-exposure) code of ethics 
 |accessdate=2007-03-12

 |archivedate=2007-03-10 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood advises that any individual who is a professional or amateur magician should be aware that "exposing" the methods of an illusion may result in damage to their relations among other magicians.

However, such codes don't extend to selling magic, though magicians consider{{Who|date=January 2010}} the seller of a magic trick should prove that the purchaser intends to learn and perform the trick for others, thereby becoming a magician, rather than simply wanting to know how a magic trick is done out of curiosity.

'''Irma Stern''' (1894, [[Schweizer-Reneke]], [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] – 23 August 1966, [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]) was a major South African artist who achieved national and international recognition in her lifetime.

== Life ==
She was born in Schweizer-Reneke, a small town in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], of German-Jewish parents. Her father was interned in a concentration camp by the British during the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] because of his pro-[[Boer]] leanings.[1] Irma and her younger brother, Rudi, were thus taken to Cape Town by their mother. After the war, the family returned to Germany and constant travel. This travel would influence Irma's work.

In 1913 Stern studied art in Germany at the [[Weimar Academy]], in 1914 at the Levin-Funcke Studio and notably from 1917 with [[Max Pechstein]], a founder of the Novembergruppe. Stern was associated with the German Expressionist painters of this period. She held her first exhibition in Berlin in 1919. In 1920 Stern returned to Cape Town with her family where she was first derided and dismissed as an artist before becoming an established artist by the 1940s.

In 1926 she married Dr Johannes Prinz, her former tutor, who subsequently became professor of German at the University of Cape Town. They were divorced in 1934.

Irma Stern travelled extensively in Europe and explored Southern Africa, [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Congo region]]. These trips provided a wide range of subject matter for her paintings and gave her opportunities to acquire and assemble a collection of artifacts. Stern's dream was to travel extensively in her lifetime: in 1930 to Madeira, in 1937 and 1938 to Dakar, Senegal, 1939 Zanzibar, 1942 Congo, 1945 Zanzibar, 1946 Central Africa, 1952 Madeira, 1955 Congo, 1960 Spain and 1963 France. Stern travelled extensively in South Africa, for example in 1926 to [[Swaziland]] and [[Pondoland]], in 1933 to [[Namaqualand]], in 1936 generally, and in 1941 to the Eastern Cape. In 1931 she visited [[Madeira]] and [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], in 1937 and 1938. Irma Stern refused to either travel or exhibit in [[Germany]] during the period 1933 - 1945. Instead, she undertook several journeys into Africa; going to [[Zanzibar]] twice in 1939 and 1945 and then planned three trips to the [[Congo region]] in 1942, 1946 and 1955. These expeditions resulted in a wealth of artistic creativity and energy as well as the publication of two illustrated journals; ''Congo'' published in 1943 and ''Zanzibar'' in 1948.

Almost one hundred solo exhibitions were held during her lifetime both in South Africa and Europe: including Germany, France, Italy and England. Although accepted in Europe, her work was unappreciated at first in South Africa where critics derided her early exhibitionsin the 1920s with reviews titled "Art of Miss Irma Stern - Ugliness as a cult".

The Irma Stern Museum was established in 1971 and is the house the artist lived in for almost four decades. She moved into ''The Firs'' in [[Rondebosch]] in 1927 and lived there until her death. Several of the rooms are furnished as she arranged them while upstairs there is a commercial gallery used by contemporary South African artists.

On 8 May 2000, one of her works sold at Sotheby’s South Africa in Johannesburg for an all-time record of  R1.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vgallery.co.za/99stern/vzine.htm Irma Stern at V Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; This record was soon broken, however, and in March 2007 Stern's work was sold for R6.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artthrob.co.za/07mar/news/auction.html Auction action in Cape Town]&lt;/ref&gt; Stern's Gladioli was sold for an all-time high of R13.3 million in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/article704000.ece/Irma-Stern-work-sells-for-record-R13.3m Irma Stern work sells for record R13.3m]&lt;/ref&gt; but was then followed by the sale of Bahora Girl for R26.7 million later that month&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.timeslive.co.za/minor/2010/10/28/new-irma-stern-record/ New Irma Stern record]&lt;/ref&gt; - both were also records for sales of South African art at the time. A new South African record was set in March 2011, when a Stern painting sold for R34 million at Bonham's, London.

On 11 November 2012, Stern’s painting, Fishing Boats, was stolen along with four other paintings from a museum in Pretoria. A tip-off led South African police to a cemetery in Port Elizabeth where four of the five paintings were recovered from under a bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''''Lake with Dead Trees''''', also known as '''''Catskill''''', is an oil on canvas painting completed in 1825 by [[Thomas Cole]]. Depicting a scene in the [[Catskill Mountains]] in southeastern New York State, this work is one of five of Cole's 1825 landscapes to found the mid-19th century American art movement known as the [[Hudson River School]].

==Artist's Background==
Tom Christopher wrote that “[Thomas] Cole’s greatest artistic asset proved to be his untutored eye.”&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cole emigrated to [[America]] with his family in the spring of 1819 at the age of eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, ''The Life and Works of Thomas Cole'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, his surroundings were of [[Lancashire]], [[England]], an area known to be an epicenter of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]’s primarily industrial region.  Because of this, Cole was granted an additional clarity of and sensitivity to the vibrancy of American landscapes awash with color, a stark contrast to the bleak and subdued landscapes of the country he left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Great Northern Catskills of Greene County. “Hudson River School of Art,” 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==''Lake with Dead Trees'' and The Hudson River School==
When Cole emerged from the Catskill mountains in 1825, not only would he bring with him some of the first renderings of the Catskills in his first five landscape paintings, but in those paintings, he brought a new style of art.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Accessed October 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This style would come to be known as the [[Hudson River School]], a style that would sweep across the United States in celebration of one of America’s most prized attributes, our natural resources and wildernesses.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum, [[H. Barbara Weinberg]] described the style as, “[[Plantation era|Antebellum]] encounters with barely tamed nature, lovingly recorded in meticulous botanical detail and overwhelming in scale in comparison with those who enjoy its pleasures…”.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, “Late-Nineteenth-Century American Painting” 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial value==
Among those five paintings, the first of their kind, stands ''Lake with Dead Trees''. The oil on canvas painting was sold originally for twenty-five dollars in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Allowing for 191 years of inflation, the sum’s equivalent would now be $537.86.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman. “The Inflation Calculator”.&lt;/ref&gt;  While that was considered a respectable price and sale at the time, another work by [[Thomas Cole]], ''[[Part of the Ruins of Kenilworth Castle]]'', was recently put up to be auctioned with an appraisal of the painting estimated to be $200,000 to $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Invaluable. “Thomas Cole Auction Price Results”. &lt;/ref&gt;  A style that began nearly two hundred years ago is still viable and commercially successful. Currently, the original resides at the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]] of [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], as it has since its donation in 1904 by [[Charles F. Olney]].&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual Analysis and Composition==
Simply named, ''Lake with Dead Trees'' exemplifies the typical stylistic traits of the [[Hudson River School]] art movement. The viewer’s eye is drawn first to the stand of snags foremost, which is highlighted starkly by warm morning light. They are skeletal, stripped of leaves, of bark, of any branch that would not bend. They embody death and they are surrounded by life. 

The trees are twisted splintering apart at the core as if by some great ravaging storm. The exposed raw wood shines sun-bleached in shades of pale yellow, white, and gray, the only darker pigments used to define shadows cast by light from the upper right side of the painting. Following vibrant trees along the lakeside, and along the bottom of the painting, there is further evidence of a great storm; downed and fallen trees lie by ample water, sunlight, and nutrient rich soil, conditions in which the surrounding trees thrive. 

The 27 x 33 3/4 in. dimensions of ''Lake with Dead Trees'' make it reminiscent of a picture window offering a portal to the Catskill mountains in southeastern [[New York State]]. The painting does not present a specific moment in time, rather it exists. It seems to indicate that within the delicate balance of beauty and life, there is also a strength that will slowly rise and reclaim where ruin has set foot. 

As the viewer’s gaze sweeps from the bottom left of the painting, a scene of destruction evokes emotions of loss and regret. Moving up to the right side of the painting and across the sky, sentiments shift with the change in light. From left to right, the sky clears from a ruminating storm to the respite of a clearing sky. On the left of the painting, the dead trees are prominent, as evident by their size and proximity. As the scene moves right, the dead trees become smaller; they decrease in importance, fade, and give way to living trees and new life. 

Each of these transitions, from left to right, are smooth, natural motions across realistic spectrums of extremes, until the viewer’s eye is caught and disrupted by the two deer crossing the painting. Captured in the pristine and graceful scene, the deer appeared overly poised, lacking the fluidity found elsewhere. In 1825, an unnamed contemporary viewer noted Cole might easily have omitted the two deer, as they “detracted from [the] foreground.”&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Influence==
The introduction of Thomas Cole’s works at the emergence of the Hudson River School style, gave voice to conservation, an idea that was just beginning to develop. It was at nearly the same time that ''Lake with Dead Trees'' was sold, as were the other four paintings, and Thomas Cole’s name was starting to become familiar as a noteworthy artist, that the [[Erie Canal]] officially opened across upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of this major transportation system, second worldwide only to the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in [[China]], swept the nation up in a surge of patriotism and celebration of the innovations of this great country. In this outpouring of nationalism, Thomas Cole was wholeheartedly embraced and became championed as the "American Adam of landscape painting.”&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole is considered to be one of the pioneers of American environmentalism, for his concern for the impending destruction by “Copper-hearted barbarians … pushing a railroad up through his valley to exploit its natural resources – through mining, quarrying, and logging” and in his effort to inform the public, Thomas Cole’s labors are among those that motivated the creation of the [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catskill Park]] was established in 1904 to protect thousands of acres, incredible vistas, and mountain ranges including thirty-three [[Catskill’s high peaks]], a natural inheritance that will remain forever wild, an event that without Thomas Cole, and ''Lake with Dead Trees'', likely would not have transpired.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, '''late modernism''' encompasses the overall production of most recent art made between the aftermath of World War II and the early years of the 21st century. The terminology often points to similarities between late modernism and post-modernism although there are differences. The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is [[contemporary art]]. Not all art labelled as contemporary art is modernist or post-modern, and the broader term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modern and late modernist traditions, as well as artists who reject modernism for post-modernism or other reasons. [[Arthur Danto]] argues explicitly in ''After the End of Art'' that contemporaneity was the broader term, and that postmodern objects represent a subsector of the contemporary movement which replaced modernity and modernism, while other notable critics: [[Hilton Kramer]],&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp. 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Kirk Varnedoe]],&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe - Passages'', critical essay, [[Artforum]], Nov. 2003 by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others have argued that postmodern objects are at best relative to modernist works.

The jargon which encompasses the two terms ''late modernism'' and ''[[postmodern art]]'' is used to denote what may be considered as the ultimate phase of [[modern art]], as art at the end of [[modernism]] or as certain tendencies of [[contemporary art]].

There are those who argue against a division into modern and [[postmodern]] periods. Not all critics agree that the stage called modernism is over or even near the end. There is no agreement that all art after modernism is post-modern. [[Contemporary art]] is the more-widely used term to denote work since roughly 1960, though it has many other uses as well. Nor is post-modern art universally separated from modernism, with many critics seeing it as merely another phase in [[modern art]] or as another form of late [[modernism]].

As with all uses of the term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt; This is not to say that the phase of art denoted by post-modernism is accepted, merely that the need for a term to describe movements in art after the peak of [[abstract expressionism]] is well established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.

In literature, the term '''late modernism''' refers to works of literature produced after World War II. However, several different definitions of late modernist literature exist. The most common refers to works published between 1930 and 1939, or 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hindrichs, "Late Modernism, 1928–1945: Criticism and Theory" ''Literature Compass'', Volume 8, Issue 11, pages 840–855, November 2011;  J. H. Dettmar "Modernism". David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are modernists, such as [[Basil Bunting]] (1900–85) and [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888-1965), writing later than 1945, and [[Samuel Beckett]], who died in 1989, has been described as a "later modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot published two plays in the 1950s and Bunting's long modernist poem "[[Briggflatts]]" was published in 1965. The poets [[Charles Olson]] (1910-1970) and [[J. H. Prynne]] (1936- ) are, amongst other writing in the second half of the 20th century, who have been described as late modernists.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books.&lt;/ref&gt; There is the further question as to whether late modernist literature differs in any important way from the modernist works produced before 1930. To confuse matters, more recently the term late modernism has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of [[World War II]], especially the [[Holocaust]] and the dropping of the atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from postmodernism==
Late modernism describes movements which both arise from, and react against, trends in [[modernism]] and reject some aspect of modernism, while fully developing the conceptual potentiality of the modernist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171&lt;/ref&gt; In some descriptions post-modernism as a period in art is completed, whereas in others it is a continuing movement in [[contemporary art]]. In art, the specific traits of modernism which are cited are generally formal purity, [[medium specificity]], [[art for art's sake]], the possibility of [[authenticity in art]], the importance or even possibility of universal truth in art, and the importance of an avant-garde and originality. This last point is one of particular controversy in art, where many institutions argue that being visionary, forward looking, cutting edge and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present, and that postmodern therefore, represents a contradiction of the value of "art of our times".

One compact definition offered is that while post-modernism acts in rejection of modernism's grand narratives of artistic direction, and to eradicate the boundaries between high and low forms of art, to disrupt genre and its conventions with collision, collage and fragmentation. Post-modern art is seen as believing that all stances are unstable and insincere, and therefore irony, parody and humor are the only positions which cannot be overturned by critique or later events.

Many of these traits are present in modern movements in art, particularly the rejection of the separation between high and low forms of art. However, these traits are considered fundamental to post-modern art, as opposed to merely present in one degree or another. One of the most important points of difference, however, between post-modernism, and modernism, as movements in art, is modernism's ultimately progressive stance that new works be more "forward looking" and advanced, whereas post-modern movements generally reject the notion that there can be advancement or progress in art per se, and thus one of the projects of art must be the overturning of the "myth of the [[avant-garde]]". This relates to the negation of what post-structuralist philosophers call "[[metanarratives]]".

[[Rosalind Krauss]] was one of the important annunciators of the view that avant-gardism was over, and that the new artistic era existed in a post-liberal and post-progress normalcy.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171, Part II, ''Toward Post-Modernism'', pp. 196-291.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this viewpoint is explained by [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] in ''The Shock of the New''&lt;ref&gt;''The Shock of the New'' [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], Publisher: Knopf; Revised edition (August 13, 1991),&lt;/ref&gt; in his chapter "The Future That Was":

{{Quote|
Where did this new academy begin? At its origins the ''avant-garde'' myth had held the artist to be a precursor; the significant work is the one that prepares the future. The cult of the precursor ended by cluttering the landscape with absurd prophetic claims. The idea of a cultural ''avant-garde'' was unimaginable before 1800. It was fostered by the rise of [[liberalism]]. Where the taste of religious or secular courts determined patronage, "subversive" innovation was not esteemed as a sign of artistic quality. Nor was the artist's autonomy, that would come with the [[Romanticism|Romantics]].

As with all uses of the term postmodern there are critics of its application. [[Kirk Varnedoe]], for instance, stated that there is no such thing as postmodernism, and that the possibilities of modernism have not yet been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, p. 4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics are currently in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt;

[[Hilton Kramer]] describes postmodernism as "a creation of modernism at the end of its tether".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oliver Bennett, ''Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern World'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p. 131. {{ISBN|0-7486-0936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in [[Frederic Jameson]]'s analysis, does not hold that there is a postmodern stage radically different from the period of [[high modernism]]; instead, postmodern discontent with this or that high modernist style is part of the experimentation of high modernism, giving birth to new modernisms.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Jameson, ''Foreword'' to Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Condition'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pxvi. {{ISBN|0-7190-1450-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical movements in modern art ==

Radical movements in Modernism, Modern art, and radical trends regarded as influential and potentially as precursors to late modernism and postmodernism emerged around World War I and particularly in its aftermath. With the introduction of the use of industrial artifacts in art, movements such as [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] as well as techniques such as [[collage]] and artforms such as cinema and the rise of [[reproduction]] as a means of creating artworks. Both [[Pablo Picasso]] the [[Modernist]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] the rebel created important and influential works from [[found objects]].

===Fauvism, cubism, dada, surrealism as the precedent===
{{main|Fauvism|Cubism|Dada|Surrealism}}

[[File:Matissedance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[The Dance (second version)]]'', 1909 [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]]]
In the early 20th century, following [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]'s impact as Fauvist painters and [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]'s monumental innovations and the worldwide success of [[Cubism]] and the emboldening of the [[avant-garde]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] exhibited a urinal as a sculpture. His point was to have people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art, because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]." The ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'',  was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, that shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as [[Dada]].

Dadaism can be viewed as part of the modernist propensity to challenge established styles and forms, along with [[Surrealism]], [[futurism]] and [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a chronological point of view Dada is located solidly within modernism, however a number of critics have held that it anticipates postmodernism, while others, such as [[Ihab Hassan]] and [[Steven Connor]], consider it a possible changeover point between modernism and postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Pegrum, ''Challenging Modernity: Dada Between Modern and Postmodern'', Berghahn Books, 2000, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|1-57181-130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fauvism]] and [[Henri Matisse]] in particular became an important influence on both [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field painting]], important milestones of Late Modernism. ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' is commonly recognized as "a key point of Matisse's career and in the development of modern painting".&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; With its large expanse of blue, simplicity of design and emphasis on pure feeling the painting was enormously influential to American artists who viewed it at [[MoMA]] in New York City.

===High art and culture===

The ignition point for the definition of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as [[kitsch]] by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably [[Clement Greenberg]] with his essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'', first published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/kitsch.html Avant-Garde and Kitsch]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg proved to be an articulate and powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively made the case for High art and culture. In 1961 ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by [[Clement Greenberg]] was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] [[art critic]] and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of [[Modern art]] history, and the history of [[modernism]] and Late Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson Pollock: abstract expressionism===
{{main|Jackson Pollock|Abstract expressionism|Process art|Western painting}}

During the late 1940s [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art gets made at the mid-century point. Pollock's move — away from easel painting and conventionality — was a liberating signal to his contemporaneous artists and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process — working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing, essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. [[Abstract expressionism]] in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them.

===Neo-Dada, collage and assemblage===

{{main|Collage|Assemblage art|Installation art}}

Related to [[abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combined manufactured items — with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and [[commercial photography]].

[[Leo Steinberg]] uses the term postmodernism in 1969 to describe Rauschenberg's "flatbed" picture plane, containing a range of cultural images and artifacts that had not been compatible with the pictorial field of premodernist and modernist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp in Hal Foster (ed), ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 44. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] goes further, identifying the significance of Rauschenberg's work not as a representation of, in Steinberg's view, "the shift from nature to culture", but as a demonstration of the impossibility of accepting their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamp]], between modernism and postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p. 174. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s and 1970s===

[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|[[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], ''CUBI VI'', 1963]]
In abstract painting and sculpture during the 1950s and 1960s [[Geometric abstraction]] emerged as an important direction in the works of many sculptors and painters. In painting [[color field painting]], [[minimalism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. The New Informalists, Art News, v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; constituted radical new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Rose]]. ''American Painting. Part Two: The Twentieth Century''. Published by Skira - Rizzoli, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Darby Bannard]]. "Notes on American Painting of the Sixties." ''Artforum'', January 1970, vol. 8, no. 5, pp.40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

April, 1967. pp. 37-41, Cover Illus.: Six-Ninths Blue, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Peter Reginato]], were some of the artists whose works characterized abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v. 57, n. 6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lyrical abstraction]] shares similarities with [[color field]] painting and [[abstract expressionism]] especially in the freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field]] painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in [[action painting]] there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.
During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Richard Saba]], [[Susan Crile]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;"Shade acrylic canvases in which geometric shapes are juxtaposed". [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery. The New Yorker. Oct. 3, 1977 p.8&lt;/ref&gt; and dozens of others continued to produce vital and influential paintings.

===Minimalism and post-minimalism===

{{main|Minimalism|Postminimalism}}
[[File:'Red Canvas' by Richard Tuttle, 1967, Corcoran Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Tuttle]], ''Red Canvas'', 1967]]
By the early 1960s [[minimalism]] emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]). Important artists who emerged as pioneers of [[minimalism]] include [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ronald Bladen]] among others. These artists also frequently employed [[shaped canvas]]es, as in the example by [[Richard Tuttle]] shown at right. [[Minimal art]] rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of [[action painting]]. [[Minimalism]] argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting and sculpture, as opposed to other areas, is a late modernist movement and depending on the context can be construed as a precursor to the post modern movement.

Hal Foster, in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'', examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 44–53. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name=Foster36/&gt;

In the late 1960s the term [[Post-minimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, ''[[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]]'', March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosalind Krauss]] argues that by 1968 artists such as Morris, LeWitt, Smithson and Serra had "entered a situation the logical conditions of which can no longer be described as modernist."&lt;ref name=Krauss287&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' pp.287&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the category of sculpture to include [[land art]] and [[architecture]], "brought about the shift into postmodernism."&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' (1979). pp.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their late [[modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

===Process art===
{{Main|Process art}}

By the late 1960s however, [[process art]] emerged as a revolutionary concept and movement that encompassed painting and sculpture, via [[lyrical abstraction]] and the [[postminimalist]] movement, and in early [[Conceptual Art]]. [[Eva Hesse]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Mel Bochner]], [[Hannah Wilke]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Barry Le Va]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], and [[Alan Saret]], were some of the process artists that emerged during the 1960s. Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, scale, size, and plastic and real space.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop art===
{{main|Pop art|Western painting}}
The term "pop art" was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] to describe paintings that celebrated [[consumerism]] of the post World War II era.&lt;ref&gt;''Topics in American Art since 1945'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], 1975 by W.W. Norton and Company, NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement rejected [[abstract expressionism]] and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement. While later American examples include the bulk of the careers of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and his use of [[Benday dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a clear connection between the radical works of [[Duchamp]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ist — with a sense of humor; and [[pop art]]ists like [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

In general pop art and [[minimalism]] began as modernist movements, a shift in the paradigm and a philosophical split between [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and anti-formalism in the early 1970s caused those movements to be viewed by some as precursors, or transitioning to postmodern art. Other modern movements cited as influential to postmodern art are [[Conceptual art]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] and the use of techniques such as [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[collage]], [[bricolage]] and art forms which used recording or reproduction as the basis for artworks.
 
There are differing opinions as to whether pop art is a late modernist movement or is [[Postmodern]]. Thomas McEvilly, agreeing with [[Dave Hickey]], says that postmodernism in the visual arts began with the first exhibitions of pop art in 1962, "though it took about twenty years before postmodernism became a dominant attitude in the visual arts."&lt;ref name=McEvilly29&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p. 29. {{ISBN|90-5701-311-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Jameson]], too, considers pop art to be postmodern.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Jameson in Hal Foster, ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 111. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way that Pop art is postmodern is that it breaks down what [[Andreas Huyssen]] calls the "Great Divide" between high art and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 20. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism emerges from a "generational refusal of the categorical certainties of high modernism."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sim, ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'', Routledge, 2001. p. 148. {{ISBN|0-415-24307-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although to presuppose that [[modernism]] stands for "high art" only, and is in any way certain as to what constitutes "high" art is to profoundly and basically misunderstand modernism.

===Performance art and happenings===

{{main|Performance art|List of performance artists|Happenings}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]] performing her piece ''Interior Scroll, 1975.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of [[contemporary art]]. [[Yves Klein]] in France, and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in New York City were pioneers of performance based works of art. Groups like The [[Living Theater]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments; radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]] located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], [[New York City]], and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. These performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form, combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. The works were characterized by the reductive philosophies of [[minimalism]], and the spontaneous improvisation, and expressivity of [[abstract expressionism]].

During the same period — the late 1950s through the mid-1960s various [[avant-garde]] artists created [[Happenings]]. Happenings were mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in varied specified locations. Often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physical exercise, costumes, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random and seemingly disconnected acts. [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]] among others were notable creators of Happenings.

===Fluxus===

{{main|Fluxus}}
Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

Fluxus encouraged a do it yourself aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

[[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for postmodernism as, "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement – as it were, postmodernism's sublime."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 192. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against, "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 196. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and low===

[[File:OtternessSculpture.JPG|thumb|Tom Otterness sculpture in Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, [[Battery Park City]], New York City]]
As a kind of response to [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 [[Kirk Varnedoe]] and [[Adam Gopnik]] curated ''High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture'', at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The exhibition attempted to elucidate the extent that artists and high culture drew on and from popular culture. Although universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Kirk Varnedoe, 1946&amp;ndash;2003'' - Front Page - Obituary - [[Art in America]],  Oct, 2003 by Marcia E. Vetrocq&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is remembered today as a benchmark of the conflict between late modernism and postmodernism.

==Movements associated with Postmodern art==

===Conceptual art===
{{main|Conceptual art}}

[[Conceptual art]] became an important development in contemporary art in the late 1960s, it delivered an influential critique on the status quo. Late modernism expanded and contracted during the late 1960s and for some, conceptual art made a complete break with modernism. Sometimes it is labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in [[deconstruction]] of what makes a work of art, "art". Conceptual art, because it is often designed to confront, offend or attack notions held by many of the people who view it, is regarded with particular controversy. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Thus, because ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was exhibited, it was a sculpture. [[Marcel Duchamp]] famously gave up "art" in favor of [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Duchamp]]&lt;/ref&gt; Avant-garde composer [[David Tudor]] created a piece, ''Reunion'' (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross that features a chess game, where each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. At the premiere, the game was played between [[John Cage]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Tudor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some other famous examples being [[John Cage]]'s 4' 33" which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]''.  Many conceptual works take the position that art is created by the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not from the intrinsic qualities of the work itself.

=== Installation art ===

{{main|Installation art}}
An important series of movements in art which have consistently been described as postmodern involved [[installation art]] and creation of artifacts that are conceptual in nature.  One example being the signs of [[Jenny Holtzer]] which use the devices of art to convey specific messages, such as "Protect Me From What I Want".  Installation Art has been important in determining the spaces selected for museums of contemporary art in order to be able to hold the large works which are composed of vast collages of manufactured and found objects. These installations and collages are often electrified, with moving parts and lights.

They are often designed to create environmental effects, as [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' which was a row of barrels intended to create a [[traffic jam]].

=== Intermedia and multi-media ===

{{main|Intermedia}}

Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]], a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[Concrete Poetry]], [[Found objects]], [[Performance art]], and [[Computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a [[Concrete poet]], married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes, "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms", in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 13. {{ISBN|0-631-23213-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[Video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with [[performance art]], where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

=== Appropriation art and neo-conceptual art ===

{{main|Appropriation art|neo-conceptual art}}
In his 1980 essay ''The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism'', [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] identifies the re-emergence of an [[allegorical]] impulse as characteristic of postmodern art. This impulse can be seen in the [[appropriation art]] of artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Robert Longo]] because, "Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation art debunks modernist notions of artistic genius and originality and is more ambivalent and contradictory than modern art, simultaneously installing and subverting ideologies, "being both critical and complicit."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997. p. 186. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neo-expressionism ===
{{main|Neo-expressionism}}

The return to the traditional art forms of sculpture and painting in the late 1970s and early 1980s seen in the work of [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] artists such as [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]] has been described as a postmodern tendency,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Woods, ''Beginning Postmodernism'', Manchester University Press, 1999. p. 125. {{ISBN|0-7190-5211-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first coherent movements to emerge in the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2006, p. 842. {{ISBN|0-495-00480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strong links with the commercial art market has raised questions, however, both about its status as a postmodern movement and the definition of postmodernism itself. Hal Foster states that neo-expressionism was complicit with the conservative cultural politics of the Reagan-Bush era in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Foster36&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, p. 36. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]] disregards the "large promotional operations dubbed 'neo-expressionism' in Germany", (an example of a "fad that maintains itself by means of publicity") as a too easy way for him "to demonstrate that postmodernism is nothing but the last gasp of modernism." These critiques of neo-expressionism reveal that money and public relations really sustained contemporary art world credibility in America during the same period that conceptual and feminist art practices were systematically reevaluating modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Doss, ''Twentieth-Century American Art'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 210. {{ISBN|0-19-284239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutional Critique ===

Critiques on the institutions of art (principally museums and galleries) are made in the work of [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]] and [[Hans Haacke]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the beginning of the 21st century contemporary painting, contemporary sculpture and contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting, sculpture and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently, magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit. Frank Stella's ''La scienza della pigrizia'' (''The Science of Laziness''), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality and an excellent example of Late Modernism.

[[Hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[hyperrealism]], [[photorealism]], [[expressionism]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], [[pop art]], [[op art]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field painting]], [[monochrome painting]], [[neo-expressionism]], [[collage]], [[intermedia]] painting, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] painting, [[digital painting]], [[postmodern]] painting, [[Neo-Dada]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting, environmental [[mural painting]], traditional [[figure painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]], are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century. The New European Painting of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, with painters like [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Luc Tuymans]], has opened a complex and interesting dialogue with the legacy of American color field and lyrical abstraction on the one hand and figurality on the other hand.

A '''[[New Testament minuscule]]''' is a copy of a portion of the [[New Testament]] written in a small, cursive Greek script (developed from [[Uncial script|Uncial]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th edition, (Stuttgart: [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minuscules 1-500 ==
* The numbers (#) are the now standard system of [[Caspar René Gregory]], often referred to as the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbers.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 100 year increment where specific date is unknown.
* Content generally only describes sections of the New Testament: [[Gospel]]s, The [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts), [[Pauline epistles]], and so on. Sometimes the surviving portion of a codex is so limited that specific books, chapters or even verses can be indicated. Linked articles, where they exist, generally specify content in detail, by verse.
* Digital images are referenced with direct links to the hosting web pages, with the exception of those at the [[INTF]]. The quality and accessibility of the images is as follows:

{| style="background:transparent"
|bgcolor="sandybrown"|Gold color indicates high resolution color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="tan"|Tan color indicates high resolution color images available locally, not online.
|-
|bgcolor="wheat"|Light tan color indicates only a small fraction of manuscript pages with color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="lightgray"|Light gray color indicates black/white or microfilm images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="powderblue"|Light blue color indicates manuscript not imaged, and is currently lost or ownership unknown.
|-
|bgcolor="mistyrose"|Light pink color indicates manuscript destroyed, presumed destroyed, or deemed too fragile to digitize.
|-
|bgcolor="violet"|Violet color indicates high resolution ultraviolet images available online.
|}
&lt;br&gt;
† Indicates the manuscript has damaged or missing pages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates only a portion of the books were included. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates manuscript also includes a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates lost portions of manuscript replaced via supplement of a later hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;abs&lt;/sup&gt; (''abschrift'') Indicates manuscript is copy. All of these have now received new numbers from the INTF.&lt;br /&gt;
[ ] Brackets around Gregory-Aland number indicate the manuscript belongs to an already numbered manuscript, was formerly numbered as a copy of another manuscript, was found to not be a continuous text manuscript, was found to be written in modern Greek versus Koine Greek, or has been destroyed.&lt;br&gt;

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"

==History==
NYFA was founded in 1971 by the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] as an independent organization to facilitate the development of arts activities throughout the State. NYFA has since expanded their programming around the country and internationally focusing on four core program areas: [[Artists' Fellowships]], [[Fiscal Sponsorship]], [[Professional Development]], and [[Online Resources]].

==Programs==
NYFA's core programs for artists are: Artists' Fellowships, Fiscal Sponsorship, NYFA Learning (Professional Development), and Online Resources.

The NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellowship Program provides unrestricted grants of $7,000 to New York-based artists every year. Since 1985, the program has awarded over $27 million to more than 4,000 artists. For the 30th anniversary of the fellowship program, NYFA is celebrating with multi-disciplinary programming around New York State. NYSCA/NYFA Artists Fellowships are administered with leadership support from the New York State Council on the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyfa.org/Content/Show/Artists'%20Fellowships&lt;/ref&gt;

NYFA's Fiscal Sponsorship program enables individual artists and emerging arts organizations in all disciplines the ability to raise funds using NYFA's tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3)-classified organization among other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyfa.org/Content/Show/Fiscal%20Sponsorship&lt;/ref&gt;

NYFA Learning consists of an Immigrant Artist Mentoring Program, in-depth Boot Camps, an Arts Business Incubator, and one-on-one consultations with industry professionals either in person at NYFA's office or on Skype through distance consultations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyfa.org/Content/Show/NYFA%20Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

NYFA's Online Resources include NYFA Source, the nation's largest online database of grants, opportunities, and services to artists; NYFA Classifieds, a job, opportunity, and space board for artists and arts workers; a weekly series of Business of Art articles,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyfa.org/Content/Show/Online%20Resources&lt;/ref&gt; and a monthly Artist Professional Development Day on Twitter called #ArtistHotline.

'''Ostrovica Fortress''' ({{IPA-hr|ˈostrovitsa|hr}}; {{lang-hr|Tvrđava Ostrovica}}) is a ruined [[medieval]] [[fortification]] on a solid rock jutting from the top of the hill above the village of [[Ostrovica, Croatia|Ostrovica]] in [[Zadar County]], [[Croatia]]. It is located between the two historical and geographical regions, [[Bukovica]] and [[Ravni Kotari]]. It was once an important stronghold, known as the "Key to the City of [[Zadar]]", as it was a key defense of the city. It was destroyed during the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]] in the second half of the 17th century, leaving only a few remains.

==History==
The name Ostrovica was first mentioned in the second half of the 12th century (according to Croatian historian [[Vjekoslav Klaić]]), when the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Cinnamus]] listed the Croatian places conquered by the army of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] in 1168, quoting, among others, [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Trogir]], [[Šibenik]], [[Skradin]] and Ostrovica. For the second time ''castrum Ostrovica'' was specified as a place where an army of, then [[Herzog|herzog (duke)]], [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]], future [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croato-Hungarian]] king, camped in 1198 on its way back home from a military campaign in the south.

The fortress, as well as the whole medieval [[Bribir, Šibenik-Knin County|Bribir]] [[Župa|Župa (County)]], was owned by members of the [[House of Šubić|Šubić noble family]], known as ''nobiles, comites or principes Breberienses'' (Princes of Breber, "Knezovi Bribirski" in Croatian), until 1347. After the death of [[Paul II Šubić of Bribir|Pavao (Paul) II Šubić]] in 1346, who used to live in Ostrovica, he was succeeded by his underaged son [[Juraj I Zrinski|George (Juraj) III Šubić]] and his son's legal representative (George's uncle and Paul's jounger brother) [[Gregory V Šubić of Bribir|Grgur (Gregory)]]. It was in the very next year, that the ruling king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] demanded from Šubićs to hand him over the fortress, for he wanted to use it as a strategic point in a war against the [[Republic of Venice]]. In exchange for it, the king granted them the [[Zrin Castle]] and surrounding estate, a very distant property to the north of the country, actually in lower [[Slavonia]], one of Croatian lands.

Ostrovica had strategic significance since ancient times. It controlled the important ways and routes in directions of north-south (between [[Siscia]] and [[Salona]]) as well as of west-east (between [[Zadar]] and [[Knin]]). So it helped king Louis to win the war and to liberate [[Dalmatia]] from Venetians, which was ended in 1358 by signing the Peace [[Treaty of Zadar]]. After Louis' death in 1382, the fortress changed various owners in a relatively short period of time. For instance, it was property of [[John of Palisna|Ivan Paližna]], [[Prior]] of [[Vrana (town)|vrana]] and [[Bans of Croatia|Ban (viceroy) of Croatia]], and his descendants, then (between 1388 and 1391) of the mighty [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnian]] king [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], and from 1393 of the [[Vuk Vukčić Hrvatinić]] (younger brother of [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]], Grand Duke of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]), who was appointed Ban of Croatia for some time by the [[counter-king]] [[Ladislaus of Naples]].

At the beginning of the 15th century, it was [[Sandalj Hranić Kosača]], [[Grand Duke]] of [[Zahumlje|Hum]], who married Katarina, a daughter of Vuk Vukčić Hrvatinić, and was given Ostrovica as her [[dowry]] (in spring 1405), together with the Town of Skradin. This was acknowledged by the king Ladislaus in a [[charter]] dated 23 March 1407. However, new circumstances occurred in 1409, as Ladislaus sold his rights to Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice. Subsequently negotiated Sandalj Hranić Kosača the terms of delivery of the castle to Venetians and agreed upon its handover for the sum of 5.000 [[ducat]]s. An agreement was signed in Zadar on 13 April 1411, and so the Most Serene Republic gradually took over the whole Dalmatia for a while, paying for it the sum of 100.000 ducats to king Ladislaus.

The fall of medieval Bosnian Kingdom into [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] hands in 1463 meant a new and constant jeopardy for the fortress. However, it remained within territory of the Croato-Hungarian Kingdom until 1523, when it was conquered by the Ottomans, together with surrounding land and villages.

In the next decades Ostrovica was subject to face the instability of the [[Military Frontier|military frontier]] between the Ottomans and Venetians and was finally razed to the ground in the second half of the 17th century. According to available sources, the fortress still existed in 1671, as [[Stojan Janković]], a famous warriorr against the Turks, was appointed its Venetian military commander. After that, on the [[plateau]] of Ostrovica's steep rock there were only remains of the ruined fortress left. Today can only some of them be found, like stone water [[cistern]], hewn stone [[stairway]] and  fragments of [[Gothic art|gothic]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

The '''Oxborough Dirk''' is a large ceremonial weapon or [[dirk]] from the early [[bronze age]]. One of only six such objects across [[Europe]], it was found in a rural part of the county of [[Norfolk]], England in the 1980s and is now part of the [[British Museum]]'s prehistoric collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=808195&amp;partId=1&amp;place=26449&amp;plaA=26449-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
It was found by chance in 1988 protruding from a [[peat]] bog near [[Oxborough]], [[Norfolk]], where it had been deposited point down. A walker had discovered it in woods near the village by accidentally tripping up on the [[hilt]] of the [[sword]]. Six years after its discovery, the sword was purchased by the British Museum with the support of the [[National Art Collections Fund]].

==Rare find==
The Oxborough find is one of only six large [[dirk]]s known in north-west Europe, though excessively large versions of other types of objects from this era are also recorded. The six are so similar that they may have been made in the same [[workshop]], in which case this one could have been imported in to [[Great Britain|Britain]] from the continent. The six almost identical swords have been found across three countries in western Europe: two in France, two in the Netherlands and two in England. All six of these very rare swords are labelled the [[Plougrescant]]-[[Ommerschans]] type, after two of the sites from where they were found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regiocanons.nl/overijssel/salland/ommen/bronsschat-ommerschans Dutch article on Ommerschans weapon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The others were discovered in [[Beaune]] and [[Jutphaas]] and a second from [[Norfolk]].  The [[Beaune]] example is also in the British Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=808153&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=beaune&amp;images=true&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.  The second [[Norfolk]] example is in the collection of [[Norwich Castle Museum]].

==Description==
The Oxborough Dirk is dated to between 1450–1300 BC and measures {{convert|70.9|cm}} long with a mass of {{convert|2.37|kg}}, making it "ridiculously large and unwieldy" and clearly never intended for practical use, which the lack of holes on the hilt for fitting a handle also demonstrates.  It was probably either a [[votive offering]] or a [[store of value]] that could be retrieved at a later time.  It is currently on display in Room 50 at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10334">'''Participatory art''' is an approach to making art which engages [[public participation]] in the creative process, letting them become co-authors, editors, and observers of the work. This type of art is incomplete without viewers' physical interaction. It intends to challenge the dominant form of making art in the West, in which a small class of professional artists make the art while the public takes on the role of passive observer or consumer, i.e., buying the work of the professionals in the marketplace. Commended works by advocates who popularized participatory art include [[Augusto Boal]] in his [[Theater of the oppressed]], as well as [[Allan Kaprow]] in [[happenings]].

One of the earliest usages of the term appears in photographer [[Richard Ross (photographer)]]'s review for the [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art]] journal of the exhibition "Downtown Los Angeles Artists," organized by the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum in 1980. Describing ''in situ'' works by [[Jon Peterson (artist)]], Maura Sheehan and Judy Simonian anonymously placed around Santa Barbara, Ross wrote, "These artists bear the responsibility to the community. Their art is participatory."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ross."At Large In Santa Barbara." ''LAICA Journal''. September–October 1980, Number 28. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Participatory art requires of the artist that they either not be present, or that they somehow are able to recede far enough to become equal with the participants. This is the only way that participants might be offered the agency of creation; without this detail, participants will always respond within the domain of authority of the artist; they will be subjugated in this way, and the work will fail to be participatory. This detail is centrally important in asserting Participation as a form in itself, and effectively differentiates Participation from interactive, community based art and socially engaged art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11152406/Participation_Hosting_And_Mimesis_The_Double_Being|title=Participation, Hosting And Mimesis: The Double Being|last=Mount|first=Andrew|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these techniques can include the presence of the artist, as it will not impinge upon the outcome of the work in the same way.

There are various degrees of participation from nominal manipulation of an object like the wearable sculptures of [[Lygia Clark]] to the relinquishing of the artist's body to the whims of the audience in the 1974 performance ''Rhythm 0'' by [[Marina Abramović]]. New media theorist Beryl Graham has compared the varying degrees of participation in the arts to the eight rungs of power described in [[Sherry Arnstein]]'s "Ladder of Citizen Participation"—ranging from manipulation to token consulting, to complete citizen control. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Beryl|date=|title=What kind of participative system? Critical Vocabularies from new media art.|url=|journal=The 'do-it-yourself' artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media|volume=|pages=290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fall/Winter issue of Oregon Humanities magazine, writer Eric Gold describes "an artistic tradition called '[[Social Practice#Art and Social Practice|social practice]],' which refers to works of art in which the artist, audience, and their interactions with one another are the medium. While a painter uses pigment and canvas, and a sculptor wood or metal, the social practice artist often creates a scenario in which the audience is invited to participate. Although the results may be documented with photography, video, or otherwise, the artwork is really the interactions that emerge from the audience's engagement with the artist and the situation."

Participatory or interactive art creates a dynamic collaboration between the artist, the audience and their environment. Participatory art is not just something that you stand still and quietly look at–it is something you participate in. You touch it, smell it, write on it, talk to it, dance with it, play with it, learn from it. You co-create it. 

== Related fields ==
It is important to point out that there has been some nominal obfuscation of Participatory Art, causing its appreciation as a distinct form to be stymied. It is most likely that this occurred simultaneously with the development of the term [[Relational Aesthetics]] by [[Special:BookSources/2840660601|Bourriaud]] in the late 1990s. Some other art making techniques, such as [[Community arts|'community-based art']], '[[interactive art]]', or '[[Social Practice#Art and Social Practice|socially-engaged art]]' have been (mis)labelled as Participatory art, simply because the subtleties of distinction are not always clearly understood or cared about. Many forms of popular culture and media beyond visual art have grown increasingly participatory with the rise of the [[Internet]] and [[social media]], which allow users to participate at a distance.

== Examples ==
[[Janet Cardiff]] has created various audio tours that users experience by walking site-specific routes and listening to soundscapes composed by the artist. 

[[Figment (arts event)]] is an annual showcase of participatory art in New York City.

[[Antony Gormley]] has involved the public in the creation of several works, most notably [[One &amp; Other]] which invited hundreds of participants to occupy the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|vacant plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] and perform or otherwise contribute to the work. 

[[Carsten Höller]] has created interactive installations like Test Site (2006), which invites participants to play on giant slides installed in the [[Tate Modern]]. 

[[Allan Kaprow]] pioneered the field of participatory art with his [[Happening]] events staged in 1960's New York City, which used physical installations and prompts to facilitate aesthetic experiences for participants.  

[http://www.learningtoloveyoumore.com/ Learning to Love you More] (2002–2009) was a work of [[Internet art]] by [[Miranda July]] and [[Harrell Fletcher]] that invited participants to submit responses to written prompts, and displayed an archive of the resulting works of [[conceptual art]].

[[Adrian Piper]] led a series of events titled Funk Lessons (1982 –1984) that combined participatory dance-parties with conversations and lectures about African-American culture.

[http://www.publicartstation.org Public Art Stations] (2013 - present) allow the public freedom in the creation of works, usually in watercolor.

== Influences ==
Folk and tribal art can be considered to be a predecessor or model for contemporary "participatory art" in that many or all of the members of the society participate in the making of "art". However, the ideological issue of ''use'' arises at this point because art made in the institutions of art is by default, already part of the art world, and therefore it's perceived ''use'' is entirely different to any ritualistic or traditional practices expressed by folk or tribal groups. As the ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl wrote, the tribal group "has no specialization or professionalization; its division of labor depends almost exclusively on sex and occasionally on age, and only rarely are certain individuals proficient in any technique to a distinctive degree ... the same songs are known by all the members of the group, and there is little specialization in composition, performance or instrument making.” &lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno, ''Music in Primitive Culture'', Cambridge, Harvard 1956, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pisnia zavzhdy z namy''''' ({{lang-uk|Пісня завжди з нами}}) is a 1975 Soviet Ukrainian [[musical film]], produced by [[Viktor Storozhenko]] starring [[Sofia Rotaru]] in the main role, as well as Soviet Ukrainian [[Smerichka]] vocal-instrumental band. The movie features songs in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Moldova]]n and Russian of Sofia Rotaru filmed in the background of Ukrainian [[Carpathian]] mountains.

== Plot ==
Filmed by Ukrainian studio of television films, the musical film ''Pisnia zavzhdy z namy'' features six songs of [[Volodymyr Ivasiuk]], written for [[Sofia Rotaru]]. The young and beautiful singer starts a concert in a mountainous vacation resort music club in open air. This autobiographical scenario depicts true Ukrainian Moldavian origins of [[Sofia Rotaru]] in the bucolic atmosphere of melodic [[Bukovyna]] in Western Ukraine.

== Production==
The filming took place in the village Ploska in [[Putyla Raion|Putylshchyna]]. The main theme of the movie is the exploration of the artistic laboratory of [[Sofia Rotaru]], who has always affirmed that her artistic path started from a stage in a village club.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4405">'''Spiro Konstantine Kostof''' (7 May 1936, [[Istanbul]] – 7 December 1991, [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]) was a leading [[architectural historian]], and professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His books continue to be widely read and some are routinely used in collegiate courses on [[architectural history]].

Born in [[Turkey]], of Greek and Bulgarian ethnic origin, Kostof was educated at [[Istanbul]]'s [[Robert College]].  He came to the United States in 1957 for graduate work at [[Yale University]].  Although he intended to major in drama, his interests shifted to architectural history.  He received his Ph.D. in 1961, then taught at Yale for four years, before moving to the University of California to join the faculty of the [[UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design|College of Environmental Design]].  He was to remain at Berkeley for the duration of his career.

Kostof's approach to [[architectural history]] emphasized urbanism as well as architecture and showed how architectural works are embedded in their physical and social contexts.  Commonly accepted today, Kostof's approach was a break with previous directions in architectural history which tended to emphasize the sequence of styles and to study architectural works in relative isolation from their settings.  Kostof's textbook, ''A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals'' (1985) embodied these ideas and soon became one of the standard texts in the field.

In 1987, Kostof hosted a five-part [[PBS]] series, ''America by Design''.

Kostof's publications were wide-ranging and included ''The Architect: Chapters in the History of the Profession''; ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History''; ''America by Design''; and ''The City Assembled: Elements of Urban Form through History''.

In 1993, following his death, the [[Society of Architectural Historians]] established the "'''Spiro Kostof Award'''", to recognize books "in the spirit of Kostof's writings," particularly those that are interdisciplinary and whose content focuses on urban development, the history of urban form, and/or the architecture of the built environment.

'''''Stormy Sea''''', by [[Emil Nolde]], date 1930, is a landscape painting done with watercolor on 34x 45&amp;nbsp;cm paper. This piece has very organic lines and there are many spots of bright colors, in particular blues and oranges. There are two boats on the horizon and a [[steam boat]] off to the right side which is a nod to [[modernism]] and [[industrialization]]. The bright fiery orange on the horizon gives a sense of drama to the piece and the white color in the foreground shows the crests of the moving waves. The waves juxtaposed against the fiery horizon animate the painting, and the colors help to depict the tumultuous waves.  The orange light in the sky imbues energy and excitement against the dark blue waters.

The painting is now in the collection of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]].

==Nolde's technique==
Nolde elevated watercolor far above the level of a specialized technique and achieved works of breathtaking and ephemeral beauty which stand unique in the history of twentieth-century art.&lt;ref&gt;Selz,"Emile Nolde,"68.&lt;/ref&gt;  His use of color conveys movement and emotion, and the mysterious quality of painting is typical of the [[Die Brücke]] style.  [[Watercolor]] is a medium that Nolde liked because he could translate his ideas and concepts to creation faster than oil painting which requires that it is drawn out and planned before it is put on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Selz,"Emile Nolde,"60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolde said about his paintings, “To the annoyance of art historians I shall destroy all lists that give information about the dates of my pictures.”&lt;ref&gt;Peter Selz,"Emile Nolde,"67.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Ada Nolde, kept a precise catalog of his oil paintings but not of his watercolors.

==Nolde's reception==
His work was denounced by [[Hitler]] in [[World War Two]] as [[Degenerate Art]]. Hitler condemned modern art and especially art by Jewish artists to be degenerate.

Emil Nolde was heavily censored even though he was a German citizen. During this time many of his works were removed from exhibitions at German museums and he was heavily censored by the [[Nazi party]] during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="Grove Art online" group="Oxford Art online"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lloyd|first=Jill|title=Emil Nolde|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T062679.|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolde’s landscapes are not mere pictures of mood or reflections of the changing atmosphere of a year or of a day, but are truly ‘landscapes of the soul’, the free and direct expression of artistic and human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Urban," Emile Nolde Landscapes:Watercolors and Drawings,"7.&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses true feeling and emotion with the fluidity and bright colors present in his watercolors. Nolde was able to create work faster through watercolor and he could go straight from concept to creation immediately unlike with oil painting which he had to plan out. Watercolor was Nolde’s primary medium from the 1930s until his death, and he used it to create the beautiful painting ''Stormy Sea''.

'''Susanne Katherina Langer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|ər}}; ''née'' '''Knauth'''; December 20, 1895 – July 17, 1985) was an American philosopher, writer, and educator and was well known for her theories on the influences of art on the mind. She was one of the first women in American history to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled, ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. In 1960, Langer was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born Susanne Katherina Knauth, Langer was raised in Manhattan's West Side in New York. She was the daughter of Antonio Knauth, an attorney, and Else Uhlich, both emigrants of Germany. Though she was American born, Langer's primary language was German, as it was strictly spoken in her household throughout her youth, and her German accent remained her entire life. She was exposed thoroughly to creativity and art, most specifically through music. She was taught to play the cello and the piano, and she continued with the cello for the remainder of her life. As a girl, Langer enjoyed reciting the works of great poets as well as traditional children's rhymes and tales. This sparked her love for reading and writing, and she would often write her own poems and stories to entertain her younger siblings. Her love of nature began during the summers her family spent in their cottage on Lake George. She married William Leonard Langer, a fellow student at Harvard in 1921, and in the same year they took their studies to Vienna, Austria. They had two sons and moved back to Cambridge, Massachusetts before the couple divorced in 1942. She died July 17, 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-02412.html|title=American National Biography Online: Langer, Susanne K.|website=www.anb.org|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |title=Susanne Langer |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221075501/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |archivedate=21 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Her early education included attendance at [[Veltin School for Girls]], a private school as well as being tutored from home. In 1916, Langer enrolled at Radcliffe College. She earned the bachelor's degree in 1920 and continued with graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard, where she received the master's diploma in 1924 and the doctorate in 1926. She was a tutor in philosophy at Radcliffe from 1927 to 1942. She lectured in philosophy for one year at the University of Delaware and for five years at Columbia University (1945-1950). From 1954 to 1962 she taught at Connecticut College. She also taught philosophy at the University of Michigan, New York University, Northwestern University, Ohio University, Smith College, Vassar College, the University of Washington, and Wellesley College.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Susanne Langer's unexplored thesis revolving around the connection of consciousness and aesthetics as well as her unusual use of language in her writing ultimately caused her to be scrutinized by her fellow scholars. However, it led her to further explore the complexity and nature of human consciousness.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shelley, C 1998, 'Consciousness, Symbols and Aesthetics: A Just-So Story and its Implications in Susanne Langer's 'Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling', ''Philosophical Psychology'', 11, 1, pp. 45-66, Philosopher's Index, EBSCOHost, viewed 4 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer's philosophy explored the continuous process of meaning-making in the human mind through the power of “seeing” one thing in terms of another. Langer's first major work is entitled, ''Philosophy in a New Key''. It put forth an idea that has become commonplace today: that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Howard Gardner, "Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer" ''Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity'', New York: Basic Books, pp. 48–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with a critique of positivism, the work is a study of human thought progressing from semantic theory through philosophy of music, sketching a theory for all the arts. For Langer, the human mind "is constantly carrying on a process of symbolic transformation of the experiential data that come to it," causing it to be "a veritable fountain of more or less spontaneous ideas".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Susanne Langer's distinction between discursive versus presentational symbols is one of her better known concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Michael H. G., Geist und Welt – durch die Symbolisierungen der Kunst betrachtet, a review of Susanne K. Langer, Die lebendige Form menschlichen Fühlens und Verstehens (The living form of human feeling and understanding). Munich: Fink, 2000. {{ISBN|3-7705-3462-X}}, IASL Online, retrieved 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursive symbolization arranges elements (not necessarily words) with stable and context invariant meanings into a new meaning. Presentation symbolization operates independently of elements with fixed and stable meanings. The presentation cannot be comprehended by progressively building up an understanding of its parts in isolation. It must be understood as a whole. For example, an element used in one painting may be used to articulate an entirely different meaning in another. The same principle applies to a note in a musical arrangement—such elements independently have no fixed meaning except in the context of their entire presentation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lachmann, Rolf (January 1998), From Metaphysics to Art and Back: The Relevance of Susan K. Langer’s Philosophy for Process Metaphysics 26, Process Studies, pp. 107–125&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer believed that symbolism is the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Stephen W.; Foss, Karen A. (2008), ''Theories of Human Communication'' (9th ed.), Belmont, California: The Thomson Wadsworth Corporation, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[Ernst Cassirer]], Langer believed that what distinguishes humans from animals is the capacity for using symbols. While all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols, and language. Animals respond to signs, but stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex for humans. The perspective also is associated with symbolic communication where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of a cooperating group.

Langer is one of the earliest philosophers who paid close attention to the concept of the virtual. Inspired by Henri Bergson's notions of matter and memory, she connected art to the concept of the virtual. For her, figuring out the space of an art work by its creator was no less than building a virtual world. She describes virtuality as "the quality of all things that are created to be perceived." For her, the virtual is not only a matter of consciousness, but something external that is created intentionally and existing materially, as a space of contemplation outside of the human mind. Langer sees virtuality as a physical space created by the artist, such as a painting or a building, that is “significant in itself and not as part of the surroundings.” She particularly considers architecture not as the realization of a space for being, but its conceptual translation into virtuality for perceiving: “The architect, in fine, deals with a created space, a virtual entity.” In contrast to Bergson, for Langer, virtuality is tangible and can cause a contemplative interaction between humans and the machine.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne K. Langer, ''Feeling and Form'' (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953), 65 and 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years, Langer came to believe that the decisive task of her work was to construct a science and psychology based theory of the "life of the mind" using process philosophy conventions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Langer's final work, ''Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling'' represents the culmination of her attempt to establish a philosophical and scientific underpinning of aesthetic experience, relying on a three volume survey of a comprehensive set of relevant humanistic and scientific texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== History of feeling ===
Langer's desire to study the mind and its connections with art was rooted in her theory that works of art are representations of human feeling and expression. This led Langer to construct a biological theory of feeling that explains that "feeling" is an inherently biological concept that can be connected to evolutionary genetics. In her essay, ''Mind'', Langer goes into depth to connect the early evolution of man to how we perceive the mind today. She explains that early organisms underwent refinery through natural selection, in which certain behaviors and functions were shaped in order for them to survive. Langer describes the body's organs to all operate within a specific rhythm, and these rhythms must cooperate with one another to keep the organism alive. This development, Langer explains, was the beginning of the framework for the Central Nervous System, which Langer believed to be the heart of cognitive interactions among humans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Rhetoric ===
Susanne Langer's work with symbolism and meaning has led to her association with contemporary rhetoric, although her influence in the field is somewhat debated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lunsford, Andrea (1995). Reclaiming Rhetoric: Women in the Rhetorical Tradition. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 265–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Langer established the use of symbols as the "epistemic unit of community",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; suggesting that all knowledge in a community is gained and built from shared symbol-systems within a given culture. Langer's concept regarding language and dialogue may be understood to imply that language does not simply communicate, but it produces symbols from which humans then create their own reality.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Robert (2008). Susanne Langer in Focus: The Symbolic Mind. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Claimed support of this perspective comes from Langer's statement that "language is intrinsic to thinking, imagining, even our ways of perceiving".&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

According to Arabella Lyon, professor at State University of New York, Langer holds that meaning arises from the relationship between a community, its discourse, and the individual.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lyon suggests that Langer's work may be viewed as a contradiction to the comparatively traditional theories of Aristotle, by way of Langer's argument that discourse forms through sensory experiences shared between speaker and hearer, rather than through logic as advocated by the philosopher. Langer's epistemic view of symbolism and language, which further examines the motivation of the speaker, the influential aspects of language that affect people, and the relationship between the speaker and the community,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; are often reflected in aspects of modern rhetorical studies.

== Influences ==
[[File:Susanne Langer - Filosofia é a contínua busca de sentidos - mais amplos, claros, negociados, articulados.svg|thumb|Poster with a quotation of Susanne Langer in Portuguese]]
Langer's works were largely influenced by fellow philosophers Ernst Cassirer and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Whitehead, an English mathematician and philosophy professor, was Langer's professor at Radcliffe. Whitehead introduced Langer to the history of human thought, the origins of the modern world, and contemporary philosophy. He helped shape her perspective on these topics which she presented in her first text, The Practice of Philosophy. Throughout her career, Whitehead continued to influence her understanding of the complicated world of human thought which guided her to pursue a philosophical career.  She shared Whitehead’s belief in going beyond the limitations of scientific research and believed that along with the new-found thinking and ideas that had initiated the modern era in science and philosophy, the opportunity for a rebirth of philosophical creativity would arise. Langer dedicated Philosophy in a New Key, to "Alfred North Whitehead, my great Teacher and Friend."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/drydenlangerwhitehead.htm|title=Dryden, "Whitehead’s Influence on Susanne Langer’s Conception of Living Form"|website=www.anthonyflood.com|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susanne Langer's other main influence was the German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. Cassirer was a neo-Kantianist who studied the field of theories of symbolization. Cassirer influenced much of Langer's ides in ''Philosophy in a New Key'', where she stated that the creation of symbols is the essential activity of art, myth, rite, the sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. She stated, "It is a peculiar fact that every major advance in thinking, every epoch-making new insight, springs from a new type of symbolic transformation". She drew from Cassirer's view in her belief that art theory must be independent with a theory of mind.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Susanne Langer is not an extremely well known philosopher; however, her work has influenced and continues to influence many. As one of the first female philosophers, her work has posed as an inspiration to many fellow women to pursue a future in philosophy and other related fields. Her imaginative views on the connections of art and aesthetics with the human mind were revolutionary during her time and sparked a wide interest in the complexity of human consciousness. Although her work is not often cited by today's philosophers, her theories on presentational symbolic activity are part of the "[[collective unconscious]]" where philosophy and psychology meet anthropology.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8124">The Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]] has composed eight [[symphonies]], considered by some to be the core of his instrumental output.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 1, Op. 24 ==
Originally entitled just 'Sinfonia', Sallinen's first symphony lasts around 16 minutes. It won first prize in a competition organized by the [[City of Helsinki]] to mark the inauguration of Finlandia House, and was premièred there in December 1971 by the Helsinki City Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Jorma Panula]].&lt;ref name="Novellocat"&gt;Aulis Sallinen, Catalogue, January 1987, Novello, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; This single movement symphony is a dense atmospheric piece arising from an environment of F sharp minor.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"&gt;Korhonen, Kimmo. Contemporary Composers from Medieval to Modern - Inventing Finnish Music (English translation Kimmo Korhonen and Jaakko Mäntyjärvi, 2007), 2007, Finnish Music Information Centre, {{ISBN|978-952-5076-61-5}}. Chapter IX “That Which Was Old” p126-129.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Okko Kamu]] notes that the symphonic texture is founded on organic expansion of motifs; the work emerges from small intervals. He comments that "the scherzo movement... rushes forward like a tempest... The exquisite section with percussion and harp is peculiarly fascinating with timbres of sound and an exoticism, the intensity of which emanates from an escaping triad".&lt;ref name="kamubis041"&gt;Kamu, Okko. Booklet notes for Bis CD 41, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symphony No. 2, Op. 29 'Symphonic Dialogue for percussion and orchestra' ==
The second symphony was written soon after the first and lasts around 17 minutes. It was commissioned by and first performed by the [[Norrköping Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Okko Kamu]] in February 1973, with percussionist Rainer Kuisma. A studio recording was made by the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] under Ole Schmidt in February 1981.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; The work is based principally on two themes, a falling scale, and a fanfare-like motif; the percussion part, well-integrated into the symphony as a whole demands use of marimba, vibraphone, crotales, tom-tom, bongo, military snare drum, suspended cymbal, guiro and tam-tam.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Martin. Booklet notes for Sallinen works recorded on CPO 999 969-2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symphony No. 3, Op. 35 ==
Sallinen's third symphony was commissioned by the Finnish Broadcasting Company and dedicated to Okko Kamu, who conducted the première with the [[Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra]] in April 1975. The work lasts around 27 minutes.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; The symphony was finished at around the time of his first opera ''[[The Horseman (opera)|Ratsumies]]'' (''The Horseman''), and was the first to be divided into several movements.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt; The middle movement takes the form of a chaconne based on themes of the first movement coda. The last movement recreates the atmosphere of the first, where "the sea builds up into an engulfing orchestral wave pouring over the landscape".&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;Mark Morris. ''The Pimlico dictionary of 20th-century composers.'' London, Pimlico, 1999, p113.&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 1984 a ballet entitled ''Midsomernatten'' with choreography by Thor Sutowski and based on this symphony was first performed at the [[Atlanta Civic Center]].&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; Kamu reflects that, conceived on an island out in the Baltic, it embodies the composer's love of the ocean “that fickle element which without warning changes character”.&lt;ref name="kamubis041"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 4, Op. 49 ==
This symphony was a commission from the city of [[Turku]] to celebrate its 750th anniversary. Lasting 22 minutes, and in less sombre mode than its predecessors, it was first played by the Turku City Symphony Orchestra conducted by Pertti Pekkanen in August 1979. The UK première was given by the [[Hallé Orchestra]] conducted by Okko Kamu in the [[Free Trade Hall]] in October 1980.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; Composed shortly after his ''Dies Irae'' for voices and orchestra (1978) which was influenced by thoughts of nuclear devastation, the symphony maintains a sense of fear: a striking opening march interweaves with quiet, bleak passages, while the sound of bells overlies the last movement.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt; Especially in the first movement of this symphony Sallinen begins to develop a ‘mosaic technique’, which he would make a central part of his approach to the fifth symphony.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 5, Op. 57 'Washington Mosaics' ==
Sallinen's fifth symphony was a commission from the National Symphony Orchestra Association (USA). It received its première at the [[Kennedy Center]] in October 1985 with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. The work lasts 37 minutes. The UK première was given by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under Kamu in the Royal Festival Hall in February 1987.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt; Sallinen has commented that “whereas each movement in a symphony usually has its own material, here certain motifs are repeated identically, just like identical pieces in a mosaic, in the various movements”. This five-movement work ranges in expression “from static frozen cluster chords to almost tonal allusions to Sibelius and Mahler”.&lt;ref name="korhoenen"/&gt;

== Symphony No. 6, Op. 65 'From a New Zealand Diary' ==
In order to prepare for the commission from the New Zealand Symphony Orhcestra, Sallinen had a holiday in New Zealand in early 1989. The titles of the movements are I. The Islands of the Sounds. The sounds of the islands (attaca) II. Air. Rain. III. [[Kyeburn]] Diggings (attaca) IV. Finale 'Simply by sailing in a new direction You could enlarge the world' (a line from a poem by [[Allen Curnow]]). The 2nd movement quotes from Act II of ''[[The King Goes Forth to France]]'', and the whole work lasts approximately 42 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Weitzman. Booklet notes for Bis CD 511, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symphony No. 7, Op. 71 'The Dreams of Gandalf' ==
The music was intended for a ballet around the subject of the [[Hobbit]], which was abandoned due to copyright difficulties, but much of the material was made into this 25-minute seventh symphony (the subtitle refers to [[Gandalf|a character of JRR Tolkien]]). The first performance by the [[Göteborg Symphony Orchestra]] was conducted by [[Neeme Järvi]]. A ballet ''Holbitti'' (also called The Dragon Mountain (The Hobbit), Op.78) (choreographed by Marjo Kuusela) was produced at the [[Finnish National Opera]] in 2001 using this symphony and other music by Sallinen.&lt;ref&gt;Sallinen, quoted in the booklet accompanying CD CPO 999 918-2 of works by Sallinen, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A note in the score states “The symphony does not actually depict the events in the novel; rather it is a musical expression of the literary atmosphere and poetry”.

== Symphony No. 8 Autumnal Fragments, Op. 81 (2001) ==
Written in 2001, the symphony lasts 24 minutes in its world première recording.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Rasilainen conducting the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz on CPO 999 972-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] it received its world première by the same orchestra conducted by [[Paavo Järvi]] on 16 April  2004. In the words of the composer « I have quoted "Theme of the Dead" from my opera ''[[Kullervo (Sallinen)|Kullervo]]'', and it finally emerges as a five-part canon. The "Bell Theme" of the finale is a salute to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra... built up from certain notes from the name and its home city: ConCErtGEBouwAmstErDAm.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the booklet accompanying CD CPO 999 972-2 of works by Sallinen, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The autumnal of the subtitle refers to the composer's time of life.

Music from Symphonies 1, 3 and 4 was used for a ballet, based on a play, ''Himlens hemlighet'' (''Secret of Heaven'') by [[Pär Lagerkvist]], choreographed by Pär Isberg, and shown on Swedish television on 20 October 1986.&lt;ref name="Novellocat"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5256">The '''Symphony in G minor''' was [[Édouard Lalo]]’s final original orchestral composition.  It was composed in 1885-1886.  (There were two earlier symphonies composed by Lalo, believed destroyed).  It was premiered on 7 February 1887 in [[Paris]] at the [[Orchestre Lamoureux|Concerts Lamoureux]] under [[Charles Lamoureux]].  

It is a classically constructed romantic symphony with the composer’s Latin roots present in the melodies and orchestration.  There are four movements with 28 minutes duration:
*I. [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Andante]] - [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] non troppo
*II. [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Vivace]]
*III. [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Adagio]]
*IV. Allegro

Instrumentation is two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, four [[french horn|horn]]s, two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]] and [[string section|string]]s. The full score was published by G. Hartmann in 1888, and brought out as a Heugel et Cie imprint in 1900 as plate 1820 (Heugel having purchased Hartmann in 1891).  [[Xavier Leroux]] also made a four hand piano version, published by Heugel as plate 1795.

In a letter of 7 March 1887 to author and Wagner enthusiast [[Adolphe Jullien]] responding for information on the symphony, Lalo stated his belief in pure music over descriptive music:

''“It appears that you personally wish to have some information regarding the thought which predominates in my symphony. Alas, I am going to scandalize you! I had no literary thought in the sense that you mean. When I write a composition to words, I become a slave to what convention terms the verities of musical expression, according to a given text. But when I write music without a literary text, I have before and about me only the domain of sounds, melodic and harmonic. For a musician, this immense field possesses in itself, aside from all literature, its poems and its dramas. As to my Symphony, I have presented the master phrase in a brief introduction, as you have been kind enough to remark; it predominates in the first movement, and I recall it in the others whenever my poetic or dramatic musical intentions (do not laugh!) make its intervention seem necessary to me”.''  

Lalo’s symphony was called one of the "happiest" of French symphonies in a 1925 article in ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]''.  Lalo’s is from the same period that produced three other notable French symphonies:  [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Symphony No. 3 "Organ Symphony"]], [[Vincent d'Indy|d'Indy’s]] ''[[Symphony on a French Mountain Air]]'', and [[César Franck|Franck’s]] [[Symphony in D minor (Franck)|Symphony in D minor]].  Lalo's work was neglected until [[Thomas Beecham]] "discovered" it and conducted it regularly.  In the United States, only the [[New York Philharmonic]] amongst major symphony orchestras performed the work up to 1970 (that sole performance being in 1931).

A 1961 review of the first major recording (Beecham’s made in 1959 at the [[Salle Wagram]] in Paris) disparaged the composition as "not very rewarding. Both matter and manner are dull and undistinguished, without the sparkle and melodic charm of the popular ''[[Symphonie Espagnole]]''".  A 1976 review of [[Antonio de Almeida (conductor)|Antonio de Almeida]]’s recording suggests that "the cyclic theme does bear an unfortunately close resemblance to the opening of the [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Brahms)|B-flat Piano Concerto]], in a way that Lalo surely did not intend".  This review finds the second movement the most cohesive of the four and "wonderfully scored", suggesting [[Georges Bizet|Bizet's]] [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]] as the "closest equivalent".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2157">The '''Symphony on a French Mountain Air''' ({{lang-fr|'''Symphonie sur un chant montagnard français''' }}), [[opus number|Op.]] 25, written in [[1886 in music|1886]] by [[Vincent d'Indy]], is virtually the only work by the composer that still receives regular performances today. 

As indicated by the title, d'Indy took the principal [[theme (music)|theme]] from a [[French folk music|folk song]] he heard at Périer overlooking the [[Cévennes]] mountains (hence the work's alternative name, '''''Symphonie cévenole''''').  Originally conceived as a [[Fantasia (music)|fantaisie]] for piano and orchestra, the symphony is unusual in that it is scored for a prominent (but never dominant) [[piano]] part together with [[orchestra]], and has acquired the label [[sinfonia concertante]] from some critics.  

It consists of three [[movement (music)|movements]] and lasts just under half an hour:
*''Assez [[Tempo#French_tempo_markings|lent]] - Modérément animé''
*''Assez [[Tempo#French_tempo_markings|modéré]], mais sans lenteur''
*''Animé''
The symphony begins with an evocative melody played first by a [[cor anglais]].  The main themes of subsequent movements are based on this melody, and as the symphony progresses each subsequent variation becomes more and more like the original version.

The work was dedicated to [[Marie-Léontine Bordes-Pène]], who was the soloist at the premiere in Paris on March 20, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Blom]], ed., [[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], 5th ed, 1954, Vol. I, p. 814&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Boyhood of Raleigh''''' is a painting by [[John Everett Millais]], which was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1871. It came to epitomise the culture of heroic [[imperialism]] in late [[Victorian era|Victorian Britain]] and in British popular culture up to the mid-twentieth century {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

The painting depicts the young, wide-eyed [[Walter Raleigh]] and his brother sitting on the beach by the [[Devon]]shire coast. He is listening to a story of life on the seas, told by an experienced sailor who points out to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=9515 Tate Gallery, The Boyhood of Raleigh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The painting was influenced by an essay written by [[James Anthony Froude]] on ''England's Forgotten Worthies'', which described the lives of [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] seafarers. It was also probably influenced by a contemporaneous biography of Raleigh, which imagined his experiences listening to old sailors as a boy. Millais travelled to [[Budleigh Salterton]] to paint the location.

Millais's sons Everett and George modelled for the boys. The sailor was a professional model.&lt;ref name = "jg"&gt;J.G. Millais, ''The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais'', vol 2, pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Millais' friend and biographer, the critic [[Marion Spielmann]], stated that he was intended to be [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. He also argues that the sailor is pointing south towards the "[[Spanish main]]".&lt;ref name = "jg"/&gt;

==Literary and satirical use==

===Cartoons===
The painting has been parodied many times in political cartoons.

In 1928 David Low published a cartoon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/jeffrey-archer-l18417/lot.66.html&lt;/ref&gt; showing the Earl of Birkenhead ([[Secretary of State for India]]), [[Stanley Baldwin]] (Prime Minister) and [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) listening to "Tales of the Dominions" from a diminutive sailor ([[Leo Amery]], Colonial Secretary – who was a very short man).

In 1993 the ''Sunday Telegraph'' ran "The Boyhood of Hurd and Major". The then Prime Minister [[John Major]] and Foreign Secretary [[Douglas Hurd]], who had recently pushed the Maastricht Treaty through Parliament against the wishes of many Conservatives, were shown as small boys in Elizabethan costume, listening as an old sailor ([[Sir Edward Heath]]) gestured towards the coast labelled "Europe" visible on the other side of the water. Former Prime Minister Heath – whose hobby had been yachting – had taken Britain into the EEC (as it was then called) during his premiership, and had grown up in Kent where the coast of France is visible on a clear day. At the time Heath was [[Father of the House of Commons]] and enjoying something of an Indian Summer after the ousting of his political nemesis, the eurosceptic [[Margaret Thatcher]], as Prime Minister in 1990.

In 1999 the ''Daily Telegraph'' published a Garland cartoon, showing the then Conservative leader William Hague as a small boy (this was common in satire at the time, as Hague had first attained national fame as a teenager in the 1970s), while two old sailors – former Foreign Secretary [[David Owen]] and former Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Denis Healey]] – gestured inland and away from a ship labelled "Euro". The two elder statesmen described themselves as pro-European but opposed to British membership of the Single Currency.

===Postcolonialism===
The picture has also appeared in recent explorations of [[postcolonialism]], most notably [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[Midnight's Children]]'', in which the narrator Saleem Sinai partly misremembers and transforms the meaning of the painting, a copy of which hung on his bedroom wall when he was a child.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Ten Kortenaar, "Postcolonial Ekphrasis: Salman Rushdie Gives the Finger Back to the Empire", ''Contemporary Literature'', Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 232-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Record Covers===
Elements of the picture appear on the cover of the Talk Talk album ''[[It's My Life (album)|It's My Life]]''.

The painting is also reproduced in part on the cover of the 1982 single "Almost With You/Life Speeds Up" by [[The Church (band)|The Church]].

'''''The Defense of Champigny''''' is a late [[19th century]] painting by [[Édouard Detaille]]. The painting, done in [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]], depicts the [[Battle of Villiers]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The painting is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

== History ==
'''''The Defense of Champigny''''' depicts a scene from the Battle of Villiers (also referred to as the Battle of Champingny) during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. The battle was fought as part of a series of attempts by the [[French Army|French army]] to disrupt the [[Prussian Army|Prussian army's]] [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|siege of Paris]]. At Villiers, what the French intended to be a small reconnaissance sortie turned into a pitched battle with the Prussians; this fighting in turn caused thousands of casualties on both sides, the partial destruction of the villages of [[Villiers-sur-Marne]] and [[Champigny-sur-Marne]], and the retreat of the French army to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lbdb.com/TMDisplayBattle.cfm?Bid=503|title=Leaders and Battles: Villiers,|date=2005-11-15|access-date=2018-05-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115071638/http://www.lbdb.com/TMDisplayBattle.cfm?Bid=503|archivedate=2005-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Franco-Prussian War, which caused the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]], was a military and political disaster for France. In the post-war period, the idea that France should rise to meet the challenge posed by the [[German Empire]] gained traction in French society. This desire for vengeance  – [[revanchism]] –  was reflected in the art of several prominent French painters, including that of Detaille.&lt;ref&gt;Karine Varley, ''Under the Shadow of Defeat: The War of 1870–71 in French Memory'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Tg8DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT187&amp;lpg=PT187&amp;dq=Detaille+revanchism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kjprZUZDQ_&amp;sig=nepgpJceVy-V69TjRVCDJ4xbSHM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFvMiY1obbAhWQnFkKHdUQBSwQ6AEIQjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Detaille%20revanchism&amp;f=false|title=The Deaths of Henri Regnault|last=Gotlieb|first=Marc|date=2016-06-09|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226276045|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such art commonly depicted the seemingly dilapidated state of the French army during the Franco-Prussian War, with the intent being to show that a revitalized national army was needed to project French power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jay, "Alphonse de Neuville's 'The Spy' and the Legacy of the Franco-Prussian War", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' (1984) 19: pp. 151–162 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1512817 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karine Varley, "The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870–1914". in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Detaille, who came from a military family, served in the French army during the Siege of Paris.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistoryunstuffed.com/edouard-detaille-the-end-of-a-tradition/|title=Édouard Detaille, The End of a Tradition {{!}} Art History Unstuffed|website=arthistoryunstuffed.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On display ===
Detaille originally painted his scene of the battle as part of a wider project to produce a panoramic painting of the battle. His preliminary painting from 1879, titled ''The Defense of Champigny'', is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. Detaille successfully completed a massive 52 × 400 ft panorama (titled the ''Battle of Champigny'') in 1882, but over the years said work was divided into multiple smaller paintings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fragment of the panorama that mirrors ''The Defense of Champigny'' was auctioned off to a private buyer in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2012/old-master-19th-century-european-art-n08826.html Review of a Sothebys auction]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting projects a scene in which French soldiers are fortifying a position in the village of Villiers-sur-Marne in preparation for the Prussian counterattack that historically took place. Men are seen using pickaxes to bore through a wall to allow the French artillery to fire on the Prussians. Other soldiers are occupied with building barricades out of furniture, and in the background more soldiers are seen emptying a house (presumably a ''maison de maître'') of its furnishings for use as barricading materiel. The painting uses muted colors to accentuate the bleakness of the French situation; the ground is a trodden, muddy brown covered with debris, and the sky is dull sunset yellow in reference to the imminent fall of Paris and the Second Empire. In the top center of the painting, shells can be seen exploding against the sky and birds can be seen in flight. A forest of barren trees can also be seen in the background; some are bare due to the battle's being fought in early December, while one tree has been snapped in two by a shell.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436188|title=Édouard Detaille {{!}} The Defense of Champigny {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As far as the French soldiers themselves are concerned, the men are depicted as being haggard but active; some soldiers are seen to be wounded, while many others carry their rifles slung over their shoulders in defiance of traditional military discipline. However, all are active; even the men seen idling in the painting's foreground are depicted as awaiting their officer's command. General Faron of the [[French 1st Corps|French Ist Corp]] and a cadre of officers can be seen in discussion with a gardener immediately to the left of the painting's center. A sense of unease emanates from the painting, as the men (and the viewer) wait for the inevitable Prussian attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MxNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=The+Defense+of+Champigny+impressionism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ednLEGSJcK&amp;sig=GRuZvU5zyd9SmSYK3it4TrFHyxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHoI__4YbbAhVlhuAKHdB4BbIQ6AEIVjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Defense%20of%20Champigny%20impressionism&amp;f=false|title=The world's painters since Leonardo: being a history of painting from the renaissance to the present day|last=Pattison|first=James William|date=1906|publisher=Duffield|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they are officers or enlisted men, the French soldiers are portrayed in such a way as to be visually realistic while at the same time being portrayed in romanticized situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is in keeping with Detaille's inclusion in the school of [[academic art]], which borrowed heavily from [[Romanticism]]. The painting is also an example of Detaille's penchant for [[military art]].&lt;ref name="dear"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dearinger|first=David Bernard|title=Paintings and Sculpture in the Collection of the National Academy of Design: 1826–1925|year=2004|publisher=Hudson Hills|location=Manchester, Vermont|isbn=9781555950293|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Paintings_and_Sculpture_in_the_Collectio.html?id=PHH45aYubp4C|author2=Stanley Ellis Cushing|editors=Virginia Wageman and Phil Freshman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Gruffalo's Child''''' by [[Julia Donaldson]] and [[Axel Scheffler]] is the bestselling sequel to ''[[The Gruffalo]]''.

The story is about the Gruffalo's child (a daughter) who, despite her father's warning, sets off into the "deep dark wood" to find the "big bad mouse", the only thing her father is afraid of.

During her winter journey, she encounters the tracks of snake, owl, and fox from ''The Gruffalo'', each of whom she first suspects to be the "big bad mouse", but who in turn tell her where she can find the real "big bad mouse". Eventually, concluding she has been tricked by the animals (and perhaps her father), she sadly admits that she "doesn't believe in the 'big bad mouse{{'"}}.

At this point, she encounters the little mouse from ''The Gruffalo'', who previously tricked her father. The mouse invites her to meet the "big bad mouse", which he re-creates by using moonlight to project a tremendously enlarged, fearsome shadow. Believing the shadow to belong to the real "big bad mouse", the Gruffalo's child flees and returns to the Gruffalo cave with faith in her father restored.

The story repeats the "brains over brawn" theme, the creatures, and the easily flowing rhyme scheme ([[tetrameter]]) of its predecessor, ''The Gruffalo''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">'''The Japanese Art Society of America''' (JASA) promotes the study and appreciation of [[Japanese art]]. Founded in 1973 as the Ukiyo-e Society of America by collectors of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese prints]], the Society's mission has expanded to include related fields of Japanese art.

==History==
While the Society now addresses all aspects of Japanese art and culture, it traces its origins to a small group of [[ukiyo-e]] print collectors in and around New York City in 1973, at a time when Parke-Bernet Galleries (later to merge with [[Sotheby's]]) had begun to develop a market for Japanese art. The first major auction was the 1969 sale of the Blanche McFetridge estate, consisting of ukiyo-e prints once owned by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], followed by the 1972 sale of the estate of Hans Popper (1904–1971), a Viennese businessman who spent time working in Japan. His collection included masterpieces by [[Harunobu]], [[Utamaro]], [[Sharaku]] and [[Hokusai]], and the sale attracted many of the great collectors and dealers of the era, including [[Richard Pillsbury Gale]] (1900–1973) in Minnesota, [[Felix Tikotin]] (1893–1986), a dealer living in Switzerland, and Nishi Saiju (1927–1995), the first Japanese dealer to attend a sale in the United States.

JASA entered its fourth decade under the direction of [[Joan Baekeland]] as president, and the long-time Chicago collector George Mann as vice president. The current president is Dr. Susan Peters. Today, JASA has some 400 members from countries around the world, including Japan.

==Activities==
Through its annual lectures, seminars and other events, the Society provides a forum for the exchange ideas and experiences about traditional and contemporary arts of Japan.

The Society also sponsors exhibitions, such as ''Designed for Pleasure: The World of Edo Japan in Prints and Paintings, 1680–1860'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasociety.org/media/press-releases/asia-society-presents-major-exhibition-japanese-woodblock-prints-and-paintings/ Asia Society Presents Major Exhibition of Japanese Woodblock Prints And Paintings]&lt;/ref&gt; which was shown at Asia Society in New York City in Spring 2008.

==Programs and publications==
Programs for members and the public remain the focus of the Society: in 2009, for example, members had tea in the Japanese teahouse at [[Kykuit]], the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills near Tarrytown, New York; visited private and public collections in Sacramento and San Francisco; and toured the Richard Fishbein and Estelle Bender Collection as well as the mini-museum of the [[Mary Griggs Burke|Mary Griggs Burke Collection]] in New York City. Lecture programs in New York are held at the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]] and elsewhere. 

The programs and publications of the Society were valuable in the 1970s, when ukiyo-e studies and, for that matter, [[Edo period]] art history had scarcely entered the academic mainstream either in the United States or Japan.{{cn|date=January 2015}} 

The society publishes a quarterly newsletter for members as well as an annual journal, ''Impressions.'' ({{ISSN|1095-2136}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japaneseartsoc.org/publications.htm/ Japanese Art Society publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Art Index'', Jan. 2010, New York, H. W. Wilson Co., Vol. 81, No. 1, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Impressions'' was the recipient of the 2009 Donald Keene Prize for the Promotion of Japanese Culture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keenecenter.org/content/view/53/75/ 2009 Donald Keene Prize for the Promotion of Japanese Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; awarded by the [[Donald Keene]] Center, [[Columbia University]].

The '''Royal Albert Dock'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool's Albert Dock gets royal title |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-44368901 |date=6 June 2018|access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. Designed by [[Jesse Hartley]] and [[Philip Hardwick]], it was opened in 1846, and was the first structure in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world.&lt;ref name=p83&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its construction the Albert Dock (as it was formerly known before receiving its Royal status in 2018) was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first [[hydraulic]] [[Crane (machine)|cranes]].&lt;ref name=p46&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as [[brandy]], [[cotton]], [[tea]], [[silk]], [[tobacco]], [[ivory]] and [[sugar]]. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] serving as a base for boats of the [[Home Fleet|British Atlantic Fleet]]. The complex was damaged during [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] on Liverpool, notably during the [[Liverpool Blitz|May Blitz]] of 1941. In the aftermath of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]] was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.

Today the Royal Albert Dock is a major tourist attraction in the city and the most visited multi-use attraction in the [[United Kingdom]], outside [[London]].&lt;ref name="Albert Dock: The Present Day"&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock: The Present Day |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1257 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a vital component of Liverpool's [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage]] [[Maritime Mercantile City]] and the docking complex and warehouses also comprise the largest single collection of [[Grade I]] [[listed buildings]] anywhere in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/cityofculture2008/story/0,,950372,00.html |title=Glory of Greece, grandeur of Rome ... and docks of Liverpool |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=7 March 2003 |author=Helen Carter |access-date=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Grand beginnings and early history===

[[Image:Albert Docks Liverpool.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Albert Dock's design allowed ships to lay up and be loaded and unloaded directly from the large warehouses]]
The history of the Albert Dock dates back to 1837, when Jesse Hartley first began the development of plans for a combined [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] and [[warehouse]] system.&lt;ref name="p83" /&gt; The plans drawn up by Hartley and fellow [[civil engineer]] Philip Hardwick for the Albert Dock were at the time considered quite 'radical', as they envisioned the loading and unloading of ships directly from the warehouses.&lt;ref name=heyday&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction, heyday and decline of the Albert Dock |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/historyofthealbertdock.asp |access-date=26 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906100035/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/historyofthealbertdock.asp |archivedate=6 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea was not new, and as far back as the 1803 Warehousing Act, legislation had been passed to allow this form of development to occur, whilst the concept was first actually used in the construction of [[St Katharine Docks|St Katharine's Dock]] in [[London]], which was opened in 1828.&lt;ref name=p18&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the development process, Hartley was eager to test the fire resistance of any particular design by constructing an {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} dummy structure, filling it with timber and tar, and setting it alight. After testing several structural designs he settled on the combination of [[cast iron]], [[brick]], [[sandstone]] and [[granite]].&lt;ref name="p20"/&gt; The design was submitted for [[planning permission]] in 1839 although it wasn't until 1841, when the [[Act of Parliament|bill]] authorising the design of the dock was eventually passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], that construction was allowed to begin.&lt;ref name=p19&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock History |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=2 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jesse Hartley.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Jesse Hartley]]
The site chosen for the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by [[Salthouse Dock]] to the east, the entrance channel to [[Canning Dock]] to the north and by [[Duke's Dock]] to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a [[pub]], several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard.&lt;ref name=p20&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of '[[Navvies]]' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.&lt;ref name=p23&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dock complex was officially opened in 1846 by [[Albert, Prince Consort]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]] and the man in honour of whom it was named. This event marked the first occasion in [[Liverpool]]'s history in which a member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] had made a state visit to the city and as a result the occasion was marked with a major celebrations.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of people turned out for the Royal visit with the newspaper ''The Pictorial Times'' noting the reception Prince Albert received:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His reception was most enthusiastic; balconies were erected along the line of procession, and these and the windows of houses were filled with gay and animated parties. There was a most brilliant display of flags, banners &amp; c. [sic]. All business is suspended. There are 200,000 strangers in town, and all the inhabitants are in the streets. All is gaiety and splendour." (''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).&lt;ref name=p13&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Prince was taken on a processional tour through the city, including a visit to the [[Liverpool Town Hall|town hall]] where the royal address was made, before departing aboard the ferry across to the [[Cheshire]] side of the [[Mersey]] and then northwards towards the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=p13/&gt;&lt;ref name=p14&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again this stage of the procession route was laden with onlookers with ''The Pictorial Times'' describing the Prince's entrance into the Albert Dock:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From the Cheshire side of the river the Fairy crossed to the Liverpool side, and returned along the line of docks amidst the cheers of assembled thousands and the roar of artillery. The sight was really magnificent, all the ships in the docks were decked out in gayest colours and the river was crowded with boats filled with people. At half-past two the fairy entered the dock, where were assembled two thousand ladies and gentlemen, the elite of the town; they cheered enthusiastically, which his Royal Highness returned, and in order to gratify the crowd sailed round the dock." (''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).&lt;ref name=p14/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the official opening occurring in 1846, the construction of the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a [[hydraulic]] cargo handling [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] system, the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=p46/&gt; Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the [[Harbourmaster|piermaster]], his assistant &amp; the warehouse superintendent; and a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]age. Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts 1824 - 1854 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1213 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing fortunes and role in the Second World War===

[[Image:Dkbkpl28.jpg|right|thumb|British Empire Dockyards and Ports, 1909]]
The enclosed design of the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within [[Liverpool]]. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including [[brandy]], [[cotton]], [[tea]], [[silk]], [[tobacco]], [[ivory]] and [[sugar]]. At the same time their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as [[hemp]] or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer.&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from [[China]] coming through it and more generally half of all the far eastern trade income.&lt;ref name=p24&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the great prosperity the dock afforded the city, within 20 years of its construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chrimes|1991|p=76}}: "arguably out-of-date before they were built"&lt;/ref&gt; Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes, by the start of the 20th century only 7% of ships into the [[Port of Liverpool]] were sailing vessels.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it.&lt;ref name="p24"/&gt; Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally [[steamship]]s could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than [[sailing ship]]s, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development.&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained an integral part of the dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the [[pump house]] was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.&lt;ref name=hf1860&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts 1860 - 1970 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd|url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1213 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s virtually all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in use for the storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail.&lt;ref name=hf1860/&gt;&lt;ref name=p47&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the [[Admiralty]] and used as base for the [[Home Fleet|British Atlantic fleet]] including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the [[Liverpool Blitz#The May Blitz|May Blitz]] of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack.&lt;ref name=p47/&gt; By the end of the war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage.&lt;ref name=p28&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post War history and decline===

By the time the Second World War had finished the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board]] (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, and if it is broke we still won't fix it'.&lt;ref name=p29&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards [[Europe]], coupled with the advent of [[containerisation]] meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belchem|2006|loc=Chpt. Milne, G.J. "Maritime Liverpool"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I [[listed building]] status.&lt;ref name=hf1860/&gt;

Despite this recognition, the increasing debts of the MDHB meant that by the 1960s the company was eager to get rid of the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land,&lt;ref name=p47/&gt; the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by [[Harry Hyams]].&lt;ref name=p29/&gt; Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=City's Reputation Will Depend Upon Waterfront Plan |newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]] |date=30 May 1966 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the council reluctant to allow such a ''grandiose'' development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of [[Quentin Hughes (architect)|Quentin Hughes]]), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.&lt;ref name=p29/&gt;

[[Image:The Albert Dock from the River Mersey, 1979.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Albert Dock viewed from the [[River Mersey]] in 1979]]
With the MDHB on the verge of bankruptcy a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The [[Brunswick Dock]] gates, which separated the South Docks system from the [[River Mersey]], were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began.&lt;ref name=p48&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p30&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many senses just as the Albert Dock's development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool at the time of its construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.&lt;ref name=belchem&gt;{{harvnb|Belchem|2006|loc=Chpt. Murden, John "City of Change and Challenge: Liverpool Since 1945"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early 1970s plans continued to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock site and the whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including [[Liverpool City Council]]'s suggestion to use the dock basin as a [[landfill]] site. The [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Company]] (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.&lt;ref name=p31&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of [[Merseyside County Council]] (MCC) in 1974 brought new hope that the Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal to take over the running of the south docks.&lt;ref name=hf1972&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts Historic Facts 1972 - 2002 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1313 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), [[Liverpool City Council]] (the local planning authority) and [[Merseyside County Council]] (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans.&lt;ref name="p31" /&gt; Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the 'Minister for Merseyside' [[Michael Heseltine]], set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.&lt;ref name=belchem/&gt;&lt;ref name=p32&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The MDC and regeneration of the Albert Dock===

The creation of the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]] (MDC) in 1981 was part of a [[Development Corporation|new initiative]] launched by the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government that earmarked the regeneration of some {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of Liverpool's south docks, by using public sector investment to create infrastructure within an area that could then in turn be used to attract private sector investment. Thus the MDC was not directly responsible for [[urban renewal|regeneration]] programmes but rather acted as a spearhead, guiding the development process. Upon its formation it immediately created an initial strategy for the area placing a high priority on restoring those buildings that could be restored &amp; demolishing the rest, restoring a water regime within the dock system (including the removal of up to {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} of silt) and general environmental landscaping. As part of the strategy two flagship schemes were set up: the redevelopment of a site in [[Otterspool Promenade|Otterspool]] for the [[International Garden Festival]] and the regeneration of the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name="p32" /&gt;

In 1982 the MDC entered into negotiations with [[London]]-based developers Arrowcroft in order to secure much needed private sector investment. On a visit to the site, Arrowcroft's chairman Leonard Eppel spoke of how the buildings "talked to him" and upon his return to London set about persuading the company's board to take on the project.&lt;ref name=p33&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1983 a deal was signed between Arrowcroft plc and the MDC leading to the creation of the Albert Dock Company, which could now start the process of regenerating the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=creating&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating a museum |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/creatingamuseum.asp |access-date=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720073139/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/creatingamuseum.asp |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albert Dock2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The former Dock Office was for many years the home of [[Granada Television]] in Liverpool.]]
One of the first priorities of the regeneration was the restoration of the dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the [[Brunswick Dock]] gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced &amp; bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired.&lt;ref name=p34&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albert Dock company appointed [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|1999|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of [[Jesse Hartley|Hartley]]'s design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.&lt;ref name=p34/&gt;

Development within the Albert Dock was rapid and the newly renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready in time for the 1984 [[Tall Ships' Races|Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race]]. The race was a big success for the city with over one million visitors into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to [[Granada Television]].&lt;ref name=p35&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Weather docks.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The floating weather map of the British Isles, from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'']]

Spurred by the success of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion refurbishment a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by [[Merseyside County Council]] had previously been located in the [[pilotage]] building and a salvage shed nearby.&lt;ref name=creating/&gt; Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at [[Harrods]]'.&lt;ref name=p36&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albert Dock was officially re-opened in 1988 by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref name=p37&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; the great-great-great-grandson of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the man who had originally opened the docks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal Family Tree |publisher=Britroyals.com |url=http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm |access-date=25 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080913184759/http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm| archivedate= 13 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was timed to coincide with the opening of the newly finished [[Tate Liverpool]], which was dubbed the 'Tate of the north' and at the time the only one outside London.&lt;ref name=p49&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to locate a [[Tate]] gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of [[modern art]] in the North of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Tate Liverpool |publisher=Tate |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/history-of-tate#liverpool |access-date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s new morning television show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', hosted by [[Richard and Judy]], began broadcasting from a studio inside the Albert Dock. As part of the show weather presenter [[Fred Talbot]] used a floating map of the British Isles to report the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warwick |first=Dave |title=Fred Talbot |url=http://www.davewarwick.co.uk/dave_warwick_fred_talbot.htm |access-date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 1990 [[The Beatles Story]] museum opened, the only [[Beatles]] themed visitor attraction in Britain, providing yet another draw to the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=p37/&gt;

Throughout the 1990s development continued including a new hotel and the conversion of vacant space for use by larger companies such as [[Telewest]] (Now Virgin Media).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hodgson |first=Neil |title=Telewest jobs announcement |publisher=icLiverpool |date=14 June 2002 |url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/page.cfm?objectid=11951315&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50061 |access-date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in 2003, some 22 years after the renovation of the Albert Dock started, the last remaining undeveloped space was brought into use with the opening of a new [[Premier Lodge]] hotel in the Britannia Pavilion.&lt;ref name=p37/&gt;

In lieu of the dock's 175 anniversary in 2021, the owners of the dock applied for a royal charter. At a event at Tate Liverpool on 6th June 2018 the royal charter was handed over. The dock will be formally known as Royal Albert Dock Liverpool to avoid confusion with the Royal Albert Dock in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal title for Liverpool's Albert Dock |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-44368901 |website=BBC News |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Alistair |title=New Royal name for the Albert Dock |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/albert-dock-renamed-royal-albert-14748439 |website=liverpoolecho |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural design and construction==

When it was constructed the Albert Dock was considered a [[state of the art]] docking system.&lt;ref name="p24" /&gt; Built almost entirely from [[cast iron]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[brick]], the Albert Dock was designed to be fireproof, and on completion was the world's first non-combustible warehouse system. It provided {{convert|1290000|sqft|m2}} of warehouse space and its dock basin had a water area of {{convert|7.75|acre|ha}}. In its construction over 23 million bricks were used and 47,000 tonnes of mortar.&lt;ref name="p83"/&gt; In total it cost £782,265 (approximately £41m today),&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; whilst today its estimated to be worth £230 million.&lt;ref name=p38&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's design complements many existing construction techniques with, what were considered at the time, radical solutions. The warehouses are supported by large [[load-bearing wall]]s that range from being {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick at the base to {{convert|19|in}} on the fourth level. One of the most advanced architectural features is the use of [[stressed skin]] roofing, which at the time of construction was virtually unheard of. Huge iron [[trusses]] are crossed with [[rivet]]ted and [[galvanised]] [[wrought iron]] plates, creating a shape similar to an upturned boat hull that acts to support the roof above.&lt;ref name=p22&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floors in the warehouses are supported by large iron columns and the spaces between were considered 'highly flexible', as new windows, stairwells and lift shafts could be added without risk to the building's structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock Warehouses |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/albertdock/Albert_Dock_warehouses.asp |access-date=5 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629045643/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/albertdock/Albert_Dock_warehouses.asp|archivedate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albert Dock Liverpool 4.jpg|thumb|left|Huge cast iron columns line the Albert Dock's quayside helping to support the building above]]
The advanced design stretches far beyond what can be seen from the ground. The structures are free from wood, but their foundations contain 13,729 [[Deep foundation|piles]] of timber, which would stretch for {{Convert|48|mi|km}} in length if laid end to end. Such heavily supportive foundations were needed because the construction land was reclaimed from the [[River Mersey]] to build on. Given the '[[quicksand]]' nature of the Mersey's tidal silt the piles were needed to provide maximum stability. The resultant effect of the dock being constructed where it was is that the north and west stacks (now Merseyside Maritime Museum and Colonnades) rise and fall with every tide.&lt;ref name="p20" /&gt;

One of the most notable features of the Albert Dock are the huge cast iron columns that line the quayside.&lt;ref name=p21&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|15|ft|m}} high and almost {{convert|13|ft|m}} in circumference, the columns are based upon the Greek [[Doric style]] of architecture.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesse Hartley|Hartley]]'s decision to use cast iron was an economic one as at the time it was cheaper than [[granite]]. Nonetheless, because of the huge dock walls that were built, the Albert Dock's construction required so much granite that the dock trustee's had to open their own mine in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt;&lt;ref name=p21/&gt; The quality of the build materials used as well as the docks sheer size are considered a strong illustration of the great prosperity that the [[Port of Liverpool]] afforded the city at the time and the building's style is described as [[cyclopean]] [[classicism]].&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

Today the Albert Dock is one of Liverpool's most important tourist attractions and a vital component of the city's [[UNESCO world heritage]] [[Maritime Mercantile City]]. As well as being the number one tourist attraction in Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock |publisher=VisitLiverpool.com|url=http://www.visitliverpool.com/site/albert-dock-p16143 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Albert Dock is also the most visited multi-use attraction in the [[United Kingdom]] outside [[London]], with in excess of four million visitors per year.&lt;ref name="Albert Dock: The Present Day" /&gt; Amongst the many attractions at the Albert Dock are the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], [[the Beatles Story]]  and the [[Tate Liverpool]]. There are also two hotels within the Albert Dock: a [[Holiday Inn]] and [[Premier Inn]] both located in the Britannia Pavilion.&lt;ref name="p82"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the five warehouses around the dock, referred to as A, B, C, D and E, are Grade&amp;nbsp;I listed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1205175|desc= Warehouse A, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1068409|desc= Warehouses B and C, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1280847|desc= Warehouse D, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1068410|desc= Warehouse E, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also listed Grade&amp;nbsp;I is the former dock traffic office.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1356264|desc= Dock Traffic Office, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other buildings around the dock are listed Grade&amp;nbsp;II; they are the former hydraulic pumping station,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1280849|desc= Hydraulic Pumping Station to East of Canning Half-Tide Dock |access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[swing bridge]] leading from the dock towards the Pierhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1356265|desc= Swingbridge, Albert Dock |access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the dock's regeneration in the 1980s a policy had been adopted to try to attract retailers into the newly created premises within. However, after many years of struggling to compete with other major shopping areas in the city, the Albert Dock Company Ltd announced in 2007 a shift into attracting more bars and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gleeson |first=Bill |title= Albert Dock primed for ‘colossal tourism’|publisher=[[Liverpool Daily Post]] |date=6 August 2007 |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/business/business-local/2007/08/06/albert-dock-primed-for-colossal-tourism-64375-19575999/ |accessdate=24 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107095559/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/business/business-local/2007/08/06/albert-dock-primed-for-colossal-tourism-64375-19575999/|archivedate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, bars and restaurants resident in the Albert Dock include Panam Bar &amp; Restaurant, Revolution Bar, Spice Lounge, and Whats Cooking?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock: Food and Drink |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=51 |access-date=24 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014173819/http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=51| archivedate= 14 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Seven Ages of Man''''' is a series of paintings by [[Robert Smirke (painter)|Robert Smirke]], derived from a [[monologue]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[As You Like It]]'', spoken as the melancholy Jaques in Act II Scene VII. The phrase begins as ''[[all the world's a stage]]''. The stages referred are: [[infant]], [[schoolboy]], lover, [[soldier]], [[justice]], [[Pantalone|pantaloon]] and [[old age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Smirke,_Robert_%281752-1845%29_%28DNB00%29 |chapter=Robert Smirke (1752–1845) |title=Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900 |volume=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1st-art-gallery.com/Robert-Smirke/The-Seven-Ages-Of-Man-The-Infant-From-Act-II,-Scene-VII-Of-As-You-Like-It-By-William-Shakespeare-C.1798-1801.html | title=The Seven Ages of Man The Infant from Act II, Scene vii of As You Like it by William Shakespeare c.1798–1801 |publisher=1st Art Gallery Inc. |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/tomkins_peltro_william_as_you_like_it.htm | title=Peltro William Tomkins &amp; Robert Smirke: As You Like It (The Seven Ages of Man: The First Age) |publisher=Art of The Print |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shakespeare.emory.edu/illustrated_showimage.cfm?imageid=277 | title=Shakespeare Illustrated, The Artists: Robert Smirke, 7.

== Background ==
In 1796, Robert Smirke agreed to paint William Shakespeare's ''The Seven Ages of Man'' for [[John Boydell|John]] and [[Josiah Boydell]]'s Shakespeare Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9RhvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 |title=Art, Artisans and Apprentices: Apprentice Painters &amp; Sculptors in the Early Modern British Tradition | publisher=Oxbow Books |first1=James |last1=Ayres |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The seven ages ==
The character [[Jaques (As You Like It)|Jaques]] expresses the ages as the following stages:

[[File:Robert Smirke - The Seven Ages of Man- Second Childishness, 'As You Like It,' II, vii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|''The Old Age'']]
=== The Infancy ===
Just after being born, he is an innocent baby; all the while wailing and crying.  

=== The Schoolboy ===
Here, he begins his schooling; the charms of helpless innocence cease. It is in that stage of life that he begins to go to school. He is unwilling to leave the protected environment of his home as he is still not confident enough to exercise his own discretion.

=== The Lover ===
The lover is depicted as a young man composing his love poems, shown beneath two pictures of [[Cupid]], the god of love and on the left, ''Romeo-Juliet balcony scene''. In this stage, he is always maudlin, expressing his love in a fatuous manner. He makes himself ridiculous in trying to express his feelings.The child in this stage, cares for its beloved the most and is quite concerned about it and is ready to sacrifice its life also to show its affectionate towards it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=i1QiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 | title=The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare and Popular Culture |first1=Robert |last1=Shaughnessy|page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Soldier ===
Here, he is hot-blooded with a high degree of self-respect. He looks forward to gaining a reputation, even if it costs him his life. He is inflamed with the love of war and, like a leopard, he charges.He is very easily aroused and is hot headed. He is always working towards making a reputation for himself, however short-lived it may be, even at the cost of foolish risks.&lt;ref name="Evans_Progress"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=k5RVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+seven+ages+of+man | title=The progress of human life: Shakespeare's Seven ages of man |first1=John |last1=Evans|page={{page needed|date=February 2015}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Justice ===
In this stage he thinks he has acquired wisdom through the many experiences he has had in life and is likely to impart it. He has reached a stage where he has gained prosperity and social status. He becomes vain and begins to enjoy the finer things of life and he attains a socially accepted state and expounds the wisdom he has gained in his life.&lt;ref name="Evans_Progress"/&gt;

=== The Pantaloon ===
He is a shell of his former self — physically and mentally. He begins to become the butt of others' jokes. He loses his firmness and assertiveness, and shrinks in stature and personality and tries to shrink himself into a shell of his worries and is indifferent to his physical appearance and apparel, just as he was in his youth.&lt;ref name="Evans_Progress"/&gt;

=== The Old Age ===
In this stage he is Dependent on others for care and unable to interact with the world, he experiences "second innocence, and mere oblivion. this stage is also known as second infancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JB7PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT108&amp;dq=robert+smirke+as+you+like+it+the+seven+ages+of+man | title=The Shakespeare Gallery | first1=G. |last1=Routledge | year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The monologue ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All the world's a stage,&lt;br /&gt;
And all the men and women merely players.&lt;br /&gt;
They have their exits and their entrances,&lt;br /&gt;
And one man in his time plays many parts,&lt;br /&gt;
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,&lt;br /&gt;
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, the whining school-boy with his satchel&lt;br /&gt;
And shining morning face, creeping like snail&lt;br /&gt;
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,&lt;br /&gt;
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad&lt;br /&gt;
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then, a soldier,&lt;br /&gt;
Full of strange oaths, and  bearded  like the pard,&lt;br /&gt;
Jealous in honour, sudden, and quick in quarrel,&lt;br /&gt;
Seeking the bubble reputation&lt;br /&gt;
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then, the justice,&lt;br /&gt;
In fair round belly, with a good capon lined,&lt;br /&gt;
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,&lt;br /&gt;
Full of wise saws, and modern instances,&lt;br /&gt;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts&lt;br /&gt;
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,&lt;br /&gt;
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,&lt;br /&gt;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide&lt;br /&gt;
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,&lt;br /&gt;
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes&lt;br /&gt;
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,&lt;br /&gt;
That ends this strange eventful history,&lt;br /&gt;
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,&lt;br /&gt;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."
-Act II, Scene VII, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[As You Like It]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=William |last1=Shakespeare |url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/asyoulikeit/full.html |title=As You Like It, Scene 7, Act 2 | accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Traditional metal working in Mexico''' dates from the [[Mesoamerica]]n period with metals such as gold, silver and copper. Other metals were mined and worked starting in the colonial period. The working of gold and silver, especially for jewelry, initially declined after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. However, during the colonial period, the working of metals rose again and took on much of the character traditional goods still have.  Today, important metal products include those from silver, gold, copper, iron, [[tin]] and more made into jewelry, household objects, furniture, pots, decorative objects, toys and more. Important metal working centers include [[Taxco]] for silver, [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] for copper, [[Celaya]] for tin and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] for [[wrought iron]].

==History==

===Prehispanic period===
[[File:AztecGoldPalacioCV.JPG|thumb|150px|Aztec gold ornament from the 16th century at the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca]], Mexico]]
Metal working in Mesoamerica, especially of silver, gold and copper was advanced by the time the Spanish arrived, mostly concentrated in the modern states of [[Michoacán]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Guerrero]].&lt;ref name="fonart"&gt;{{cite book |title= Art popular mexicano al estilo FONART/FONART’s style in Mexican popular art |year=1992 |publisher= Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías |location=Mexico City |isbn=968 29 4019 2|pages= V1-V17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"&gt;Aprahamian, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The mining and working of metals probably came to Mesoamerican cultures from the south. Metal working was principally in gold, silver, tin and lead, with some copper work known in what is now Michoacán.&lt;ref name="jruiz1011"&gt;Ruiz, p.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz106"&gt;Ruiz, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Gold was generally obtained in powder or pellet form in rivers and streams from various sites in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Michoacán, the [[Mexican Plateau|Central Highlands]] and the Mayan region.&lt;ref name="jruiz114"&gt;Ruiz, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz12"&gt;Ruiz, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  As silver rarely appeared on the surface it was almost exclusively mined.&lt;ref name="jruiz12"/&gt;

In the pre Hispanic period, metals were used to create needles, punches, tweezers, weapons and musical instrument but its most important uses, especially gold and silver, was as jewelry for the social elite and as offerings to the gods.&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz15"&gt;Ruiz, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-plateria-como-artesania.html |title=La Plateria |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Silver work |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209205047/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-plateria-como-artesania.html |archivedate=February 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold and silver were worked by hammering, plating and molds the blending of these and some casting was known.&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;  One pre Hispanic technique was to hammer metal flat, punch out a design and then layer this design over wood or leather, often used on shields.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;  Silver was less used in the pre Hispanic period as it was less valued as tribute. It did not have the same divine symbolic value that gold did.&lt;ref name="jruiz15"/&gt;  The use of copper was almost exclusive to the [[Purépecha Empire]] in what is now Michoacán when the Spanish arrived. Copper instruments included axes, hoes, scythes, punches, chisels, needles, pins, arrowheads, brooches, canes, handles, helmets, shields and small bells.&lt;ref name="jruiz106"/&gt;

===Colonial period===

According to tradition, one of the first gifts that [[Hernán Cortés]] received from [[Moctezuma II]] was a pair of discs, one in gold and one in silver, which represented the sun and moon respectively.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; The existence of gold and silver in Mexico was one of the main attractions for the Spanish in the New World, with the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] and subsequent exploration with the aim of finding more of these precious metals. Mining and metal working became a main aspect of the economy of colonial Mexico.&lt;ref name="jruiz1522"&gt;Ruiz, p.15, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the emphasis was on the mining of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, [[platinum]] and tin with much of the metal, especially gold, shipped to Spain.&lt;ref name="jruiz2154"&gt;Ruiz, p.21, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the working of metals in the new colony was heavily restricted or outright banned for several reasons, including protection of Spanish metal guilds, the fact that the work did not contribute to royal taxes and the fear that the indigenous would make weapons.&lt;ref name="jruiz114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aprahamian60"&gt;Aprahamian, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, these soon became impractical to enforce with the restrictions then only to the making of objects related to indigenous religion.&lt;ref name="jruiz21105"&gt;Ruiz, p.21, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish introduced new metalworking techniques, especially the promoting of copper work by [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in Michoacan and various metals by [[Pedro de Gante]] in [[Mexico City]] .&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt; and eventually indigenous craftsmen competed with European ones.&lt;ref name="jruiz21105"/&gt; Most of Mexican colonial metal work copied that in Spain, which was Gothic in style and later Renaissance. These styles eventually defined the handcraft work of areas such as Oaxaca, [[Zacatecas]], [[Durango]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Guanajuato]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;    However, after the Conquest, the making of jewelry in Mexico nearly disappeared, with precious metals shipped to Spain. Only after 1551, with the establishment of a Mexican upper class, did this return slowly. At first Spanish craftsmen arrived to work European methods including [[filigree]], [[repoussé and chasing]], engraving and the incrustation of precious stones. But during the colonial period, these craftsmen never reached the level of their contemporaries in Europe. Indigenous craftsmen were relegated in this area to producing cheaper jewelry with lesser metals.&lt;ref name="jruiz114118"&gt;Ruiz, p.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the relative lack of precious metal work was that in silver, which became more important over the colonial period after the start of trade with Asia in the 17th century. Mexico’s abundance made silver an important form of currency and silver working guilds gained prestige and power, mostly in the creation of coins, silverware, religious medallions, crosses and liturgical items.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz120"&gt;Ruiz, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous silver jewelry often became marked by the use of silver coins as decoration. Trade with the Orient introduced elements to silver pieces such as pearls (later augmented by those found in the [[Gulf of California]]), turtle shell  and colored glass from Europe. The last was particularly popular with indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;  One item that was important in the 18th century were cigarette and snuff cases made of both silver and gold, as the habit of using tobacco became very fashionable among the upper classes. The creation of the cases waned in the 19th as lower classes began to use tobacco as well.&lt;ref name="jruiz122"&gt;Ruiz, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence to the present===
[[File:CombAllende.JPG|thumb|19th century silver comb on display at the Allende House Museum in San Miguel Allende, Guanajuato]]
After the [[Mexican War of Independence]], much of Mexico metalworking continued to follow European trends, with elements added such as Mexican national symbols. Silverwork became less Baroque in nature and more secularized during the 19th century as political antagonism towards the Church grew and became more focused on items such as buttons, cane handles, pocket watches and hair decorations, incrustations as well as jewelry. The indigenous tended to keep more of the colonial era designs especially necklaces with dangling coins, glass and silver figurines, filigree.&lt;ref name="jruiz125"&gt;Ruiz, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

As mines gave out in the 19th and 20th centuries, precious metalworking declined. Traditional utilitarian iron and copper working declined due to industrialization.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"/&gt;  In the mid 20th century, a revival began in silver working in the town of Taxco, even though the area’s mines had given out. It began with the work of American artisan [[William Spratling]], who took traditional Mexican indigenous and colonial designs and gave them new adaptations, then teaching other artisans in the area. Today, Taxco’s silverwork is one of Mexico’s important exports of finished products.&lt;ref name="aprahamian60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz125"/&gt;  Copper working, mostly for utilitarian items and home décor continues in Santa Clara del Cobre, a tradition that has remained since the early colonial period.  These items include bowls, plates, pitchers, vases and their quality has won awards in both Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;

==Jewelry making==
[[File:Artisan assembling pieces in the workshop of Oro de Monte¦ü Alba¦ün.jpg|thumb|left|Artisan assembling silver necklace in Oaxaca]]
[[File:JagNeckMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Silver necklace with ruby, emerald and Mexican opal with two jaguars in confrontation from Guadalajara on display at the Museum of Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
Jewelry making began well before the arrival of the Spanish, with mines providing supplies of metals and stones. The designs of modern Mexican handcrafted jewelry is a mixture of both Spanish and indigenous traditions. Indigenous designs are based on those seen in [[Mesoamerican codices]] and artifacts from archeological sites. Most of Mexico’s fine jewelry is made in silver, with the most important center being Taxco, Guerrero. A lesser known center is [[San Felipe del Progreso]] in the [[State of Mexico]]. Here traditional [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] jewelry has seen a revival, especially the production of earrings used for Mazahua weddings, but also bracelets and necklaces.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In Guanajuato, jewelry making focuses on cast silver in colonial style often decorated with images of birds along with glass beads and pearls.&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;   In [[Pátzcuaro]], artisans made necklaces and earrings of smooth or scratched silver, often with small dangling fish, combined with red and black porcelain beads. In [[Yalalag]], Oaxaca they make silver necklaces with colonial era style crosses.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In [[Huetamo]] and Zitácuaro, they made dangling earrings called arracadas of silver with images of leaves, flowers and birds. In [[Santa María Huazolotitlán|Huazolotitlán]], Oaxaca, they make beaded necklaces with crosses and small animals made of silver.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

While gold jewelry making faded during the colonial period in Mexico, it is still done in a number of places such as Iguala and Taxco in Guerrero. In [[Ometepec]], large and small crosses are made with various metals along with gold necklaces of various colors. Gold filigree is an important trade in [[Chiapas]], often made with local [[amber]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"/&gt;  Fine gold and silver wire is used by craftsmen in Oaxaca, [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], Guerrero and Chiapas to create earrings, necklaces and bracelets with intricate designs.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] region of Michoacán, they make a type of dangling gold earring with the name of “siete lunas” or seven moons.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"/&gt;  In Yucatán rosaries made with gold or gold plated filigree are popular often made with red and pink coral. Turtle shell jewelry is incrusted with gold and silver.   Soplillos are necklaces de cuentas de oro ochavadas in Yucatán.&lt;ref name="artepueblo387"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; Fine jewelry making in [[Campeche]] tends to focus on the creation of earrings and rings with incrustations of gold and silver. Mayan influence can be seen in the large gold chains.&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"/&gt; In [[Quintana Roo]], a type of dangling earring called an arracadas in gold are popular since the 20th century, which includes men of high social status in Mayan communities.&lt;ref name="artepueblo387"/&gt; The creation of gold and silver jewelry is very varied in Oaxaca mixed with various other materials including coral, coins, colored glass and various stones.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"/&gt;

==Silver==
[[File:SilverDishesFMayer.jpg|thumb|Display of silver dishes at the Franz Mayer Museum]]
Despite down from its peak in the colonial era, Mexico is still the number one producer of silver in the world.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; Silver pieces made in Mexico include [[candelabra]]s, jars, platters, necklaces and buttons for [[charro]] outfits.&lt;ref name="artepueblo394"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional silver work in Mexico has its origins in the colonial period, as the metal was not particularly prized in the Mesoamerican era.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srlopez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Temen se pierda orfebreria barroca |first= Sergio Raul |last=Lopez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 18, 2000 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Fear of losing Baroque precious metal work }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican silver from the colonial era to the present can be found in many museum collections around the world.&lt;ref name="artepueblo3896"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; There are still artisans which still make silver pieces in the style of the 17th and 18th centuries. However, these kind of work tends to bring more fame than money.&lt;ref name="srlopez"/&gt; Globalization has affected the design of silver pieces in Mexico as much of it is exported.&lt;ref name="artepueblo3896"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; Most Mexican silver work today is updated designs, a trend that dates from the work of William Spratling in Taxco, making Mexico again a center of export for finished pieces.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"/&gt; The tradition continues here, with some schools that teach the trade but most smiths learn through a term of apprenticeship, often as a part of the family business.&lt;ref name="artepueblo397"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Taxco has been designated a [[Pueblo Mágico]] in part because of its silver work, and it is home to the [[William Spratling Museum]], which has a collection of this silver work.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

The number of artisans who can do traditional Mexican silver work is dwindling.&lt;ref name="srlopez"/&gt; To help preserve the tradition, every two years the Hugo Salinas Price National Silver Prize is awarded to Mexican silversmiths in various categories. It is sponsored by the Fomento Cultural Grupo Salinas, the [[Secretariat of Social Development|Secretaría de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL)]], the [[National Fund for the Development of Arts and Crafts|Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías (FONART)]] and the [[Museo de Arte Popular]]. The purpose is to promote the craft in the country both in Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="salinas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fomentoculturalgruposalinas.com.mx/quehacemos/concursoplata.aspx |title= Importancia del premio |publisher=Fomento Cultural Grupo Salinas|location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Importance of the prize |accessdate=December 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copper==
[[File:TablewareSCCobre.JPG|thumb|Copper products for sale in [[Santa Clara del Cobre]], Michoacán]]
While copper was worked in some parts of Mesoamerica, modern Mexican tradition is Spanish in origin.&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Copper working was initially ignored by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s as they were looking for gold and silver. It was not shipped to Spain as much as the other two. Instead, it eventually became important for the creation of utilitarian items, especially domestic items such as pots and pans.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"/&gt; Today, the center of traditional copper work in Mexico is the state of Michoacán, especially the municipality of Santa Clara del Cobre.  One traditional hammered copper object is a large vessel in which pork fat is rendered or sugar caramelized for making candies. Every year during the month of August [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] holds a copper festival.&lt;ref name="hossack24"&gt;{{cite book |title= Handmade Style Mexico |last= Hossack |first= Karin |year=1999 |publisher= Chronicle Books |location= San Francisco |isbn=0-8118-2567-1 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron==
[[File:LagunillaAntiques08.JPG|thumb|Antique iron tools and other items at the [[La Lagunilla Market, Mexico City]] ]]
Iron was not worked in the Mesoamerican period, with its mining and working introduced by the Spanish.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration of the metal was initially banned to protect the industry in Spain, but as tools made from the metal were essential for exploration and conquest, the prohibition was soon ignored.&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo402"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the items were purely utilitarian such as tools, locks, horseshoes and tools.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the colonial period, iron began to be used in other ways, including decorative elements in churches and mansions such as railings and balconies.&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt; The height of traditional Mexican ironworking was in the 17 and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt;

Initially the main iron working centers were Puebla and Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt; Oaxacan iron was exceptionally malleable and light allowing for intricate designs and tools not possible with other types of iron. Most Oaxacan iron objects date from the 17th and 18th centuries and include locks, furniture and scissors, often with intricate designs etched on them.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401402"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:San Cristobal - Templo Caridad - Kreuz.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Iron cross on the Templo de Caridad in San Cristobal de las Casas]]
By the end of the 18th century, there were important iron working centers in Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico City, Guanajuato and [[Querétaro]], as well as western Mexico such as [[Guadalajara]], Zacatecas and [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]], which eventually developed its own style. Western Mexican ironwork is distinguished by oriental influence due to trade with [[Manila]] as well as the use of iron for decorative purposes on wooden objects.&lt;ref name="artepueblo406"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aleyniers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leyniers |first=A |date=May–August 2008 |title=El hierro forjado artístico en Zacatecas |trans-title=The artistic wrought iron of Zacatecas |journal=XII JORNADAS DE INVESTIGACIÓN Revista Investigación Científica |volume=4 |issue=2 |location=Zacatecas |publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas |language=Spanish |issn=1870-8196 |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |url=http://www.uaz.edu.mx/cippublicaciones/ricvol4num2tom1/Arte%20y%20cultura/Elhierro.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032831/http://www.uaz.edu.mx/cippublicaciones/ricvol4num2tom1/Arte%20y%20cultura/Elhierro.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handcrafted wrought iron is still important in [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[León, Guanajuato|Leon]], [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|city of Guanajuato]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Teocaltiche]], [[Jalisco]], [[Morelia]], San Felipe de los Herreros, Michoacán, Mexico City, [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] and [[Amozoc de Mota]].  It is used to make garden and home furniture, lamps, chimneys and chimney tools.&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aleyniers"/&gt; [[San Cristobal de las Casas]] is known for the creation of intricate crosses made of wrought iron, popular as symbols of divine protection.&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"/&gt;

==Tin==
[[File:Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos votive 1911.jpg|thumb|Traditional votive painting on tin from 1911]]
In the colonial period, tin was worked for its functional rather than aesthetic value. It was created and sold in standard sheets, which were then cut, folded and joined to make various objects. These sheets also became a traditional base for [[Votive paintings of Mexico|folk ex votos]].&lt;ref name="mortiz"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tin exhibit mirrors wit, religion of Mexico |first= Mario G. |last=Ortiz |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|location=Milwaukee, WI |date=Sep 8, 1992 |page=OZWC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, tin and other sheet metals, often from industrial waste, is still used to create decorative and functional objects such as castles, churches, masks, airplane models, saints, nativity scenes, contains, mirror frames, chandeliers, lamps, trays and plates.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mortiz"/&gt; Another important line is toys, which are painted in bright enamels, especially in Celaya and San Miguel de Allende.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Other important centers include Oaxaca, [[Irapuato]], Mexico City, Puebla, [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|Tlaxcala]] and [[Tlaquepaque]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;

==Other metals==
[[File:BrassFliesMAPDF.JPG|thumb|150px|Necklace with brass insect decoration at the Museo de Arte Popular]]
[[Brass]], tin and iron are used to create old fashioned lamps, decorative items for the home as well as furniture and sculptures.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; The creation of brass and [[bronze]] objects was introduced by the Spanish. Bronze was mostly used for the casting of church bells, some tools and decorative elements on iron railings. The indigenous adapted it to the use of small bells used in ceremonial dances. Brass was used for many different types of implements, mostly for domestic use.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lead]] miniature figures are made for collectors although originally they are created as toys for children. They typically include soldiers, furniture, boats, machines and more in Romantic styles from the 19th century and before.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Celaya makes a wide variety of miniature for doll houses including figures, furniture, and decorations. Another popular line is toy soldiers. Most pieces are made with molds, some of which date from the 19th century, then painted.&lt;ref name="artepueblo417"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

The main producer of handcrafted metal eating utensils is the city of Oaxaca, with fine silverware produced in Taxco. Other areas that make this are in [[Cualac, Guerrero|Cualac]], [[Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero|Ciudad Altamirano]], [[Ayutla, Jalisco|Ayutla]], and [[Tecpan de Galeana]] in Guerrero, especially blades such as utility knives and [[machete]]s.&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7658">The [[Grateful Dead]] had worked on songs in the early 1990s for an [[album]], but it was never completed.&lt;ref name="Sclafani 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; This has sometimes been referred to as the '''unfinished last Grateful Dead album'''&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; and '''The Missing Album'''.&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; The band began work on a new album in February 1992, which was incomplete. After [[Jerry Garcia]]'s death, the band had considered finishing the album,&lt;ref name="Simon 1999"/&gt; but it never came into fruition.&lt;ref name="Sclafani 2013"/&gt;

==Overview==
In the early 1990s, the Grateful Dead had been working on new songs. When [[Jerry Garcia]] had died in 1995, the band decided to break up and this album never was able to be finished.&lt;ref name="Sclafani 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; Work on the unfinished album began in February 1992 in West Marin County in California, at a studio the band called "the Site", which was located on a hill with scenic views and occasional views of wildlife.&lt;ref name="Sclafani 2013"/&gt; At the time, Jerry Garcia was not particularly interested or focused upon the project, which discouraged its impetus.&lt;ref name="Sclafani 2013"/&gt; The studio session work did not have any lead vocals from songs that Garcia performed lead vocals on, and Garcia's guitar work on the tracks was described as "rudimentary."&lt;ref name="Relix 2015"/&gt; The tracks for the new album were incomplete.&lt;ref name="Dodd Spaulding 2000"/&gt;

In 1995, [[Phil Lesh]] was performing studio work on the unfinished album.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; At this time, Lesh stated that the album "... doesn't have much Jerry on it",&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; referring to Garcia. In 1997, [[Bob Weir]] stated that the album could potentially be completed, but that it would take additional collaboration from the remaining band members.&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; Weir and others stated at this time that they expected for a collaboration to finish the album to occur sometime in 1998.&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; In August 1999, Lesh stated that he felt the content from the studio sessions did not merit use on an album, and that efforts to improve the content would not equate to what Garcia would have performed.&lt;ref name="Relix 2015"/&gt; In 1999, Dennis McNally, spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, stated that using another guitarist to fill-in for Garcia "would have been unconscionable", and that "without Garcia, there is no last album." So the album never came into fruition.&lt;ref name="Sclafani 2013"/&gt;

The album ''[[So Many Roads (1965–1995)]]'' has six songs from live concert performance and rehearsal tracks from the unfinished Grateful Dead album.&lt;ref name="Simon 1999"/&gt;

This album would have had the most variety of lead singers for songs of any of the Grateful Dead's studio albums. There were four singers: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and [[Vince Welnick]].

==Fan renditions==
[[Deadhead|Fans]] and book authors have created their own albums that could represent what they had been working on. An example of this is the mock-album ''Days Between (The Final Album That Never Was),'' put together by Tony Sclafani, author of the 2013 book ''The Grateful Dead FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Greatest Jam Band in History''. This would-be album is sketched out in Chapter 35 of his book; he also put together a video on YouTube, made up of studio and live recordings, so fans could hear what the album might have sounded like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V-HXABGKQoA|title=Grateful Dead - Days Between (The Final Album That Never Was)|date=6 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sclafani 2013"/&gt;

Another fine example of this is So Many Roads (1995, Full Album), a video on YouTube which collects studio quality recordings of the songs that were slated to be on the album. It also only has 10 tracks instead of twelve; the exclusions are "Samba in the Rain", and "If the Shoe Fits" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lM4BhQq9UE So Many Roads - The Grateful Dead (Full Album)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Jonas Vertical Roll.jpg|thumb|Still from ''Vertical Roll'']]
'''''Vertical Roll''''' is a 1972 [[video art]] piece by American video and [[performance art|performance]] artist [[Joan Jonas]]. It is a sequel to Jonas' first video work ''Organic Honey's Visual Telepathy''. Jonas' interfacing with the material grammar of video was significant to the late 1960s and early 1970s experimentation with new video technology. Among others, [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Nam June Paik]] and [[Peter Campus]] also contributed to the emergent material discourse of video art.

==The video==
Shot in [[Ace Gallery]] Los Angeles, Vertical Roll features Jonas performing a series of actions under her [[alter-ego]] ''Organic Honey'', the [[belly dancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.utah.edu/~klm6/3905/vertical_roll.html "Joan Jonas: Vertical Roll"], The University of Utah, Accessed 04-26-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The video was shot during one of the rehearsals for Jonas' ''Organic Honey'' performance, and while it is mostly based off the structure of a vertical roll it does contain some images from ''Visual Telepathy''.&lt;ref name=five10&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finklepearl|first1=Tom|last2=Jonas|first2=Joan|title=Joan Jonas:five works|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|location=Queens Museum of Art|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Jonas the video offered a new means to approach perception and offer "multiple and simultaneous points of view".&lt;ref name=five10/&gt; Vertical Roll provided Jonas a means to explore the disjunction between performance and a recording of that performance. She places a heavy emphasis on time, and both physical and mental space in her explanation of the work.

===The Vertical Roll===
''Vertical Roll'' combines both video and the performance space. As an installation alongside the ''Organic Honey'' performance it makes use of both live action and recorded video.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Hanhardt, "From Screen to Gallery: Cinema, Video and Installation Art Practices" in "American Art" Vol 22, No. 2., (The University of Chicago Press, Summer 2008), Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; The performance, on and off camera, plays on the disjunction between the two modes of presentation. Jonas' intentional mediation of "the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies"&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt; causes the image being displayed to repeatedly travel vertically from the bottom of the screen to the top resulting in the "[[synch roll|vertical roll]]" for which the piece is titled. The vertical roll, in and of itself, is one "of the primary technical features of video".&lt;ref name=Crimp130&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crimp|first1=Douglas|title=Sloan Jonas: Scripts and Descriptions|date=1982|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|page=130|chapter=De-Synchronization in Joan Jonas's Performances'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonas' manipulation of the vertical hold function on a CRT monitor to mimic the vertical movement of film through a projector, placing the piece in clear dialog with the cinematic tradition.&lt;ref name="Martin Kremer 2004 p. 10-19"&gt;Martin Kremer, "Get rid of the Knots" in ''Afterall: A Journal of Art, Context, and Enquiry'', Issue 9 (Spring/Summer 2004), The University of Chicago Press on behalf of Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, University of the Arts London, p. 10-19&lt;/ref&gt; This dialog is seen in Jonas' technical handling of the video in which video "shifts have to become registered either by camera movement... or by cutting".&lt;ref name=Krauss&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krauss|first1=Rosalind|title=Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism|journal=October|date=1976|issue=1|pages=60–61|doi=10.2307/778507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast as an “electronic erotic seductress,” the multiple costumes and roles performed by Jonas critically examine the ever-changing, but consistently unequal roles of women. The ''Organic Honey'' videos showcased Jonas' early exploration into "the narcissistic qualities of video"&lt;ref&gt;Tom Finklepearl, Joan Jonas, ''Joan Jonas: Five Works'' eds. Warren Niesluchowski, Valerie Smith (New York: Queens Museum of Art, 2003), p. 6, Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; and would later provide the foundation for proceeding video works. The camera [[gaze]]s at Jonas, [[Feminist film theory#the gaze and female spectatorship|implicating]] the viewer in the work and further, with her body. Jonas presents her collection of images through multiple perspectives that are dependent "in terms of the camera's distance and its orientation to horizontal ground".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; The de-synchronization of the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies results in the constant wiping away of the images on screen which renders the images recognizable but gives them the illusion of being invisible. The illusion created is perceptual. it is "one of a continuous dissolve through time and space".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; ''Vertical Roll'' introduces the paradigm of the body existing in a space between the video and the monitor. The monitor becomes a metaphorical stand-in for the reel and this metaphor is only further enhanced through the continuous action of the vertical roll which references the "physical reality of the tape deck".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Creating a sense of fragmentation, the vertical roll relentlessly pounds at the images of the artist as she moves through a series of performed identities. Characterized a "disjunctive self portrait" by the [[Electronic Arts Intermix]], the image content of the work is strongly mediated by the mirror-like function of the camera, scrutinized by the lens and subjected to violence by the vertical roll.&lt;ref&gt;"Vertical Roll" Electronic Arts Intermix, 2013. http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-synchronization===
The disparity between the video monitor, the repeating percussive sound, and the on-screen image are examples of the use of de-synchronization as a conceptual tool for revealing the contingency of [[Sensory analysis#Perception|perceptual]] experience. This disparity relies on the instability of Jonas' images juxtaposed with their cementation as visible through the use of the video medium.&lt;ref name=Crimp9&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crimp|first1=Douglas|title=Sloan Jonas: Scripts and Descriptions|date=1982|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|page=9|chapter=De-Synchronization in Joan Jonas's Performances'}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the perceptual confusions created in Jonas' ''Vertical Roll'' can be seen in the sequence where "Jonas bangs a spoon against a mirror, creating the illusions of a relationship between the sounds and the image disturbance".&lt;ref name=Crimp130/&gt; Jonas matches action and sound to the timing of the vertical roll &lt;ref name="Video is Being Invented"&gt;Bruce Kurtz, [http://vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VidBeingInvented.pdf "Video is Being Invented"] in "Arts Magazine" (1973), p. 41,Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; which creates the idea of simultaneous occurrences in the video.

Temporality is made a part of ''Vertical Roll'' through the disjunctive nature of the video, and this sense of time is "understood as propulsion towards an end."&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Time is visualized through a constant wiping away of the image. Through de-synchronization, the artist posed a challenge to the supposed [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of experience from the senses, potentially uncovering pretenses or dispositions that inform the processing of sensory data.&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt; The images on screen seem to decompose in their constant scanning from the bottom to the top of the screen.&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Jonas further enhances the effects of de-synchronization through her movements which are "choreographed in relation to the action of the vertical roll."&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt;

Jonas explores the notion of the frame extensively in ''Vertical Roll'' as an expression of “standing one’s ground against external forces.” &lt;ref name="Martin Kremer 2004 p. 10-19"/&gt; By recording  a CRT playing back video, Jonas creates a frame within a frame, and then creating the image that the frame is collapsing in on itself every half second or so by adjusting the vertical roll on the monitor. While visually excluding the outside world nearly the entire piece, sounds accompanying the crashing frame dictate some kind of external operator attempting to beat along with the CRT’s image, expanding the scope of the piece beyond the video. In the concluding moments of her video Jonas breaks the frame entirely when she inserts her head in between the camera and the monitor, entering from the outer edge of the frame, destroying the symbolic wall the camera creates and adding another level of spatial fragmentation and self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Artists' Video: An International Guide|last = Zippay|first = Lori|publisher = Electronic Arts Intermix|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of Jonas' head is an act of agency independent of the vertical roll. It renders the vertical roll visible and reveals the space of the video to the viewer,&lt;ref name=Crimp130/&gt; shattering its perceptual illusion. The disjunction caused by the concluding moments of this video highlights the implications of video presented, or displayed, in the space of the monitor.&lt;ref name="Video is Being Invented"/&gt;

Jonas claims that Vertical Roll finds a likeness to [[The Garden of Forking Paths]] a work by [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref name=five10/&gt;

'''Vincent Callebaut''' (b. May 27, 1977 - ) is a Belgian ecological [[architect]]. He designs futuristic-like [[ecodistrict]] projects which take account of several aspects of sustainability (renewable energies, biodiversity, urban agriculture).

==Biography==

Vincent Callebaut was born in 1977 in Belgium. He graduated in 2000 from the Institute [[Victor Horta]], he moved to Paris to intern with architects [[Odile Decq]] and [[Massimiliano Fuksas]] and then founded his own company, « ''Vincent Callebaut Architectures'' ».

==Virtual projects==

===Dragonfly===

The project consists on implementing "[[Vertical farming|vertical farms]]" in [[Manhattan]] along the East River at the South edge of the Roosevelt Island. In a way to rethink the city's food production and encourage each inhabitant to participate to the gardens, one of the visions of the Dragonfly project was defined as: 'Eating an apple just picked out of a collective orchard in the fourth floor while looking at New York through the window and then go back to your office just in the upper floor.'&lt;ref name="culturebox"&gt;{{cite web|title=culturebox|url=http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/tendances/architecture/architecte-visionnaire-vincent-callebaut-invente-la-ville-de-demain-148595|website=culturebox.francetvinfo.fr|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was inspired by the Japanese movie "[[Castle in the Sky|Laputa : Castle in the sky]]".&lt;ref name="FranceAmerique"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragonfly|url=http://www.france-amerique.com/articles/2009/07/31/dragonfly_une_ferme_dans_un_gratte-ciel.html|website=france-amerique.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragonfly building is {{convert|575|m}} high, shaped as firefly wings. It is composed of two towers related by a 'bio-climatic' glasshouse.  It deploys itself between two crystalline wings made out of glass and steel. The structure in honeycomb stitch allows the sunlight to pass through the building.&lt;ref name="urbanism" /&gt; This concept is seen as a feeder farm and reconnects the consumers with producers. This prototype of urban farm would have superimposed 132 floors and estending {{convert|600|m}} vertically with garden vegetables, fields, production of meat, milk, poultry and eggs where people could grow their own food. The Dragonfly can accommodate 28 different agricultural fields for the production. It is self-sufficient in energy, water and bio-fertilizing, powered by sunshield and eolian systems. These combine solar and wind power, which would make the Dragonfly self-sufficient.&lt;ref name="inhabitat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inhabitat|url=http://inhabitat.com/dragonfly-urban-agriculture-concept-for-ny/|website=inhabitat.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Everything is recyclable in a continuous auto-feeding so that nothing is lost.  The spaces between the wings are designed to take advantage of solar energy by accumulating warm air in the structure during winter. During the summer it is cooling which is facilitated through natural ventilation and "evapo-perspiration" from the plants.&lt;ref name="inhabitat" /&gt;

The objectives of the Dragonfly project were defined as:
*Creating a proximity between the inhabitants and their productions.
*Reducing intermediaries in the production mode.
*Getting close to self-sufficiency which leads to financial savings.&lt;ref name="urbanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragonfly|url=http://projets-architecte-urbanisme.fr/projet-dragonfly-de-vincent-callebaut-ferme-verticale-dans-new-york/|website=Architecture Urbanisme|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lilypad===
{{Main| Floating ecopolis}}
The Lilypad or [[Floating ecopolis]] project is based on the idea of creating a place for future refugees of [[Current sea level rise]] caused by [[Global warming]].

=== Tao Zhu Yin Yuan ===

Formerly called "Agora Garden", Vincent Callebaut designed a tower for [[Taipei]], promoting vertical construction in an overpopulated city.&lt;ref name=FranceInter&gt;

 | accessdate= 2 December 2014
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept of eco-construction to reduce the carbon footprint of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Dezeen&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent Callebaut Architectures SARL replied to an invitation to tender in November 2010. As of 2014 the project is under construction, and due for completion in 2016.&lt;ref name=culturebox/&gt;

The shape of the building looks like a molecule of [[DNA]] with its [[double helix]] (but in opposite [[chirality]] of most common (known) B-form DNA). This was designed to represent a symbol of life and [[wikt:dynamism|dynamism]].&lt;ref name=FranceInter/&gt; The surface area is about {{convert|50000|m²}}.

The aim of the project is to represent a perfect [[symbiosis]] between humans and nature. Vincent Callebaut aims to develop an avant-gardist architecture and tries to institute a new life style in harmony with nature. The building is intended to guarantee environmental norms in order to obtain the Green Building Label delivered by the Home Affairs Ministry of Taipei.

The project addresses four ecologic objectives of the [[Copenhagen Accord]]:&lt;ref name=Dezeen/&gt;

* Reduction of [[global warming]]
* Protection of biodiversity.
* Protection of the environment and quality of life
* Management natural resources and waste

The Agora Garden concept embraces the [[Cradle to Cradle]] philosophy: "nothing is lost and everything transforms itself" ([[Antoine Lavoisier]]). All materials are recycled or recyclable in order to imitate the processes of natural ecosystems. For example, at the top there is a huge free access garden covered by photovoltaic panels which produce electricity for the building. The tower is surrounding by {{convert|20|m|adj=on}} trees which increase the biodiversity in the city.&lt;ref name=Dezeen/&gt;

Agora Garden was planned as twenty levels in a double helix formation, with a total twist from bottom to top of ninety degrees. The twist satisfies four major objectives. Firstly, thanks to this architecture, the morphology of the building changes according to its orientation: On the East/West side we can see a rhomboidal pyramid, when one the North/South side we can see a reverse pyramid. Then, all flats have their own balconies looking like a [[hanging garden]]. Thirdly, there is no vis-à-vis so inhabitants have privacy and a panoramic view on Taipei.&lt;ref name=FranceInter/&gt; &lt;!-- And number four has gone missing? --&gt;

The six main components of the project are :
* The forestair{{clarify|date=November 2017}}: the building is bordered by a forest which ensures the privacy of the inhabitants. The light is over present{{clarify|date=November 2017}} and the car parks, the swimming pool and the fitness area are naturally ventilated.
* Indoor and outdoor areas are well connected thanks to all the bay windows.
* The central core is composed of two staircases, four high speed elevators, a car elevator and two sky garages.
* The apartments measure {{convert|650|m2}}. This could seem large for European people but in Taiwan it is not uncommon for large families of three generations to live together in one flat.
* The landscapes balconies project is to build gardens which cover the entire building and in this way reeintroduce an element of nature to the city. Inhabitants can cultivate fruits, vegetables and herbs so that they could be self-sufficient. Therefore, this gardens take part of the sustainability process. There are compost spaces to transform waste into organic fertilizers, and reservoirs to collect rainwater.
* At a height of {{convert|100|m}}, a {{convert|1000|m²}} [[pergola]] with photovoltaic covering generates electricity for the network of the building.

===The Gate===

The Gate is under construction in Cairo (Egypt). It is a multi-use complex with housing, work spaces and facilities like sports. The roof top is a garden where you can swim or run.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">[[File:Mann Von Hirschlanden.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A copy of the Hirschlanden warrior, on display at the findspot.]]
The '''''Warrior of Hirschlanden''''' (''Krieger von Hirschlanden'' in German) is a [[statue]] of a nude [[phallic symbol|ithyphallic]] [[warrior]] made of [[sandstone]], the oldest known [[Iron Age]] life-size anthropomorphic statue north of the Alps. It was a production of the [[Hallstatt culture]], probably dating to the 6th century BC. It is now in the [[Landesmuseum Württemberg|Württembergisches Landesmuseum]] in [[Stuttgart]], with a copy at the Hirschlanden site (now [[Ditzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]), where it was found. The preserved height is 1.50 m, but the feet have been broken off.

==Description==
The warrior wears a [[torc]] (neck-ring), a belt with a typical late Hallstatt dagger, and a pointed hat, possibly made (as with the real hat in the princely grave of [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]]) of birchbark.

While the legs are modelled with some realism, the upper body is rather schematic and the face is extremely sketchy, leading to speculation that the man might be intended to be seen as wearing a mask, as is known from burials in Klein-Klein, Styria, Austria, [[Trebeništa]] (Macedonia) and the much earlier shaft-graves of [[Mycenae]], ca. 1500 BC.

The statue shows significant weathering, suggesting that it stood exposed to the elements for a long time before being buried.  Other anthropomorphic statues of the early Iron Age have been found in Rottenburg, Tübingen, Stammheim and Stockach (all Baden-Württemberg, Germany), but they are far more stylised, more carving than statue.  In the following [[La Tène period]], anthropomorphic statues are still very rare, but examples include the finds from [[Glauberg]] (Hessen, Germany), Holzgerlingen (Baden-Württemberg, Germany), the [[Mšecké Žehrovice Head]] (Bohemia), and the sculptures at [[Roquepertuse]].

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influence (''[[Kouros|kouroi]]'') has been discussed. Numerous black figure vessels from fortified settlements of the period attest trading contacts with the Mediterranean, probably via the [[Rhône River]] and the Greek colony of [[Marseilles|Massilia]] ([[Marseille]]). Much closer stylistic connections exist with the far more elaborate statues from [[Capestrano]], Picenium, [[Italy]] (650-550 BC) and Casale Marittimo (middle of the 7th century).

==History==
The statue was found in Hirschlanden (now [[Ditzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]) in 1963 when a low [[tumulus|barrow]] was excavated. The barrow was surrounded by a [[stone circle]] and a [[dry stone wall]]. It contained 16 burials, ranging from the very beginning of the Iron Age (Hallstatt D1, ca. 600 BC) to the beginning of the Late Iron Age ([[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period, ca. 450 BC). The statue was found north of the barrow, but is supposed to have been originally placed on the top.

'''''Wheatfield with Crows''''' is a July 1890 painting by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It has been cited by several critics as one of his greatest works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6JTCCBSZuoC&amp;pg=PA11|title=Cézanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-garde|page=11|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2006|isbn=1588391957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqWFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT101|title=Art, Literature and Culture from a Marxist Perspective|last=McKenna|first=Tony|publisher=Springer|date=2015|isbn=1137526610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is commonly stated that this was van Gogh's final painting. However, art historians are uncertain as to which painting was van Gogh's last, as no clear historical records exist. The evidence of his letters suggests that ''Wheatfield with Crows'' was completed around 10 July and predates such paintings as ''[[The Town Hall at Auvers|Auvers Town Hall on 14 July 1890]]'' and ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="Letter"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "VGM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vggallery.com/painting/by_period/auvers.htm| title=Auvers-sur-Oise: May – July 1890 (75 paintings) |publisher=vggallery.com|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Jan Hulsker]] points out that a painting of harvested wheat, ''Field with Stacks of Wheat'' (F771), must be a later painting.&lt;ref name= "Hulsker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulsker|first=Jan|title=The Complete Van Gogh: Paintings, Drawings, Sketches|year=1986|work=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-517-44867-X|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The [[Van Gogh Museum]]'s ''Wheatfield with Crows'' was painted in July 1890, in the last weeks of van Gogh’s life. Many have claimed it as his last painting, while it is also possible ''[[Tree Roots]]'', or the previously mentioned ''Daubigny's Garden'', was his final painting.

''Wheat Field with Crows,'' made on a [[Double-squares and Squares#Van Gogh.27s Double-square canvases|double-square canvas]], depicts a dramatic, cloudy sky filled with crows over a wheat field.&lt;ref name= "VGM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3343&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Wheat Field with Crows |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of isolation is heightened by a central path leading nowhere and by the uncertain direction of flight of the crows. The windswept wheat field fills two-thirds of the canvas. &lt;!--- No! 3 paths, uncertain horizon etc "An empty path pulls the audience into the painting."---&gt; [[Jules Michelet]], one of van Gogh's favorite authors, wrote of crows: "They interest themselves in everything, and observe everything.  The ancients, who lived far more completely than ourselves in and with nature, found it no small profit to follow, in a hundred obscure things where human experience as yet affords no light, the directions of so prudent and sage a bird."&lt;!--- garbled and referenced next para anyway: Of making the painting Van Gogh wrote that he did not have a hard time depicting the sadness and emptiness of the painting, which was powerfully offset by the restorative nature of the countryside. ---&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards149"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | pages=78, 186 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kathleen Erickson finds the painting as expressing both sorrow and a sense of his life coming to an end.&lt;ref name="Erickson97"&gt;{{cite book | title=At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision Of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Erickson, K | publisher=William B.

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Wheatfield Under Thunderclouds - VGM F778.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|Wheatfield Under Thunderclouds]]'' (1890)]]

About 10 July 1890 van Gogh wrote to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] and his wife [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo Bonger]], saying that he had painted another three large canvases at [[Auvers-sur-Oise|Auvers]] since visiting them in Paris on 6 July.&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh and Jo van Gogh-Bonger. Auvers-sur-Oise, on or about Thursday, 10 July 1890|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let898/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these are described as &lt;!--- source is "d'immenses" ---&gt; immense stretches of wheatfields under turbulent skies, thought to be ''[[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|Wheatfield under Clouded Sky]]'' and ''Wheatfield with Crows'', and the third is ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]''. He wrote that he had made a point of expressing sadness, later adding "extreme loneliness" (''de la solitude extrême''), but also says he believes the canvases show what he considers healthy and fortifying about the countryside (and adds that he intended to take them to Paris as soon as possible).

Walther and Metzger, in ''Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings'', state that "There is nothing in van Gogh's words to support a simplistic interpretation along the lines of artistic ''angst'' and despair – nor is there any evidence for the widely-held belief that it was this painting that van Gogh had on his easel at the time he killed himself."&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; They refer to a June 1880 letter of van Gogh's, in which he compared himself to a bird in a cage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Cuesmes, between about Tuesday, 22 and Thursday, 24 June 1880|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let155/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remark: "The crows in the painting, in other words, were an altogether personal symbol closely associated with van Gogh's own life".&lt;ref name=ingo&gt;{{cite book|title=Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings|year=2010|first1= Ingo F.|first2= Rainer|last1 = Walther|last2= Metzger|pages= 680–682|work=[[Taschen]]|isbn=3-8365-2299-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These painting are all examples of van Gogh's elongated double-square canvases, used exclusively by him in the last few weeks of his life, in June and July 1890.

The painting is held in the collection of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam, as is ''Wheatfield under Clouded Sky''.
