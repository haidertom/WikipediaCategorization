'''''A Philosopher by lamplight''''' (also known as '''''A Hermit Studying Anatomy''''') is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]]. It is not known when Wright painted the picture, but it was first exhibited in 1769 in London with the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]]. This was one of the earliest of many lamplight or candlelight paintings and portraits for which Wright is famed.

== Description ==

This picture was described in the catalogue of the 1801 sale as a companion to ''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus]]''. Each has a main figure in the foreground with two subsidiary ones behind, both are night scenes and show old men engaged in scientific research.&lt;ref name="Nicolson 1968"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: Painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|author2=Mellon, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows an old man who is thought to be a philosopher or a pilgrim,examining a collection of human bones in a lamp-lit cave. Two smaller men, or boys, dressed as pilgrims (as identified by the [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shells]] in their hats: the emblem of St James) seem to be approaching him. The size of these figures is a lot smaller than the main character in the painting. Outside the cave the dark landscape is lit by the moonlight breaking through the clouds. Shells were the sign of pilgrims but they were also the emblem of the Darwin family which included [[Erasmus Darwin]] who was a leading member of the [[Lunar Society]] and [[Derby Philosophical Society]] which linked key men in the age of enlightenment.
[[File:Demokrit, hensunken i betragtninger.jpg|thumb|left|100px|''Democritus in Meditation'' by [[Salvator Rosa]].]]
Experts believe that this painting was based on [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Democritus in Meditation''. Wright’s friend [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] was a follower of Rosa’s so it is possible that Wright would have seen Rosa's work or an engraving of it.&lt;ref name="Derby Museums page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art treasure - A Hermit |url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |accessdate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425222633/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |archivedate=25 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Democritus was a Greek philosopher who is remembered for making fun of the foolishness of mankind.

Though the painting's subtitle is ''A Hermit Studying Anatomy'', his attitude towards the bones he is holding does not suggest particularly serious scrutiny. He is surrounded by symbols of the ephemeral nature of the human condition which include the skeleton, a lamp that will burn all its fuel, the moon which has to be reborn every four weeks and an hour glass. The moon was also the symbol of the [[Lunar Society]] which Wright was strongly associated with although he never became a member.

The preoccupation of the philosopher and trepidation of the two pilgrims may be a reflection on concerns about the new scientific understanding and [[The Enlightenment|enlightenment at the time]] Wright lived.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

An '''acting workshop''' is  a meeting of actors or others of one specific trade to learn how to hone their skills and to [[social network|network]] with other actors, [[acting coach]]es, and casting directors.  Many actors will critique, mentor, and coach their peers and offer tips on how to improve their preparation for roles, [[audition]]s, and enhance their performing abilities. Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill.

==Specialist types==
There are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill.  
==Examples==
Specialist independent workshops exist to provide the facilities required for training and providing skills courses. A good example of this is [[Dewar Studios]] in Great Titchfield Street in Central London.

Beauty is a perceived characteristic of an animal, [[idea]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], person or [[Location (geography)|place]] that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction. Many people define beauty as something that is subjective, being that it is in the "eye of the beholder" to see what he or she thinks is actually beautiful. This "eye" is seen in many different cultures with each having a different preference. This subjective can be seen throughout history, especially in the African-American community. With the presence of oppression in the past, African-American cultural beauty has bend mended and redefined in many ways.

== Slavery and Its Contribution ==
Even before the United States had been formed, the idea of beauty was one which was seen throughout different societies. In ancient Egypt, women were classified based on their skin tone; the woman with lighter skin tones were seen as higher class because unlike the woman in the working class they did not spend their days working under the sun, and the judgement based on skin tone is one that was seen through slavery as well.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, Mark. Branded Beauty : How Marketing Changed the Way We Look, Kogan Page, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/washington/detail.action?docID=781928&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, the definition of beauty was mainly set by Whites, since they were slaves owners, and were in numerous ways, considered to be the superior race. Beginning from as early as 1619, African-American women's beauty has been compared to Caucasian beauty standards, mainly in two areas: hair and skin color. Even though African-American slaves were not seen as beautiful by some slave masters, that did not stop them from having intimacies with many of them, which resulted in lighter skinned offspring During slavery, those who were of lighter complexion and had more European features, did not work in the hot scorching sun with the darker complexioned slaves. The lighter toned slaves tended to be [[house slave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patton|first=Tracey|date=Fall 2017|title=Hey Girl, Am I More Than My Hair?: African American Women and Their Struggles with Beauty, Body Image, and Hair.|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=e8c7f05d-2ed8-41b3-94c6-9913d430baf5%40sessionmgr104|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=II|pages=26|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/newsandviews/2007/10/for_lightskinned_only.html|title=For Light-Skinned Only?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of African-Americans being assimilated to obtain more "acceptable" or "beautiful" features slowly becomes juxtaposed with the abolishment of slavery by way of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], written by [[Abraham Lincoln]]. 

== Attempt of Assimilation ==
[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS 2a cropped.jpg|thumb|Malcolm X, civil rights activist]]
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
African-American hair has, and still is sometimes seen as unprofessional and inappropriate to most white standards. Many people argue that imitation European standards of beauty was a necessity to the prosperity of blacks and how they would be accepted by white culture (mainly in the workplace).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/black-hair-care-and-culture-story|title=Black hair care and culture, a story {{!}} African American Registry|website=www.aaregistry.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main efforts of assimilation was to straighten African-American hair. This can be seen in history through figures such as [[Malcolm X]], who was a Civil Rights Activist in the 1950s. Malcolm X [[Perm (hairstyle)|relaxed]] his hair using, what was then called a “[[conk]]”, which consisted of [[lye]]. One experience he had consisted of the lye burning he scalp at the same time his water went out. He resulted in putting his head inside of a toilet to get the product out of his hair. This was his realization that his attempt to become more presentable was also his biggest mistake.

== Development of Black culture ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Throughout history, African-American culture has evolved in such a way that their beauty standards too became their own. Each time frame has its own standard of what beauty is, but many of them stick closely to natural beauty, without much processing taking place. The hair, clothes, styles, expectations (of a man or woman), and everything in between changes as time changes. During the 1960s, the [[Afro]] was cultivated. During the 1980s and early 1990s  West African hairstyles began to regain their fame, including: [[braid]]s, [[Hair twists|twists]], [[cornrows]], and much more. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the [[Jheri curl]] was introduced, but most African-Americans chose [[dreadlocks]], fades, or other styles that used their own natural hair texture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During these time periods, the development of African-American music was mainstream with hip hop, which included foul language, violence, and truth in lyrics. Many [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] groups and Rap groups/rappers glorified the beauty of the natural woman, with her accentuating curves and even her flaws.

== Cultural appropriation ==
[[File:Mybraids.jpg|thumb|Cornrow Hairstyle]]
White culture subdues African-Americans in many aspects. The past and present culture that America lives in criticizes blacks for the styles or trends that they create and later copy them and become coined as “trendy” or “fashionable”. Many celebrities have showed examples of this appropriation in most recent years. [[Miley Cyrus]], for example, at one point in 2015, wore her hair in faux dreadlocks at an award’s show and was seen as being edgy. [[Zendaya]], a celebrity of African-American descent, also wore her hair in dreadlocks at an awards show later on that year, but was publicly criticized for looking like “she smells like … weed” by Entertainment News host Giuliana Rancic in one of her TV appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2017/02/how-black-culture-is-exploited-in-memes-copy-headline-plz|title=The Double Standards of Cultural Appropriation {{!}} The Bottom Line|date=2017-02-22|work=The Bottom Line|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also celebrities like the Kardashian and Jenner family have made names for themselves by basically using black attributes and culture to their advantage.

== Effects on society ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Within the United States, the beauty of African-American woman continued to be ostracized in society by not allowing African-American woman to participate in [Miss America] beauty contests until 30 years after their beginning. &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Geoffrey. “Blonde and Blue-Eyed?

JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40057559.&lt;/ref&gt;The beauty contests within the United States were the beginnings of ideal beauty portrayed in the media.

[[File:Watercolorists Society.jpg|thumb|right|Watercolorist Tom Nicholas painting at an American Watercolor Society demonstration]]
The '''American Watercolor Society''', founded in 1866, is a nonprofit membership organization devoted to the advancement of [[watercolor|watercolor painting]] in the [[United States]]. 

Watercolor technique requires discipline, forethought, and planning of the composition, as the paintings can not be revised if mistakes occur (as one could with oil technique, for instance). AWS judges the work of a painter before granting admission to the society as an "active" (now "signature") member. Such membership in the society now is considered an indication of the painter having established a consistent style and to have demonstrated considerable skill in the medium. ''Transparency'' in the works of water color painters is highly valued. That is a technique wherein the paper surface is allowed to show through the applied paint as an integral aspect of the painting. The applicant usually must demonstrate a history of winning prizes in juried art shows with professional standing to gain admission. This type of membership in the society, generally, is signalled by "AWS" following the painter's name in promotional materials and biographies. Membership by others is indicated as an "associate" status.

[[Catherine Tharp Altvater]] (1907–1984) was the first woman to hold office in the society. In 2008 Jim McFarlane took over presidency from Janet Walsh.

==History==
The society was founded in 1866 by eleven painters and was originally known as the '''American Society of Painters in Water Colors'''.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author=Erin Corley | year=2007 | title=American Watercolor Society records, 1867-1977, bulk 1950-1970 | work= | publisher=Archives of American Art Oral History Program | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-watercolor-society-records-8636/more | accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was difficult to draw in new members, partially because some artists of the time opposed the society's policy of allowing women to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanwatercolorsociety.org/a_the_beginning.php|title=The Founding of the American Watercolor Society - New York 1866|website=www.americanwatercolorsociety.org|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''New York Watercolor Club''' merged into the society in 1941.

The '''New York Water Color Club''' (NYWC) was founded in 1890, accepting both men and women artists as members and officers, and held its first exhibition that year.&lt;ref name=SAAA&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-york-water-color-club-records-8150 | title=New York Water Color Club records, 1890 | publisher=Smithsonian Archives of American Art | accessdate=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Childe Hassam]] was the organization's first president. NYWC was organized in response to refusal by the American Watercolor Society (AWS) to accept women members and to organize an annual exhibition in the fall. In comparison to AWS, it held jury-selected exhibitions which meant stricter standards for the content included in its shows.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan p. 224"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Niamh O'Sullivan|author2=Aloysius O'Kelly|title=Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K4W8kWtqnkC&amp;pg=PA224|year=2010|publisher=Field Day Publications|isbn=978-0-946755-42-4|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club had male and female members and officers, whereas the American Watercolor Society did not accept women as members of their organization until 1897.&lt;ref name="SAAA-AWS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art2004 p. 36"&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Museum of Women in the Arts (U.S.)|author2=Columbus Museum of Art|title=Claude Raguet Hirst: Transforming the American Still Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkaKr4vBPWoC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2004|publisher=Hudson Hills|isbn=978-0-918881-54-0|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its headquarters and site of its annual exhibition was in the American Fine Arts Building at 215 West 57th Street.{{#tag:ref|The building was constructed as the result of the founding of the [[American Fine Arts Society]] in 1889. Other art organizations headquartered in the building were the [[American Federation of Arts]], American Water Color Society, [[Artists' Fund Society|Artists' Aid Society]], Mural Painters, and the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Its galleries held [[National Academy of Design]], [[Architectural League]] and New York Water Color Club exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Art Directory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yYMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA177|year=1918|publisher=R.R.

Of the 581 works of art, 501 of were watercolors.&lt;ref name="1918 AAD" /&gt;

[[File:Annunciation - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|''The Annunciation'', [[Oil painting|Oil]] [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from wood to canvas]], c. 1434. [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, DC]], 93 x 37 cm]]

'''''The Annunciation''''' is an oil painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436.  The panel is housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]], in Washington D.C.  It was originally on [[panel painting|panel]] but has been [[transfer of panel paintings|transferred]] to canvas.  It is thought that it was the left (inner) wing of a [[triptych]]; there has been no sighting of the other wings since before 1817. The annunciation is a highly complex work, whose [[iconography]] is still debated by art historians.

The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38).  The inscription shows his words: &lt;small&gt;''AVE GRÃ. PLENA''&lt;/small&gt; or "Hail, full of grace...".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 28 "et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit  '''ave gratia plena''' Dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus ..." - [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=1&amp;version=4 Latin Vulgate];  28"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women." [[Authorised Version]]. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lucas%201%20;&amp;version=9; King James (Authorised) Version]&lt;/ref&gt;   She modestly draws back and responds, &lt;small&gt;''ECCE ANCILLA DÑI''&lt;/small&gt; or "Behold the [[handmaiden]] of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 38"dixit autem Maria '''ecce ancilla Domini''' fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum et discessit ab illa angelus" Latin [[Vulgate]]; 38"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her." King James/Authorised Version.&lt;/ref&gt;   The words appear upside down because they are directed to God and are therefore inscribed with a God's-eye view. The [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on [[Seven rays|seven rays of light]] from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolizing the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path; "This is the moment God's plan for salvation is set in motion. Through Christ's human incarnation the old era of the Law is transformed into a new era of [[Divine Grace|Grace]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Gallery of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Temple==
The setting develops this theme.  Mary was believed in the Middle Ages to have been a very studious girl who was engaged by the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] with other selected maidens to spin new curtains for the [[Holy of Holies]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller p.34 The source was the [[apocrypha]]l [[Protoevangelium of James]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's [[Book of Hours]]; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study in a part of the Temple (one medieval authority specified  that she was reading the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller pp.34-5, 41-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this painting was probably ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.81, who does not mention the altarpiece of 1397 by [[Melchior Broederlam]] (from the Chartreuse de Champmol, now Dijon Museum) - Schiller p.49 &amp; (fig 111), also discussed in Purtle 1999,p.4, and in the Losh External link below (fig 4)[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:BroedelamAnnunciation.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture moves from older, round [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] forms above, to (slightly) pointed Gothic arches below, with the higher levels largely in darkness, and the floor level well-lit.&lt;ref&gt;Many recent writers have stressed that the architecture of the buildings is not as anomalous, and therefore symbolic, as it might appear, and as Panovsky thought it. See Harbison pp. 151-57, &amp; 212, also Purtle 1999, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gloom of the [[Old Covenant]] is about to be succeeded by the light of the [[New Covenant]].  The flat timber roof is in poor repair, with planks out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Purtle, 1999, p 2 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of van Eyck and his followers, and other paintings show both styles in the same building in a symbolic way.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49-50. Purtle 1999, p. 4 and notes 9-14. Also see Gallery, and [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf ''The Iconography of the Temple in Northern Renaissance Art'' by Yona Pinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326170616/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Jan van Eyck 081.jpg|thumb|left|Floor tiles: [[David]] slaying [[Goliath]] in front, [[Samson]] pulling down the [[Philistine]]s' Temple behind]]

The decoration of the Temple is naturally all derived from the [[Old Testament]], but the subjects shown are those believed in the Middle Ages to prefigure the coming of Christ the [[Messiah]].  In the floor tiles [[David]]'s slaying of [[Goliath]] (centre front), foretells Christ's triumph over the devil.  Behind this, [[Samson]] pulls down the Temple of the [[Philistine]]s, prefiguring both the Crucifixion and the [[Last Judgement]], according to medieval authorities.  To the left, [[Delilah]] is cutting Samson's hair (Betrayal of Christ), and behind he slays the Philistines (Christ's triumph over sin).   The death of [[Absalom]] and possibly that of [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] are identified by some art historians, although only tiny sections are visible.  [[Erwin Panofsky]], who developed much of this analysis, proposed a scheme for the significance of the [[astrological symbol]]s in the round border tiles, and other versions have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp. 80-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The rear wall has a single stained glass window, where Jehovah stands, above triple plain-glazed windows below, which perhaps suggest the Christian trinity.  On either side of the single window are dim wall-paintings of the ''Finding of Moses'' by [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter (left, pre-figuring the Annunciation itself), and Moses receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] (right, paralleling the [[New Covenant]] Christ would bring).  Below them are roundels with [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], for which various symbolic functions have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.80, Purtle, 1999, pp 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The lilies are a traditional attribute of Mary, standing for purity.  The empty stool may be an "[[hetoimasia|empty throne]]", a symbol for Christ going back to early [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp 79 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==The figures==
[[File:Annunciation - Virgin and Angel - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Detail - Mary and Gabriel]]

It has been suggested that Mary has been given the features of [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]], wife of [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], who may well have commissioned the painting from van Eyck, his (part-time) court painter.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.82. Carra Ferguson O'Meara (1981) originated the suggestion&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary wears a robe in her usual blue, which is trimmed in [[ermine]], reserved for royalty, which would suit this theory, although the Middle Ages placed great emphasis on Mary's [[Davidic line|royal descent]] in any case.  As is usual, especially in the North, Mary's features are less attractive than those of Gabriel; being a sexless angel there was considered to be no possibility of his beauty causing inappropriate thoughts in the onlooker.  Neither figure has a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]; these were being dispensed with in Early Netherlandish art in the interests of realism - eventually the Italians would follow.  Mary's posture is ambiguous; it is not clear if she is standing, kneeling or sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
Many writers, including Hand, call the figures over-large compared to the architecture.  This is certainly a feature of some of van Eyck's depictions of Mary in a Church setting, with a particular theological meaning.  In ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] where this theme is most developed: the figure of Mary is some sixty feet high, filling much of the height of a tall Gothic church.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 1991, pp. 169-187&lt;/ref&gt; It is not so clear that any effect of this type is intended here; there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building.  If, for example, the setting were a first floor room, or one giving on to a courtyard, the windows might be lower than is normal in a medieval church.  The size of the plain glass roundels does not seem disproportionate with the figures.

===Sacramental themes===
[[File:Louvre Le sacerdoce de la Vierge.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' (The Priesthood of the Virgin), 1425-50, Louvre, unknown French artist]]
Another of van Eyck's themes, and that of other Early Netherlandish painters, is indicated by the large [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]] worn by [[Gabriel]].  This would, in a human, mark him as a celebrant or attendant at a [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]].  Mary is facing a table with a book upon it about the right size to be a [[Gospel Book]] or [[Missal]], and has her hands raised in a gesture known as the ''expansis manibus''.  This is certainly to convey the alarm and uncertainty with which she usually greets the surprising apparition of Gabriel and his news, but is also a gesture used by a priest at certain points of a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has been connected with the ''Golden Mass'' ("Missa Aurea"), a [[liturgical drama]], or dramatised Mass, popular in the Netherlands at the time, which included a staging of the Annunciation as the [[Gospel]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81, and Lane, pp 47-50; both citing: Carol J Purtle, 1982. Also Purtle 1999 note 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus, 1999, pp 1-4 describes the Golden Mass in the context of Giotto's Arena Chapel frescoes&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, this is part of a common theme in Early Netherlandish art where Mary, as intermediary between the faithful and God, is compared to, or seen as, a priest celebrating Mass.  Her personal sacrifice of her son  is compared to the ritual sacrifice enacted by the priest in the Mass.  In a surviving extreme example in the [[Louvre]] she is shown clearly wearing vestments and celebrating mass at an [[altar]]; more often, as here, the comparison is made more subtly.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 1984, pp 41-77. The Louvre ''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' is fig 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other panels of the triptych==
No more has been heard of the rest of the triptych since the mentions below in the Provenance.  It would presumably have been an altarpiece, for a side-altar or small chapel.  The subjects of the other missing panels remain uncertain; a ''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' or ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' are considered most likely for the central panel, at least twice as wide as this one, with a ''Visitation of Mary'' or ''Presentation of Jesus'' on the right-hand wing matching this one.  The outer sides of the wings would probably have been painted in some fashion, but if there was a full scene, or even a figure in [[grisaille]] on the back of this, it is unlikely it would have been discarded when the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  No doubt the themes of this wing would originally have related to those in the other wings in ways we cannot now guess.

==Painting technique==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 078.jpg|thumb|230px|The rear wall: Moses found in the bullrushes on the wall, [[stained glass]] of [[Jehovah]], with [[Seraphim]] above. The wall-painting is not in the underdrawing]]
A cleaning in 1998, and examination by modern technical methods such as infrared reflectograms, has revealed much about van Eyck's technique here, which is consistent with other works of his such as the [[Arnolfini Portrait]].  His [[underdrawing]] has been revealed, and so have many changes made in the course of painting the work.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Eyck's superb oil painting technique is evident throughout.  [[Gold leaf]] is only used for the seven rays coming in from the left; paint is used for all the gold on Gabriel, often worked [[wet-on-wet]] to achieve the textural effects of his [[brocade]]d clothes.  In a shadowy area behind the stool van Eyck worked a glaze with his fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The play of light over the many different textures in the painting is brilliantly rendered, and the illusionistic detail, especially in Gabriel's rich costume, is exceptional.

Apart from several small changes in the position of hands and faces, the under-drawing shows that the small pilasters on the left wall were originally planned to be repeated on the rear wall, and to be much taller, reaching nearly to the roof, on both.  The paint on the rear wall is thicker than on the left wall, so he may have painted the pilasters before changing his mind.  In the underdrawing the ceiling planks are all in place, and there was also a light source to the right, for which the shadows are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative scenes on the tiles replace a simpler decorative plan in the underdrawing, and the stool has become much larger. The vase of lilies was not only absent in the underdrawing, but was not reserved, that is to say that a space was not left for it in the paint for the Virgin's robe or the floor.  This suggests it was only added late in the course of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 4 &amp; 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of other major van Eyck works reveals similar developments from the underdrawing, and in the course of painting, in these works.  It seems van Eyck, perhaps acting with clerical advisers, although he appears to have been a considerable reader himself, liked to add further complexity to his compositions in the course of work on them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition and date==
The painting was transferred from panel to canvas in the 19th century. It received a major cleaning in 1998, when varnish and some overpaint was removed, and a technical study undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, p1&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing before this, the NGA catalogue described the painting as extensively restored.  Craquelure (fine cracking to the surface) had been painted over, especially in the background.  Repainted areas included parts of Gabriel's face and hair, and the Virgin's robe, which appeared to have also lost a layer of glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, p76&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of dates given for the painting was previously from 1428-29 (Panofsky and others) to 1436-37, but the discovery in 1959 of a date of 1437 on an altarpiece in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]], [[Dresden]] has considerably changed all van Eyck dating, and "makes it all but impossible to continue dating the ''Annunciation'' before 1432" (Hand).  The painting appears stylistically to come between the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] and late works such as the Berlin ''Virgin in a church''.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

Two authorities have considered the painting to belong to Jan's brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], who died in 1426.  It is thought that the recent cleaning or technical investigation has tended to confirm the majority view that it is an autograph work by Jan.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82, Gifford p.1 on the recent work on the painting&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annunciation - Lily and the floor - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|Detail with the lily, the stool and the floor.|250px|thumb]]

==Provenance==
The [[provenance]] of the painting, as far as it is known, is:&lt;ref&gt;unless otherwise stated, Hand, 1986, p.76 &amp; notes&lt;/ref&gt;
*1791 - A visitor to the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]], a [[Carthusian]] monastery in [[Dijon]], now in France, but in the 15th century the capital of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], recorded seeing in the [[Prior]]'s room paintings, originally in the ducal chapel of the monastery: "... paintings on wood of the type of the earliest Flemish painters, which come from the chapels of the Dukes; they are about four feet high. The first, about a foot wide, is an Annunciation..."  The monastery was very largely destroyed in the French Revolution, but had been the burial place of the Dukes of Burgundy, and contained many important works.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Well of Moses'' by [[Claus Sluter]] remains ''in situ'', a Crucifixion by [[Jean Malouel]] of ca. 1398 is in the [[Louvre]]. The Broederlam altarpiece also came from the monastery.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting mentioned is thought likely to be the Washington painting, although the measurements (in the French ''pied'', or ''foot'', of the period) do not match very exactly.   
*1817 - Bought at an auction sale in Paris by the major dealer C.J. Nieuwenhuys of Brussels, who sold it to [[William II, King of the Netherlands]]. In Brussels until 1841, then in The Hague. In a book of 1843 Nieuwenhuys says of the picture that it was "from a set with two others by the same master, painted for [[Philip the Good]] and destined to adorn a religious foundation in Dijon". A modern scholar has also claimed that the Virgin has the features of Philip's Duchess [[Isabella of Portugal]].   
*1850 - Lot 1 in an auction in The Hague, bought by Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] for the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].  Probably between 1864 and 1870 the Hermitage transferred it to canvas, as is often done with [[panel painting]]s when the wood develops problems. 
*1929 - Franz Matthiesen, a young German art dealer, was asked by the Soviet Government to compile a list of the hundred paintings in Russian collections which should never be sold under any circumstances. He was most surprised to be shown several of these paintings not long after in Paris by [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], who had traded them with the Russians for oil.  Gulbenkian wanted him to act as his agent on further purchases, but Matthiesen instead [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings|formed a consortium]] with [[Colnaghi]]'s of London and [[Knoedler]] &amp; Co of New York, which in 1930 and 1931 bought paintings and other works from the Russians, of which [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|twenty-one paintings]] were bought by [[Andrew Mellon]], who had been offered first refusal. All are now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, where they form some of the most important paintings in the collection (two works by Raphael, also including works by Botticelli, Titian, Veronese, Velázquez, Rembrandt).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1964, pp 24-6&lt;/ref&gt;    
*1930 - Bought by Andrew Mellon via the consortium described above. In 1931 it was deeded to the [[Mellon Trust]], which gifted it in 1937 to the National Gallery of Art, whose construction began in that year.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Annunciation - Provenance |url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html#provenance |website=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trust fund"&gt;{{cite web |title=A.

'''Anuradha Vikram''' is an [[art critic]], [[curator]], author, and [[lecturer]] based in [[Los Angeles]], California. She is the artistic director of [[18th Street Arts Center]], [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], and a senior lecturer at [[Otis College of Art and Design]], Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.otis.edu/faculty/anuradha-vikram|title=Anuradha Vikram|website=Otis College of Art and Design|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has contributed to numerous publications, and has a published book called ''Decolonizing Culture: Essays on the Intersection of Art and Politics''.

== Early life and education ==
Growing up in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], New York, Anuradha Vikram began being involved in making art during high school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=We Eat Anuradha Vikram|date=2018-02-14|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-74952086/we-eat-anuradha-vikram|volume=|pages=|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 she completed a B.S. Studio Art, minor in Art History, at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openspace.sfmoma.org/author/durgaakv/|title=Dispatch from Ars Electronica|website=Open Space|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on in 1999 until 2002, to manage the studios for artists [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://museumofnonvisibleart.com/interviews/anuradha-vikram/|title=Anuradha Vikram|last=brainardcarey|date=2015-04-03|work=Interviews from Yale University Radio WYBCX|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to California, working at Nikolas Weinstein's glass studio in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She went to graduate school, completing an M.A. in Curatorial Practice at the [[California College of the Arts]], [[San Francisco]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandeducation.net/announcements/111660/ma-program-in-curatorial-practice-california-college-of-the-arts|title=MA Program in Curatorial Practice, California College of the Arts - Announcements - Art &amp; Education|website=www.artandeducation.net|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikram has worked at the [http://richmondartcenter.org/ Richmond Art Center] in [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], California, as well as the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] Art Department.

== Career ==
In 2012, she curated ''Spaces of Life:'' ''The Art of Sonya Rapoport'' which focused on Rapoport's interactive work from 1979-2011 at Mills College Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artandeducation.net/announcements/109665/spaces-of-life-the-art-of-sonya-rapoport|title=Spaces of Life: The Art of Sonya Rapoport - Announcements - Art &amp; Education|website=www.artandeducation.net|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2013 Vikram curated [http://www.cafam.org/media/27790/socialfabric_press.pdf ''Social Fabric''] at the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hebron|first=Micol|date=2013|title=Social Fabric|journal=The Journal of Modern Craft|volume=6|issue=3|pages=331–334|doi=10.2752/174967813X13806265666898}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also curated the show ''Uncommon Terrain'' for Shulamit Nazarian Gallery in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/show/shulamit-nazarian-uncommon-terrain-curated-by-anuradha-vikram|title=Uncommon Terrain curated by Anuradha Vikram {{!}} Shulamit Nazarian {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has organized over fifty exhibitions over the last decade.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Decolonizing Culture: Anuradha Vikram and Vivian Sming|url=https://soundcloud.com/artpractical/decolonizing-culture-anuradha-vikram-and-vivian-sming|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, she published her first book ''Decolonizing Culture'' with ''[[Art Practical]]'' and Sming Sming Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Culture|last=Vikram|first=Anuradha|publisher=Art Practical Books and Sming Sming Books|year=2017|isbn=9780998500652|location=California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Decolonizing Culture'' book focuses on the intersection of art and politics in contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artpractical.com/event/anuradha-vikram-decolonizing-culture-book-launch/|title=Anuradha Vikram: Decolonizing Culture Book Launch {{!}} Art Practical|last=vivian|work=Art Practical|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikram actively contributes to critical art magazines, such as [[Hyperallergic]], [[Art Practical]] and the San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA) blog.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/author/anuradha-vikram/|title=Anuradha Vikram|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Hyperallergic|publisher=Hyperallergic Media Inc.|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable concepts ==
A notable concept of Vikram's curatorial practice is creating connections between people. She works to extend beyond artwork that is solely in dialogue with European/American standards of what art is.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her work concerns ideas of gender, representation, cultural appropriation, diversity, race, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/433320/anuradha-vikram-decolonizing-culture-talk/|title=The Difficult Work of Decolonizing Culture, from the Whitney Biennial to Gentrification|date=2018-03-19|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She aims to find the intersection between the contemporary art world and politics, writing to acknowledge the imbalance in treatment in the art world between artists of color and white artists. Through her work, Vikram shows that while contemporary art has been a space for strong social justice outlooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Contemporary Art Biennials : Spectacles of Critique, Theory and Art|last=Kompatsiaris|first=Panos|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-138-18458-9|location=711 Third Avenue, New York, NY, 10017|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not quite get to a non-imperialist approach to curating work. In interviews she has spoken about sexism in art  through a discussion of [[Carolee Schneemann|Carolee Schneeman]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has also spoken about racial disparity in the contemporary art world through a discussion of [[Isaac Julien]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Select work and exhibitions ==
Vikram has one published book, ''Decolonizing Culture: Essays on the Intersection of Art and Politics''. It was published in 2017 by ''[[Art Practical]]'' and Sming Sming Books. It is a collection of 17 of her essays, focusing on inclusion, diversity, and the lack thereof, in contemporary art.

She is also a contributor to  ''X-TRA'', ''KCET Artbound'' and ''DAILY SERVING'', and has been published in ''[[Hyperallergic]]'', ''Leonardo, SF Camerawork Journal'', ''Afterimage'', ''Artillery'', ''The Brooklyn Rail'', and ''Open Space'', the blog of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.curativeprojects.net/?page_id=9|title=About|date=2013-06-14|work=Curative Projects|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of her other recent publications include  "'Naked in the Sight of the Object': Masking, Masquerade, and Black Identity" (''X-TRA'', vol. 18 no. 4, Summer 2016), "Becoming Human: Nam June Paik's Futuristic Compassion" (''X-TRA'', vol. 18 no. 1, Fall 2015), "A Brief and Incomplete History of Art and Technology Ventures in the Bay Area 1980-2010" (''Afterimage'', vol. 41, no. 6, Summer 2014), and "Sonya Rapoport: A Woman's Place is in the Studio" (''Sonya Rapoport: Pairings of Polarities''.

An '''archive''' is an accumulation of [[Historical document|historical records]] or the physical place they are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usd.edu/library/instruction/glossary.shtml#a |title=Glossary of Library and Internet Terms |accessdate=30 April 2007 |publisher=University of South Dakota Library|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310132820/http://www.usd.edu/library/instruction/glossary.shtml#a|archivedate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archives contain [[primary source]] documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization's lifetime, and are kept to show the function of that person or organization. Professional [[archivist]]s and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. They have been metaphorically defined as "the secretions of an organism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=V.H. |last=Galbraith |authorlink=Vivian Hunter Galbraith |title=Studies in the Public Records |place=London |year=1948 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity. &lt;!--removed from another section where it was irrelevant; may wish to be incorporated: The word ''archive'' can refer to any organised body of records fixed on media. The management of archives is essential for effective day-to-day organisational decision making, and even for the survival of organisations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}--&gt;

In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines for which many identical copies exist. This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=7 December 2012|publisher=Society of American Archivists|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615035638/http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who works in archives is called an [[archivist]]. The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called [[archival science]]. The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive (more usual in the [[United Kingdom]]), an archives (more usual in the [[United States]]), or a repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=2013-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022034302/http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to historical records or the places they are kept, the plural form ''archives'' is chiefly used.&lt;ref&gt;"archive" ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989. [[OED Online]]. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The computing use of the term 'archive' should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in early 17th century, the word ''archive'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|aɪ|v}} is derived from the French ''archives'' (plural), in turn from [[Latin]] ''archīum'' or ''archīvum'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Darchium archīum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924185602/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Darchium |date=24 September 2015 }}, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[romanization|romanized]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἀρχεῖον'' (''archeion''), "[[public records]], [[town-hall]], residence, or office of chief [[magistrate]]s",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxei%3Don ἀρχεῖον] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009174332/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)rxei=on |date=9 October 2012 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; itself from ''ἀρχή'' (''arkhē''), amongst others "magistracy, office, government"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125340/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)rxh%2F |date=6 June 2011 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (compare an-archy, mon-archy), which comes from the verb ''ἄρχω'' (''arkhō''), "to begin, rule, govern".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw ἄρχω] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618065951/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw |date=18 June 2013 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The word originally developed from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|ἀρχεῖον}}'' (arkheion), which refers to the home or dwelling of the [[Archon]], in which important official state documents were filed and interpreted under the authority of the Archon. The adjective formed from ''archive'' is ''archival''.

==History==
The practice of keeping official documents is very old. Archaeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometime thousands) of clay tablets going back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Amarna]], [[Hattusas]], [[Ugarit]], and [[Pylos]]. These discoveries have been fundamental to know ancient alphabets, languages, literature, and politics.

Archives were well developed by the ancient Chinese, the ancient Greeks, and ancient Romans (who called them ''[[Tabularium|Tabularia]]''). However, they have been lost, since documents written on materials like [[papyrus]] and paper deteriorated at a faster pace, unlike their stone tablet counterparts. Archives of churches, kingdoms, and cities from the Middle Ages survive and have often kept their official status uninterruptedly until now. They are the basic tool for historical research on these ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern archival thinking has many roots from the French Revolution. The [[French National Archives]], who possess perhaps the largest archival collection in the world, with records going as far back as 625 A.D., were created in 1790 during the [[French Revolution]] from various government, religious, and private archives seized by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/archive |title=archive: Definition, Synonyms from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523111412/http://www.answers.com/topic/archive |archivedate=23 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Staatsarchiv Erdberg Sep 2006 002.jpg|thumb|right|Reading room of the [[:de:Österreichisches Staatsarchiv|Österreichisches Staatsarchiv]] (Austrian State Archive), in the Erdberg district of Vienna (2006)]]
Historians, [[genealogist]]s, lawyers, [[demographer]]s, filmmakers, and others conduct research at archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/about/what-are-archives |title=What Are Archives? |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=[[National Museum of American History]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905072959/http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/about/what-are-archives |archivedate=5 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research process at each archive is unique, and depends upon the institution that houses the archive.  While there are many kinds of archives, the most recent census of archivists in the United States identifies five major types: academic, business (for profit), government, non-profit, and other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walch |first=Victoria Irons |year=2006 |title=Archival Census and Education Needs Survey in the United States: Part 1: Introduction |journal=The American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=294–309 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Walch-ACENSUS.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314203430/http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Walch-ACENSUS.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also four main areas of inquiry involved with archives: material technologies, organizing principles, geographic locations, and tangled embodiments of humans and non-humans.  These areas help to further categorize what kind of archive is being created.

Archives in colleges, universities, and other educational facilities are typically housed within a library, and duties may be carried out by an [[archivist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William J. |last=Maher |year=1992 |title=The Management of College and University Archives |oclc=25630256 |location=Metuchen, New Jersey |publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]] and [[The Scarecrow Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}  Academic archives exist to preserve institutional history and serve the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kennesaw.edu/archives/| title= Welcome to University Archives and Records Management| accessdate= 8 May 2007| publisher= Kennesaw State University Archives| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070414165623/http://www.kennesaw.edu/archives/| archivedate= 14 April 2007| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An academic archive may contain materials such as the institution's administrative records, personal and professional papers of former professors and presidents, memorabilia related to school organizations and activities, and items the academic library wishes to remain in a closed-stack setting, such as rare books or [[thesis]] copies. Access to the collections in these archives is usually by prior appointment only; some have posted hours for making inquiries.  Users of academic archives can be undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff, scholarly researchers, and the general public.  Many academic archives work closely with [[alumni]] relations departments or other campus institutions to help raise funds for their library or school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/groups/college-and-university-archives-section/guidelines-for-college-and-university-archives |title=Guidelines for College and University Archives |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905030415/http://www2.archivists.org/groups/college-and-university-archives-section/guidelines-for-college-and-university-archives |archivedate=5 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Qualifications for employment may vary.  Entry-level positions usually require an undergraduate diploma, but typically archivists hold graduate degrees in history or library science (preferably certified by a body such as the [[American Library Association]]).&lt;ref name=Riggs&gt;Michelle Riggs, "The Correlation of Archival Education and Job Requirements Since the Advent of Encoded Archival Description," Journal of Archival Organization 3, no. 1 (January 2005): 61-79. (accessed 23 July 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Subject-area specialization becomes more common in higher ranking positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=So You Want to Be an Archivist: An Overview of the Archives Profession |url=http://www2.archivists.org/profession |website=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=23 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711152538/http://www2.archivists.org/profession |archivedate=11 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business (for profit)===
Archives located in for-profit institutions are usually those owned by a private business.  Examples of prominent business archives in the United States include [[Coca-Cola]] (which also owns the separate museum [[World of Coca-Cola]]), [[Procter and Gamble]], [[Motorola]] Heritage Services and Archives, and [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]]  These corporate archives maintain historic documents and items related to the history and administration of their companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessarchivescouncil.org.uk/|title=Business Archives Council |accessdate=8 May 2007 |publisher=businessarchivescouncil.org.uk| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070606151253/http://www.businessarchivescouncil.org.uk/| archivedate= 6 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Business archives serve the purpose of helping their corporations maintain control over their brand by retaining memories of the company's past.  Especially in business archives, [[records management]] is separate from the historic aspect of archives.  Workers in these types of archives may have any combination of training and degrees, from either a history or library background.  These archives are typically not open to the public and only used by workers of the owner company, though some allow approved visitors by appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunterinformation.com/corporat.htm|title=Directory of Corporate Archives |accessdate=8 May 2007 |publisher=hunterinformation.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405071910/http://www.hunterinformation.com/corporat.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business archives are concerned with maintaining the [[integrity]] of their company, and are therefore selective of how their materials may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archivists.org/saagroups/bas/Intro_bus_arch.asp |title= Business Archives in North America – Invest in your future: Understand your past |accessdate=8 May 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001211352/http://www.archivists.org/saagroups/bas/Intro_bus_arch.asp |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
{{main|National archives}}
[[File:WikiXDC National Archives Tour Hall - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Storage facility at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], Washington, D.C.]]
Government archives include those maintained by local and state government as well as those maintained by the national (or federal) government. Anyone may use a government archive, and frequent users include [[reporters]], [[genealogists]], writers, [[historians]], students, and people seeking information on the history of their home or region. Many government archives are open to the public and no appointment is required to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/about-us/016/index-e.html |title=Directions for Change |deadurl=yes |accessdate=27 October 2016 |publisher=collectionscanada.ca |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070227022316/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/about-us/016/index-e.html |archivedate=27 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) maintains central archival facilities in the [[District of Columbia]] and [[College Park, Maryland]], with regional facilities distributed throughout the United States. Some city or local governments may have repositories, but their organization and accessibility varies widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyndislist.com/us/state-level-records-repositories |title=Cyndi's List - United States - U.S. State Level Records Repositories |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=[[Cyndi's List of Genealogy Sites on the Internet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the library profession, certification requirements and education also varies widely, from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Christine. "Chapter Report: The Many Faces of Certification." American Libraries 29, no. 9 (October 1998): 11. (accessed 23 July 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Professional associations themselves encourage the need to professionalize.&lt;ref&gt;Bastian, Jeannette, and Elizabeth Yakel. "'Are We There Yet?'

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] (formerly known as the Public Record Office) is the government archive for England and [[Wales]]. The [[English Heritage Archive]] is the public archive of [[English Heritage]]. The [[National Archives of Scotland]], located in [[Edinburgh]], serve that country while the [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]] in [[Belfast]] is the government archive for Northern Ireland.

A network of [[county record office]]s and other local authority-run archives exists throughout England, Wales, and Scotland and holds many important collections, including local government, landed estates, church, and business records. Many archives have contributed catalogues to the national "[[Access to Archives]]" programme and online searching across collections is possible.

In France, the French Archives Administration (''Service interministériel des Archives de France'') in the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] manages the [[Archives nationales (France)|National Archives]] (''Archives nationales''), which possess 406&amp;nbsp;km. (252 miles) of archives {{as of|2010|lc=y}} (the total length of occupied shelves put next to each other), with original records going as far back as A.D. 625, as well as the departmental archives (''archives départementales''), located in the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfectures]]'' of each of the 100 ''[[departments of France|départements]]'' of France, which possess 2,297&amp;nbsp;km. (1,427 miles) of archives ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}), and also the local city archives, about 600 in total, which possess 456&amp;nbsp;km. (283,4 miles) of archives ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr_icon}} ''Chiffres clés 2011. Statistiques de la Culture'', Paris, La Documentation française, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Put together, the total volume of archives under the supervision of the French Archives Administration is the largest in the world.

In [[India]], the [[National Archives of India|National Archives]] (NAI) are located in New Delhi.

In [[Taiwan]], the National Archives Administration are located in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.tw/English |title=National Archives Administration |website=National Development Council of Taiwan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917052616/http://www.archives.gov.tw/english/ |archivedate=17 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most intergovernmental organisations keep their own historical archives. However, a number of European organisations, including the European Commission, choose to deposit their archives with the European University Institute in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Archives|url=http://www.eui.eu/Research/HistoricalArchivesOfEU/AbouttheHistoricalArchives/Index.aspx|website=European University Institute|accessdate=23 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706220937/http://www.eui.eu/Research/HistoricalArchivesOfEU/AbouttheHistoricalArchives/Index.aspx|archivedate=6 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church===
A prominent Church Archives is the [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican Secret Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vatican Secret Archives|url=http://asv.vatican.va/home_en.htm|accessdate=2 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422174512/http://asv.vatican.va/home_en.htm|archivedate=22 April 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Archdiocese]]s, [[diocese]]s, and parishes also have archives in the Roman Catholic and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Churches. Very important are [[monastery]] archives, because of their antiquity, like the ones of [[Monte Cassino]], [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Saint Gall]], and [[Fulda monastery|Fulda]]. The records in these archives include manuscripts, papal records, local Church records, photographs, oral histories, audiovisual materials, and architectural drawings.

Most Protestant denominations have archives as well, including the Presbyterian U.S.A Historical Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presbyterian Historical Society|url=http://history.pcusa.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110426023226/http://history.pcusa.org/| archivedate= 26 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moravian Church Archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/|title=Moravian Archives|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329122545/http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives|url=http://www.sbhla.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110330061539/http://www.sbhla.org/| archivedate= 30 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Methodist Archives and History Center of the United Methodist Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Methodist Archives Center|url=http://www.gcah.org|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828054648/http://gcah.org/| archivedate=28 August 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disciples of Christ Historical Society|url=http://discipleshistory.org/|accessdate=2 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725235550/http://www.discipleshistory.org/| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=October 2011}}

===Non-profit===
Non-profit archives include those in [[List of Historical Societies|historical societies]], not-for-profit businesses such as hospitals, and the repositories within [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]].  Non-profit archives are typically set up with private funds from donors to preserve the papers and history of specific persons or places.  Often these institutions rely on [[Grant (money)|grant]] funding from the government as well as the private funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Dorothy Weyer |last=Creigh |first2=Laurence R. |last2=Pizer | year=1991 | title=A Primer for Local Historical Societies |edition=2nd |page=122 |publisher=[[American Association for State and Local History]] |isbn=9780942063127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the funds available, non-profit archives may be as small as the historical society in a rural town to as big as a state historical society that rivals a government archives. Users of this type of archive may vary as much as the institutions that hold them.  Employees of non-profit archives may be professional archivists, para-professionals, or volunteers, as the education required for a position at a non-profit archive varies with the demands of the collection's user base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Walter Muir | last=Whitehill | year=1962 | title=Independent Historical Societies: An Enquiry into Their Research and Publication Functions and Their Financial Future  | chapter=Introduction | editor= | others= | page=311 | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=The Boston Athenaeum | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web archiving===
{{main|Web archive}}
Web archiving is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] and ensuring the collection is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an archive, such as an [[archive site]], for future researchers, historians, and the public.  Due to the massive size of the Web, web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated collection.

Similarly, software code and documentation can be archived on the web, as with the example of [[CPAN]].

===Other===
Some archives defy categorization.  There are tribal archives within the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] nations in North America, and there are archives that exist within the papers of private individuals.  Many museums keep archives in order to prove the [[provenance]] of their pieces.  Any institution or persons wishing to keep their significant papers in an organized fashion that employs the most basic principles of [[archival science]] may have an archive.  In the 2004 census of archivists taken in the United States, 2.7% of archivists were employed in institutions that defied categorization.  This was a separate figure from the 1.3% that identified themselves as self-employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walch |first=Victoria Irons |year=2006 |title=A*Census: A Closer Look|journal=The American Archivist |volume=69 |issue= 2|pages=327–348|url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census| accessdate=8 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405071939/http://www.archivists.org/a-census| archivedate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of archive is the Public Secrets project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicsecret.net/|title=Public Secrets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an interactive testimonial, in which women incarcerated in the California State Prison System describe what happened to them. The archive's mission is to gather stories from women who want to express themselves, and want their stories heard. This collection includes transcripts and an audio recording of the women telling their stories.

The archives of an individual may include letters, papers, photographs, computer files, scrapbooks, financial records, or diaries created or collected by the individual – regardless of media or format. The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes.

==Standardization==
The [[International Council on Archives]] (ICA) has developed a number of standards on archival description including the General International Standard Archival Description ISAD(G).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ica.org/10206/standards/standards-list.html|title=ICA Standards Page|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824102817/http://www.ica.org/10206/standards/standards-list.html|archivedate=24 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISAD(G) is meant to be used in conjunction with national standards or as a basis for nations to build their own standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818015843/http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000 |date=18 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, ISAD(G) is implemented through [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]], popularly known as "DACS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Describing Archives: A Content Standard|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/standards/dacs.asp|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=20 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714055311/http://www.archivists.org/governance/standards/dacs.asp|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, ISAD(G) is implemented through the Council of Archives&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/Canadian{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Rules for Archival Description]], also known as "RAD".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rules for Archival Description|year=1990|publisher=Bureau of Canadian Archivists|isbn=978-0-9690797-3-6|url=http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/archdesrules.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516200843/http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/archdesrules.html|archivedate=16 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BlakeMalkin.jpg|thumb|William Blake's frontispiece to ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' (1806), combining a portrait with a symbolic image of the child's soul departing the earth]]
'''Benjamin Heath Malkin''' ({{Birth date|1769|03|23|df=y}}, London - {{Death date and age|1842|05|26|1769|03|23|df=y}} at [[Cowbridge]]&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;G. Martin Murphy, [[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British scholar and writer notable for his connection to the artist and poet [[William Blake]].

==Career and education==
Malkin was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Cambridge University]], receiving his MA in 1802 and his doctorate in 1810. In 1795 he published ''Essays on Subjects connected with Civilization'' (C. Dilly, London). From 1809 to 1828 he was headmaster of [[Bury St Edmunds Free School]], where he taught a number of pupils who would later go on to become [[Cambridge Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Bentley Jr, ''Blake Records'', 285 fn.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, Malkin became the first professor of History in the newly formed London University.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; During his scholarly career he published both historical and creative works on many subjects, including the history of South Wales, a translation of [[Gil Blas]], and the play ''Almahide and Hamet''.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', 1842, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;   He contributed biographies to ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]''.

==Connections with Blake==
Today he is remembered for his 1806 book ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'', which leads off with a 48-page introduction consisting of a dedication to his friend [[Thomas Johnes]] and the earliest biographical account of Blake. Blake had designed (though it was engraved by [[Robert Cromek]]) the frontispiece depicting Malkin's deceased son.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; G. E. Bentley suggests that Malkin met Blake in 1803, soon after Blake returned to London from his three years in Felpham.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, 223&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that the two men were acquainted via the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] for whom Blake had worked.  [[William Godwin]] reports meeting Malkin at dinner at [[Horne Tooke]]'s in 1796 and 1797 and at [[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]]'s Milton Gallery in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, 223 fn.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore likely that Blake and Malkin shared radical sympathies.  Malkin also lived close to Blake's patron Thomas Butts in Hackney, London and knew [[George Cumberland]], another friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, 285 fn.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a short biography of Blake, Malkin published a number of Blake's lyric poems. This was the first time they had been published other than in Blake's own original illuminated etchings. Before the publication of [[Alexander Gilchrist]]'s ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' in 1863, Malkin's book was the principal means of public knowledge of Blake's poetry. [[William Wordsworth]] copied poems from it.

==''A Father's Memoirs of His Child''==

''A Father's Memoirs of His Child'' is an account of the life and death of Malkin's son Thomas Williams Malkin, who along with his brother Benjamin is described as a [[child prodigy]] with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. He apparently learned the alphabet from blocks as an infant and would point to the correct letters when they were named. He did not speak until he was about two years old. Before he was three, he taught himself to write by copying print in books. Malkin insists that he did not push Thomas but followed his lead and taught him subjects such as Latin or mathematics only by request. Thomas also invented an [[Fictional country|imaginary country]] called Allestone, including details of its history, geography and monetary system, and an elaborate (for a five-year-old) map. Much of this material is included in the book, partly as proof that Thomas acted independently and was not coerced to achievements.

The book was written in part because of a confrontation with a "medical expert" the day after Thomas' death. It was his stated belief that Thomas had died of so-called "water on the brain", citing Thomas' "large head" and high intelligence as symptomatic of this disease. In effect, he accused Malkin of causing his son's death through having allowed him to overindulge in mental activity. Thus, Malkin includes the medical details of Thomas' final illness. He also ordered an autopsy, which he says proved conclusively that Thomas died of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[peritonitis]], and that his brain was perfectly normal. Malkin's grief and frustration are expressed vividly in this part of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Benjamin Heath, ''[https://archive.org/details/fathersmemoirsof00malk A Father's Memoirs of His Child]''. Published 1806 and available at the Internet Archive as of 2009-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Malkin's other children survived to adulthood. Benjamin Jr. became a [[barrister]]. He worked in the Imperial legal service, first as [[List of Recorders of Penang, Singapore and Malacca|Recorder]] of [[Penang]], and later as one of the [[Puisne]] Judges of [[Calcutta]], for which he was knighted. He was noted for his high intelligence and pleasant manner. He married and had two children, including [[Herbert Malkin]], lawyer and cricketer. He died in 1838.

Frederic, who was an infant when Thomas died, wrote several books on history including a history of Greece. [[Arthur Malkin|Arthur]], the youngest, also wrote historical textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Craik]], "A Child's Life Sixty Years Ago." In [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/abj7528.0001.001/43?page=root;size=100;view=image The Unkind Word &amp; Other Stories]. London: Hurst and Blackett, Publishers, 13, Great Marlborough Street, 1870. Craik criticizes Malkin for acceding to Thomas' requests to be educated at an early age and believes it did overtax his brain and contribute to his death; but she also admits that the other boys did well in life.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Malkin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lRMMAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false History of Greece from the earliest times to its final subjection to Rome]''. London: Baldwin &amp; Craddock, Paternoster Row, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas' "Allestone" [[paracosm]] came to the attention of fantasy fans in 1973 when the map was reprinted in ''[[An Atlas of Fantasy]]'' by Jeremiah Post.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5866">[[File:Beresford Hope cross VandA 265-1886.jpg|thumb|One side of the Beresford Hope Cross, circa 9th century, depicting the Virgin Mary praying flanked by busts of four saints]]

The '''Beresford Hope Cross''' is a 9th-century [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[reliquary]] cross with [[cloisonné]] [[enameling]].  It was intended to be worn as a pectoral [[crucifix]], perhaps holding a fragment of the [[True Cross]] in the compartment inside.  The cross is thought to have been made in southern Italy around the end of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], between 843 and the mid tenth century. It has been held by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] since 1886.

==Description==
The cross is made from gold, enamel, and [[silver gilt]], and measures approximately {{convert|8.7|x|5.8|x|1.8|cm}}.  It has a hinge at the top and catch at the bottom of the cross, so it can be opened to permit a small object to be placed in the cavity within.

One side of the cross depicts [[Christ]] [[crucifixion|on the cross]], with busts of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] on one side and of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] on the other. Below Christ's feet is a skull, possibly that of [[Adam]]. Above Christ's head is an inscription and the Sun and Moon.  At the centre of the cross, where Christ's chest and torso would be, is a hole.  The arms of the cross also bear faint Greek inscriptions,

The other side of the cross shows the Virgin Mary, standing with hands raised in prayer, flanked by busts of the saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], as Mary and Joseph were on the other side, with busts of [[John the Baptist]] above and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] below.
	
==Reliquary crosses==
Reliquary crosses contained objects from a holy place or person, and would often be worn as pendants. In the Beresford Hope cross, the hole in what would be Christ's torso is where this relic would have been placed. These articles were worn by a pious person, often someone high up in the church hierarchy.

This specific cross was probably one of the first of its kind, and led the way for future reliquary crosses, at least in this part of the world. It is also possible that this cross held a piece of the [[True Cross]], which was said to have been discovered in [[Jerusalem]] during [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s reign.

==Cloisonné==
[[Cloisonné]] is not an easy technique, but it is often seen in jewellery.  Byzantine artists found it one of the best ways to depict their religious icons, and render them realistically. Cloisonné is made by using thin strips of gold or other metal to outline a shape. The shape is then filled with glass mixed with pigment as a paste, and then fired to solidify it.  It is then ground down, and polished.  The medium is not good at rendering small detail and is more commonly used for geometric or vegetal subjects such as flowers, vines, or fruit, and not human forms. Colour can be hard to get right, and shapes can lose their form, making human faces look melted. We can see this in the Beresford Hope Cross, as the faces of Jesus, Mary, Joseph, etc., have almost muddy looking faces, without much detail.

==Provenance==
[[File:Sussex archaeological collections relating to the history and antiquities of the county (1856) (14776575414).jpg|thumb|Drawings from 1856]]

The cross was probably made somewhere in southern Italy. Early Byzantine enamels before 726 used a [[filigree]] technique, but cloisonné became dominant later.  The shade of translucent green enamel used as a body colour indicates a date between 843, when iconoclasm ended in Byzantium, to the mid tenth century.

Based on the relatively crude depictions of Christ, Mary, and the saints, and the way the craftsman completed the work, scholars have concluded that the cross was made by an Eastern craftsman in a Western city. This could mean the craftsman was someone from the East who moved West during iconoclasm, or perhaps someone who had studied under an Eastern craftsman before practising their trade in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Breckenridge&lt;/ref&gt; It is presumed that the cross was made in a much more isolated location than other crosses from the same time period. It has some stylistic similarities to the reliquary box known as the [[Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke]], but is even more crude.

It was first documented in a catalogue of the collection of [[Louis Fidel Debruge-Duménil]] (1788-1838), published in 1847. It was acquired by Mr. J.H. Beresford Hope{{who|date=March 2016}}.  His collection was sold by [[Alexander Beresford-Hope]] at [[Christie's]] in May 1886, when the cross was acquired for the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The '''Bezold effect''' is an [[optical illusion]], named after a German professor of meteorology, [[Wilhelm von Bezold]] (1837–1907), who discovered that a color may appear different depending on its relation to adjacent colors. 

It happens when small areas of color are interspersed. An assimilation effect called the '''von Bezold spreading effect''', similar to [[spatial color mixing]], is achieved. 

The opposite effect is observed when large areas of color are placed adjacent to each other, resulting in [[color contrast]].

'''''Black Lies, White Lies: The Truth According to Tony Brown''''' is a 1995 book by [[Tony Brown (journalist)|Tony Brown]], published by [[William Morrow &amp; Company ]].

Brown advocates for black self-reliance,&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-688-13270-5|title=Black Lies, White Lies: The Truth According to Tony Brown |publisher=[[Publisher's Weekly]]|date=1995-12-04|accessdate=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[black separatism]] in general. He criticizes black politicians' ties to the [[Democrat Party (United States)|Democrat Party]].&lt;ref name=Kahlenberg&gt;{{cite web|author=Kahlenberg, Richard D.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/blacklie.htm|title=Civil Rights and Wrongs |publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=1994-02-04|accessdate=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that African-Americans make up four "tribes".&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; Richard Kahlenberg of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' stated that "[[conspiracy theories]]", including those targeting the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and saying that [[AIDS]] research funds are not distributed properly, make up about 33% of the content.&lt;ref name=Kahlenberg/&gt; Kahlenberg stated that the criticisms of [[affirmative action]] for wealthier minorities are "flashes of insight".&lt;ref name=Kahlenberg/&gt;

==Background==
Brown is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

The book was dedicated to his foster guardians, Elizabeth "Mama" Sanford and Mabel Holmes, Sanford's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Terry, Gayle Pollard|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-18/opinion/op-37524_1_tony-brown|title=LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW : Tony Brown : Black Empowerment--via a Computer|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=1996-02-18|accessdate=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Kahlenberg stated that Brown's "sensationalist style that works better on television than in print" undermines his "legitimate criticisms".&lt;ref name=Kahlenberg/&gt;

[[Publisher's Weekly]] stated that Brown "undermines his case with a broad-brush assessment of the black community", referring to the designation of tribes, "and exaggerated references to black leaders' support for (and America's drift to) ``socialism.''"&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

The '''California Society of Printmakers''' (CSP) is the oldest continuously operating association of printmakers and friends of printmakers in the United States. CSP is a non-profit arts organization with an international membership of print artists and supporters of the art of fine [[printmaking]]. CSP promotes professional development and opportunity for printmakers, and educates artists and the public about printmaking. New members are admitted by portfolio review. Friends and supporters of printmaking are admitted by fee. They are based in [[San Francisco]], California.

== Early history: American print clubs (printmakers societies) and California Society of Etchers (CSE)==
[[File:California Society of Printmakers 2004 logo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Logo 2004-.]]
[[American print clubs]] or printmaking societies were prolific in the 19th century. Their impetus was primarily exhibition, technical exchange, shared equipment, and the promotion of printmaking as a fine art, as opposed to a method of reproducing images. The invention of photography meant that reproduction of art works could be achieved photographically instead of through the graphic arts of etching, engraving, and lithography. Thus, these methods of printmaking were freed from their reproducing role to develop as pure fine arts. In addition to the rise of printmaking societies/clubs, individual printmaking artists also sought to distinguish their work as a fine art, as opposed to a craft. Generally these artists from the 19th century were referred to as painter-etchers.  Nineteenth century printmaking societies in the United States were the New York Etchers Club (1877), Boston Etchers Club (1880?), Philadelphia Society of Etchers (1880), Brooklyn Etchers Club (1881), Brooklyn Scratchers Club (1882), Society of American Etchers (1888), Cincinnati Etchers Club (circa 1890).

Early 20th century printmaking societies were the very influential [[Chicago Society of Etchers]] (1910), begun and promoted by [[Bertha Jaques]]. After the Chicago Society, a flurry of other printmakers' societies followed. Next was the California Society of Etchers (1912), the Los Angeles group called the Printmakers of California (1914), and the Brooklyn Society of Etchers (1915).

The California Society of Etchers (CSE) merged with Bay Printmakers Society in 1968 when the current name, California Society of Printmakers (CSP), was adopted. Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s short histories of the society penned by various elected officers always referred to CSE/CSP as " the second oldest" continuous operating club in the United States. However, these historians failed to mention what the oldest society was. A little research revealed that the oldest American society of printmakers was the Chicago Society of Etchers. The California Society of Etchers was very aware of its Chicago predecessor, as the Chicago founder [[Bertha Jaques]] encouraged printmakers to establish their own local societies. Jaques also joined the California Society of Etchers in 1913, when non-resident members were first admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Millman, Mary and Dave Bohn, ''Master of Line: John W. Winker, American Etcher'' (Capra Press: Santa Barbara, 1994), p. 31, note 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Society of Etchers ceased operations in 1956, leaving California Society of Printmakers as the longest lived printmakers' society in the U.S.

== Origins of the California Society of Etchers (CSE)==

The California Society of Etchers (CSE) was founded in San Francisco in December 1912 and announced in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' on January 19, 1913  ("Etchers Form a State Organization", p.&amp;nbsp;27). Several sources cite an earlier 1911 date, such Marilyn S. Kushner's detailed chapter, "Genesis of the Twentieth-Century Print Club", although she does not cite her source. Robert B. Harshe, founder, and later first president of California Society of Etchers, leaves the founding date ambiguous in his chapter in the 1916 book, ''Art in California''. His chapter mentions the four years of the society, although the chapter itself is undated. Mary Millman and Dave Bohn's very thorough biography of John W. Winkler, cited above, supports the CSE founding date of 1912.

The founding of CSE is intimately connected with the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] (PPIE), a world’s fair held in 1915 in San Francisco to showcase the city’s recovery from the 1906 earthquake. It was Joseph Pennell, scheduled to be a juror for this event, who inspired a handful of local printmakers to launch the California Society of Etchers in preparation for that great event. Pennell, perhaps the best known American etcher, local to New York City and London, had traveled to Panama to sketch the construction of the Canal, then traveled to San Francisco where he produced a series of etchings of San Francisco, exhibiting them in 1912 in San Francisco. It is said that his presence in San Francisco achieved its purpose: encouraging local printmakers to get prepared and organized to take advantage of the promotional opportunities afforded by the upcoming San Francisco PPIE, the largest display of original art work of its time.

The four founders of the California Society of Etchers were artist colleagues: [[Robert B. Harshe]] (1879–1938), himself an etcher and then art professor at Stanford University;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/musarchives/archharshe.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706022242/http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/musarchives/archharshe.html# |archive-date=2008-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos|Pedro Joseph J. Lemos]] (1882–1954), then etcher and professor at the San Francisco Institute of Art (now [[San Francisco Art Institute]]);&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=4-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gottardo Piazzoni]] (1872–1945), painter and muralist; and [[Ralph Stackpole]] (1885–1973), a sculptor, printmaker, and at that time Piazzoni's studio assistant.

The young organization began exhibiting immediately, with its first annual exhibition in April 1913 at Vickery, Atkins and Torrey Print Gallery, 550 Sutter Street, San Francisco. Its second annual exhibition was also held in 1913.

Admission of artist members to the Society was originally not by juried portfolio review, as it is today. Then the society was open to all artists, painters and sculptors alike, any artist who had experience with etching techniques.  Artist membership was expanded beyond California in 1913 to include artists throughout the United States as well as American printmakers living abroad. It is not clear when precisely CSE began accepting international printmakers, but 1964 was CSE's first major international print competition.

The primary purpose of the Society was exhibition and education, promoting printmaking as a fine art, and sharing workspace and equipment. Non-artist members, then as now, were accepted as Associate or Patron members. Membership in both artist and associate categories grew quickly. The four founding members grew to fifteen charter members, those who were members at the time of publication of the first Constitution of the CSE in 1915; among these charter members was [[Gertrude Partington Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;Hailey, Gene, ed. [https://archive.org/stream/californiaartres15hail#page/n79/mode/2up "Gertrude Partington Albright"]. ''California Art Research 15 (1937): 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 there were 41 artist members and 107 associate members. Among the most prominent associate members were the Moore S. Achenbachs, the Sigmund Sterns, Dr. Leon Kolb, the Milton Esbergs, the Zellerbachs, [[Albert M. Bender]], and institutions such as the De Young Museum, Oakland Public Library, and the Print Club of Albany New York.

== Mid-Century==

California Society of Etchers (CSE) had enjoyed a dedicated executive secretary, Nicholas Dunphy (1896–1955), for more than 20 years, from 1932 to his death in 1955.  Understandably, Dunphy’s death created a huge hole in CSE's leadership. Nonetheless, annual membership shows continued except for the year of his death, with [[Elizabeth Ginno]] (1911–1991) becoming secretary after Dunphy's death. Ginno, Ginno's husband John W. Winkler, aka Winks (1890–1979), and Mark Luca (1918–2005), were active CSE members between 1955 and 1968, the year that CSE merged with Bay Printmakers Society to form California Society of Printmakers (CSP)

== Bay Printmakers Society==

In 1955 two graduate students from Oakland's California College of Arts and Crafts (now the [[California College of the Arts]]) were eager for exhibition opportunities.   According to [http://www.jeaneger.com  Jean Womack], former CSP historian, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080706141751/http://denverlibrary.org/about/art/strawn.html Mel Strawn] (1929–) and [http://www.oakton.edu/museum/pcpwill.html Will Petersen] (1928–1994) placed an ad in a national art magazine announcing themselves as the Bay Printmakers Society hosting a national exhibition. Work was to be sent to the address cited even though a location for the actual show had not yet been established. As the work poured in, Paul Mills, then director of the [[Oakland Museum]] of Art, provided the venue, and remained a strong supporter during the next five national exhibitions. The first exhibition was juried by John Paul Jones, respected printmaker from UCLA. The jurying took place at the home of Eldon Mills, friend of Mel Strawn, and an active supporter of Bay Printmakers; it was monitored/observed by Sabro Hasegawa, a visiting teacher from Japan at CCAC.

Charter members of the Bay Printmakers Society included artists [[Beth Van Hoesen]] (1926–2010 ), [http://www.printdealers.com/artist_template.cfm?id=1985 John Ihle] (1925–2002), [[Karl Kasten]] (1916–2010 ), [[Nathan Oliveira]] (1928–2010 ), Gordon Cook (1927–1985), Virginia Vandegrift, and art collector Eldon Mills.  Their activities were focused exclusively on the national show. Between 1955 and 1960, Bay Printmakers generally had one-person juries for their open national shows. After John Paul Jones, BPS jurors were printmaker Leonard Edmondson (1916–2002); poet [[Kenneth Patchen]] (1911–1972); and Director of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts [[Ernst Gunter Troche]] (1909–1971).

Between 1959 and 1965 CSE created three-person jury teams for their national open, juried print exhibitions. These generally consisted of one artist member, one critic, and one museum curator. In 1959 the jurors were Ernest Freed, John Winkler, and John LaPlante. In 1960 the jurors were Doel Reed, E. Gunter Troche, and Raymond E. Lewis. Other CSE national annual jurors were: 1961 Gordon Cook; 1965 Wayne Thiebaud, Alan Lynch, and Moses Lasky.

== Merger History: California Society of Etchers Joins Bay Printmakers==

In 1968 Ginno invited Bay Printmaker member John Ihle to join CSE, probably the first dual member of both organizations.  Ginno then approached Bay Printmaker president [[Karl Kasten]], who had help create the etching studios at the new San Francisco State University campus in 1949 and then joined UC Berkeley's art department in printmaking, about the possibility of merging CSE and BPS. Kasten took up the suggestion immediately. Both organizations met at the Oakland Museum in 1968 and approved the merger, electing Kasten as the first president of the new society, which they named California Society of Printmakers. A new constitution was created, and exhibitions, education of members and the public, and publications continued.

== CSP Today==

Today, CSP  has approximately 250 artist members, 19 honorary members, and 12 associate and patron memberships. CSP publishes the annual ''California Printmaker '''Journal''''' and previously published 
the semi-annual ''California Printmaker '''Newsbrief'''''.

== Archives ==

California Society of Printmakers maintains two separate archives: one of its records, the other of prints. The California Society of Printmakers Records were given to The [[Bancroft Library]], [[University of California, Berkeley]] by the California Society of Printmakers in January 1988. Additions were made in 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007. A finding aid to the records may be found at the [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2g5002s7/ Online Archive of California].

A small archive of prints is maintained by CSP at a San Francisco storage facility. An inventory has not yet been created.

[[File:A Colour Television Test.jpg|thumb|300px|A color television test at the [[Mount Kaukau]] transmitting station, [[New Zealand]], in 1970. A [[test pattern]] with color bars is sometimes used when no program material is available.]]
'''Color television''' is a [[television]] transmission technology that includes information on the [[color]] of the picture, so the video image can be displayed in color on the television set.  It is an improvement on the earliest television technology, [[monochrome]] or [[black and white television]], in which the image is displayed in shades of gray ([[grayscale]]). [[Television broadcasting]] stations and networks in most parts of the world upgraded from black and white to color transmission in the 1970s and 1980s. The invention of color television standards is an important part of the [[history of television]], and it is described in the [[technology of television]] article.

Transmission of color images using mechanical scanners had been conceived as early as the 1880s. A practical demonstration of mechanically-scanned color television was given by [[John Logie Baird]] in 1928, but the limitations of a mechanical system were apparent even then. Development of electronic scanning and display made an all-electronic system possible.  Early monochrome transmission standards were developed prior to the Second World War, but civilian electronics developments were frozen during much of the war. In August 1950, Baird gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic color television display. In the United States, commercially competing color standards were developed, finally resulting in the NTSC standard for color that retained compatibility with the prior monochrome system. Although the NTSC color standard was proclaimed in 1953 and limited programming became available, it was not until the early 1970s that color television in North America outsold black and white or monochrome units.  Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] formats until the 1960s.

Around 2006 countries began to switch from analog color television technology to [[digital television]]. This changeover is now complete in many developed countries, but analog television is still the standard in many developing countries.

==Development==
The human eye's detection system, which is in the [[retina]], consists primarily of two types of light detectors: [[rod cells]] that capture light, dark, and shapes/figures, and the [[cone cells]] that detect color. A typical retina contains 120 million rods and 4.5 million to 6 million cones, which are divided among three groups that are sensitive to red, green, and blue light. This means that the eye has far more resolution in brightness, or "[[luminance]]", than in [[color]]. However, post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image.

The eye has limited bandwidth to the rest of the visual system, estimated at just under 8 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Reilly, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-speed-of-sight "Calculating the speed of sight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910114905/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-speed-of-sight/ |date=September 10, 2017 }}, ''New Scientist'', July 28, 2006, &lt;/ref&gt; This manifests itself in a number of ways, but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion. This illusion starts to work at about 16 [[frames per second|frame/s]], and common motion pictures use 24 frame/s. Television, using power from the [[electrical grid]], tunes its rate in order to avoid interference with the [[alternating current]] being supplied – in North America, some Central and South American countries, Taiwan, Korea, part of Japan, the Philippines, and a few other countries, this is 60 [[Field (video)|video fields]] per second to match the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz power, while in most other countries it is 50 fields per second to match the 50&amp;nbsp; Hz power.

In its most basic form, a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images, one each in the three colors of [[red]], green, and blue (RGB). When displayed together or in rapid succession, these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer. One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951–1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic system developed by [[RCA]] which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The [[NTSC]] standard represented a major technical achievement.

===Early television===
Experiments in television systems using radio broadcasts date to the 19th century, but it was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made development practical. A key problem was the need to convert a 2D image into a "1D" radio signal; some form of image scanning was needed to make this work. Early systems generally used a device known as a "[[Nipkow disk]]", which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image. A single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot, which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast. A similar disk was used at the receiver side, with a light source behind the disk instead of a detector.

A number of such systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s. The best-known was [[John Logie Baird]]'s, which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in Britain for several years. Indeed, Baird's system was demonstrated to members of the Royal Institution in London in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true, working television system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/baird_logie.shtml|title=BBC - History - John Logie Baird|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=John Logie Baird: A Life|last=Kamm|first=Antony|last2=Baird|first2=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these early successes, all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems. Being mechanically driven, perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs was not easy to ensure, and irregularities could result in major image distortion. Another problem was that the image was scanned within a small, roughly rectangular area of the disk's surface, so that larger, higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images. Rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than Nipkow discs for high-resolution mechanical scanning, allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced, but such delicate, high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

It was clear to a number of developers that a completely electronic scanning system would be superior, and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means. Converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances. The two key advances were [[Philo Farnsworth]]'s electronic scanning system, and [[Vladimir Zworykin]]'s [[Iconoscope]] camera. The Iconoscope, based on [[Kálmán Tihanyi]]'s early patents, superseded the Farnsworth-system. With these systems, the [[BBC]] began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936, but these were shut down again with the start of [[World War II]] in 1939. In this time thousands of television sets had been sold. The receivers developed for this program, notably those from [[Pye Ltd.]], played a key role in the development of [[radar]].

By 22 March 1935, 180-line black-and-white television programs were being broadcast from the [[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow|Paul Nipkow TV station]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1936, under the guidance of "Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda" [[Joseph Goebbels]], direct transmissions from fifteen mobile units at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in Berlin]] were transmitted to selected small television houses ({{lang|de|Fernsehstuben}}) in Berlin and Hamburg.

In 1941, the first [[NTSC]] meetings produced a single standard for US broadcasts. US television broadcasts began in earnest in the immediate post-war era, and by 1950 there were 6 million televisions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Television", ''The World Book Encyclopedia'' 2003: 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-mechanical color===
The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built.

Among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no practical details.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumière Electrique'', vol. 11, December 1, 1880, p. 477–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An Armenian inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,&lt;ref&gt;Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C. Sutton, Business &amp; Economics - 1973, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; and was patented in [[Germany]] on March 31, 1908, patent № 197183, then in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], on April 1, 1908, patent № 7219,&lt;ref&gt;The History of Television, 1880-1941, by Albert Abramson, 1987, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; in [[France]] (patent № 390326) and in [[Russia]] in 1910 (patent № 17912).&lt;ref name="tvmuseum.ru"&gt;[http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 A. Rokhlin, Tak rozhdalos' dal'novidenie (in Russian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424162531/http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 |date=April 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on July 3, 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources, controlled by the signal, at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration was of a young girl wearing different colored hats. [[Noele Gordon]] went on to become a successful TV actress, famous for the soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]''. Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on February 4, 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at London's [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205202439/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html |date=February 5, 2015 }}. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.

===Hybrid systems===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
As was the case with black-and-white television, an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like Baird's. The obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional Iconoscopes with colored filters in front of them to produce an RGB signal. Using three separate tubes each looking at the same scene would produce slight differences in parallax between the frames, so in practice a single lens was used with a mirror or prism system to separate the colors for the separate tubes. Each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems.

The problem with this approach was there was no simple way to recombine them on the receiver end. If each image was sent at the same time on different frequencies, the images would have to be "stacked" somehow on the display, in real time. The simplest way to do this would be to reverse the system used in the camera: arrange three separate black-and-white displays behind colored filters and then optically combine their images using mirrors or prisms onto a suitable screen, like [[frosted glass]]. [[RCA]] built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on February 5, 1940,  privately shown to members of the US Federal Communications Commission at the RCA plant in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon Kilbon, ''Pioneering in Electronics: A Short History of the Origins and Growth of RCA Laboratories, Radio Corporation of America, 1919 to 1964'', [http://www.davidsarnoff.org/kil-chapter09.html Chapter Nine – Television: Monochrome to Color] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430082903/http://www.davidsarnoff.org/kil-chapter09.html |date=April 30, 2008 }}, 1964. V.K. Zworykin with Frederick Olessi, ''Iconoscope: An Autobiography of Vladimir Zworykin'', [http://www.davidsarnoff.org/vkz-chapter10.html Chapter 10 – Television Becomes a Reality, 1945–1954] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419083408/http://www.davidsarnoff.org/vkz-chapter10.html |date=April 19, 2008 }}, 1971. "The system used two color filters in combination with photocells and a flying spot scanner for pickup." Alfred V. Roman, ''The Historical Development of Color Television Systems'', doctoral dissertation, New York University, 1967, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This system, however, suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set, as well as having very dim pictures, the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era. Projection systems of this sort would become common decades later, however, with improvements in technology.

Another solution would be to use a single screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead of an even coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate electron gun, aimed at its colored phosphor. Although obvious, this solution was not practical. The [[electron gun]]s used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would have to focus on individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond the [[state of the art]] at the time.

Instead, a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror. In these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other, in either complete frames in the "[[field-sequential color system]]", or for each line in the "line-sequential" system. In both cases a colored filter was rotated in front of the display in sync with the broadcast. Since three separate images were being sent in sequence, if they used existing monochrome radio signaling standards they would have an effective refresh rate of only 20 fields, or 10 frames, a second, well into the region where flicker would become visible. In order to avoid this, these systems increased the frame rate considerably, making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards.

The first practical example of this sort of system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|author=|date=|website=www.bairdtelevision.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403170543/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|archivedate=April 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref name="Goldmark1"&gt;Peter C.

The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22, 1942 to August 20, 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22," ''New York Times'', March 8, 1942, p. 1.

===Fully electronic===
[[File:Baird first color photo.jpg|thumb|right|This live image of Paddy Naismith was used to demonstrate [[John Logie Baird]]'s first all-electronic color television system, which used two projection CRTs. The two-color image would be similar to the basic telechrome system.]]
As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the "[[Telechrome]]". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "stereoscopic" at the time). Baird's demonstration on August 16, 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hempstead|first1=Colin|title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403170543/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html |date=April 3, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

====FCC color====
In the immediate post-war era the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) was inundated with requests to set up new television stations. Worrying about congestion of the limited number of channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new [[UHF]] bands for television broadcast. At the time, black and white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations, they were free to pick an incompatible system and allow the older [[VHF]] channels to die off over time.

The FCC called for technical demonstrations of color systems in 1948, and the Joint Technical Advisory Committee (JTAC) was formed to study them. CBS displayed improved versions of its original design, now using a single 6&amp;nbsp;MHz channel (like the existing black-and-white signals) at 144 fields per second and 405 lines of resolution. [[Color Television Inc.]] demonstrated its line-sequential system, while [[Philco]] demonstrated a dot-sequential system based on its [[beam-index tube]]-based "Apple" tube technology. Of the entrants, the CBS system was by far the best-developed, and won head-to-head testing every time.

While the meetings were taking place it was widely known within the industry that RCA was working on a dot-sequential system that was compatible with existing black-and-white broadcasts, but RCA declined to demonstrate it during the first series of meetings. Just before the JTAC presented its findings, on August 25, 1949, RCA broke its silence and introduced its system as well. The JTAC still recommended the CBS system, and after the resolution of an ensuing RCA lawsuit, color broadcasts using the CBS system started on June 25, 1951. By this point the market had changed dramatically; when color was first being considered in 1948 there were fewer than a million television sets in the U.S., but by 1951 there were well over 10 million. The idea that the VHF band could be allowed to "die" was no longer practical.

During its campaign for FCC approval, CBS gave the first demonstrations of color television to the general public, showing an hour of color programs daily Mondays through Saturdays, beginning January 12, 1950, and running for the remainder of the month, over [[WUSA (TV)|WOIC]] in Washington, D.C., where the programs could be viewed on eight 16-inch color receivers in a public building.&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Chosen for First Color Showing; From Ages 4 to 90, Audience Amazed", ''The Washington Post'', January 13, 1950, p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to high public demand, the broadcasts were resumed February 13–21, with several evening programs added.&lt;ref&gt;"Color TV Tests To Be Resumed In Washington", ''The Washington Post'', February 12, 1950, p. M5.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS initiated a limited schedule of color broadcasts from its New York station [[WCBS-TV]] Mondays to Saturdays beginning November 14, 1950, making ten color receivers available for the viewing public.&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Color Television To Make Public Debut In N.Y.

L1. "Video Color Test Begins on C.B.S.," ''New York Times'', November 14, 1950, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York broadcasts were extended by [[coaxial cable]] to Philadelphia's [[WCAU|WCAU-TV]] beginning December 13,&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Color Preview Seen By 2,000 in Philadelphia", ''The Wall Street Journal'', December 16, 1950, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and to Chicago on January 10,&lt;ref&gt;"CBS to Display Color Video in City Next Week", ''Chicago Tribune'', January 6, 1951, television and radio section, p. C4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Preview of CBS Color TV Wins City's Acclaim", ''Chicago Tribune'', January 10, 1951, p. A8.&lt;/ref&gt; making them the first network color broadcasts.

After a series of hearings beginning in September 1949, the FCC found the RCA and CTI systems fraught with technical problems, inaccurate color reproduction, and expensive equipment, and so formally approved the CBS system as the U.S. color broadcasting standard on October 11, 1950. An unsuccessful lawsuit by RCA delayed the first commercial network broadcast in color until June 25, 1951, when a musical variety special titled simply [[Premiere (TV program)|''Premiere'']] was shown over a network of five East Coast CBS affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;"C.B.S. Color Video Presents a 'First'," ''New York Times'', June 26, 1951, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing was again restricted: the program could not be seen on black-and-white sets, and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the New York area.&lt;ref&gt;Four-hundred guests watched the premiere commercial broadcast on eight color receivers at a CBS studio in New York, as no color receivers were available to the general public. "C.B.S. Color Video Presents a 'First"", ''New York Times'', June 26, 1951, p. 31. A total of about 40 color receivers was available in the five cities on the color network. The CBS affiliate in Washington had three receivers and a monitor. "First Sponsored TV in Color Praised by WTOP Audience", ''The Washington Post'', June 26, 1951, p. 1. Most of the remainder of the prototype color receivers were given to advertisers sponsoring the color broadcasts. "Today, June 25, 1951, is a turning point in broadcasting history" (WTOP-TV advertisement), ''The Washington Post'', June 25, 1951, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Regular color broadcasts began that same week with the daytime series ''[[The World Is Yours (TV series)|The World Is Yours]]'' and ''[[Modern Homemakers]]''.

Three exceptions among the major television manufacturers were [[Philco]], which offered 11 models that could show CBS color broadcasts in black-and-white; and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] and [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|Admiral]], which offered adapters to receive color broadcasts in black and white.

CBS had bought a television manufacturer in April,&lt;ref&gt;"Hytron's Deal With CBS Seen TV Color Aid", ''The Washington Post'', April 12, 1951, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 1951, production began on the only CBS-Columbia color television model, with the first color sets reaching retail stores on September 28.&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Subsidiary Starts Mass Production of Color Television Sets," ''Wall Street Journal'', September 13, 1951, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=oCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 Para-TV Color Sets To Go On Sale Soon]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', October 6, 1951, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was too little, too late. Only 200 sets had been shipped, and only 100 sold, when CBS discontinued its color television system on October 20, 1951, ostensibly by request of the [[National Production Authority]] for the duration of the [[Korean War]], and bought back all the CBS color sets it could to prevent lawsuits by disappointed customers.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=cbs+color#v=snippet&amp;q=cbs%20color&amp;f=false Text of Note to CBS Asking Color Set Halt]", ''Billboard'', October 27, 1951, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color TV Shelved As a Defense Step," ''New York Times'', October 20, 1951, p. 1.

====Compatible color====
While the FCC was holding its JTAC meetings, development was taking place on a number of systems allowing true simultaneous color broadcasts, "[[dot-sequential color system]]s". Unlike the hybrid systems, dot-sequential televisions used a signal very similar to existing black-and-white broadcasts, with the intensity of every dot on the screen being sent in succession.

In 1938 [[Georges Valensi]] demonstrated an encoding scheme that would allow color broadcasts to be encoded so they could be picked up on existing black-and-white sets as well. In his system the output of the three camera tubes were re-combined to produce a single "[[Luma (video)|luminance]]" value that was very similar to a monochrome signal and could be broadcast on the existing VHF frequencies. The color information was encoded in a separate "[[chrominance]]" signal, consisting of two separate signals, the original blue signal minus the luminance (B'–Y'), and red-luma (R'–Y'). These signals could then be broadcast separately on a different frequency; a monochrome set would tune in only the luminance signal on the VHF band, while color televisions would tune in both the luminance and chrominance on two different frequencies, and apply the reverse transforms to retrieve the original RGB signal. The downside to this approach is that it required a major boost in bandwidth use, something the FCC was interested in avoiding.

RCA used Valensi's concept as the basis of all of its developments, believing it to be the only proper solution to the broadcast problem. However, RCA's early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems, and were easily bested by CBS's hybrid system. But solutions to these problems were in the pipeline, and RCA in particular was investing massive sums (later estimated at $100 million) to develop a usable dot-sequential tube. RCA was beaten to the punch by the [[Geer tube]], which used three B&amp;W tubes aimed at different faces of colored pyramids to produce a color image. All-electronic systems included the [[Chromatron]], [[Penetron]] and [[beam-index tube]] that were being developed by various companies. While investigating all of these, RCA's teams quickly started focusing on the [[shadow mask]] system.

In July 1938 the [[shadow mask]] color television was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900–1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin|International radio exhibition Berlin]] in 1939. Most CRT color televisions used today are based on this technology. His solution to the problem of focusing the electron guns on the tiny colored dots was one of brute-force; a metal sheet with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed through the holes the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The downside to this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.

In spite of these problems in both the broadcast and display systems, RCA pressed ahead with development and was ready for a second assault on the standards by 1950.

====Second NTSC====
The possibility of a compatible color broadcast system was so compelling that the NTSC decided to re-form, and held a second series of meetings starting in January 1950. Having only recently selected the CBS system, the FCC heavily opposed the NTSC's efforts. One of the FCC Commissioners, R. F. Jones, went so far as to assert that the engineers testifying in favor of a compatible system were "in a conspiracy against the public interest".

Unlike the FCC approach where a standard was simply selected from the existing candidates, the NTSC would produce a board that was considerably more pro-active in development.

Starting before CBS color even got on the air, the U.S. television industry, represented by the [[NTSC|National Television System Committee]], worked in 1950–1953 to develop a color system that was compatible with existing black-and-white sets and would pass FCC quality standards, with RCA developing the hardware elements. ("Compatible color," a phrase from advertisements for early sets, appears in the song "America" of ''[[West Side Story]]'', 1957.) RCA first made publicly announced field tests of the dot sequential color system over its New York station [[WNBC|WNBT]] in July 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"RCA to Test Color TV System On Three Shows Daily Beginning Today", ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 9, 1951, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; When CBS testified before Congress in March 1953 that it had no further plans for its own color system,&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Says Confusion Now Bars Color TV," ''Washington Post'', March 26, 1953, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Production Authority]] dropped its ban on the manufacture of color television receivers,&lt;ref&gt;"N.P.A.

Rules Color TV Can Go on Air at Once," ''New York Times'', December 19, 1953, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first publicly announced network demonstration of a program using the NTSC "compatible color" system was an episode of NBC's ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'' on August 30, 1953, although it was viewable in color only at the network's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;"NBC Launches First {{Sic|?|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Announced Color Television Show," ''Wall Street Journal'', August 31, 1953, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The first network broadcast to go out over the air in NTSC color was a performance of the opera ''[[Carmen]]'' on October 31, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Firsts in Television] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141225155750/http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html |date=December 25, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Gould, "Television in Review: Further Thoughts on Color", ''The New York Times'', November 2, 1953, p. 34.

Cuba in 1958 became the second country in the world to introduce color television broadcasting, with Havana's Channel 12 using standards established by the [[NTSC]] Committee of United States Federal Communications Commission in 1940, and American technology patented by the American electronics company RCA, or Radio Corporation of America. But the color transmissions ended when broadcasting stations were seized in the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, and did not return until 1975, using equipment acquired from Japan's [[NEC Corporation]], and [[SECAM]] equipment from the Soviet Union, adapted for the American NTSC standard.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Diaz-Martin, "The Recent History of Satellite Communications in Cuba", [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4217/ch19.htm Selection of a Color Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225231626/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4217/ch19.htm |date=December 25, 2017 }}, in ''Beyond the Ionosphere: Fifty Years of Satellite Communication'' (NASA SP-4217, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guillermo González Camarena]] independently invented and developed a field-sequential tricolor disk system in México in the late 1930s, for which he requested a patent in México on August 19 of 1940 and in the USA in 1941.&lt;ref name="US2296019"&gt;

On August 31, 1946 González Camarena sent his first color transmission from his lab in the offices of The Mexican League of Radio Experiments at Lucerna St. No. 1, in [[Mexico City]]. The video signal was transmitted at a frequency of 115&amp;nbsp;MHz. and the audio in the 40 metre band. He obtained authorization to make the first publicly announced color broadcast in Mexico, on February 8, 1963, of the program ''Paraíso Infantil'' on Mexico City's [[XHGC-TV]], using the NTSC system which had by now been adopted as the standard for color programming.

González Camarena also invented the ''Simplified Mexican Color TV system'' as a much simpler and cheaper alternative to the NTSC system.&lt;ref name="Simplified-Mexican"&gt;

[[File:RCA CT-100 screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|CT-100 at the [[SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention]] playing [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]].]]

Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XpTGUdq5JO_A4APivoCoDA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on January 1, 1954, but over the next dozen years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. In 1956 NBC's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' became the first live network television series to present a majority of episodes in color. CBS's ''[[The Big Record]]'', starring pop vocalist [[Patti Page]], was the first television show broadcast in color for the entire 1957-1958 season; its production costs were greater than most movies were at the time not only because of all the stars featured on the hour-long extravaganza but the extremely high-intensity lighting and electronics required for the new [[RCA TK-41]] cameras. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.

[[NBC]] made the first coast-to-coast color broadcast when it telecast the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on January 1, 1954, with public demonstrations given across the United States on prototype color receivers by manufacturers [[RCA]], [[General Electric]], [[Philco]], [[Raytheon]], [[Hallicrafters]], [[Hoffman Television|Hoffman]], [[Pacific Mercury]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;"Television in Review: N.B.C. Color," ''New York Times'', January 5, 1954, p. 28. Two days earlier Admiral demonstrated to their distributors the prototype of Admiral's first color television set planned for consumer sale using the NTSC standards, priced at $1,175 ({{Inflation|US|1175|1954|fmt=eq}}). It is not known when the later commercial version of this receiver was first sold. Production was extremely limited, and no advertisements for it were published in New York or Washington newspapers.

X11.&lt;/ref&gt; NBC's [[anthology series]] ''[[Ford Theatre]]'' became the first network color filmed series that October.&lt;ref&gt;After 15 episodes in color, Ford reduced costs by making only every third episode in color. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 Ford Cuts Back on Color Film]", ''Billboard'', October 30, 1954, p. 6. The syndicated ''[[The Cisco Kid|Cisco Kid]]'' had been filmed in color since 1949 in anticipation of color broadcasting. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=MvYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47 'Cisco Kid' for TV Via Pact With Ziv]", ''Billboard'', September 24, 1949, p. 47.

Early color telecasts could be preserved only on the black-and-white [[kinescope]] process introduced in 1947. It was not until September 1956 that NBC began using color film to time-delay and preserve some of its live color telecasts.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland, 2003, p. 74. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1220-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ampex]] introduced a color videotape recorder in 1958, which NBC used to tape ''[[An Evening With Fred Astaire]],'' the oldest surviving network color videotape.  This system was also used to unveil a demonstration of color television for the press. On May 22, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the WRC-TV NBC studios in Washington, D.C. and gave a speech touting the new technology's merits.  His speech was recorded in color, and a copy of this videotape was given to the Library of Congress for posterity.

Several syndicated shows had episodes filmed in color during the 1950s, including ''[[The Cisco Kid]]'', ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'', ''[[My Friend Flicka (TV series)|My Friend Flicka]]'', and ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. The first two were carried by some stations equipped for color telecasts well before NBC began its regular weekly color dramas in 1959, beginning with the Western series ''[[Bonanza]]''.

NBC was at the forefront of color programming because its parent company RCA manufactured the most successful line of color sets in the 1950s, and by 1959 RCA was the only remaining major manufacturer of color sets.&lt;ref&gt;RCA made about 95 percent of the color television sets sold in the U.S. in 1960. Peter Bart, "Advertising: Color TV Set Output Spurred," ''New York Times'', July 31, 1961, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which were not affiliated with set manufacturers and were not eager to promote their competitor's product, dragged their feet into color.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=LSMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 ABC to Go Tint at First Sponsor Nibble]", ''Billboard'', September 4, 1954, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891921-1,00.html Chasing the Rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724201955/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891921-1,00.html |date=July 24, 2008 }}," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', June 30, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS broadcast color specials and sometimes aired its big weekly variety shows in color, but it offered no regularly scheduled color programming until the fall of 1965. At least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', was filmed in color beginning in 1963 but continued to be telecast in black and white through the end of the 1964–65 season. ABC delayed its first color programs until 1962, but these were initially only broadcasts of the cartoon shows ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'' and ''[[Beany and Cecil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', and ''[[Beany and Cecil]]''. "A.B.C.-TV To Start Color Programs," ''New York Times'', April 1, 1962, p. 84. "More Color," ''New York Times'', September 23, 1962, p. 145. Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Firsts in Television] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219060637/http://novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html |date=December 19, 2008 }}. Jack Gould, "Tinted TV Shows Its Colors," ''New York Times'', November 29, 1964, p. X17.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network, although it did have a television-manufacturing parent company, was in financial decline by 1954 and was dissolved two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Ingram, [http://www.dumonthistory.tv/7.html The DuMont Television Network, Chapter Seven: Finale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804165205/http://www.dumonthistory.tv/7.html |date=August 4, 2009 }}. The small amount of color programming that DuMont broadcast in 1954–1955 (mostly its show ''Sunday Supplement'') was all from color films.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively small amount of network color programming, combined with the high cost of color television sets, meant that as late as 1964 only 3.1 percent of television households in the U.S. had a color set. But by the mid-1960s, the subject of color programming turned into a ratings war. A 1965 [[Nielsen Audio|ARB]] study that proposed an emerging trend in color television set sales convinced NBC that a full shift to color would gain a ratings advantage over its two competitors.&lt;ref name="tvobscurities.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/color60s/|title=Color Revolution: Television In The Sixties - TVObscurities|author=|date=|website=tvobscurities.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103093236/http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/color60s/|archivedate=January 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, NBC provided the catalyst for rapid color expansion by announcing that its [[1965-66 United States network television schedule|prime time schedule for fall 1965]] would be almost entirely in color.&lt;ref&gt;The exceptions being ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Convoy (TV series)|Convoy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ABC and CBS followed suit and over half of their combined prime-time programming also was in color that season, but they were still reluctant to telecast all their programming in color due to production costs.&lt;ref name="tvobscurities.com"/&gt; All three broadcast networks were airing full color prime time schedules by the [[1966-67 American network television schedule|1966–67 broadcast season]], and ABC aired its last new black-and-white daytime programming in December 1967.&lt;ref&gt;The game show ''Everybody's Talking''. CBS's daytime soap opera ''[[The Secret Storm]]'' was the last network show to switch to color after airing its last black-and-white performance on March 11, 1968, making it the last black-and-white series on commercial network television.  The last black-and-white series on network television was  ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood|MisteRogers' Neighborhood]]'' on the non-commercial [[National Educational Television|NET]].  Production of this series switched over to color in August 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Public broadcasting networks like [[National Educational Television|NET]], however, did not use color for a majority of their programming until 1968.  The number of color television sets sold in the U.S. did not exceed black-and-white sales until 1972, which was also the first year that more than fifty percent of television households in the U.S. had a color set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/facts-stats.htm Television Facts and Statistics – 1939 to 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731144259/http://www.tvhistory.tv/facts-stats.htm |date=July 31, 2008 }}, Television History – The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the year that "in color" notices before color television programs ended{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, due to the rise in color television set sales, and color programming having become the norm.

In a display of foresight, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] had filmed many of its earlier shows in color so they were able to be repeated on NBC, and since most of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color, they could now also be telecast in that format. To emphasize the new feature, the series was re-dubbed ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'', which premiered in September 1961, and retained that moniker until 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walt Disney anthology television series]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s, even those areas switched to color sets.

Color broadcasting in Hawaii started in September 1965, and in Alaska a year later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} One of the last television stations in North America to convert to color, [[WINP-TV|WQEX]] (now WINP-TV) in [[Pittsburgh]], started broadcasting in color on October 16, 1986 after its black-and-white transmitter, which dated from the 1950s, broke down in February 1985 and the parts required to fix it were no longer available. The then-owner of WQEX, [[PBS]] member station [[WQED (TV)|WQED]], diverted some of its pledge money into getting a color transmitter for WQEX.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice, they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE's]] relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Also in 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

===Europe===
The first regular colour broadcasts in Europe were by the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[BBC Two|BBC2]] beginning on July 1, 1967 (PAL). [[West Germany]]'s first colour broadcast occurred in August (PAL), followed by the Netherlands in September (PAL), and by France in October (SECAM). Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria, [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and Hungary all started regular colour broadcasts around 1969/1970. Ireland's national TV station [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] began using colour in 1968 for recorded programmes; the first [[outside broadcasting|outside broadcast]] made in colour for RTÉ Television was when Ireland hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|in Dublin in 1971]].&lt;ref name="RTÉ Archives"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1970s.html|title=THE ADVENT OF COLOUR TELEVISION: 1971|publisher=RTÉ Archives|accessdate=30 April 2013|date=18 April 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204210214/http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1970s.html|archivedate=February 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAL system spread through most of Western Europe.

More European countries introduced colour television using the PAL system in the 1970s and early 1980s; examples include [[Belgium]] (1971), [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]/[[Serbia]] (1971), [[Spain]] (1972, but not fully implemented until 1978), [[Iceland]] (1973), [[Portugal]] (1975, but not fully implemented until 1980), [[Albania]] (1981), [[Turkey]] (1981) and [[Romania]] (1983, but not fully implemented until 1990). In Italy there were debates to adopt a national colour television system, the ''ISA'', developed by [[Indesit]], but that idea was scrapped. As a result, Italy was one of the last European countries to officially adopt the PAL system in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagine70.com/vmnews/wmview.php?ArtID=650 The adoption of color television in Italy (Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229212545/http://www.pagine70.com/vmnews/wmview.php?ArtID=650 |date=February 29, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French colonial empires|France]], Luxembourg, and most of the [[Warsaw Pact|Eastern Bloc]] along with their overseas territories opted for [[SECAM]]. SECAM was a popular choice in countries with much hilly terrain, and technologically backward countries with a very large installed base of monochrome equipment, since the greater ruggedness of the SECAM signal could cope much better with poorly maintained equipment. However, for many countries the decision was more down to politics than technical merit.

A drawback of SECAM for production is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals are not really possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple fade to black is trivial in NTSC and PAL: one merely reduces the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the colour difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that [[comb filter]]ing, allowing better colour separation, is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback in the early days of SECAM as such filters were not readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.

The first regular colour broadcasts in SECAM were started on October 1, 1967, on [[France 2|France's Second Channel (ORTF 2e chaîne)]].
In France and the UK colour broadcasts were made on [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequencies, the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band being used for black and white, 405 lines in UK or 819 lines in France, until the beginning of the 1980s. Countries elsewhere that were already broadcasting 625-line monochrome on VHF and UHF, simply transmitted colour programs on the same channels.

Some British television programs, particularly those made by or for [[ITC Entertainment]], were shot on colour film before the introduction of colour television to the UK, for the purpose of sales to U.S. networks. The first British show to be made in colour was the drama series ''[[The Adventures of Sir Lancelot]]'' (1956–57), which was initially made in black and white but later shot in colour for sale to the [[NBC]] network in the United States. Other British colour television programs include ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' (1964–1965), which was the first British TV show to be filmed entirely in colour, ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' (1965–1966) and ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' (1967–1968). However, most UK series predominantly made using videotape, such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963–89; 2005–present) did not begin colour production until later, with the first colour ''Doctor Who'' episodes not airing until 1970.

===Asia and the Pacific===
In [[Japan]], [[NHK]] and [[Nippon Television|NTV]] introduced color television, using a variation of the [[NTSC]] system (called [[NTSC-J]]) on September 10, 1960, making it the first country in Asia to introduce color television.  The [[Philippines]] (1966) and [[Taiwan]] (1969) also adopted the [[NTSC]] system.

Other countries in the region instead used the [[PAL]] system, starting with [[Australia]] (1967, originally scheduled for 1972, but not fully implemented until 1975), and then [[Thailand]] (1969; this country converted from a 525-line system to 625 lines), [[Hong Kong]] (1970), the [[People's Republic of China]] (1971), [[New Zealand]] (1973), [[North Korea]] (1974), [[Singapore]] (1974), [[Pakistan]] (1976, but not fully implemented until 1982), [[Kazakhstan]] (1978), [[Vietnam]] (1978), [[Malaysia]] (1978, but not fully implemented until 1980), [[Indonesia]] (1979), [[India]] (1979, but not fully implemented until 1982), and [[Bangladesh]] (1980). [[South Korea]] did not introduce color television (using [[NTSC]]) until 1980 (full-time color transmissions began in 1981), although it was already manufacturing color television sets for export. [[Cambodia]] was the last country in [[Asia]] to introduce color television, officially introduced in 1981 using the PAL system, with full-time color transmissions since 1985.

====Middle East====
Nearly all of the countries in the Middle East use PAL. The first country in the Middle East to introduce color television was Iraq in 1967. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar followed in the mid-1970s, but Israel, Lebanon, and Cyprus continued to broadcast in black and white until the early 1980s. Israeli television even erased the color signals using a device called the [[Television in Israel#The mekhikon|''mekhikon'']].

===Africa===
The first color television service in Africa was introduced on the [[Tanzania]]n island of [[Zanzibar]], in 1973, using PAL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Zanzibar+colour+tv+in+Africa+1973.&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Zanzibar+ ''Mass Media, Towards the Millennium: The South African Handbook of Mass Communication''], Arrie De Beer, J.L. van Schaik, 1998, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 also, [[Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] of [[Mauritius]] broadcast the OCAMM Conference, in color, using SECAM. At the time, [[South Africa]] did not have a television service at all, owing to opposition from the [[apartheid]] regime, but in 1976, one was [[Television in South Africa#Introduction of television|finally launched]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/tv-in-south-africa-marks-its-40th-anniversary-20160105 TV in South Africa marks its 40th anniversary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215230324/http://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/tv-in-south-africa-marks-its-40th-anniversary-20160105 |date=February 15, 2016 }}, [[News24|channel24]], 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigeria]] adopted PAL for color transmissions in 1974 in the then Benue Plateau state in the north central region of the country, but countries such as [[Ghana]] and [[Zimbabwe]] continued with black and white until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=nEsYVfK3MtbWavGogpAO&amp;id=2MhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=zbc+tv+colour+1984&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Colour+transmission ''A Concise Encyclopedia of Zimbabwe''], Donatus Bonde, Mambo Press, 1988, page 410&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service]] (SLBS) started television broadcasting in 1963 as a cooperation between the SLBS and commercial interests; coverage was extended to all districts in 1978 when the service was also upgraded to color.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgptYdAcsOgC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=sierra%20leone%20broadcasting%20service%20colour%20television&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q=sierra%20leone%20broadcasting%20service%20colour%20television&amp;f=true ''World Broadcasting: A Comparative View''], Alan Wells, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, page 173&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
In contrast to most other countries in the Americas, which had adopted [[NTSC]], Brazil began broadcasting in color using [[PAL-M]]. Its first color transmission was on February 19, 1972. However Ecuador was the first South American country to use [[NTSC]] color. Its first color transmission was on November 5, 1974. In 1978, Argentina started broadcasting in color using [[PAL-N]] in connection with the country's hosting of the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. Some countries in South America, including Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, continued to broadcast in black and white until the early 1980s.

[[Cor Dillen]], director and later [[CEO]] of the South American branch of [[Philips]], was responsible for bringing color television to South America.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Color standards==
There are three main analog [[broadcast television systems]] in use around the world, [[PAL]] (Phase Alternating Line), [[NTSC]] (National Television System Committee), and [[SECAM]] (Séquentiel Couleur à Mémoire—Sequential Color with Memory).

The system used in The Americas and part of the Far East is NTSC. Most of Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Africa, and Eastern South America use PAL (though Brazil uses a hybrid PAL-M system). Eastern Europe and France uses SECAM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paradiso-design.net/TVsystems_worldwide.html World TV standards.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a device (such as a television) can only read or display video encoded to a standard which the device is designed to support; otherwise, the source must be converted (such as when European programs are broadcast in North America or vice versa).

[[Digital terrestrial television|Digital television broadcasting]] standards, such as [[ATSC]], [[DVB-T]], [[DVB-T2]], and [[ISDB]], have superseded these analog transmission standards in many countries.

'''Diego María de la Concepción Juan Nepomuceno Estanislao de la Rivera y Barrientos Acosta y Rodríguez''', known as '''Diego Rivera''' ({{IPA-es|ˈdjeɣo riˈβeɾa}}; December 8, 1886 – November 24, 1957) was a prominent Mexican painter. His large [[fresco]]es helped establish the [[Mexican muralism|Mexican mural movement]] in [[Mexican art]]. Between 1922 and 1953, Rivera painted [[mural]]s in, among other places, [[Mexico City]], [[Chapingo]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[San Francisco]], [[Detroit]], and [[New York City]]. In 1931, a retrospective exhibition of his works was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. Rivera had a volatile marriage with fellow Mexican artist [[Frida Kahlo]].

August 1916, oil on canvas, 134.5 x 88.5 cm, Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil. This work forms part of Rivera's [[Crystal Cubism|Crystal Cubist]] period.]]

Rivera was born in [[Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]], to a well-to-do family, the son of María del Pilar Barrientos and Diego Rivera Acosta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/3436/Rivera-Diego-1886-1957-Artist-Began-Drawing-Toddler.html Diego Rivera Began Drawing As A Toddler]&lt;/ref&gt; Diego had a twin brother named Carlos, who died two years after they were born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notablebiographies.com/Pu-Ro/Rivera-Diego.html#ixzz12GO9KaN6His online biography] Retrieved October 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera was said to have [[Converso]] ancestry (having ancestors who were forced to convert from [[Judaism]] to [[Catholicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/on-day/41680/on-day-diego-rivera-dies "On this day: Diego Rivera dies", ''The Jewish Chronicle''. Thejc.com. Retrieved 20-09-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera wrote in 1935: "My Jewishness is the dominant element in my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Mexico.html |title=Mexico: Virtual Jewish History Tour |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera began drawing at the age of three, a year after his twin brother's death. He had been caught drawing on the walls. His parents, rather than punishing him, installed chalkboards and canvas on the walls. As an adult, he married [[Angelina Beloff]] in 1911, and she gave birth to a son, Diego (1916–1918). [[Marie Vorobieff|Maria Vorobieff-Stebelska]] gave birth to a daughter named [[Marika Rivera|Marika]] in 1918 or 1919 when Rivera was married to Angelina (according to ''House on the Bridge: Ten Turbulent Years with Diego Rivera'' and Angelina's memoirs called ''Memorias''). He married his second wife, [[Guadalupe Marín]], in June 1922, with whom he had two daughters: [[Ruth Rivera Marin|Ruth]] and Guadalupe. He was still married when he met art student [[Frida Kahlo]]. They married on August 21, 1929 when he was 42 and she was 22. Their mutual infidelities and his violent temper led to divorce in 1939, but they remarried December 8, 1940 in San Francisco. Rivera later married Emma Hurtado, his agent since 1946, on July 29, 1955, one year after Kahlo's death.

Rivera was an [[atheist]]. His mural ''Dreams of a Sunday in the Alameda'' depicted [[Ignacio Ramírez]] holding a sign which read, "God does not exist". This work caused a furor, but Rivera refused to remove the inscription. The painting was not shown for nine years – until Rivera agreed to remove the inscription. He stated: "To affirm 'God does not exist', I do not have to hide behind Don Ignacio Ramírez; I am an atheist and I consider religions to be a form of collective neurosis."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Stein, ''Siqueiros: His Life and Works'' (International Publishers Co, 1994), {{ISBN|0-7178-0706-1}}, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

From the age of ten, Rivera studied art at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in [[Mexico City]]. He was sponsored to continue study in Europe by [[Teodoro A. Dehesa Méndez]], the governor of the State of [[Veracruz]]. After arrival in Europe in 1907, Rivera initially went to study with Eduardo Chicharro in [[Madrid]], Spain, and from there went to Paris, France, to live and work with the great gathering of artists in [[Montparnasse]], especially at [[La Ruche]], where his friend [[Amedeo Modigliani]] painted his portrait in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/32357038@N08/3590825086/ |title=Modigliani, Amedeo - 1914 Portrait of Diego Rivera (Museo de Arte, Sao Paolo, Brazil) &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His circle of close friends, which included [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and Modigliani's wife [[Jeanne Hébuterne]], [[Max Jacob]], gallery owner [[Léopold Zborowski]], and [[Moise Kisling]], was captured for posterity by [[Marie Vorobieff]]-Stebelska (Marevna) in her painting "Homage to Friends from Montparnasse" (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rusmuseum.ru/eng/exhibitions/?id=140&amp;year=2003&amp;pic=4 |title=M.

In those years, Paris was witnessing the beginning of [[Cubism]] in paintings by such eminent painters as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Juan Gris]]. From 1913 to 1917, Rivera enthusiastically embraced this new school of art. Around 1917, inspired by [[Paul Cézanne]]'s paintings, Rivera shifted toward [[Post-Impressionism]] with simple forms and large patches of vivid colors. His paintings began to attract attention, and he was able to display them at several exhibitions.

Rivera died on November 24, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artinthepicture.com/artists/Diego_Rivera/biography.html |title=Diego Rivera — Biography |publisher=artinthepicture.com |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, urged by Alberto J. Pani, the Mexican ambassador to France, Rivera left France and traveled through Italy studying its art, including [[Renaissance]] [[fresco]]es. After [[José Vasconcelos]] became Minister of Education, Rivera returned to Mexico in 1921 to become involved in the government sponsored Mexican [[mural]] program planned by Vasconcelos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Rivera: Biography|url=http://www.leninimports.com/diego_rivera.html|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also [[Mexican muralism]].'' The program included such [[Mexican people|Mexican]] artists as [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]], and the French artist [[Jean Charlot]].

In the autumn of 1922, Rivera participated in the founding of the Revolutionary Union of Technical Workers, Painters and Sculptors, and later that year he joined the [[Mexican Communist Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Rivera|url=http://www.fbuch.com/diego.htm|publisher=Fred Buch|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including its [[Central Committee]]). His murals, subsequently painted in [[fresco]] only, dealt with Mexican society and reflected the country's [[Mexican Revolution|1910 Revolution]]. Rivera developed his own native style based on large, simplified figures and bold colors with an [[Aztec]] influence clearly present in murals at the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] in [[Mexico City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.abcgallery.com/R/rivera/rivera-2.html |title=Diego Rivera |publisher=Olga's Gallery |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; begun in September 1922, intended to consist of one hundred and twenty-four frescoes, and finished in 1928.&lt;ref name=chronology /&gt;

Norton &amp; Company, 2006, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Rivera's most famous murals are featured at the National School of Agriculture  ([[Chapingo Autonomous University]] of Agriculture) at [[Chapingo]] near [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]] (1925–27), in the [[Palace of Cortes, Cuernavaca|Cortés Palace]] in [[Cuernavaca]] (1929–30), and the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in Mexico City (1929–30, 1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Rivera|url=http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-9063801|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=September 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Rivera|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/diego-rivera|publisher=Answers.com|accessdate=September 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/mexico/mexicocity/rivera/muralsintro.html bluffton.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivera painted murals in the main hall and corridor at the [[Chapingo Autonomous University]] of Agriculture (UACh). He also painted a fresco mural titled ''Tierra Fecundada'' (''[[Fertile Land]]'' in English) in the university's chapel between 1923 and 1927. ''Fertile Land'' depicts the revolutionary struggles of Mexico's peasant (farmers) and working classes (industry) in part through the depiction of [[hammer and sickle]] joined by a star in the soffit of the chapel. In the mural, a "propagandist" points to another hammer and sickle. The mural features a woman with an ear of [[corn]] in each hand, which art critic Antonio Rodriguez describes as evocative of the Aztec goddess of [[maize]] in his book ''Canto a la Tierra: Los murales de Diego Rivera en la Capilla de Chapingo''.

The corpses of revolutionary heroes [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Otilio Montano]] are shown in graves, their bodies fertilizing the maize field above. A sunflower in the center of the scene "glorifies those who died for an ideal and are reborn, transfigured, into the fertile cornfield of the nation," writes Rodrigues. The mural also depicts Rivera's wife [[Guadalupe Marin]] as a fertile nude goddess and their daughter [[Guadalupe Rivera y Marin]] as a cherub.&lt;ref&gt;http://clas.berkeley.edu/research/art-mexico-my-father&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was slightly damaged in an earthquake, but has since been repaired and touched up, remaining in pristine form.&lt;ref&gt;eyewitness, journalist [[Julie Mollins]], 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1927, Rivera arrived in Moscow, accepting an invitation to take part in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. The following year, while still in Russia, he met the visiting [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]], who would soon become Rivera's friend and patron, as well as the founding director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name=NYer2011/&gt; Rivera was commissioned to paint a mural for the [[Red Army]] Club in Moscow, but in 1928 he was ordered out by the authorities because of involvement in [[anti-Soviet]] politics, and he returned to Mexico. In 1929, Rivera was expelled from the [[Mexican Communist Party]]. His 1928 mural ''In the Arsenal'' was interpreted by some as evidence of Rivera's prior knowledge of the murder of [[Julio Antonio Mella]] allegedly by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Assassination|assassin]] [[Vittorio Vidali]]. After divorcing Guadalupe (Lupe) Marin, Rivera married [[Frida Kahlo]] in August 1929. Also in 1929, the first English-language book on Rivera, American journalist [[Ernestine Evans]]'s ''The Frescoes of Diego Rivera'', was published in New York City. In December, Rivera accepted a commission to paint murals in the Palace of Cortés in Cuernavaca from the American Ambassador to Mexico.&lt;ref name=commission&gt;{{cite web|title=The Commission |url=http://www.sfai.edu/page.aspx?page=35&amp;navID=79&amp;sectionID=2 |publisher=San Francisco Art Institute |accessdate=September 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909083539/http://www.sfai.edu/page.aspx?page=35&amp;navID=79&amp;sectionID=2 |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1930, Rivera accepted an invitation from architect [[Timothy L. Pflueger]] to paint for him in [[San Francisco]]. After arriving in November accompanied by Kahlo, Rivera painted a mural for the City Club of the [[Pacific Exchange|San Francisco Stock Exchange]] for US$2,500&lt;ref name="Poletti2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Art Deco San Francisco: The Architecture of Timothy Pflueger|last1=Poletti|first1=Therese|last2=Paiva|first2=Tom|year=2008|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=1-56898-756-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcUhJJJwCoIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fresco for the California School of Fine Art, later relocated to what is now the [[Diego Rivera Gallery]] at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]].&lt;ref name=commission /&gt; Kahlo and Rivera worked and lived at the studio of [[Ralph Stackpole]], who had suggested Rivera to Pflueger. Rivera met [[Helen Wills Moody]], a famous tennis player, who modeled for his City Club mural.&lt;ref name="Poletti2008"/&gt; In November 1931, Rivera had a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; Kahlo was present.&lt;ref name=souter&gt;Gerry Souter (2012).

{{ISBN|9781780424385}}. p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1932 and 1933, he completed a famous series of twenty-seven fresco panels entitled ''[[Detroit Industry]]'' on the walls of an inner court at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. During the [[McCarthyism]] of the 1950s, a [[commons:Image:Diego Rivera Mural Sign.jpg|large sign]] was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as "detestable."&lt;ref name=NYer2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schjeldahl |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter Schjeldahl |date=November 28, 2011 |title=The Painting on the Wall |journal=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast |pages=84–85 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2011/11/28/111128craw_artworld_schjeldahl |accessdate=January 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', begun in 1933 for the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, was removed after a furor erupted in the press over a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] it contained. When Diego refused to remove Lenin from the painting, Diego was ordered to leave. One of Diego's assistants managed to take a few pictures of the work so Diego was able to later recreate it. The American poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] wrote six "irony-laden" poems about the mural.&lt;ref name="enotes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/macleish-archibald |title=Archibald MacLeish Criticism |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine published [[E. B. White]]'s poem "I paint what I see: A ballad of artistic integrity".&lt;ref name="art-talks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-talks.org/rivera-poem.htm |title=I paint what I see |publisher=Art-talks.org |date=May 20, 1933 |accessdate=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the negative publicity, a further commission was canceled to paint a mural for an exhibition at the [[Chicago]] [[World's Fair]]. Rivera issued a statement that with the money left over from the commission of the mural at Rockefeller Center, he would repaint the same mural over and over wherever he was asked until the money ran out. He was paid in full though the mural was supposedly destroyed. Rumors have floated that the mural was actually covered over rather than brought down and destroyed.

In December 1933, Rivera returned to Mexico, and he repainted ''Man at the Crossroads'' in 1934 in the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City. This surviving version was called ''[[Man, Controller of the Universe]]''. On June 5, 1940, invited again by Pflueger, Rivera returned for the last time to the United States to paint a ten-panel mural for the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco. ''[[Pan American Unity]]'' was completed November 29, 1940. As he was painting, Rivera was on display in front of Exposition attendees. He received US$1,000 per month and US$1,000 for travel expenses.&lt;ref name="Poletti2008"/&gt; [[Image:San-Angel-Casa-Rivera-Kahlo.jpg|thumb|House of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo (built by [[Juan O'Gorman]] in 1930)]]The mural includes representations of two of Pflueger's architectural works as well as portraits of Kahlo, woodcarver [[Dudley C.

The mural and its archives reside at [[City College of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.riveramural.org |title=The Diego Rivera Mural Project |publisher=City college of San Francisco |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccsf.edu/NEW/en/about-city-college/diego-rivera-mural.html |title=Pan American Unity Mural |publisher=City College of San Francisco |accessdate=July 17, 2013 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership in AMORC===
In 1926, Rivera became a member of AMORC, the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]], an occult organization founded by American occultist [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]]. In 1926, Rivera was among the founders of AMORC's Mexico City lodge, called Quetzalcoatl, and painted an image of [[Quetzalcoatl]] for the local temple.&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Tibol, “Apareció la serpiente: Diego Rivera y los rosacruces,” ''Proceso'' 701 (April 9, 1990), pp. 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1954, when he tried to be readmitted into the Mexican Communist Party from which he had previously been excluded because of his support of Trotsky, Rivera had to justify his AMORC activities. The Mexican Communist Party at that time excluded from its ranks members of [[Freemasonry]], and regarded AMORC as suspiciously similar to Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Tibol, “Apareció la serpiente,” p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera answered that, by joining AMORC, he wanted to infiltrate a typical “Yankee” organization on behalf of Communism. However, he also claimed that AMORC was “essentially materialist, insofar as it only admits different states of energy and matter, and is based on ancient Egyptian occult knowledge from [[Amenhotep IV]] and [[Nefertiti]].”&lt;ref&gt;Diego Rivera, ''Arte y política'', México: Grijalbo, 1979, p. 354. {{ISBN|968-419-083-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinematic portrayals===
Diego Rivera was portrayed by [[Rubén Blades]] in ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1999), by [[Alfred Molina]] in ''[[Frida]]'' (2002), and (in a brief appearance) by José Montini in ''[[Eisenstein in Guanajuato]]'' (2015).

===Literary portrayals===
Rivera, Frida Kahlo, and [[Leon Trotsky]] are principal characters in Barbara Kingsolver's novel, ''[[The Lacuna]]''.

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''''' (German: '''''Die altniederländische Malerei''''') is a pioneering 14-volume series of illustrated books by the German art historian [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] (1867–1958). The first volume was published in 1924, and the series ran until 1937. It was the first comprehensive modern art-historical survey of [[Early Netherlandish painting]],&lt;ref&gt;The painters are sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives&lt;/ref&gt; a  term often used in art history to describe artists of the [[Low Countries]] during the 15th- and 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]].

Friedländer developed an interest in northern art of the period while director of the [[Bode Museum|Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The collection included a large selection of Flemish paintings, including [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'', [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' and ''[[Altar of Saint John]]'', and  [[Hugo van der Goes]]' ''Adoration of the Maji''. Friedländer was struck by the lack of biographical detail on even the most accomplished of the artists, some of whom were still identified by [[notname]]s, the sometimes poorly supported attributions, and general historical neglect.&lt;ref name="mv"&gt;McNamee (1998), vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The book focuses on establishing biographical details for the painters, attributing individual works, and detailing their major stylistic themes and techniques. The undertaking was extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists.&lt;ref name="s518"&gt;Silver (1986), 518&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was a major influence on [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s equally seminal ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Panofsky)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'', which expanded on Friedländer's biographical and stylistic analysis to focus on [[iconography]], intended meaning and historical context.&lt;ref name="mv" /&gt;

{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}

An '''escort agency''' is a company that provides [[call girl|escorts]] for clients, usually for [[sexual services]]. The agency typically arranges a meeting between one of its escorts and the client at the customer's house or hotel room (outcall), or at the escort's residence (incall). Some agencies also provide escorts for longer durations, who may stay with the client or travel along on a holiday or business trip.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20041018164614/http://indiadaily.com/editorial/10-18f-04.asp Camera catches Bollywood’s biggest business boom – Adult escort services and Adult travel agencies!]'' - [[India Daily]], Thursday 18 October 2004. Retrieved September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While the escort agency is paid a fee for this booking and dispatch service, the customer must negotiate any additional fees or arrangements directly with the escort for any other services that are not provided by the agency involved, such as providing sexual services (regardless of the legality of these services).

==Business model==
Escort agencies claim that they are dispatching these individuals to provide a social or conversational service rather than a sexual service, since [[prostitution laws]] often forbid taking payment for sex or communicating for the purpose of arranging a contract for sexual services. [[Advertisements]] for escort agencies often carefully skirt the legal line, and avoid specifically offering [[prostitution]] or sexual services. This fact in turn is well-known to police and the political powers, who, [[prostitution by country|where prostitution is illegal]], usually prefer to act against more visible and problematic [[street prostitution]]. This has been criticized as hypocrisy, especially where governments license and tax the escort agencies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.missingpeople.net/how_cities_'license'_off-street_hookers-june_16,_2002.htm How cities 'license' off-street hookers]'' - originally from ''The Ottawa Citizen'', Sunday 16 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, there almost certainly do exist agencies that do go by these laws and do not facilitate prostitution. Some countries have used a two-pronged approach of criminalizing street prostitution but permitting or licensing prostitution in [[brothels]] or via escort agencies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/sdavis.html#fraser Prostitution in Canada: The Invisible Menace or the Menace of Invisibility?]'' -  Davis, Sylvia; research paper, last modified Saturday 14 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruiting===
Escort agencies often recruit individuals to work as escorts by placing employment advertisements in a magazine or newspaper. Escort agencies typically maintain a list of escorts of different ages and appearances to cater to the varying interests of clients. Some agencies may specifically deal in a certain type of escort. There are male-for-male, female-for-male, and female-for-female escort agencies, as well as a few male-for-female agencies. Agencies commonly specialize in only one sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/escort-agencies-luring-students-into-prostitution-to-pay-for-college-26318574.html |title=Escort agencies luring students into prostitution to pay for college|work=independent.ie|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transsexual or transgender escorts are available from some escort agencies.

It is very common for escorts to enter the business through referrals from friends who have been in the business. The effectiveness of ads in [[Weekly newspaper|weeklies]] or specialized sites has been questioned by some operators as there are so many that they are diluted. Typically, an escort will interview with an agency.

===Advertising===
Once an agency decides to hire an escort, she or he will provide photographs or pose for a photographer. These pictures are posted on the agency's website or circulated among clients to promote business.

Some larger escort agencies maintain websites with photo galleries of their escorts. Clients contact agencies by telephone and offer a description of what kind of escorts are sought. The agency will then suggest an escort who might fit that client's need.

The agency collects the client's contact information and calls the escort. Usually, to protect the identity of the escort and ensure effective communication with the client, the agency arranges the appointment. Sometimes, it may be up to the escort to contact the client directly to make arrangements for the location and time of an appointment. Generally, the escort is also expected to call the agency upon arrival at the location and upon leaving, to ensure the safety of the escort.

==Legal considerations==
The [[arm's length]] relationship between the escort and the escort agency is designed to protect the escort agency (to some degree) from prosecution for breaking [[laws against prostitution]]. If the employee is solely responsible for arranging any illegal prostitution-oriented activities, the agency can maintain [[plausible deniability]] should an arrest be made.

Escort services aim to provide an experience that allows the operators to claim that whatever happens between the escort and the client is consensual. Operators tend to avoid discussing specifics over the telephone or via emails to avoid complications with the law.

[[Prostitution in India]] is legal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/debates/south_asian_debates/1459792.stm|title= Prostitution: should the laws be changed?|date= 2001-08-03|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of related activities, including owning or managing a [[brothel]], [[pimp]]ing and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pandering]], are crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/sca/119134.htm|title=2008 Human Rights Reports: India|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}

In 2010, Mexico Legislators added a law similar to that of the UK called the Anti Trafficking in Persons Act (rough translation) which makes it a crime to offer the sexual services of another person against their will. The law is still broadly interpreted and has many websites who offered the services of escorts running for cover and even newspapers like El Universal stopped taking classified ads for escorts or "executive massages" because of the law which also goes after anyone promoting the trafficking of persons. The legislator, who is spearheading the campaign here has filed a lawsuit against the newspaper ''[[Reforma]]'' because they have not stopped taking the classified ads for these services, but have instead put in place a mandatory presentation of official identification of the person placing the ad and the signing of a waiver stating that they are placing the ad on their own behalf and releasing the  newspaper from anything that may come from the services offered.

Most recently, the legislature in Mexico has modified the law to close some loop holes or grey areas and are like the United States zooming in on the "End User" or client.  The new law now encompasses penalties of 7 to 9 years in prison for contracting an escort, 7 – 9 years in prison for transporting an escort to her appointment and now the most broad addition like in the United States, "facilitation" of any person, persons or company that promotes or services of an escort whether a newspaper, internet ad or website is subject to 9 to 11 years in prison, which grows to a maximum of 23 years if the offending person is a public servant of any kind.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}
Escort prostitution is one of the forms that the sex trade takes in the United Kingdom, along with prostitution practiced in [[massage parlors]], saunas, private flats (such as the [[Soho walk-up]]s) and street prostitution. Working as an outcall escort is not an offence, and neither is working as a prostitute in private. However, under the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]] it is a criminal offence to pay for services of a prostitute who is controlled for gain if any third party uses force, threat (whether or not relating to violence) or any other form of coercion. In 2015 the [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] set up a dedicated “adult entertainment task force” to collect unpaid income tax from, among others, online escort agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Collinson |first= Patrick |date=4 December 2015 |title=Strippers told to bare all about tax affairs under HMRC crackdown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/04/adult-entertainment-taskforce-tax-fraud-strip-clubs |newspaper=The Guardian |location= |access-date=9 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial considerations==
The amount of money that is made by an escort varies with many factors, such as sexual attractiveness, competition from legal and illegal sources, and the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to be paid to the agency. Typically, an agency will charge their escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the pre-arranged rate. According to police in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada, the high fees charged by escort agencies may make escorting less lucrative than street prostitution, especially as agencies often also deduct the license fees directly from the earnings.&lt;ref name="Uni"&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040814080018/http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/8635 Escort agency hiring at U of C]'' - ''Gauntlet'', [[University of Calgary]], Thursday 10 October 2002. Retrieved September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent escorts may have differing fees depending on the season, or whether the client is a regular or semi-regular customer. Independent escorts may tend to see clients for extended meetings involving dinner or social activities whereas agency escorts tend to be split into two categories: Cheaper services, especially if mainly based around incall appointments (client visiting the escort at her accommodation), often only provide sexual services, while agencies that provide mainly outcall appointments (the escort visiting the client at either their home or hotel) tend to offer services similar to that of independent escorts.

In New York City, escort services charge anywhere from $200 to $1500 or more per hour.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The industry standard for dividing the money is 50% to the escort, 40% to the agency, and 10% to the booker (a kind of sales representative). Given the level of business can vary week to week, it is not uncommon for escorts to be featured by more than one agency provided they are operated by the same ownership group.

==Statistics==
A 2005 government survey in [[Prostitution in New Zealand|New Zealand]] ([[Prostitution in New Zealand|where prostitution was regulated]] and for the most part legalized in 2003), estimated that of the 6,000 prostitutes surveyed, around 20% worked for escort agencies.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10121228"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10121228 |title=Snapshot of sex industry finds 6000 prostitutes |date=19 April 2005 |agency=[[NZPA]] |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Dewey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|i}}; October 20, 1859 – June 1, 1952) was an [[American philosopher]], [[psychologist]], and [[Education reform|educational reformer]] whose ideas have been influential in education and social reform. Dewey is one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of [[pragmatism]] and is considered one of the fathers of [[functional psychology]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Dewey as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–52 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known [[public intellectual]], he was also a major voice of [[progressive education]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism'', (1995), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Violas, Paul C. |author2=Tozer, Steven |author3=Senese, Guy B. |title=School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |location= |year= |page=121 |isbn=0-07-298556-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dewey is known best for his publications about education, he also wrote about many other topics, including [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[aesthetics]], [[art]], [[logic]], [[social theory]], and [[ethics]]. He was a major educational reformer for the 20th century.

The overriding theme of Dewey's works was his profound belief in democracy, be it in politics, education, or communication and journalism. As Dewey himself stated in 1888, while still at the University of Michigan, "Democracy and the one, ultimate, ethical ideal of humanity are to my mind synonymous."&lt;ref&gt;''Early Works'', 1:128 (Southern Illinois University Press) op cited in Douglas R. Anderson, AAR, ''The Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 61, No. 2 (1993), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for his advocacy of democracy, Dewey considered two fundamental elements—schools and [[civil society]]—to be major topics needing attention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and plurality. Dewey asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed [[public opinion]], accomplished by communication among citizens, experts, and politicians, with the latter being accountable for the policies they adopt.

==Life and works==
John Dewey was born in [[Burlington, Vermont]] to a family of modest means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gutek |first=Gerald L. |title=Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: A Biographical Introduction. |publisher=Pearson Education Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0-13-113809-X |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of four boys born to Archibald Sprague Dewey and Lucina Artemisia Rich Dewey.  Their second son was also named John, but he died in an accident on January 17, 1859.  The second John Dewey was born October 20, 1859, forty weeks after the death of his older brother.  Like his older, surviving brother, [[Davis Rich Dewey]], he attended the [[University of Vermont]], where he was initiated into [[Delta Psi (University of Vermont)|Delta Psi]], and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa], Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed Oct 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in 1879. A significant professor of Dewey's at the University of Vermont was [[Henry Augustus Pearson Torrey]] (H. A. P. Torrey), the son-in-law and nephew of former University of Vermont president [[Joseph Torrey]]. Dewey studied privately with Torrey between his graduation from Vermont and his enrollment at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/dewey/dewey.html bio of Dewey from ''Bowling Green State University''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102195748/http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/dewey/dewey.html |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]], ''The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in the United States''. New York: Farrar, Staus and Giroux, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years as a high-school teacher in [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] and one teaching elementary school in the small town of [[Charlotte, Vermont]], Dewey decided that he was unsuited as a primary or secondary school teacher. After studying with [[George Sylvester Morris]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Herbert Baxter Adams]], and [[G. Stanley Hall]], Dewey received his Ph.D. from the School of Arts &amp; Sciences at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 1884, he accepted a faculty position at the [[University of Michigan]] (1884–88 and 1889–94) with the help of George Sylvester Morris. His unpublished and now lost dissertation was titled "The Psychology of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]."

In 1894 Dewey joined the newly founded [[University of Chicago]] (1894–1904) where he developed his belief in Rational [[Empiricism]], becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitled ''[[Thought and its Subject-Matter]]'', which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective title ''[[Studies in Logical Theory]]'' (1903). During that time Dewey also initiated the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, ''[[The School and Society]]'' (1899). Disagreements with the administration ultimately caused his resignation from the university, and soon thereafter he relocated near the East Coast. In 1899, Dewey was elected president of the [[American Psychological Association]]. From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''edition of January 19, 1953, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he became president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. He was a longtime member of the [[American Federation of Teachers]].

Along with the historians [[Charles A. Beard]] and [[James Harvey Robinson]], and the economist [[Thorstein Veblen]], Dewey is one of the founders of [[The New School]]. Dewey's most significant writings were "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" (1896), a critique of a standard psychological concept and the basis of all his further work; ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916), his celebrated work on progressive education; ''[[Human Nature and Conduct]]'' (1922), a study of the function of habit in human behavior;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Dewey|title= Human Nature and Conduct: An Introduction to Social Psychology |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company |url= https://archive.org/details/humannatureandco011182mbp|year=1922 |accessdate= February 2, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'' (1927), a defense of democracy written in response to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s ''[[The Phantom Public]]'' (1925); ''[[Experience and Nature]]'' (1925), Dewey's most "metaphysical" statement; ''Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World'' (1929), a glowing travelogue from the nascent [[USSR]];&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey (1929), [http://ariwatch.com/VS/JD/ImpressionsOfSovietRussia.htm ''Impressons of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World''], ''The New Republic''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewey1929"&gt;{{citation|author=John Dewey|title=Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World: Mexico — China — Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruAGAAAAMAAJ|year=1929|publisher=''The New Republic''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Art as Experience]]'' (1934), Dewey's major work on aesthetics; ''[[A Common Faith]]'' (1934), a humanistic study of religion originally delivered as the [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] at Yale; ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]'' (1938), a statement of Dewey's unusual conception of logic; ''[[Freedom and Culture]]'' (1939), a political work examining the roots of fascism; and ''[[Knowing and the Known]]'' (1949), a book written in conjunction with [[Arthur F. Bentley]] that systematically outlines the concept of trans-action, which is central to his other works (see [[Transactionalism]]). While each of these works focuses on one particular philosophical theme, Dewey included his major themes in most of what he published. He published more than 700 articles in 140 journals, and approximately 40 books.

Reflecting his immense influence on 20th-century thought, [[Hilda Neatby]] wrote "Dewey has been to our age what [[Aristotle]] was to the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]], not a philosopher, but ''the'' philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;Hilda M. Neatby, ''So Little for the Mind'' (Toronto: Clarke Irwin &amp; Co. Ltd., 1953), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey married to Alice Chipman in 1886 shortly after Chipman graduated with her PhB from the University of Michigan. The two had six children: Frederick Archibald Dewey, Evelyn Riggs Dewey, Morris (who died young), Gordon Chipman Dewey, Lucy Alice Chipman Dewey, and Jane Mary Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/dewey.htm Biography at Muskingum College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331093737/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/dewey.htm |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/dewey-alice-chipman-1858-1927 from The Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Chipman died in 1927 at the age of 68; weakened by a case of malaria contracted during a trip to Turkey in 1924 and a heart attack during a trip to Mexico City in 1926, she died from cerebral thrombosis on July 13, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=eandc Douglas J.

==Visits to China and Japan==
[[File:Hu Shih and John Dewey.jpg|thumb|John Dewey and Hu Shih, circa 1938–1942.]]
In 1919, while traveling in Japan on sabbatical leave, Dewey was invited by [[Peking University]] to visit China, probably at the behest of his former students, [[Hu Shih]] and [[Chiang Monlin]]. Dewey and his wife Alice arrived in Shanghai on April 30, 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/31043/31043-h/31043-h.htm Letters from China and Japan by Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey and John Dewey]&lt;/ref&gt; just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German held territories in [[Shandong]] province to Japan. Their [[May Fourth Movement|demonstrations on May Fourth]] excited and energized Dewey, and he ended up staying in China for two years, leaving in July 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Ching-Sze Wang. ''John Dewey in China: To Teach and to Learn''. Albany: State University of New York Press, Suny Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture, 2007. {{ISBN|9780791472033}} pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these two years, Dewey gave nearly 200 lectures to Chinese audiences and wrote nearly monthly articles for Americans in ''[[The New Republic]]'' and other magazines. Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of [[Bolshevism]] to some Chinese, Dewey advocated that Americans support China's transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms, not revolution. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures, which were interpreted by Hu Shih. For these audiences, Dewey represented "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as "Second Confucius". Perhaps Dewey's biggest impact, however, was on the forces for progressive education in China, such as Hu Shih and Chiang Monlin, who had studied with him, and [[Tao Xingzhi]], who had studied at Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, pp. 8–10, 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their letters from China and Japan describing their experiences to their family were published in 1920, edited by their daughter Evelyn.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey ''Letters from China and Japan''. New York,: E.P. Dutton, 1920; rpr. [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31043 Project Guttenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; During and after his visit his commentaries on China would be published in such periodicals as the New Republic, Asia, the China Review, and sometimes in Newspapers like the Baltimore Sun. Though discussing Chinese philosophy but rarely, one article in 1922, "As the Chinese Think", discusses the teachings of [[Laozi]] and [[Confucius]] in an attempt to improve understanding of the Chinese in international business relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/phil390561.pdf Published by University of Hawai'i Press.

==Visit to Southern Africa==
Dewey and his daughter Jane went to [[South Africa]] in July 1934, at the invitation of the World Conference of New Education Fellowship in [[Cape Town]] and [[Johannesburg]], where he delivered several talks. The conference was opened by the South African Minister of Education [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894-1948)|Jan Hofmeyr]], and Deputy Prime Minister [[Jan Smuts]]. Other speakers at the conference included [[Max Eiselen]] and [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], who would later become prime minister of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government that introduced [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraak|first1=Andre|last2=Young|first2=Michael|title=Education in Retrospect: Policy and Implementation since 1990|date=2001|publisher=Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria|isbn=0-7969-1988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; John and Jane's expenses were paid by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]]. He also traveled to [[Durban]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Victoria Falls]] in what was then [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and looked at schools, talked to pupils, and gave lectures to the administrators and teachers. In August 1934, Dewey accepted an honorary degree from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Jay|title=The Education of John Dewey|date=2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231116764|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional psychology==
{{See also|History of psychology}}
At the University of Michigan, Dewey published his first two books, ''Psychology'' (1887), and ''Leibniz's New Essays Concerning the Human Understanding'' (1888), both of which expressed Dewey's early commitment to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|British neo-Hegelianism]]. In ''Psychology'', Dewey attempted a synthesis between idealism and experimental science.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{Cite book|author=Field, Richard |title=John Dewey in ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' |publisher=Northwest Missouri State University|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/dewey.htm|accessdate= 29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While still professor of philosophy at Michigan, Dewey and his junior colleagues, [[James Hayden Tufts]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], together with his student [[James Rowland Angell]], all influenced strongly by the recent publication of [[William James]]' ''[[Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890), began to reformulate psychology, emphasizing the social environment on the activity of mind and behavior rather than the physiological psychology of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and his followers.

By 1894, Dewey had joined Tufts, with whom he would later write ''Ethics'' (1908) at the recently founded [[University of Chicago]] and invited Mead and Angell to follow him, the four men forming the basis of the so-called "Chicago group" of psychology.

Their new style of psychology, later dubbed [[functional psychology]], had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" which appeared in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1896, he reasons against the traditional [[stimulus-response]] understanding of the [[reflex arc]] in favor of a "circular" account in which what serves as "stimulus" and what as "response" depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed the idea that there is a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.

Dewey&lt;!-- , not without polemic, --&gt; was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1899.
[[File:Timbre USA John Dewey oblW 21101968.jpg|thumb]]
In 1984, the American Psychological Association announced that [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (1878–1972) had become the first psychologist to be commemorated on a United States postage stamp. However, psychologists Gary Brucato Jr. and [[John D. Hogan]] later made the case that this distinction actually belonged to John Dewey, who had been celebrated on an American stamp 17 years earlier. While some psychology historians consider Dewey more of a philosopher than a bona fide psychologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Benjamin, L.T. | year = 2003 | title = Why Can't Psychology Get a Stamp? | url = | journal = Journal of applied psychoanalytic studies | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors noted that Dewey was a founding member of the A.P.A., served as the A.P.A.'s eighth president in 1899, and was the author of an 1896 article on the [[reflex arc]] which is now considered a basis of American functional psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Brucato, G. &amp; Hogan, J.D. (1999, Spring). "Psychologists on postage stamps" ''The General Psychologist'', 34(1):65&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey also expressed interest in work in the psychology of [[visual perception]] performed by Dartmouth research professor [[Adelbert Ames Jr.]] He had great trouble with listening, however, because it is known Dewey could not distinguish musical pitches—in other words was [[tone deafness|tone deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeltner, Philip N.; '''John Dewey's Aesthetic Philosophy'''; p. 93 {{ISBN|90-6032-029-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatism, instrumentalism, consequentialism==
Dewey sometimes referred to his philosophy as [[instrumentalism]] rather than [[pragmatism]], and would have recognized the similarity of these two schools to the newer school named [[consequentialism]]. He defined with precise brevity the criterion of validity common to these three schools, which lack agreed-upon definitions:

{{quote|But in the proper interpretation of "pragmatic," namely the function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problem evoking the operations, the text that follows is thoroughly pragmatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=john|title=Logic: The theory of Inquiry|year=1938|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=NY|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His concern for precise definition led him to detailed analysis of careless word usage, reported in ''Knowing and the Known'' in 1949.

===Epistemology===
{{Main| Knowing and the Known}}
The terminology problem in the fields of epistemology and logic is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley,&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston]].&lt;/ref&gt; to inefficient and imprecise use of words and concepts that reflect three historic levels of organization and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston]], pp. 107–09.&lt;/ref&gt; In the order of chronological appearance, these are:
* Self-Action: Prescientific concepts regarded humans, animals, and things as possessing powers of their own which initiated or caused their actions.
* Interaction: as described by Newton, where things, living and inorganic, are balanced against something in a system of interaction, for example, the third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
* Transaction: where modern systems of descriptions and naming are employed to deal with multiple aspects and phases of action without any attribution to ultimate, final, or independent entities, essences, or realities.

A series of characterizations of [[Transactionalism|Transactions]] indicate the wide range of considerations involved.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, Boston, pp. 121–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic and method==
Dewey sees paradox in contemporary logical theory. Proximate subject matter garners general agreement and advancement, while the ultimate subject matter of logic generates unremitting controversy. In other words, he challenges confident logicians to answer the question of the truth of logical operators. Do they function merely as abstractions (e.g., pure mathematics) or do they connect in some essential way with their objects, and therefore alter or bring them to light?&lt;ref name="logical"&gt;"The Problem of Logical Subject Matter", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Dewey Grave.JPG|thumb|Grave of Dewey and his wife in an alcove on the north side of the [[Ira Allen Chapel]] in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. The only grave on the [[University of Vermont]] campus]]

[[Logical positivism]] also figured in Dewey's thought. About the movement he wrote that it "eschews the use of 'propositions' and 'terms', substituting 'sentences' and 'words'." ("General Theory of Propositions", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'') He welcomes this changing of referents "in as far as it fixes attention upon the symbolic structure and content of propositions." However, he registers a small complaint against the use of "sentence" and "words" in that without careful interpretation the act or process of transposition "narrows unduly the scope of symbols and language, since it is not customary to treat gestures and diagrams (maps, blueprints, etc.) as words or sentences."
In other words, sentences and words, considered in isolation, do not disclose intent, which may be inferred or "adjudged only by means of context."&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;

Yet Dewey was not entirely opposed to modern logical trends. Concerning traditional logic, he states:

{{quote|Aristotelian logic, which still passes current nominally, is a logic based upon the idea that qualitative objects are existential in the fullest sense. To retain logical principles based on this conception along with the acceptance of theories of existence and knowledge based on an opposite conception is not, to say the least, conductive to clearness—a consideration that has a good deal to do with existing dualism between traditional and the newer relational logics.}}

[[Louis Menand]] argues in ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' that [[Jane Addams]] had been critical of Dewey's emphasis on antagonism in the context of a discussion of the [[Pullman strike]] of 1894. In a later letter to his wife, Dewey confessed that Addams' argument was:

{{quote|... the most magnificent exhibition of intellectual &amp; moral faith I ever saw. She converted me internally, but not really, I fear. ... When you think that Miss Addams does not think this as a philosophy, but believes it in all her senses &amp; muscles—Great God ... I guess I'll have to give it [all] up &amp; start over again.}}

He went on to add:

{{quote|I can see that I have always been interpreting dialectic wrong end up, the unity as the reconciliation of opposites, instead of the opposites as the unity in its growth, and thus translated the physical tension into a moral thing ... I don't know as I give the reality of this at all, ... it seems so natural &amp; commonplace now, but I never had anything take hold of me so.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Menand. ''The Metaphysical Club'' p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a letter to Addams, clearly influenced by his conversation with her, Dewey wrote:

{{quote|Not only is actual antagonizing bad, but the assumption that there is or may be antagonism is bad—in fact, the real first antagonism always comes back to the assumption.}}

===Aesthetics===
{{Main|Art as Experience}}
''Art as Experience'' (1934) is Dewey's major writing on aesthetics.

It is, in accordance with his place in the Pragmatist tradition that emphasizes community, a study of the individual art object as embedded in (and inextricable from) the experiences of a local culture. In the original illustrated edition, Dewey drew on the modern art and world cultures collection assembled by [[Albert C. Barnes]] at the [[Barnes Foundation]], whose own ideas on the application of art to one's way of life was influenced by Dewey's writing. Barnes was particularly influenced by "Democracy and Education" (1916) and then attended Dewey's seminar on political philosophy at Columbia University in the fall semester of 1918.

==On philanthropy, women and democracy==
Dewey founded the University of Chicago [[laboratory school]], supported educational organizations, and supported settlement houses especially [[Jane Addams]]' Hull House.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stengel|first1=Barbara|title=Dewey's Pragmatic Poet: Reconstructing Jane Addams's Philosophical Impact|journal=Project Muse|pages=29–39|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/.|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his work at the [[Hull House]] serving on its first board of trustees, Dewey was not only an activist for the cause but also a partner working to serve the large immigrant community of Chicago and women's suffrage. Dewey experienced the lack of children's education while contributing in the classroom at the Hull House and the lack of education and skills of immigrant women.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Upin|first1=Jane S.|title="Charlotte Perkins Gilman": Instrumentalism beyond Dewey:Hypatia|journal=|volume=8|issue=2|pages=38–63|jstor=3810336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stengel argues:

{{quote|Addams is unquestionably a maker of democratic community and pragmatic education; Dewey is just as unquestionably a reflector. Through her work at Hull House, Addams discerned the shape of democracy as a mode of associated living and uncovered the outlines of an experimental approach to knowledge and understanding; Dewey analyzed and classified the social, psychological and educational processes Addams lived.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stengel|first1=Barbara|title=Dewey's Pragmatic Poet: Reconstructing Jane Addams's Philosophical Impact|journal=Project Muse|pages=29–39|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/.|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His leading views on democracy included: "First, Dewey believed that democracy is an ethical ideal rather than merely a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making ... Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society".&lt;ref name="John Dewey and American Democracy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westbrook|first1=Robert B.|title=John Dewey and American Democracy|journal=|volume=97|issue=3|pages=919–20|jstor=2164912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.

Dewey believed that a woman's place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, "You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won't be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn't do".&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; John Dewey's support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams' Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew as well as the support for the women's suffrage movement.

As commonly argued by Dewey's greatest critics, he was not able to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women's suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; "Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures".&lt;ref name="John Dewey and American Democracy"/&gt; With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.

With respect to technological developments in a democracy:

{{quote|Persons do not become a society by living in physical proximity any more than a man ceases to be socially influenced by being so many feet or miles removed from others.}}

His work on democracy influenced [[B.R. Ambedkar]], one of his students, who later became one of the founding fathers of independent India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao|title=Annihilation of castes|publisher=Critical Quest|isbn=81-89524-21-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar's teacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/05/john-dewey-pragmatism-communication-and-bhimrao-ambedkar/|title=The like-mindedness of Dewey and Ambedkar|date=2017-05-19|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2018/01/ambedkars-pragmatism-drew-heavily-on-the-1908-ethics/|title=Ambedkar’s pragmatism drew heavily on the 1908 ‘Ethics’|date=2018-01-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On education and teacher education==
{{Main| Democracy and Education}}
{{Education in the U.S.}}
Dewey's educational theories were presented in ''My Pedagogic Creed'' (1897), ''The School and Society'' (1900), ''The Child and the Curriculum'' (1902), ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916), [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001117418 ''Schools of To-morrow'' ] (c1915) with Evelyn Dewey, and ''[[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]]'' (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.

The ideas of democracy and social reform are continually discussed in Dewey's writings on education. Dewey makes a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. He notes that "to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities" (''My Pedagogic Creed'', Dewey, 1897). In addition to helping students realize their full potential, Dewey goes on to acknowledge that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He notes that "education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction".

In addition to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place within the classroom. In ''The Child and the Curriculum'' (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, "the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened" (1902, p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1902). ''The child and the curriculum''. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that in order for education to be most effective, content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.

At the same time, Dewey was alarmed by many of the "child-centered" excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much reliance on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, "we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning" (Dewey, 1902, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.

In order to rectify this dilemma, Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student. He notes that "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction" (Dewey, 1902, p.&amp;nbsp;16). It is through this reasoning that Dewey became one of the most famous proponents of [[hands-on learning]] or [[experiential education]], which is related to, but not synonymous with [[experiential learning]]. He argued that "if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind" (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;217–18).&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (2009). ''Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education''. New York: WLC Books. (Original work published 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey's ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. [[Problem-Based Learning]] (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey's ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Savery, J. R. (2006). Overview of Problem-based Learning: Definitions and Distinctions. ''Journal of Problem-based
Learning'', 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. Throughout the history of American schooling, education's purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the K–12 public education system and to the teacher training schools who attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce. In ''The School and Society'' (Dewey, 1899) and ''Democracy of Education'' (Dewey, 1916), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies. Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1899; 1916).

For Dewey and his philosophical followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners are taught that knowledge is transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. For Dewey, "The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;18). Dewey's qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which "work automatically, unconsciously" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.

===Professionalization of teaching as a social service===
For many, education's purpose is to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. As Dewey notes, "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in the production of character."(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;241–42).

According to Dewey, the emphasis is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is "impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now" (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;25). However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill, and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a "lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill, and character" (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;242) of the nation's workforce. As Dewey notes, there is a lack of these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them. According to Dewey, the profession of the classroom teacher is to produce the intelligence, skill, and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.

===A teacher's knowledge===
Dewey believed that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one's ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. "No one," according to Dewey, "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [of teaching] who does not retain [her] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [her] entire career" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;34). According to Dewey, it is not that the "teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach," rather, "a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;35). The classroom teacher does not have to be a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.

In addition to this propensity for study into the subjects taught, the classroom teacher "is possessed by a recognition of the responsibility for the constant study of school room work, the constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;37). For Dewey, this desire for the lifelong pursuit of learning is inherent in other professions (e.g. the architectural, legal and medical fields; Dewey, 1904 &amp; Dewey, PST, 2010), and has particular importance for the field of teaching. As Dewey notes, "this further study is not a side line but something which fits directly into the demands and opportunities of the vocation" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;34).

According to Dewey, this propensity and passion for intellectual growth in the profession must be accompanied by a natural desire to communicate one's knowledge with others. "There are scholars who have [the knowledge] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it. To the 'natural born' teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;35). For Dewey, it is not enough for the classroom teacher to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.

===A teacher's skill===
The best indicator of teacher quality, according to Dewey, is the ability to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). As Dewey notes, "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. The explanation is simple. They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;36). Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.

===A teacher's disposition===
As a result of the direct influence teachers have in shaping the mental, moral and spiritual lives of children during their most formative years, Dewey holds the profession of teaching in high esteem, often equating its social value to that of the ministry and to parenting (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, PST, 2010; Dewey, TTC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010). Perhaps the most important attributes, according to Dewey, are those personal inherent qualities which the teacher brings to the classroom. As Dewey notes, "no amount of learning or even of acquired pedagogical skill makes up for the deficiency" (Dewey, TLS, p.&amp;nbsp;25) of the personal traits needed to be most successful in the profession.

According to Dewey, the successful classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, they know that their career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; all of which have the potential to overcome their genuine love and sympathy for their students. For Dewey, "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions" (Dewey, APT, 2101, p.&amp;nbsp;35).

It is essential, according to Dewey, that the classroom teacher has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on them because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). Such negative demeanors, according to Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers must be aware of how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.

===The role of teacher education to cultivate the professional classroom teacher===
Dewey's passions for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which "work automatically, unconsciously" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). According to Dewey, teacher education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g. creating and delivering lesson plans, classroom management, implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday school work with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, "The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development. But later 'progress' may with such consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed. Such persons seem to know how to teach, but they are not students of teaching. Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers' journals, attending teachers' institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity. Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know how to teach as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge. According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching. Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing one's self in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.

As Dewey notes, other professional fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit in their fields to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession. Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, "An intellectual responsibility has got to be distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work that has to be done, with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibility—it is to diffuse irresponsibility" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;39). For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils. Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of classroom teaching.

As well as his very active and direct involvement in setting up educational institutions such as the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]] (1896) and [[The New School for Social Research]] (1919), many of Dewey's ideas influenced the founding of [[Bennington College]] and Goddard College in Vermont, where he served on the Board of Trustees. Dewey's works and philosophy also held great influence in the creation of the short-lived [[Black Mountain College]] in North Carolina, an experimental college focused on interdisciplinary study, and whose faculty included [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Charles Olson]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robert Creeley]], and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], among others. Black Mountain College was the locus of the "Black Mountain Poets" a group of avant-garde poets closely linked with the [[Beat Generation]] and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].

==On journalism==
{{Main| The Public and its Problems}}
[[File:John Dewey caricat.jpg|thumb|Caricature of Dewey by André Koehne, 2006]]
Since the mid-1980s, Deweyan ideas have experienced revival as a major source of inspiration for the public journalism movement. Dewey's definition of "public," as described in ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'', has profound implications for the significance of journalism in society. As suggested by the title of the book, his concern was of the transactional relationship between publics and problems. Also implicit in its name, public journalism seeks to orient communication away from elite, corporate hegemony toward a civic public sphere. "The 'public' of public journalists is Dewey's public."

Dewey gives a concrete definition to the formation of a public. Publics are spontaneous groups of citizens who share the indirect effects of a particular action. Anyone affected by the indirect consequences of a specific action will automatically share a common interest in controlling those consequences, i.e., solving a common problem.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. 1927. ''The Public and its Problems''. Henry Holt &amp; Co., New York. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Since every action generates [[unintended consequence]]s, publics continuously emerge, overlap, and disintegrate.

In ''The Public and its Problems'', Dewey presents a rebuttal to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s treatise on the role of journalism in democracy. Lippmann's model was a basic transmission model in which journalists took information given to them by experts and elites, repackaged that information in simple terms, and transmitted the information to the public, whose role was to react emotionally to the news. In his model, Lippmann supposed that the public was incapable of thought or action, and that all thought and action should be left to the experts and elites.

Dewey refutes this model by assuming that politics is the work and duty of each individual in the course of his daily routine. The knowledge needed to be involved in politics, in this model, was to be generated by the interaction of citizens, elites, experts, through the mediation and facilitation of journalism. In this model, not just the government is accountable, but the citizens, experts, and other actors as well.

Dewey also said that journalism should conform to this ideal by changing its emphasis from actions or happenings (choosing a winner of a given situation) to alternatives, choices, consequences, and [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] . Conditions and Consequences. American Philosophy: an Encyclopedia. 2007. Eds. John Lachs and Robert Talisse. New York: Routledge. pp. 124–27.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to foster conversation and improve the generation of knowledge. Journalism would not just produce a static product that told what had already happened, but the news would be in a constant state of evolution as the public added value by generating knowledge. The "audience" would end, to be replaced by citizens and collaborators who would essentially be users, doing more with the news than simply reading it. Concerning his effort to change journalism, he wrote in ''The Public and Its Problems'': "Till the Great Society is converted in to a Great Community, the Public will remain in eclipse. Communication can alone create a great community" (Dewey, p.&amp;nbsp;142).

Dewey believed that communication creates a great community, and citizens who participate actively with public life contribute to that community. "The clear consciousness of a communal life, in all its implications, constitutes the idea of democracy." (''The Public and its Problems'', p.&amp;nbsp;149). This Great Community can only occur with "free and full intercommunication." (p.&amp;nbsp;211) Communication can be understood as journalism.

==On humanism==
As an atheist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dewey at One Hundred Fifty|year=2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=9781557535504|page=22|authorlink=Larry A. Hickman|editor1=A. G.

Although he described himself as an atheist in one sense of the term, it is also clear that Dewey was opposed to militant atheism for the same reason that he was opposed to supernaturalism: he thought both positions dogmatic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] in his later life, Dewey participated with a variety of humanistic activities from the 1930s into the 1950s, which included sitting on the advisory board of [[Charles Francis Potter]]'s [[First Humanist Society of New York]] (1929); being one of the original 34 signatories of the first ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' (1933) and being elected an honorary member of the Humanist Press Association (1936).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030608113016/http://www.siu.edu/%7Edeweyctr/CHRONO.pdf "John Dewey Chronology" 1934.04.08, 1936.03.12, 1940.09, and 1950.09.11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political activism==
{{American socialism}}
As a major advocate for academic freedom, in 1935 Dewey, together with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson|Alvin Johnson]], became a member of the United States section of the International League for Academic Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/public3_text.htm American Institute of Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1940, together with [[Horace M Kallen]], edited a series of articles related to the [[The Bertrand Russell Case|Bertrand Russell Case]].

As well as being active in defending the independence of teachers, and opposing a communist takeover of the New York Teachers' Union,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Dewey was involved in the organization that eventually became the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

He was an avid supporter of [[Henry George]]'s proposal for taxing land values. Of George, he wrote, "No man, no graduate of a higher educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1927) [http://www.wealthandwant.com/HG/PP/Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html An Appreciation of Henry George]&lt;/ref&gt; As honorary president of the Henry George School of Social Science, he wrote a letter to [[Henry Ford]] urging him to support the school.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J.

He directed the famous [[Dewey Commission]] held in Mexico in 1937, which cleared [[Leon Trotsky]] of the charges made against him by [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name="Dewey Commission Report"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1937/dewey/index.htm "Dewey Commission Report"]&lt;/ref&gt; and marched for women's rights, among many other causes.

In 1939, John Dewey was elected President of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]], an organization with the goal of educating college students about the labor movement. The Student Branch of the L.I.D. would later become [[Students for a Democratic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Dewey'', edited by Molly Cochran. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Dewey, [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Jacques Maritain]] agreed to act as honorary chairmen of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v38i5a10p.htm "Origins of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, 1949–1950" CIA official web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613054254/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v38i5a10p.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Front organizations|false-front]] anti-communist advocacy group founded that year and funded by the [[CIA]].

==Other interests==
Dewey's interests and writings included many topics, and according to the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], "a substantial part of his published output consisted of commentary on current domestic and international politics, and public statements on behalf of many causes. (He is probably the only philosopher in this encyclopedia to have published both on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and on the value of displaying art in post offices.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/archives/sum2005/entries/dewey-political/ "Dewey's Political Philosophy" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Dewey met [[F. Matthias Alexander|F. M. Alexander]] in New York City and later wrote introductions to Alexander's ''Man's Supreme Inheritance'' (1918), ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'' (1923) and ''The Use of the Self'' (1932). Alexander's influence is referenced in "Human Nature and Conduct" and "Experience and Nature."&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Alexander ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'', E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1923 {{ISBN|0-913111-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as his contacts with people mentioned elsewhere in the article, he also maintained correspondence with [[Henri Bergson]], [[William M. Brown]], [[Martin Buber]], [[George Counts|George S. Counts]], [[William Rainey Harper]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[George Santayana]].

==Criticism==
Dewey is considered the epitome of liberalism by historians,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Paringer, ''John Dewey and the paradox of liberal reform'' (1990) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes was portrayed as "dangerously radical."&lt;ref&gt;William R. Caspary, ''Dewey on Democracy''. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Dewey was critiqued strongly by American communists because he argued against [[Stalinism]] and had philosophical differences with Marx, identifying himself as a democratic socialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Westbrook | first = Robert B | title = John Dewey and American Democracy | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 1993 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-8014-8111-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have examined his religious beliefs. Biographer [[Steven C. Rockefeller]] traced Dewey's democratic convictions to his childhood attendance at the [[Congregational Church]], with its strong proclamation of social ideals and the [[Social Gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Rockefeller, ''John Dewey: Religious Faith and Democratic Humanism'', (1994), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Edward A. White suggested in ''[[Science and Religion in American Thought]]'' (1952) that Dewey's work led to the 20th century rift between religion and science.

'''Horse Cave Theatre''' (in its mid-life known as Kentucky Repertory Theatre) is a [[theater]] company located in [[Horse Cave, Kentucky]], United States. The company is located in two former commercial buildings in the city's [[downtown]] area.

KRT was formed as Horse Cave Theatre in 1976, and was a novelty for its time: a professional theater company located in a small rural town, producing a series of plays in a [[repertory]] cycle. The theater's proximity to the [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] tourist area was hoped to help attract theatergoers, and that has been proven to be the case over the years, though the theater enjoys substantial support from the town's residents as well, as well as those in neighboring [[Cave City, Kentucky|Cave City]], [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]], [[Munfordville, Kentucky|Munfordville]] and other surrounding cities.

The primary season for KRT was originally in the [[summer]], when tourism business in the area is at its peak. In recent times, the company shifted its season to a period between [[autumn]] and [[Christmas]], while continuing to present a single production in the summer to attract tourists.  Over the years, KRT productions have run the gamut of theater, from [[George Bernard Shaw]] to [[Neil Simon]], with one play by [[William Shakespeare]] being featured nearly every season. The company has also encouraged works by Kentucky playwrights, including at least one such work in its repertory nearly every season. [[Sallie Bingham]], a descendant of the Bingham family of Louisville (former owners of ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' and numerous other media properties), has had three of her plays produced by KRT.

The theater was housed in two renovated buildings, and seated 346 people in its main auditorium. An entrance building, built to resemble a tobacco barn typically found in southern Kentucky, was added at the opening. In 1998, the company purchased a residential building for office space, and a nearby warehouse for [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] and [[Theatrical properties|prop]] construction. The main theater buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Warren Hammack was KRT's first artistic director, serving the company for 25 years until his retirement.

He was succeeded by director, [[Robert Brock]].  Mr. Brock was the Artistic Director of Kentucky Repertory Theatre from 2002-2011. In that time he produced 86 plays, 11 of them were new scripts premiering at the theatre. Under his directorship the theatre's Educational Outreach Programs tripled the number of students impacted (15,000 students in 22 counties annually). He created the very popular and successful Young Performers Program in 1999 and produced and directed 14 shows involving middle and high school students from the region. The Young Performers Program produced a number of young actors that went on to receive theatre scholarships to colleges and universities nationwide. 9 Young Performers were accepted into the Governor's School for the Arts. Mr. Brock also initiated a cooperative program with T J Samson Hospital and Barren County Drug Prevention to address health issues with young people in the region. The program was called Project HEAT (Health Education Awareness Theatre) and produced three plays that toured to schools. These plays offered an entertaining and imaginative approach to looking at Drug, Alcohol and Tobacco Abuse, Bullying and Hygiene. In 2008 Mr. Brock accepted the Governor's Arts Award on behalf of KRT. While Mr. Brock was Artistic Director, KRT received many accolades, among them being named ‘one of the Top Ten small regional theatres in the nation’ by USA Today. The Theatre's Educational Outreach Program was written up in the [[The Cincinnati Enquirer|Cincinnati Enquirer]], [[The Indianapolis Star]], [[The Evansville Courier]], and [[The Dallas Morning News]]. While Mr. Brock was Director, KRT was commissioned by the [[Kentucky Humanities Council]] and the Kentucky Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission to produce two plays about Lincoln ( Abraham Lincoln and One Man's Lincoln) during the bicentennial years 2008-2009. Mr Brock performed with [[Annie Potts]] in 2 productions of [[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]] in 2002 and 2003 that played in Horse Cave, Elizabethtown and Bowling Green, and directed [[Sally Struthers]] in another production of Love Letters in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glasgowdailytimes.com/news/lifestyles/love-letters/article_f94f82b0-2fa1-592b-8a4d-f0fc54a2e7a8.html|title=‘Love Letters’|last=Times|first=SUSAN TEBBENGlasgow Daily|work=Glasgow Daily Times|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com/content/struthers-gallagher-star-elizabethtown-presentation-love-letters|title=Struthers, Gallagher to star in Elizabethtown presentation of 'Love Letters' {{!}} TheNewsEnterprise.com|website=subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Christopher Carter Sanderson for one season. For the 2013 season, RepALLIANCE under the direction of Ken Neil Hailey took over the producing duties. In May 2013, the theatre was closed due to debt that had built up over a number of the later seasons. The theatre and its board suspended operations while the core directors and actors who produced the successful final season moved on and formed a new company, Kentucky Stage(s), in residence at Bowling Green's new SKyPAC (Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center during the 2013-14 season. Kentucky Stage(s) observed the process after closure and has retained a contract to reacquire and restore the theatre, re-re-branding the facility again as THE HORSE CAVE THEATRE. Plans to reopen the theatre by the summer of 2015 were unsuccessful.

The '''Kildalton Cross''' is a monolithic [[high cross]] in [[Celtic cross]] form in the churchyard of the former parish church of Kildalton (from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Cill Daltain'', "Church of the Foster Son" (i.e. [[St John the Evangelist]]) on the island of [[Islay]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]], [[Scotland]].  It was carved probably in the second half of the 8th century AD, and is closely related to crosses of similar date on [[Iona]].  It is often considered the finest surviving Celtic cross in Scotland, and is certainly one of the most perfect monuments of its date to survive on western [[Europe]].  The cross and the adjacent roofless [[medieval]] parish church are in the care of [[Historic Scotland]] (access at all times) and are jointly a [[scheduled ancient monument]] &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM13236|title=Kildalton Church, church, High Cross, and cross 60m NE ofSM13236|publisher= Historic Environment Scotland|accessdate=5 September 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;.  A simpler cross of late medieval date stands nearby.

==Ornament==
The Kildalton Cross features an iconic image of the Virgin and Child, which is closely related to similar Virgin and Child iconography found on St. Martin's Cross and St. Oran's Cross at [[Iona]]. In addition, this panel displays similarities with folio 7v in the [[Book of Kells]]. This type of [[iconography]] of the [[Virgin and Child]] may be related to contemporary Marian iconography in the Mediterranean, specifically the Maria Regina which was used in Rome to refute [[iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humphrey|first1=Hayley|title=Representations of the Virgin Mary on Irish High Crosses: Icons, Narratives and Symbols of Power|date=2012|publisher=National University of Ireland, Galway|location=Galway, Ireland|url=http://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10379/2943/2011HumphreyPhD.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - Utamaro, Kushi (Comb), ca. 1785.jpg|thumb|alt=|''Kushi'', [[Utamaro]], multicolour woodblock print, {{circa|1795–96}}]]
&lt;!-- no infobox, please --&gt;
'''''Kushi''''' ({{lang|ja|櫛}}, "Comb", {{circa|1795–96}}) is a title given to a print by the Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Kitagawa Utamaro]].  It depicts a woman looking through a clear glass comb.

==Background==

[[Ukiyo-e]] art flourished in Japan during the [[Edo period]] from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects [[oiran|courtesans]], [[kabuki]] actors, and others associated with the "floating world" lifestyle of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  Alongside paintings, mass-produced [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] were a major form of the genre.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In the mid-18th century full-colour ''{{transl|ja|[[nishiki-e]]}}'' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80–83}}  A prominent genre was ''{{transl|ja|[[bijin-ga]]}}'' ("pictures of beauties"), which depicted most often [[Oiran|courtesans]] and [[geisha]] at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}

[[Kitagawa Utamaro]] ({{circa|1753}}–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin [[ōkubi-e]]'' ("large-headed pictures of beautiful women") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87–88}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}

==Description and analysis==

A woman holds up a transparent comb, most likely of glass.  Her lower face can easily been seen through it.{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=43}}

It was published in ''[[ōban]]'' size (about {{convert|39|x|26|cm|in|disp=comma|0}}) {{circa|1795–96}} by {{illm|Ōmiya Gonkurō|ja|近江屋権九郎}}.{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=43}}

Utamaro made a [[hand fan|hand-fan]] painting similar to this print {{circa|1802–03}} called ''Giyaman Oshima'' ({{lang|ja|ぎやまんおしま}}).  The name is inscribed on the fan.  ''Giyaman'' is an Edo-period Japanese word for "glass", so the name translates as "Glass Oshima".  She was likely a popular beauty in Edo of the day.{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=43}}

''Basic Copyfitting'', Studio Vista, London, 1969, SBN 289797055, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged [[typeface]] or [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. At the level of [[mass communication]] and in common usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its [[trademark]] or [[brand]].&lt;ref name="wheeler_dbi_pg4"&gt;Wheeler, Alina.

==History==
Numerous inventions and techniques have contributed to the contemporary logo, including [[cylinder seal]]s (c. 2300 BCE), [[coin]]s (c. 600 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus.

As the [[industrial revolution]] converted western societies from [[Agriculture|agrarian]] to industrial in the 18th and 19th centuries, photography and lithography contributed to the boom of an advertising industry that integrated [[typography]] and imagery together on the page.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=138–159}} Simultaneously, typography itself was undergoing a revolution of form and expression that expanded beyond the modest, serif typefaces used in books, to bold, ornamental typefaces used on broadsheet [[poster]]s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=126–134}}

The arts were expanding in purpose—from expression and decoration of an artistic, storytelling nature, to a differentiation of brands and products that the growing middle classes were consuming. Consultancies and trades-groups in the commercial arts were growing and organizing; by 1890, the US had 700 lithographic printing firms employing more than 8,000 people.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Artistic credit tended to be assigned to the lithographic company, as opposed to the individual artists who usually performed less important jobs.
[[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|A coin from early 6th century BC [[Lydia]] bearing the head of a roaring lion with sun rays]]

Innovators in the visual arts and lithographic process—such as French printing firm Rouchon in the 1840s, Joseph Morse of New York in the 1850s, Frederick Walker of England in the 1870s, and Jules Chéret of France in the 1870s—developed an illustrative style that went beyond tonal, representational art to figurative imagery with sections of bright, flat colors.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Playful children’s books, authoritative newspapers, and conversational periodicals developed their own visual and editorial styles for unique, expanding audiences. As printing costs decreased, literacy rates increased, and visual styles changed, the [[Victorian decorative arts]] led to an expansion of typographic styles and methods of representing businesses.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=159–161}}

[[File:Bass logo.svg|thumb|upright|The first logo to be trademarked was the [[Bass Brewery|Bass]] red triangle in 1876]]

The [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] of late-19th century, partially in response to the excesses of Victorian typography, aimed to restore an honest sense of craftsmanship to the mass-produced goods of the era.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=162–167}} A renewal of interest in craftsmanship and quality also provided the artists and companies with a greater interest in credit, leading to the creation of unique logos and marks.

By the 1950s, [[Modernism]] had shed its roots as an avant-garde artistic movement in Europe to become an international, commercialized movement with adherents in the United States and elsewhere. The visual simplicity and conceptual clarity that were the hallmarks of [[Modernism]] as an artistic movement formed a powerful toolset for a new generation of graphic designers whose logos embodied [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]’s dictum, "Less is more." Modernist-inspired logos proved successful in the era of mass visual communication ushered in by television, improvements in printing technology, and digital innovations.

==Contemporary logos==
[[File:Croixrouge logos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Red Cross (symbol)|Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent (symbol)|Red Crescent]] emblems]]

The current era of logo design began in the 1870s{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} with the first abstract logo, the Bass red triangle. {{As of | 2014}}, many corporations, products, brands, services, agencies, and other entities use an ideogram (sign, icon) or an emblem (symbol) or a combination of sign and emblem as a logo. As a result, only a few of the thousands of ideograms in circulation are recognizable without a name. An effective logo may consist of both an ideogram and the company name (logotype) to emphasize the name over the graphic, and employ a unique design via the use of letters, colors, and additional graphic elements.

[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The Coca-Cola logo is identifiable in other writing-systems, here written in [[Cyrillic]].]]

Ideograms and symbols may be more effective than written names (logotypes), especially for logos translated into many [[alphabet]]s in increasingly globalized markets. For instance, a name written in [[Arabic script]] might have little resonance in most European markets. By contrast, ideograms  keep the general proprietary nature of a product in both markets. In non-profit areas, the [[Red Cross]] (varied as the [[Red Crescent]] in Muslim countries and as the [[Magen David Adom|Red Star of David]] in Israel) exemplifies a well-known emblem that does not need an accompanying name. The red cross and red crescent are among the best-recognized symbols in the world. National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross include these symbols in their logos.

[[Brand]]ing can aim to facilitate cross-language marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TICoRD'13: Global Product Development|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9788132210498e|website=Springer|publisher=Springers|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers and potential consumers can identify the [[Coca-Cola]] name written in different alphabets because of the standard color and "ribbon wave" design of its logo. The text was written in [[Spencerian Script]], which was a popular writing style when the [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola Logo]] was being designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coca-Cola logo story|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/stories/history/advertising/the-logo-story/|website=Coca Cola Official Website|publisher=The Coca Cola Company|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo design==

Since a logo is the visual entity signifying an organization, logo design is an important area of [[graphic design]]. A logo is the central element of a complex identification system that must be functionally extended to all communications of an organization. Therefore, the design of logos and their incorporation in a visual identity system is one of the most difficult and important areas of graphic design. Logos fall into three classifications (which can be combined). Ideographs, such as Chase Bank, are completely abstract forms; pictographs are iconic, representational designs; logotypes (or wordmarks) depict the name or company initials. Because logos are meant to represent companies' brands or corporate identities and foster their immediate customer recognition, it is counterproductive to frequently redesign logos.

The logo design profession has substantially increased in numbers over the years since the rise of the [[Modernist movement]] in the [[United States]] in the 1950s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=363}} Three designers are widely{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=369–374}} considered the pioneers of that movement and of logo and [[corporate identity]] design: The first is [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=373–374}} which is the firm responsible for a large number of iconic logos, such as [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] Bank (1964), [[Mobil Oil]] (1965), [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (1984), [[NBC]] (1986), [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] (2003), and others. Due to the simplicity and boldness of their designs, many of their earlier logos are still in use today. The firm recently designed logos for the [[Library of Congress]] and the fashion brand [[Armani Exchange]]. Another pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Paul Rand]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=369}} who was one of the originators of the Swiss Style of [[graphic design]]. He designed many posters and corporate identities, including the famous logos for [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The third pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Saul Bass]].{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=375}} Bass was responsible for several recognizable logos in North America, including both the Bell Telephone logo (1969) and successor [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] globe (1983). Other well-known designs were [[Continental Airlines]] (1968), Dixie (1969), and [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1972). Later, he would produce logos for a number of Japanese companies as well.
An important development in the documentation of logo design is the study of French trademarks by historian Edith Amiot and philosopher Jean Louis Azizollah.&lt;ref&gt;Les Marques Francaises 1824–1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo color==
Color is a key element in logo design and plays an important role in brand differentiation. The importance of color in this context is due to the mechanics of human visual perception wherein color and contrast play critical roles in visual detail detection.  In addition, we tend to acquire various color connotations and color associations through social and cultural conditioning, and these play a role in how we decipher and evaluate logo color. While color is considered important to brand recognition and logo design, it shouldn't conflict with logo functionality, and it needs to be remembered that color connotations and associations are not consistent across all social and cultural groups. For example, in the United States, red, white, and blue are often used in logos for companies that want to project patriotic feelings but other countries will have different sets of colors that evoke national pride. 

Choosing an organisation's logo's color is an important decision because of its long term implications and its role in creating differentiation among competitors' logos. A methodology for identifying potential logo colors within an industry sector is color mapping, whereby existing logo colors are systematically identified, mapped, and evaluated (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zena O'Connor|title=Logo Colour and Differentiation: A New Application of Environmental Colour Mapping |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.20594/abstract |journal=Color Research and Application |volume=36 |number=1 |pages=55–60 |doi=10.1002/col.20594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo design process===
Designing a good logo often requires involvement from a marketing team teaming with the graphic design studio. Before a logo is designed, there must be a clear definition of the concept and values of the brand as well as understanding of the consumer or target group. Broad steps in the logo design process include research, conceptualization, investigation of alternative candidates, refinement of a chosen design, testing across products, and finally adoption and production of the chosen mark.

===Dynamic logos===

}}

In 1898, the French tire manufacturer [[Michelin]] introduced the [[Michelin Man]], a cartoon figure presented in many different contexts, such as eating, drinking, and playing sports. By the early 21st century, large corporations such as [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Google]], [[Morton Salt]], and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] had adopted ''dynamic logos'' that change over time from setting to setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|accessdate=2008-05-21
|date=2007-02-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet-compatible logos===
A company that uses logotypes (wordmarks) may desire a logo that matches the firm's Internet address. For short logotypes consisting of two or three characters, multiple companies are found to employ the same letters. A "CA" logo, for example, is used by the French bank [[Credit Agricole]], the Dutch clothing retailer [[C&amp;A]], and the US software corporation [[CA Technologies]], but only one can have the Internet domain name CA.com.

In today's digital interface adaptive world, a logo will be formatted and re-formatted from large monitors to small handheld devices. With the constant size change and re-formatting, logo designers are shifting to a more bold and simple approach, with heavy lines and shapes, and solid colors. This reduces the confusion when mingled with other logos in tight spaces and when scaled between media. Social networks like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], and [[Google+]] use such logos.

==Design protection==
Logos and their design may be protected by copyright, via various [[Intellectual Property|intellectual property]] organisations worldwide which make available application procedures to register a design to give it protection at law. For example, in the UK, the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm.htm|publisher =UK Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; govern registered designs, patents, and trademarks. Ordinarily, the trademark registration will not 'make claim' to colors used, meaning it is the visual design that will be protected, even if it is reproduced in a variety of other colors or backgrounds.

==Sports==
For many teams, a logo or "[[crest (sports)|crest]]" is an important way to recognize a team's history and can intimidate opponents.
For certain teams, the logo and color scheme are synonymous with the team's players. For example, [[Manchester United]], the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], or [[New York Yankees]] all have a recognizable logo that can be identified by any fan of the respective sport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2398">'''Mane 'n Tail''' is the [[brand name]] of a series of health products for humans and horses. 

The product range includes shampoos, conditioners, leave-in spray treatments and conditioning creams, styling pomades and hand and nail therapy for humans. It also includes a series of products for equine animals like detanglers, conditioners, moisturizers and spray-awry uses by horse wash. 
 
It is produced by Straight Arrow Products, Inc., with head offices in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]

==Involvement in ''The Greatest Movie Ever Sold''==
The product was featured on [[Morgan Spurlock]]'s 2011 documentary ''[[The Greatest Movie Ever Sold|POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold]]'' as one of the corporate sponsors. Although featured heavily throughout the film, the end titles of the film point out that the company did not pay for the sponsorship deal. 

On the Mane 'n Tail website, management explains: "Mane 'n Tail is no stranger to doing product placement in major motion pictures, this however, was our first foray into the indie film arena as Morgan sought us out to participate in the film about product placement funded strictly by product placement. When we agreed to jump on board, we had no idea what an incredible opportunity it would blossom into. Sony Pictures Classics picked up the film three days before its Sundance premiere, much to everyone’s delight. The publicity has been unbelievable and our part in the movie... we absolutely adore. Although we are a 'sponsor', Mane 'n Tail did not pay to be part of the film, instead we exchanged our product, a true 'product placement' deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manentail.com/expert-blog/mane-%E2%80%98n-tail-goes-to-the-sundance-film-festival/ |title=Mane 'n Tail Goes To The Sundance Film Festival |publisher=Mane 'n Tail |date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mariana''''' is an 1851 [[panel painting|oil-on-wood]] painting by [[John Everett Millais]]. The image is based on the solitary Mariana from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', written between 1601 and 1606. In the play, Mariana was to be married, but was rejected when her dowry was lost in a shipwreck. Her story was retold in "[[Mariana (poem)|Mariana]]", a poem published in 1830 by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], which provided additional inspiration for Millais' painting. The painting is regarded as an example of Millais' "precision, attention to detail, and stellar ability as a colorist".&lt;ref name="SallyK"&gt;King, Sally. "[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/millais/paintings/king1.html "Aweary" and Waiting: John Everett Millais's Mariana]". English 156 / History of Art 152, Brown University, 2007. Retrieved 21 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Millais was a founding member of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], a group of English artists who came together in 1848 with the goal of renewing British painting. They found in the art of the early Italian Renaissance—before [[Raphael]]—a sincerity of purpose and clarity of form that they sought to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;Treuherz, J. (2003). ''Pre-Raphaelitism''. Grove Art Online.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:William Hunt Claudio and Isabella Shakespeare Measure for Measure.jpg|thumb|upright|''Mariana'' may have been painted as a companion piece to ''Claudio and Isabella'' (1850) by [[William Holman Hunt]]&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowle|first=Frances|title=Sir John Everett Millais, Bt ''Mariana'' 1851|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-mariana-t07553/text-summary|publisher=The Tate|accessdate=22 January 2013|date=December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Oftentimes the PRB artists used allegorical images to create a narrative, which taught a moral virtue or virtues.  Sometimes they used contemporary literature as inspiration for their paintings, which often include numerous details that allow the viewer to "read" the painting. Millais used Tennyson's poetry to create a narrative for his painting of ''Mariana'' and he wanted to allow the viewer familiar with Tennyson's poetry to read the entire poem through the painting.

When it was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1851, the display caption contained lines from Tennyson's "Mariana" (1830):

&lt;poem&gt;
    She only said, 'My life is dreary,
      He cometh not,' she said;
    She said, 'I am aweary, aweary,'
      I would that I were dead!'
&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting is packed with details that help the viewer to read the narrative of the work along with Tennyson's poetry.  Everything from the rolled embroidery that Mariana has been working on and the leaves outside of the window point the reader in the direction of the narrative which is about a young woman rejected by her fiancé because her dowry was lost at sea. It is about waiting and the passage of time, which Millais shows by the arched-back pose of the woman.  The pose makes it seem like she has been sitting too long and she must stand up to stretch before she sits again.  The rolled embroidery on the table gives the viewer a clue as to how long Mariana has been working on it.

In the painting ''Mariana'', Millais included many details that relate directly to Tennyson's poetry.  One example is the curtain.  In the poem, Tennyson wrote, "When thickest dark did trance the sky, She drew her casement-curtain by, and glanced athwart the glooming flats".&lt;ref name="Poems and Plays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tennyson|first1=Alfred|title=Poems and Plays|date=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is not a curtain in Millais' painting, this line is similar to the scene that is presented outside of the window.  The viewer perceives an ominous feeling, just like the dark storm that Tennyson alludes to in the line above.  The little mouse that is on the floor towards the bottom right corner is a detail that Millais took from Tennyson's poem: "the mouse behind the mouldering wainscots shriek'd or from the crevice peer'd about".  Together, Millais' painting and Tennyson's poem create an intriguing storyline for the reader to follow.&lt;ref name="Poems and Plays"/&gt;

'''''Ode to the Death of Jazz''''' is an album by  Finnish avant-garde jazz composer, bandleader and drummer [[Edward Vesala]] recorded in 1989 and released on the [[ECM Records|ECM]] label in 1990.&lt;ref name="ECM discography"&gt;[http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/ECM/1400/1413.php ECM discography] accessed October 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The [[Allmusic]] review by Brian Olewnick awarded the album 2½ stars stating "it feels as though something essential is being restrained, as though Vesala is reluctant to simply let his ensemble surge forward unbound. Fine instrumental work abounds, however, notably by the leader himself on drums and the Garbarek-laden tones of tenor saxophonist Jouni Kannisto. In sum, the listener gets the impression that, although all the elements are in place for a fine album, excessive control has led to a dilution of the power that could have been".&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Olewnick, B. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/ode-to-the-death-of-jazz-r149524/review Allmusic Review] accessed October 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osman Nuri Pasha''' (c.1839 in [[Istanbul]] &amp;ndash; 1906 in Istanbul) was a Turkish painter and military officer. While his birth date has not been established, it is on record that he received his education in Istanbul, attending the [[Turkish Military Academy]]. In 1857, he received an appointment as [[court painter]]; serving under Sultans [[Abdülmecid I]] and [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Abdülaziz]], who gave him paintings by European artists, to serve as examples for his work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vweaF4UgvQ8C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=osman+nuri+pasha+painter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tTZv_0YSB_&amp;sig=2U2EJ-A_JBdBEPlB5gp4pxdFqj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z46VVZ-lDIWzogSG6a74Dw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=osman%20nuri%20pasha%20painter&amp;f=false Excerpt from ''Ottoman Painting'' by Wendy Shaw] @ GoogleBooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a court painter he was eventually promoted to Brigadier General (Tuğgeneral) and became an art teacher at [[Kuleli Military High School]]. Most of Turkey's best-known painters were among his students, including [[Ahmet Ziya Akbulut]], [[Hodja Ali Rıza]] and [[Hüseyin Zekai Pasha]]. In 1877, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], he served as a military commander.

Although he painted landscapes, most of his paintings deal with military subjects; notably battles and warships. These include his depiction of the [[Battle of Preveza]] (which was one of the first Turkish paintings to use Western-style oil techniques) and the sinking of the frigate ''[[Ottoman frigate Ertuğrul|Ertuğrul]]'', following a good-will mission to Japan.

'''Plakatstil''' (German for "poster style"), also known as ''Sachplakat'', was an early style of poster art that originated in Germany in the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Consuegra, David, American type design &amp; designers, 2004, pg. 288&lt;/ref&gt; It was started by [[Lucian Bernhard]] of Berlin in 1906. The common characteristics of this style are bold eye-catching lettering with flat colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~pjd77408/DrD/Art461/LecturesAll/Lectures/Lecture06/Plakastil.html |title=Plakatstil |publisher=Csun.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapes and objects are simplified, and the composition focuses on a central object. ''Plakatstil'' turned away from the complexity of Art Nouveau and propagated a more modern outlook on poster art. Famous ''Plakatstil'' artists include [[Ludwig Hohlwein]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Edmund Edel|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernst Deutsch-Dryden|de}}, [[Hans Lindenstadt]], [[Julius Klinger]], [[Julius Gipkens]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul Scheurich|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Schulpig|de}} and [[Hans Rudi Erdt]].&lt;ref name="rabinowitz1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabinowitz|first=Tova|title=Exploring Typography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7vKG7s1FaUC|accessdate=06-12-2012|edition=Illustrated|date=2006-02-28|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1401815057}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later master of the Sachplakat was [[Otto Baumberger]].

''Das Plakat'' was a German art magazine that was published from 1910 to 1921 by the Verein der Plakatfreunde ("association of friends of the poster"), founded in 1905 and later edited by the Berlin dentist [[Hans Sachs (poster collector)|Hans Sachs]].

'''''Possession: A Romance''''' is a 1990 best-selling novel by British writer [[A. S. Byatt]] that won the 1990 [[Booker Prize]]. The novel explores the [[postmodern]] concerns of similar novels, which are often categorised as [[historiographic metafiction]], a genre that blends approaches from both historical fiction and [[metafiction]].

The novel follows two modern-day academics as they research the paper trail around the previously unknown love life between famous fictional poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. ''Possession'' is set both in the present day and the Victorian era, contrasting the two time periods, as well as echoing similarities and satirising  modern [[academia]] and mating rituals. The structure of the novel incorporates many different styles, including fictional [[epistolary novel|diary entries, letters]] and poetry, and uses these styles and other devices to explore the [[postmodern]] concerns of the authority of textual narratives. The title ''Possession'' highlights many of the major themes in the novel: questions of ownership and independence between lovers; the practice of collecting historically significant cultural artefacts; and the possession that biographers feel toward their subjects.

The novel was adapted as a [[Possession (2002 film)|feature film]] by the same name in 2002, and a serialised radio play that ran from 2011 to 2012 on BBC Radio 4. In 2005 ''[[Time Magazine]]'' included the novel in its list of ''100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html | work=Time | title=All-Time 100 Novels | date=16 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the novel was listed on the BBC's survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top200.shtml "BBC – The Big Read"].

==Background==

The novel concerns the relationship between two fictional [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] poets, Randolph Henry Ash (whose life and work are loosely based on those of the English poet [[Robert Browning]], or [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], whose work is more consonant with the themes expressed by Ash, as well as Tennyson's having been poet-laureate to Queen Victoria) and Christabel LaMotte (based on [[Christina Rossetti]]),&lt;ref name="Parini"/&gt; as uncovered by present-day academics Roland Michell and Maud Bailey. Following a trail of clues from letters and journals, they collaborate to uncover the truth about Ash and LaMotte's relationship, before it is discovered by rival colleagues. Byatt provides extensive letters, poetry and diaries by major characters in addition to the narrative, including poetry attributed to the fictional Ash and LaMotte.

[[A. S. Byatt]], in part, wrote ''Possession'' in response to [[John Fowles]]' novel ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969). In an essay in Byatt's nonfiction book, ''On Histories and Stories'', she wrote:
{{quote|Fowles has said that the nineteenth-century narrator was assuming the omniscience of a god. I think rather the opposite is the case—this kind of fictive narrator can creep closer to the feelings and inner life of characters—as well as providing a Greek chorus—than any first-person mimicry. In 'Possession' I used this kind of narrator deliberately three times in the historical narrative—always to tell what the historians and biographers of my fiction never discovered, always to heighten the reader's imaginative entry into the world of the text.&lt;ref name ="ASB H&amp;S"&gt;A.S. Byatt ''On Histories and Stories'' (2001), p. 56. qtd in Lisa Fletcher "Historical Romance, Gender and Heterosexuality: John Fowles’s The French Lieutenant’s Woman and A.S. Byatt’s Possession", Journal of Interdisciplinary Gender Studies vol.7 2003, p30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot summary==
Obscure scholar Roland Michell, researching in the [[London Library]], discovers handwritten drafts of a letter by the fictional eminent [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poet Randolph Henry Ash, which lead him to suspect that the married Ash had a hitherto unknown romance.  He secretly takes away the documents – a highly unprofessional act for a scholar – and begins to investigate.  The trail leads him to Christabel LaMotte, a minor poet and contemporary of Ash, and to Dr. Maud Bailey, an established modern LaMotte scholar and distant relative of LaMotte. Protective of LaMotte, Bailey is drawn into helping Michell with the unfolding mystery.  The two scholars find more letters and evidence of a love affair between the poets (with evidence of a holiday together during which – they suspect – the relationship may have been consummated); they become obsessed with discovering the truth. At the same time, their own personal romantic lives – neither of which is satisfactory – develop, and they become entwined in an echo of Ash and LaMotte. The stories of the two couples are told in parallel, with Byatt providing letters and poetry by both of the fictional poets.

The revelation of an affair between Ash and LaMotte would make headlines and reputations in academia because of the prominence of the poets, and colleagues of Roland and Maud become competitors in the race to discover the truth, for all manner of motives. Ash's marriage is revealed to have been unconsummated, although he loved and remained devoted to his wife. He and LaMotte had a short, passionate affair; it led to the suicide of LaMotte's companion (and possibly lover), Blanche Glover, and the secret birth of LaMotte's illegitimate daughter during a year spent in [[Brittany]]. LaMotte left the girl with her sister to be raised by her, and passed off as her own. Ash was never informed that he and LaMotte had a child.

As the [[Great Storm of 1987]] strikes England, the interested modern characters come together at Ash's grave, where they intend to exhume documents buried with Ash by his wife, which they believe hold the final key to the mystery. Reading them, Maud learns that rather than being related to LaMotte's sister, as she has always believed, she is directly descended from LaMotte and Ash's illegitimate daughter. Bailey thus is heir to the correspondence by the poets. Freed from obscurity and a dead-end relationship, Michell remedies the potential professional suicide of stealing the original drafts, and sees an academic career open up before him. Bailey, who has spent her adult life emotionally untouchable, finds her human side and sees possible future happiness with Michell. The sad story of Ash and LaMotte, separated by the mores of the day and condemned to secrecy and separation, has a kind of resolution through the burgeoning relationship between Bailey and Michell.

In a brief epilogue, it is revealed that both the modern and historical characters ''(and hence the reader)'', have for much of the latter half of the book, misunderstood the significance of one of Ash's key mementoes.

==Reception==
American writer [[Jay Parini]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'', wrote "a plenitude of surprises awaits the reader of this gorgeously written novel. A. S. Byatt is a writer in mid-career whose time has certainly come, because ''Possession'' is a tour de force that opens every narrative device of English fiction to inspection without, for a moment, ceasing to delight." Also "The most dazzling aspect of ''Possession'' is Ms. Byatt's canny invention of letters, poems and diaries from the 19th century".&lt;ref name="Parini"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D8153FF932A15753C1A966958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fByatt%2c%20A%2e%20S%2e | title=Unearthing the Secret Lover | work=The New York Times | accessdate=23 October 2014 | author=Parini, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]], writing in the ''New York Times'', noted that what he describes as the "wonderfully extravagant novel" is "pointedly subtitled 'A Romance'."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; He says it is at once "a detective story" and "an adultery novel."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DD143CF936A15753C1A966958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fByatt%2c%20A%2e%20S%2e Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, Books of The Times; "When There Was Such a Thing as Romantic Love"], ''The New York Times'', 25 October 1990. Retrieved 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' online, [[Sam Jordison]], who described himself as "a longstanding Byatt sceptic", wrote that he was: "caught off-guard by ''Possession's'' warmth and wit"  ... "Anyone and everything that falls under Byatt's gaze is a source of fun." Commenting on the invented 'historical' texts he said their "effect is dazzling – and similarly ludic erudition is on display throughout." ... "Yet more impressive are in excess of 1,700 lines of original poetry". "In short, the whole book is a gigantic tease – which is certainly satisfying on an intellectual level" but,'' "Possession's'' true centre is a big, red, beating heart. It's the warmth and spirit that Byatt has breathed into her characters rather than their cerebral pursuits that makes us care". Concluding, "There's real magic behind all the brainy trickery and an emotional journey on top of the academic quest. So I loved it."&lt;ref name="Sam Jordison"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/18/book-club-possession-as-byatt | title=Guardian book club: Possession by AS Byatt | publisher=[[The Guardian]] 19 June 2009 | accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Primavera''''' ({{IPA-it|primaˈveːra}}, meaning "Spring"), is a large [[panel painting]] in [[tempera]] paint by the [[Italian Renaissance]] painter [[Sandro Botticelli]] made in the late 1470s or early 1480s (datings vary). It has been described as "one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world",{{sfn|Fossi|1998|p=5}} and also "one of the most popular paintings in Western art".{{sfn|Cunningham &amp; Reich|2009|p=282}}

The painting depicts a group of figures from [[classical mythology]] in a garden, but no story has been found that brings this particular group together.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics agree that the painting is an [[allegory]] based on the lush growth of Spring, but accounts of any precise meaning vary, though many involve the [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] which then fascinated intellectual circles in [[Florence]]. The subject was first described as ''Primavera'' by the art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] who saw it at [[Villa Castello]], just outside Florence, by 1550.{{sfn|Foster &amp; Tudor-Craig|1986|p=42}}

Although the two are now known not to be a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; of the two, the ''Birth'' is even better known than the ''Primavera''.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 134; Legouix, 118&lt;/ref&gt; As depictions of subjects from [[classical mythology]] on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 119&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.

The history of the painting is not certainly known, though it seems to have been commissioned by one of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]. It draws from a number of classical and Renaissance literary sources, including the works of the Ancient Roman poet [[Ovid]] and, less certainly, [[Lucretius]], and may also allude to a poem by [[Poliziano]], the Medici house poet who may have helped Botticelli devise the composition. Since 1919 the painting has been part of the collection of the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], Italy.

==Composition==
[[File:Primavera 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] standing in her arch.]]
The painting features six female figures and two male, along with a cupid, in an orange grove. The movement of the composition is from right to left, so following that direction the standard identification of the figures is: at far right "[[Zephyrus]], the biting wind of March, kidnaps and possesses the nymph [[Chloris]], whom he later marries and transforms into a deity; she becomes the goddess of Spring, eternal bearer of life, and is scattering roses on the ground."{{sfn|Capretti|2002|p=48}} [[Chloris]] the nymph overlaps Flora, the goddess she transforms into.

In the centre (but not exactly so) and somewhat set back from the other figures stands Venus, a red-draped woman in blue. Like the flower-gatherer, she returns the viewer's gaze. The trees behind her form a broken arch to draw the eye. In the air above her a blindfolded [[Cupid]] aims his bow to the left.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 126–128&lt;/ref&gt; On the left of the painting the [[Charites|Three Graces]], a group of three females also in diaphanous white, join hands in a dance. At the extreme left [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], clothed in red with a sword and a helmet, raises his [[caduceus]] or wooden rod towards some wispy gray clouds.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 128–135&lt;/ref&gt;

The interactions between the figures are enigmatic. Zephyrus and Chloris are looking at each other. Flora and Venus look out at the viewer, the Cupid is blindfolded, and Mercury has turned his back on the others, and looks up at the clouds. The central Grace looks towards him, while the other two seem to look at each other. Flora's smile was very unusual in painting at this date.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 138&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  
To the right of centre of the painting, Flora, a flower-crowned female figure stands in a floral-patterned dress scattering flowers that are piled up in a folds of her dress.  She has a slight smile on her face while stepping towards the viewer. The colours of the flowers on her dress and in her hand are pink, red and white.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

To the right of Flora a woman in diaphanous white is being seized from above by Zephyr, a winged male. His cheeks are puffed, his expression intent, and his unnatural complexion separates him from the rest of the figures. The trees around him blow in the direction of his entry, as does the skirt of the woman he is seizing. The drapery of her companion blows in the other direction.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The pastoral scenery is elaborate. There are 500 identified plant species depicted in the painting, with about 190 different flowers,{{sfn|Capretti|2002|p=49}} of which at least 130 can be specifically identified.{{sfn|Fossi|1998|p=5}} The overall appearance, and size, of the painting is similar to that of the [[millefleur]] ("thousand flower") Flemish [[tapestries]] that were popular decorations for palaces at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 123; Ettlingers, 120, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

These tapestries had not caught up by the 1480s with the artistic developments of the Italian Renaissance, and the composition of the painting has aspects that belong to this still Gothic style. The figures are spread in a rough line across the front of the picture space, "set side by side like pearls on a string".&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 122&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that in the setting for which the painting was designed the bottom was about at eye level, or slightly above it, partly explaining "the gently rising plane" on which the figures stand.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The feet of Venus are considerably higher than those of the others, showing she is behind them, but she is at the same scale, if not larger, than the other figures. Overlapping of other figures by Mercury's sword and Chloris' hands shows that they stand slightly in front of the left Grace and Flora respectively, which might not be obvious otherwise, for example from their feet. It has been argued that the flowers do not grow smaller to the rear of the picture space, certainly a feature of the millefleur tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

The costumes of the figures are versions of the dress of contemporary Florence, though the sort of "quasi-theatrical costumes designed for masquerades of the sort that Vasari wrote were invented by Lorenzo de’ Medici for civic festivals and tournaments."&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of an obvious narrative may relate to the world of pageants and ''[[tableau vivant]]s'' as well as typically static Gothic allegories.

==Meaning==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Three Graces in Primavera.jpg|thumb|[[Charites|The Three Graces]]]]
Various interpretations of the figures have been set forth,&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 118–119 gives a spirited quick summary&lt;/ref&gt; but it is generally agreed that at least at one level the painting is "an elaborate mythological [[allegory]] of the burgeoning fertility of the world."{{sfn|Cunningham &amp; Reich|2009|p=282}} It is thought that Botticelli had help devising the composition of the painting and whatever meanings it was intended to contain, as it appears that the painting reflects a deep knowledge of classical literature and philosophy that Botticelli is unlikely to have possessed. Poliziano is usually thought to have been involved in this,&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Marsilio Ficino]], another member of Lorenzo de' Medici's circle and a key figure in Renaissance Neoplatonism, has also often been mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 113–114, 126–127; Ettlingers, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of the painting is a depiction of the progress of the season of spring, reading from right to left. The wind of early Spring blows on the land and brings forth growth and flowers, presided over by Venus, goddess of April, with at the left Mercury, the god of the month of May in an early Roman calendar, chasing away the last clouds before summer.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being part of a sequence over the season, Mercury in dispelling the clouds is acting as the guard of the garden, partly explaining his military dress and his facing out of the picture space. A passage in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' describes him clearing the skies with his caduceus.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 136–137&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive, Neoplatonist, view of the clouds is that they are "the benificent veils through which the splendour of transcendent truth may reach the beholder without destroying him."&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 123–124, 123 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] presides over the garden – an orange grove (a Medici symbol). It is also the [[Garden of the Hesperides]] of classical myth, from which the golden apples used in the [[Judgement of Paris]] came; the [[Hellenistic]] Greeks had decided that these were [[citrus]] fruits, exotic to them.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 126&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Claudian]], no clouds were allowed there.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332&lt;/ref&gt; Venus stands in front of the dark leaves of a [[Myrtus|myrtle]] bush. According to [[Hesiod]], Venus had been born of the sea after the semen of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] had fallen upon the waters. Coming ashore in a shell she had clothed her nakedness in myrtle, and so the plant became sacred to her.{{sfn|Foster &amp; Tudor-Craig|1986|p=44}} Venus appears here in her character as a goddess of marriage, clothed and with her hair modestly covered, as married women were expected to appear in public.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 127–128, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The Three Graces are sisters, and traditionally accompany Venus. In classical art (but not literature) they are normally nude, and typically stand still as they hold hands, but the depiction here is very close to one adapting [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in his ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435), which Botticelli certainly knew.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 130–132; Ettlingers, 120&lt;/ref&gt; From the left they are identified by [[Edgar Wind]] as [[Voluptas]], Castitas, and Pulchritudo (Pleasure, Chastity and Beauty),&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; though other names are found in mythology, and it is noticeable that many writers, including Lightbown and the Ettlingers, refrain from naming Botticelli's Graces at all.
[[File:Pallasetlecentaure.jpg|thumb|Botticelli's ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'' (1482) has been proposed as the companion piece to ''Primavera''.{{sfn|Deimling|2000|p=45}}]]

Cupid's arrow is aimed at the middle Grace, Chastity according to Wind, and the impact of love on chastity, leading to a marriage, features in many interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 133; Wind, 119–121&lt;/ref&gt; Chastity looks towards Mercury, and some interpretations, especially those identifying the figures as modelled on actual individuals, see this couple as one to match Chloris and Zephyrus on the other side of the painting.

In a different interpretation the earthy carnal love represented by Zephyrus to the right is renounced by the central figure of the Graces, who has turned her back to the scene, unconcerned by the threat represented to her by Cupid. Her focus is on Mercury, who himself gazes beyond the canvas at what many believe hung as the companion piece to ''Primavera'': ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', in which "love oriented towards knowledge" (embodied by [[Pallas Athena]]) proves triumphant over lust (symbolized by the [[centaur]]).&lt;ref&gt;Deimling, 45–46.  But Mercury seems clearly to be looking above him, as he works on the clouds.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic identification of the figures is now widely agreed,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 126–140; Ettlingers, 122–124; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; but in the past other names have sometimes been used for the females on the right, who are two stages of the same person in the usual interpretation. The woman in the flowered dress may be called Primavera (a personification of Spring), with Flora the figure pursued by Zephyrus.{{sfn|Steinmann|1901|p=82-84}}&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 116–117. Vasari's "recollection that the picture 'signifies spring' (''dinotando la primavera'')" is blamed for some writers wanting to identify a figure as the personification of Primavera. For [[Kenneth Clark]], 96, Chloris is "Spring"; Ettlingers, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  One scholar suggested in 2011 that the central figure is not Venus at all, but [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kline|first=Jonathan|date=2011|title=Botticelli's "Return of Persephone": On the Source and Subject of the "Primavera"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23076486|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=42|issue=3|pages=665–688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its overt meaning, the painting has been interpreted as an illustration of the ideal of Neoplatonic love popularized among the Medicis and their followers by Marsilio Ficino.{{sfn|Deimling|2000|p=45}} The Neoplatonic philosophers saw Venus as ruling over both earthly and divine love and argued that she was the classical equivalent of the Virgin Mary; this is alluded to by the way she is framed in an altar-like setting that is similar to contemporary images of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Harris &amp; Zucker}}&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332&lt;/ref&gt; Venus' hand gesture of welcome, probably directed to the viewer, is the same as that used by Mary to the [[Archangel Gabriel]] in contemporary paintings of the ''[[Annunciation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 128; Clark, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Punning allusions to Medici names probably include the golden balls of the oranges, recalling those on the Medici coat of arms, the laurel trees at right, for either Lorenzo, and the flames on the costume of both Mercury (for whom they are a regular attribute) and Venus, which are also an attribute of [[Saint Laurence]] (Lorenzo in Italian). Mercury was the god of medicine and "doctors", ''medici'' in Italian. Such puns for the Medici, and in ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'' the Vespucci, run through all Botticelli's mythological paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332–333&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the very many literary sources that may have fed into the painting,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332&lt;/ref&gt; the clearest was first noted in modern times by [[Aby Warburg]] in 1893, in his seminal dissertation on the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 140; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; The group at the right of the painting was inspired by a description by the Roman poet Ovid of the arrival of Spring (''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Book 5, May 2). In this the wood nymph Chloris recounts how her naked charms attracted the first wind of Spring, Zephyr. Zephyr pursued her and as she was ravished, flowers sprang from her mouth and she became transformed into Flora, goddess of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 140&lt;/ref&gt; In Ovid's work the reader is told 'till then the earth had been but of one colour'. From Chloris' name the colour may be guessed to have been green – the Greek word for green is ''khloros'', the root of words like [[chlorophyll]] – and may be why Botticeli painted Zephyr in shades of bluish-green.{{sfn|Foster &amp; Tudor-Craig|1986|p=45}}

Other specific elements may have been derived from a poem by [[Poliziano]].{{sfn|Steinmann|1901|p=80}} As Poliziano's poem, "Rusticus", was published in 1483 and the painting is generally held to have been completed by around 1482,{{sfn|Fossi|1998|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, captions to his pictures&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars have argued that the influence was reversed,{{sfn|Cheney|1985|p=52}} bearing in mind that Poliziano is generally thought to have helped with devising the allegory in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt;

Another inspiration for the painting seems to have been the poem by Lucretius "[[De rerum natura]]", which includes the lines, "Spring-time and Venus come, and Venus' boy, / The winged harbinger, steps on before, / And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora, / Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all / With colors and with odors excellent."{{sfn|Deimling|2000|p=43}}{{sfn|Lucretius}}&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 137, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a plethora of literary sources, most of them probably not known directly by Botticelli, or set out for him by advisors, the visual sources are a different matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But where, in the visual rather than the literary sense, did the vision come from? That is the mystery of genius.  From antique sarcophagi, from a few gems and reliefs, and perhaps some fragments of [[Aretine ware]]; from those drawings of classical remains by contemporary artists which were circulated in the Florentine workshops, like the architects' pattern-books of the 18th century; from such scanty and mediocre material, Botticelli has created one of the most personal evocations of physical beauty in the whole of art, the Three Graces of the ''Primavera''. ([[Kenneth Clark]])&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli 041.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] may have been modeled after [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]],{{sfn|Fisher|2011|p=12}} or possibly his cousin [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453–1478)|Giuliano de' Medici]].{{sfn|Heyl|1912|p=89-90}}]]
The origin of the painting is unclear. Botticelli was away in Rome for many months in 1481/82, painting in the [[Sistine Chapel]], and suggested dates are in recent years mostly later than this, but still sometimes before. Thinking has been somewhat changed by the publication in 1975 of an inventory from 1499 of the collection of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 142; [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/5allegor/20pallas.html Inventory publication]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1499 inventory records it hanging in the city palace of [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463–1503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] and his brother [[Giovanni il Popolano|Giovanni "Il Popolano"]]. They were the cousins of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] ("Lorenzo il Magnifico"), who was effectively the ruler of Florence, and after their father's early death had been his wards.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; It hung over a large ''lettuccio'', an elaborate piece of furniture including a raised base, a seat and a backboard, probably topped with a [[cornice]]. The bottom of the painting was probably at about the viewer's eye-level, so rather higher than it is hung today.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same room was Botticelli's ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', and also a large [[tondo (art)|tondo]] with the ''Virgin and Child''. The tondo is now unidentified, but is a type of painting especially associated with Botticelli. This was given the highest value of the three paintings, at 180 lire. A further inventory of 1503 records that the ''Primavera'' had a large white frame.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of his ''Life of Botticelli'', published in 1550, Giorgio Vasari said that he had seen this painting, and the ''[[Birth of Venus]]'', hanging in the Medici country [[Villa di Castello]]. Before the inventory was known it was usually believed that both paintings were made for the villa, probably soon after it was acquired in 1477, either commissioned by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco or perhaps given to him by his older cousin and guardian [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. Rather oddly, Vasari says both paintings contained female nudes, which is not strictly the case here.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 142; Vasari, 148&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Oberhausen - Gasometer - Der schöne Schein - Primavera (Botticelli) 03 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Chloris]] and [[Zephyrus]]]]
Most scholars now connect the painting to the marriage of [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]]. Paintings and furniture were often given as presents celebrating weddings. The marriage was on 19 July 1482, but had been postponed after the death of the elder Lorenzo's mother on 25 March. It was originally planned for May.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; Recent datings tend to prefer the early 1480s, after Botticelli's return from Rome, suggesting it was directly commissioned in connection with this wedding, a view supported by many.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

Another older theory, assuming an early date, suggests the older Lorenzo commissioned the portrait to celebrate the birth of his nephew [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici]] (who later became [[Pope]]), but changed his mind after the assassination of Giulo's father, his brother [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453–1478)|Giuliano]] in 1478, having it instead completed as a wedding gift for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco.{{sfn|Capretti|2002|p=48}}&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

It is frequently suggested that Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco is the model for Mercury in the portrait, and his bride Semirande represented as Flora (or Venus).{{sfn|Fisher|2011|p=12}} In older theories, placing the painting in the 1470s, it was proposed that the model for Venus was [[Simonetta Vespucci]], wife of Marco Vespucci and according to popular legend the mistress of Giuliano de' Medici (who is also sometimes said to have been the model for Mercury);{{sfn|Heyl|1912|p=89-90}} these identifications largely depend on an early date, in the 1470s, as both were dead by 1478. Simonetta was the aunt of Lorenzo's bride Semirande.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the many interpretations of the painting, [[Leopold Ettlinger]] includes "descending to the ludricous – a Wagnerian pantomime enacted in memory of the murdered Giuliano de' Medici and his beloved Simonetta Vespucci with the Germanic Norns disguised as the Mediterranean Graces."&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever this painting and the ''Birth of Venus'' were united at Castello, they have remained together ever since. They stayed in Castello until 1815, when they were transferred to the Uffizi. For some years until 1919 they were kept in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], another government museum in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 115–118&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1919, it has hung in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. During the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] of World War Two, the picture was moved to Montegufoni Castle about ten miles south west of Florence to protect it from wartime bombing.{{sfn|Healey|2011}}

It was returned to the Uffizi Gallery where it remains to the present day. In 1978, the painting was [[restoration (art)|restored]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 143–145&lt;/ref&gt; The work has darkened considerably over the course of time.{{sfn|Steinmann|1901|p=80}}

==History==
{{Main|Radio in Ireland}}
===Background===
After the [[Irish Free State]] was formed and the [[Irish Civil War]] was concluded, the new state set up a single radio channel named [[2RN]] in 1926, launched by [[Douglas Hyde]]. This was ran by the [[Irish Post Office]] and was not a private enterprise. The radio program, operating out of [[Dublin]], largely served the [[Anglophone]] population and at best reached as far as [[County Tipperary]]; a situation which did not change until more powerful transmitters were adopted in the 1930s at [[Athlone]].&lt;ref name="wat97"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/5703|title=A History of Irish Language Broadcasting: National Ideology, Commercial Interest and Minority Rights|author=Iarfhlaith Watson|date=1997|publisher=UCD Press|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved in setting up 2RN and [[J. J. Walsh]] ([[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]] from 1923 to 1927) discussed the possibility of setting up an [[Irish-language]] radio service for the ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' community and more widely were sympathetic to Irish culture which included language revival, but the project was frustrated due to economic reasons and came to little.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0228/856014-raidio-na-gaeltachta/|title=Local Radio Service at Last for An Gaeltacht 1972|author=Féach|date= 6 March 1972|publisher= RTÉ Archives|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Éamon de Valera.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Éamon de Valera]], [[Taoiseach]] and later [[President of Ireland]], supported the idea of establishing a ''Gaeltacht'' radio station.]]
As the Irish language was valued as part of Irish national identity and a marker of the young state's independence, there were some broadcasts in the language such as ''Nuacht'' and ''Tréimhseachán Teann'' (shows with English equivalents), the latter written by [[Séamus Ó Néill]] and [[Ciarán Ó Nualláin]] (brother of [[Brian Ó Nualláin]]). These featured alongside focus on [[Gaelic games]], [[Irish traditional music]] and [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic religious]] programming as part of a general [[nation-building]] content focus. In the 1940s, there were shows which sought to proactively teach the language such as ''Is Your Irish Rusty?'' and ''Listen and Learn''.&lt;ref name="wat"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/5633/Watson_2002_Irish_Language_Broadcasting._Media_Culture_&amp;_Society.pdf?sequence=1|title=Irish-language broadcasting: history, ideology and identity|author=Iarfhlaith Watson|date= 2002|publisher=Sage Publications|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish-language programming suffered from a shortage of materials and for audience figures. In 1943, [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] – whose wife [[Sinéad Ní Fhlannagáin]] was a keen ''[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]'' activist – promoted the idea of a ''Gaeltacht'' station again, but there was no breakthrough.&lt;ref name="rte"/&gt; By this time, 2RN had become ''[[Radio Éireann]]'' and still only had [[RTÉ Radio 1|one channel]], with limited broadcasting hours, often in competition for listeners with [[BBC Radio]] and [[Radio Luxembourg]].

In the 1950s, a general [[liberalisation]] and [[commercialisation]], indeed [[Americanisation]] began to occur in Ireland, as a push was made to move Ireland from a rural-agrarian society with a protectionist cultural policy, towards a [[market economy]] basis, with [[supply and demand]] the primarily basis of public communications. This brought Ireland into line culturally with the [[Western powers]] and eventually paved the way for its entrance into the [[European Economic Community]]. In 1960, [[RTÉ]] was established and direct control of communications moved from a government ministry position to a non-governmental [[Director-General of RTÉ|RTÉ Director-General]] position, first filled by the American, Edward Roth. Previous cultural policies, including broadcasting in Irish, reduced in percentage, as ratings and profit became key. Eventually, in the late 1960s, a civil rights movement in the ''Gaeltacht'', particularly Conamara emerged, seeking development and services for Irish-speakers, including a radio service. Out of the {{lang|ga|[[Gluaiseacht Chearta Siabhialta na Gaeltachta]]}}'s advocacy came the [[Irish pirate radio|pirate radio]] station ''[[Saor Raidió Chonamara]]'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/4561/OhIfearnain_2000_Irish.pdf;sequence=1|title=Irish Language Broadcast Media: The Interaction of State Language Policy, Broadcasters and their Audiences|author=Tadhg Ó hIfearnáin |date= 2000|publisher=University of Limerick|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the subsequent discourse for Irish-language and ''Gaeltacht'' issues as a [[civil rights]] and [[minority rights]] imperative.

===Foundation===
[[File:Raidío na Gaeltachta, Casla - geograph.org.uk - 1269978.jpg|thumb|240px|Raidió na Gaeltachta headquarters in [[Casla]], [[County Galway]]. It is located in the [[Conamara]] Gaeltacht.]]
[[Gerry Collins (politician)|Gerry Collins]], the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, announced in the ''[[Dáil]]'' in February 1971 that a new radio station for the ''Gaeltacht'' would be created. ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' began broadcasting at 3pm on 2 April 1972 as part of an [[Easter Sunday]] programming. During the very first broadcast, the main station at [[Casla]], [[County Galway]] was not yet finished and the studios in [[County Kerry]] and [[County Donegal]] were still in construction, so it was broadcast from [[Galway]]. The first ''Ceannaire'' (Controller) Pádraic Ó Raghallaigh opened the show, which was followed by a recording from President Éamon de Valera. A recording of [[Seán Ó Riada]]'s Irish-language [[Mass (music)|Mass]], ''Ceol an Aifrinn'' (which includes the hymn ''[[Ag Críost an Síol]]'') from the ''Seipéal Mhic Dara'' at [[Carraroe]] was also played.

At foundation, the station began with a staff of seven, including six former teachers and a businessman: Ó Raghallaigh, Breandán Feiritéar, Timlín Ó Cearnaigh, Máirtín Ó Fátharta, Seán Ó Tuairisg, Maidhc P. Ó Conaola, [[Mícheál Ó Sé]] and Feardorcha Ó Colla.&lt;ref name="it"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/raidi%C3%B3-r%C3%A9alteanna-raidi%C3%B3-na-gaeltachta-marks-40-years-1.493375|title=Raidió réalteanna: Raidió na Gaeltachta marks 40 years|author=Lorna Siggins|date= 2 April 2012|publisher= [[Irish Times]]|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' broadcast for only two hours a day&lt;ref name="gp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaelport.com/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=7887|title=RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta celebrates 40 years on the air|author=|date= 3 April 2012|publisher= Gaelport|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was only available in or near the three largest ''Gaeltacht'' districts. The local studio at [[Derrybeg]] in [[Gweedore]], County Donegal, under the direction of Ulstermen, Ó Cearnaigh and Ó Colla, aided the native Irish music scene there. In the 1970s, ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' gave early coverage to [[Clannad]] and [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]] (later the singer for [[Altan (band)|Altan]]). These groups would gain popularity not only in Ireland, but on the international stage, selling millions of records during the 1980s especially.&lt;ref name="it"/&gt; The station was dedicated to bringing the listener general news, both national and international (which, in the [[The Troubles|context]] of the times meant Donegal reporters with names ''as Gaeilge'' having to cross [[British Army]] checkpoints into [[Northern Ireland]]), as well as [[Gaelic sports]] coverage and more localised affairs of significance to the community in the ''Gaeltacht''.&lt;ref name="it"/&gt;

===Recent===
Following the putting in place of a fourth RTÉ national radio transmitter network (used for [[RTÉ lyric fm]]), the station expanded to 24 hours from 1 October 2001. Listenership figures are hard to come by, as the station does not make payments to be included covered in the [[Joint National Listenership Research|JNLR]] listenership survey. It is claimed that – as it doesn't carry advertising (the only Irish radio station not to do so) – paying to be included in a survey organised mainly for the benefit of the Irish advertising industry would be a pointless waste of scarce funds. It is generally believed that listenership is high amongst fluent Irish speakers but its appeal among those learning the language is not as high as [[TG4]] because (despite being available nationally) it is widely perceived as being oriented (as its name suggests) towards [[Gaeltacht]] residents.

For many years it was the only Irish-language broadcaster in the country; in recent years it has been joined by a television service, Telefís na Gaeilge ([[TG4]]), and by regional community radio stations: [[Raidió na Life]] in Dublin, [[Raidió Fáilte]] in Belfast and [[Raidió Rí-Rá]].

In March 2005, RTÉ announced that RnaG would allow songs with English lyrics to be played between 21:00 and 01:00, as part of a new popular music strand. In April 2005, it was announced that the name of this strand would be ''Anocht FM'' (Tonight FM). On weeknights the strand includes a new programme, ''Géill Slí'' (Give Way), as well as the existing long-running ''An Taobh Tuathail'' slot. ''Anocht FM'' will also be broadcast at weekends with different programmes. The new service was launched on 2 May 2005. The first track with English-language lyrics played was ''[[Blister in the Sun]]'' by the [[Violent Femmes]], chosen by public vote.

==Locations==
RnaG is based in [[Casla]], Co. Galway. It also has studios at [[Gaoth Dobhair]] (''Gweedore''), Co. Donegal; [[Ballynagall|Baile na nGall]] in [[Ard na Caithne]], Co. Kerry; [[Castlebar]], Co. Mayo; with a smaller studio in [[An Rinn]], County Waterford and the [[RTÉ Radio Centre]] in [[Dublin]]. The station is operated by RTÉ, but has a separate advisory council, Comhairle Raidió na Gaeltachta, which is appointed by the RTÉ Authority. RTÉ also appoints the Ceannaire, or Controller, of RnaG, who has day-to-day responsibility for the service.

===Funding===
The station received a total budget of €11.3 million for 2015.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Audience===
According to the 2011 [[Joint National Listenership Research|JNLR]] survey, RnaG has a weekly listenership of 100,000 which equates to a 3% market share.

This is similar to Welsh-language [[BBC Radio Cymru]], which has 116,000 listeners and a 2.4% share.&lt;ref&gt;https://static.rasset.ie/documents/about/18280-rte-languagescheme-bilingual-eng-v4-screen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-33794230|title=BBC Cymru Wales loses listeners|first=Huw|last=Thomas|date=6 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reduction print''' is a print of a large-size format film converted to a smaller size format (for example, a 70mm print converted to 35mm). Often this is necessary because not all theatres have a screen of the size required to show a film in large format, or indeed the projection equipment. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of some screens in [[multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] theatres. In former days, it was true of the [[neighbourhood theatre]]s located outside of [[downtown]] areas.

Conversely, a "blow-up print" is a regular format film converted to larger size (i.e., 35mm to 70mm). This was once often done so that "regular-sized" film would seem even more impressive on screens such as the ones in [[Cinerama]] theatres. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==relief printing==
In [[relief print]]ing, a reduction print is a multicolour print in which the separate colours printed from the same block at different stages. Usually, the lightest colour of the design is printed first, then the block is "reduced" by carving to the areas which the artist wants to print the second colour from, and so forth. The disadvantage of reduction printing as opposed to printing from multiple blocks is that once the first colour is printed, the matrix for it is destroyed in the creation of the printing matrix for the second colour. It is impossible to undo mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ross | first = John |author2=Clare Romano  | title = The Complete Printmaker | publisher = Free Press | date = 1991 | location = | pages = | isbn = 0-02-927372-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SYZ conjecture''' is an attempt to understand the [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]] conjecture, an issue in theoretical physics and mathematics. The original conjecture was proposed in a paper by [[Andrew Strominger|Strominger]], [[Shing-Tung Yau|Yau]], and [[Eric Zaslow|Zaslow]], entitled "Mirror Symmetry is ''T''-duality".&lt;ref name="SYZ"&gt;{{Citation |last=Strominger |first=Andrew |last2=Yau |first2=Shing-Tung |last3=Zaslow |first3=Eric |year=1996 |title=Mirror symmetry is ''T''-duality |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=479 |issue=1–2 |pages=243–259 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(96)00434-8 |arxiv = hep-th/9606040 |bibcode = 1996NuPhB.479..243S }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[homological mirror symmetry| homological mirror symmetry conjecture]], it is one of the most explored tools applied to understand mirror symmetry in mathematical terms. While the homological mirror symmetry is based on [[homological algebra]], the SYZ conjecture is a geometrical realization of mirror symmetry.

== Formulation ==
In [[string theory]], mirror symmetry relates [[type IIA]] and [[type IIB]] theories. It predicts that the effective field theory of type IIA and type IIB should be the same if the two theories are compactified on mirror pair manifolds.

The SYZ conjecture uses this fact to realize mirror symmetry. It starts from considering [[BPS state]]s of type IIA theories compactified on ''X'', especially [[0-brane]]s that have [[moduli space]] ''X''. It is known that all of the BPS states of type IIB theories compactified on ''Y'' are [[3-brane]]s. Therefore, mirror symmetry will map 0-branes of type IIA theories into a subset of 3-branes of type IIB theories.

By considering [[supersymmetric]] conditions, it has been shown that these 3-branes should be [[special Lagrangian submanifold]]s.&lt;ref name="BBS"&gt;{{Citation |last=Becker |first=Katrin |last2=Becker |first2=Melanie |last3=Strominger |first3=Andrew |year=1995 |title=Fivebranes, membranes and non-perturbative string theory |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=456 |issue=1–2 |pages=130–152 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(95)00487-1 |arxiv = hep-th/9507158 |bibcode = 1995NuPhB.456..130B }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;{{Citation |last=Harvey |first=Reese |last2=Lawson |first2=H. Blaine, Jr. |year=1982 |title=Calibrated geometries |journal=Acta Mathematica |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=47–157 |doi=10.1007/BF02392726 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[T-duality]] does the same transformation in this case, thus "mirror symmetry is T-duality".

{{One source|date=April 2018}}
A '''screen test''' is a method of determining the suitability of an [[actor]] or [[actress]] for performing on [[film]] or in a particular role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/screen+test|title=Definition of SCREEN TEST|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer is generally given a scene, or selected lines and actions, and instructed to perform in front of a camera to see if they are suitable. The developed film is later evaluated by the relevant production personnel such as the casting director and the director. The actor may be asked to bring a prepared monologue or alternatively, the actor may be given a script to read at sight ("cold reading"). In some cases, the actor may be asked to read a scene, in which another performer reads the lines of another character.

==Types==
Screen tests can also be used to judge the suitability of [[costume]], [[make-up]] and other details, but these are generally called costume or make-up tests. Different types of actors can have different tasks for each individual test. For example, a lead for a musical theater-type movie could be requested to sing a popular song or learn a dance routine. Screen tests are routinely used in films and commercials. They are also used for short films.

International actors such as [[Bruce Lee]] were given screen tests to demonstrate that they are sufficiently articulate in the relevant language. In Lee's case, for the role of Kato in ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', he was asked to converse about [[Chinese culture]] in [[English language|English]] to judge his grasp of the language, then to demonstrate some [[martial arts]] moves to show off his physical skills.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

{{Sociology}}
In [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[linguistics]], '''structuralism''' is the methodology that implies elements of human culture must be understood by way of their relationship to a broader, overarching system or structure. It works to uncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel. Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], structuralism is "the belief of alien life that is not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".&lt;ref name="Blackburn"&gt;Blackburn, Simon (2008). ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'', second edition revised. Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954143-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralism in Europe developed in the early 1900s, in the [[structural linguistics]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the subsequent [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]],&lt;ref name=d170&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]]&lt;ref name="d170" /&gt; and [[The Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen]] schools of linguistics. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when structural linguistics was facing serious challenges from the likes of [[Noam Chomsky]] and thus fading in importance, an array of scholars in the [[humanities]] borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study. French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] was arguably the first such scholar, sparking a widespread interest in structuralism.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;

The structuralist mode of reasoning has been applied in a diverse range of fields, including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[literary criticism]], [[structuralist economics|economics]] and [[structuralism (architecture)|architecture]]. The most prominent thinkers associated with structuralism include [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], linguist [[Roman Jakobson]], and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]]. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed to be the heir apparent to [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://literariness.wordpress.com/2016/03/20/structuralism/|title=Structuralism|last=Mambrol|first=Nasrullah|date=2016-03-20|website=Literary Theory and Criticism Notes|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly French intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]], and the literary critic [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="d170"/&gt; Though elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as [[post-structuralists]]. In the 1970s, structuralism was criticized for its rigidity and [[ahistoricism]]. Despite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Lacan, continue to assert an influence on [[continental philosophy]] and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;John Sturrock (1979), ''Structuralism and since: from Lévi Strauss to Derrida'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The term "structuralism" is a related term that describes a particular philosophical/literary movement or moment. The term appeared in the works of [[French people|French]] [[anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and gave rise in [[France]] to the "structuralist movement," which influenced the thinking of other writers such as [[Louis Althusser]], the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Nicos Poulantzas]], most of whom disavowed themselves as being a part of this movement.
 
The origins of structuralism connect with the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] on [[linguistics]], along with the linguistics of the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]] and [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]] schools. In brief, Saussure's structural linguistics propounded three related concepts.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;
 
# Saussure argued for a distinction between ''langue'' (an idealized abstraction of language) and ''parole'' (language as actually used in daily life). He argued that the "sign" was composed of both a ''signified'', an abstract concept or idea, and a "signifier", the perceived sound/visual image.
# Because different languages have different words to describe the same objects or concepts, there is no intrinsic reason why a specific sign is used to express a given signifier. It is thus "arbitrary".
# Signs thus gain their meaning from their relationships and contrasts with other signs. As he wrote, "in language, there are only differences 'without positive terms.'"&lt;ref&gt;F. de Saussure, ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de linguistique generale]]'', published by [[Charles Bally|C. Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye|A. Sechehaye]] (Paris: Payot, 1916); English translation by Wade Baskin, Course in General Linguistics (New York: Philosophical Library, 1959), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of structuralism would argue that a specific domain of culture may be understood by means of a structure—modelled on language—that is distinct both from the organizations of reality and those of ideas or the imagination—the "third order".&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacan's [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, the structural order of "[[the Symbolic]]" is distinguished both from "[[the Real]]" and "[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]]"; similarly, in Althusser's [[Structural Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the structural order of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinct both from the actual, real agents involved in its relations and from the [[Ideology|ideological]] forms in which those relations are understood.

Blending Freud and Saussure, the French (post)structuralist [[Jacques Lacan]] applied structuralism to [[psychoanalysis]] and, in a different way, [[Jean Piaget]] applied structuralism to the study of [[psychology]]. But Jean Piaget, who would better define himself as [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]], considers structuralism as "a method and not a doctrine" because for him "there exists no structure without a construction, abstract or genetic".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Piaget, ''Le structuralisme'', ed. PUF, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the French theorist [[Louis Althusser]] is often associated with a brand of structural [[Social theory|social analysis]] which helped give rise to "[[structural Marxism]]", such association was contested by Althusser himself in the Italian foreword to the second edition of ''[[Reading Capital]]''. In this foreword Althusser states the following:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite the precautions we took to distinguish ourselves from the 'structuralist' ideology ..., despite the decisive intervention of categories foreign to 'structuralism' ..., the terminology we employed was too close in many respects to the 'structuralist' terminology not to give rise to an ambiguity. With a very few exceptions ... our interpretation of Marx has generally been recognized and judged, in homage to the current fashion, as 'structuralist'... We believe that despite the terminological ambiguity, the profound tendency of our texts was not attached to the 'structuralist' ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Althusser and [[Étienne Balibar]]. ''Reading Capital'' trans. Ben Brewster. London: NLB, 1970. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later development, [[Feminist theory|feminist theorist]] [[Alison Assiter]] enumerated four ideas that she says are common to the various forms of structuralism. First, that a structure determines the position of each element of a whole. Second, that every system has a structure. Third, structural laws deal with co-existence rather than change. Fourth, structures are the "real things" that lie beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Assiter | first = Alison | title = Althusser and structuralism | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 272–296 | date = June 1984  | url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/BJS/pastVolumes/vol35/index284.aspx | ref = harv | doi = 10.2307/590235| jstor = 590235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In linguistics== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Charles F. Hockett]] --&gt;
{{See also|Structural linguistics}}

In ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' the analysis focuses not on the ''use'' of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|parole]]''", or speech), but rather on the underlying [[system]] of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|langue]]''"). This approach examines how the elements of language relate to each other in the present, [[synchronic analysis|synchronically]] rather than [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Saussure argued that [[Sign (linguistics)|linguistic signs]] were composed of two parts:

# a "signifier" (the "sound pattern" of a word, either in mental projection—as when one silently recites lines from signage, a poem to one's self—or in actual, any kind of text, physical realization as part of a [[speech act]])
# a "signified" (the concept or meaning of the word)

This was quite different from previous approaches that focused on the relationship between words and the things in the world that they designate.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Suryo and Talbot Roosevelt, ''Landmarks in Linguistic Thought'', 1st ed. [1989], pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key notions in structural linguistics include [[paradigm]], syntagm, and value (though these notions were not fully developed in Saussure's thought). A structural "idealism" is a class of linguistic units ([[lexemes]], [[morphemes]] or even [[Pattern language|constructions]]) that are possible in a certain position in a given linguistic environment (such as a given sentence), which is called the "syntagm". The different functional role of each of these members of the paradigm is called "value" (''{{lang|fr|valeur}}'' in [[French language|French]]).

Saussure's ''Course'' influenced many linguists between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the United States, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] developed his own version of structural linguistics, as did [[Louis Hjelmslev]] in Denmark and [[Alf Sommerfelt]] in Norway. In France [[Antoine Meillet]] and [[Émile Benveniste]] continued Saussure's project, and members of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]] of linguistics such as [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] conducted research that would be greatly influential. However, by the 1950s Saussure's linguistic concepts were under heavy criticism and were soon largely abandoned by practicing linguists: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to [[Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The clearest and most important example of Prague school structuralism lies in [[phonemics]]. Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur in a language, the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed in terms of a series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct [[phonemes]] because there are cases ([[minimal pair]]s) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of [[Contrastive distribution|contrastive features]] also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in [[English language|English]] is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. [[Phonology]] would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism in a number of different fields.

==In anthropology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Social anthropology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Structural anthropology}}

According to structural theory in anthropology and social anthropology, [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] is produced and reproduced within a culture through various practices, phenomena and activities that serve as systems of signification. A structuralist approach may study activities as diverse as food-preparation and serving rituals, religious rites, games, literary and non-literary texts, and other forms of entertainment to discover the deep structures by which meaning is produced and reproduced within the culture. For example, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] analysed in the 1950s cultural phenomena including mythology, kinship (the [[alliance theory]] and the [[incest taboo]]), and food preparation. In addition to these studies, he produced more linguistically focused writings in which he applied Saussure's distinction between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his search for the fundamental structures of the human mind, arguing that the structures that form the "deep grammar" of society originate in the mind and operate in people unconsciously. Lévi-Strauss took inspiration from [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UoXZ8aIeZpgC&amp;dq= ''History of Structuralism: Volume 1: The Rising Sign, 1945-1966''], University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concept used in structural anthropology came from the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague school of linguistics]], where [[Roman Jakobson]] and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features (such as voiceless vs. voiced). Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the universal structures of the mind, which he held to operate based on pairs of [[binary opposition]]s such as hot-cold, male-female, culture-nature, cooked-raw, or marriageable vs. tabooed women.

A third influence came from [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), who had written on gift-exchange systems. Based on Mauss, for instance, Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship systems are based on the exchange of women between groups (a position known as 'alliance theory') as opposed to the 'descent'-based theory described by [[Edward Evans-Pritchard]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]. While replacing Marcel Mauss at his ''[[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]]'' chair, Lévi-Strauss' writing became widely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and gave rise to the term "structuralism" itself.

In Britain, authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] were highly influenced by structuralism. Authors such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Emmanuel Terray]] combined [[Marxism]] with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[James Boon]] built on structuralism to provide their own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as [[Eric Wolf]] argued that [[political economy]] and [[colonialism]] should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which [[Sherry Ortner]] has referred to as '[[practice theory]]'.

Some anthropological theorists, however, while finding considerable fault with Lévi-Strauss's version of structuralism, did not turn away from a fundamental structural basis for human culture. The [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] group for instance argued that some kind of structural foundation for culture must exist because all humans inherit the same system of brain structures. They proposed a kind of [[neuroanthropology]] which would lay the foundations for a more complete scientific account of cultural similarity and variation by requiring an integration of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[neuroscience]]—a program that theorists such as [[Victor Turner]] also embraced.

== In literary theory and criticism ==
{{Main|Semiotic literary criticism}}
In [[literary theory]], structuralist criticism relates literary texts to a larger structure, which may be a particular [[genre]], a range of [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] connections, a model of a universal [[narrative structure]], or a system of recurrent patterns or motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P. (2002), 'Structuralism', Beginning theory: an introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester, pp. 39–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Slavutin, [[Vladimir Pimonov]]: ‘Plot Structure’. Flinta - Nauka, Moscow 2018&lt;/ref&gt;Structuralism argues that there must be a structure in every text, which explains why it is easier for experienced readers than for non-experienced readers to interpret a text. Hence, everything that is written seems to be governed by specific rules, or a "grammar of literature", that one learns in educational institutions and that are to be unmasked.&lt;ref&gt;Selden, Raman / Widdowson, Peter / Brooker, Peter: ''A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory'' Fifth Edition. Harlow: 2005. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential problem of structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive, as scholar [[Catherine Belsey]] puts it: "the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference."&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey|Belsey, Catherine]]. "Literature, History, Politics". Literature and History 9 (1983): 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' did not write anything "really" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a "formula" with a symbolic operator between them would be "Boy '''+''' Girl") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other ("Boy's Group '''-''' Girl's Group" or "Opposing forces") and conflict is resolved by their death. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two ''friendly'' families ("Boy's Family '''+''' Girl's Family") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other ("Boy '''-''' Girl") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed.

Structuralistic literary criticism argues that the "literary banter of a text" can lie only in new structure, rather than in the specifics of character development and voice in which that structure is expressed. Literary structuralism often follows the lead of [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in seeking out basic deep elements in stories, [[Mythology|myths]], and more recently, anecdotes, which are combined in various ways to produce the many versions of the ur-story or ur-myth.

There is considerable similarity between structural literary theory and [[Northrop Frye]]'s archetypal criticism, which is also indebted to the anthropological study of myths. Some critics have also tried to apply the theory to individual works, but the effort to find unique structures in individual literary works runs counter to the structuralist program and has an affinity with [[New Criticism]].

== History and background ==
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, [[existentialism]], such as that propounded by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], was the dominant European intellectual movement. Structuralism rose to prominence in France in the wake of existentialism, particularly in the 1960s. The initial popularity of structuralism in France led to its spread across the globe.

Structuralism rejected the concept of human freedom and choice and focused instead on the way that human experience and thus, behaviour, is determined by various structures. The most important initial work on this score was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s 1949 volume ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the [[The New School|New School]] in [[New York City|New York]] during [[World War II|WWII]] and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism as well as the American [[anthropology|anthropological]] tradition. In ''Elementary Structures'' he examined [[kinship]] systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of a few basic kinship structures. In the late 1950s he published ''[[Structural Anthropology]]'', a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.

By the early 1960s structuralism as a movement was coming into its own and some believed that it offered a single unified approach to human life that would embrace all disciplines. [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] focused on how structuralism could be applied to [[literature]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

The so-called "Gang of Four" of structuralism was Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, Barthes, and Foucault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthumref.libguides.com/content.php?pid=111224&amp;sid=837742 Post-Structuralism – LibGuides]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

== Interpretations and general criticisms ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Philip Pettit]], [[Paul Ricœur]] and [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] --&gt;
Structuralism is less popular today than other approaches, such as [[post-structuralism]] and [[deconstruction]]. Structuralism has often been criticized for being ahistorical and for favouring deterministic structural forces over the ability of people to act. As the political turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s (and particularly the student uprisings of May 1968) began affecting academia, issues of power and political struggle moved to the center of people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Marshall (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwDR3oSoWWAC&amp;dq= ''Poststructuralism, Philosophy, Pedagogy''], Springer, 2004, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[deconstruction]]—and its emphasis on the fundamental ambiguity of language rather than its crystalline logical structure—became popular. By the end of the century structuralism was seen as an historically important school of thought, but the movements that it spawned, rather than structuralism itself, commanded attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Finlayson]] and Jeremy Valentine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQMQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''Politics and post-structuralism: an introduction''], Edinburgh University Press, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several social thinkers and academics have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it ''in toto''. The French [[hermeneutic]] philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]] (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for constantly overstepping the limits of validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as "a [[Kantianism]] without a [[transcendental subject]]".&lt;ref&gt;P. Ricœur. (2004), ''The Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics'' (originally published in French in 1969 as ''Le conflit des interprétations: Essais d’herméneutique''). Continuum, pp. 49, 78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Adam Kuper]] (1973) argued that "'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement and some of its adherents felt that they formed a [[secret society]] of the seeing in a world of the blind. Conversion was not just a matter of accepting a new paradigm. It was, almost, a question of salvation."&lt;ref&gt;Kuper, Adam (1973), ''Anthropologists and Anthropology: The British School 1922–72'', Penguin, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Noel Pettit]] (1975) called for an abandoning of "the [[Positivism|positivist]] dream which Lévi-Strauss dreamed for [[semiology]]" arguing that semiology is not to be placed among the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, Philip (1975), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ5n3czwdZQC&amp;dq= ''The Concept of Structuralism: A Critical Analysis''], University of California Press, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (1975) criticized structuralism as failing to explain [[Symbolic system|symbolic mediation]] in the social world;&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1987), ''The Imaginary Institution of Society'' (originally published in French in 1975 as ''L'institution imaginaire de la société''). Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; he viewed structuralism as a variation on the "[[Rationalism|logicist]]"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; theme, and he argued that, contrary to what structuralists advocate, language—and symbolic systems in general—cannot be reduced to logical organizations on the basis of the [[Two-valued logic|binary logic]] of [[Square of opposition|oppositions]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1997), ''The Imaginary: Creation in the Social-Historical Domain''. In: ''World in Fragments''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critical theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] (1985) accused structuralists, such as Foucault, of being positivists; he remarked that while Foucault is not an ordinary positivist, he nevertheless paradoxically uses the tools of science to criticize science&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (originally published in German in 1985 as ''Der Philosophische Diskurs der Moderne''), MIT Press, 1990, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Performative contradiction#Usage in philosophy|Performative contradiction]]'' and ''[[Foucault–Habermas debate]]''). Sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1993) is another notable critic; while Giddens draws on a range of structuralist themes in his theorizing, he dismisses the structuralist view that the reproduction of [[social system]]s is merely "a mechanical outcome".&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1993), ''New rules of sociological method: A positive critique of interpretative sociologies.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symphony No. 6''' by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] was composed in [[Hoy]] during the first half of 1996, and was premiered on 22 June of the same year in the Phoenix Cinema, [[Kirkwall]], as part of the twentieth [[St Magnus Festival]], [[Orkney]], by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by the composer. The work was written with specific members of the RPO in mind, and is dedicated to the memory of the poet [[George Mackay Brown]], who died on the day the symphony was completed.

==Character and materials==
The symphony sets out at the beginning from a slow [[Indigenous Australians|Australian aboriginal]] tune, as reworked in Davies's ''Time and the Raven'', composed the previous year, and returns to it at the end. Over the course of the symphony this theme is subjected to continual transformations {{harv|Davies|1996}}. As with many of Davies's works from the time of the First Symphony onward, the Sixth Symphony establishes its own set of harmonic rules, with its own "tonics" and "dominants" {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=37}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes (2nd doubling alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, five percussionists (playing glockenspiel, crotales, marimba, two wood blocks, tambourine, side drum, two bass drums, two suspended cymbals, crash cymbals, rain sticks), harp, celesta, and strings.

==Analysis==
The symphony is in three movements:
# Adagio – Allegro
# Adagio non troppo – Allegro
# Adagio – più animato
After the presentation of the slow theme as an introduction, the first movement becomes a "[[scherzo]] masquerading as a [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]]" {{harv|Davies|1996|loc=4}}. The opening Aboriginal-derived theme is clearly centred on E, and after wandering into other areas, the movement settles back onto E at the end, with one of the secondary pitches, B, above it {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=37}}.

The second movement reproduces the pattern of the first in many respects: a slow introduction, followed by faster music over a slower-moving background, as a sonata-allegro masquerading as a scherzo—the reverse of the first movement's disguise {{harv|Davies|1996|loc=4}}. The initial tonality once again focusses on E, but soon gives way to B and a collection of minor-third related centres: D, F and G{{Music|sharp}}. Later, the tonality shifts to B, D, and F and the movement closes with a violent passage successively centred on B, F, and finally D {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=37}}.

After two fast movements the finale is essentially a slow one. Like the other two, it begins with an introduction, only briefer this time, followed by transformations now attempting to reconcile everything from the diverse elements of the first and second movements {{harv|Davies|1996|loc=5}}. This synthesis is reflected in the tonalities. When the Aboriginal theme returns at letter U, it is supported by a timpani tattoo, first on B, then on F, then alternating D, B, and F, finally settling quietly onto a low D. This leaves the ambiguous feeling that the tonic may be E and the dominant B, or the tonic may be B with dominants D, F, and G{{Music|sharp}} {{harv|Jones|2002|loc=37}}.

'''''The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus''''' is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] originally completed in 1771 then reworked in 1795.&lt;ref name="Vertesi - ReoCities"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vertesi|first=Janet|title=Light and Enlightenment in Joseph Wright of Derby's The Alchymist|url=http://www.reocities.com/jvertesi/wright#_ftn11|publisher=ReoCities|accessdate=26 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69X9vVjgB?url=http://www.reocities.com/jvertesi/wright#_ftn11|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full title of the painting is '''''The Alchymist, in Search of the Philosopher's Stone, Discovers Phosphorus, and prays for the successful Conclusion of his operation, as was the custom of the Ancient Chymical Astrologers'''''. It has been suggested that ''The Alchymist'' refers to the discovery of [[phosphorus]] by the [[Hamburg]] [[alchemist]] [[Hennig Brandt]] in 1669.&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Players article"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alchymist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone (Exhibited 1771)|url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;x1=&amp;y1=&amp;x2=&amp;y2=&amp;scale=&amp;theme=&amp;album=&amp;viewpage=%2Fengine%2Fresource%2Fexhibition%2Fstandard%2Fchild.asp&amp;originator=&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=&amp;text=&amp;resource=5230&amp;exhibition=1654&amp;offset=0|publisher=Revolutionary Players|accessdate=1 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69X9wLlLm?url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story was often printed in popular chemical books in Wright's lifetime, and was widely known.

==Description==

The picture shows the alchemist trying to produce the elusive [[Philosopher's stone]], which could turn ordinary metal into gold, but instead, to his amazement, he discovers phosphorus. However, Wright does not picture the alchemist in a 17th-century background but he romanticises the room by imagining medieval gothic arches and high, pointed windows as if he is in a church. He also gave a very favourable impression of the actual process which involves the reduction by boiling of urine. A 1730 description of the manufacture of phosphorus described the need for 50 or 60 pails of urine that was both putrid and "bred worms".&lt;ref name=whitten&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitten|first=Kenneth W.|title=Chemistry|year=2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsMdeVqMp_MC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=urine+brand+wright+joseph&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9ou-TfHVMsGHhQftuvDJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=urine%20brand%20wright%20joseph&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Thomas Wijck - An Alchemist - WGA25742.jpg|upright|thumb|left|''The Alchemist'' by Thomas Wijck]]

Wright also gives religious connotations to the painting. The alchemist kneels in front of a shining vessel, stretching out his hands in a similar gesture to that used by [[El Greco]] when painting ''St Francis receiving the Stigmata'' or ''St Jerome in Prayer''.&lt;ref name="Derby Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art treasure – The Alchymist|url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheAlchymist.htm|accessdate=1 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223145643/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheAlchymist.htm|archivedate=23 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedict Nicolson]] compares his posture to that of one of Christ's disciples receiving communion. He believes that the layout of the painting may have been taken from [[Thomas Wijck]]'s painting (''left'') of an alchemist which also contains similar vaulting, a confusion of objects and a similar assistant who is singled out by the light. This painting from the previous century was on display in London during Wright's lifetime.{{sfn|Nicolson|1968|p=52}} However it is clear from a sketch by Wright's companion, [[Peter Perez Burdett]], that he had a strong influence on the design. His sketch of 4 February 1771 shows the vaulting and the layout of the painting with the glass container as its focus. It is Burdett who says where to place the figure in the painting and Burdett had already referred Wright to [[Matthew Turner (physician)|Matthew Turner]] so that Wright might fully understand the underlying science in the painting.{{sfn|Nicolson|1968|p=118}}

==History==

Since its exhibition in 1771, the picture has provoked many contradictory interpretations. Its mystery obviously disturbed 18th century viewers, and although Wright was an internationally recognised artist, the painting was not sold when he first exhibited it. The picture travelled with Wright to Italy in 1773–1775, came back to England, was reworked in 1795, but was only sold four years after his death, when his possessions were auctioned at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref name="Vertesi - ReoCities" /&gt;

'''The Bob Hope Theatre''' is a [[community theatre]] in [[Eltham]] in the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/YourCouncil/TheBorough/TownCentres/Eltham/PlacesOfInterest.htm Greenwich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108183327/http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/YourCouncil/TheBorough/TownCentres/Eltham/PlacesOfInterest.htm |date=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is owned and run by the members of Eltham Little Theatre Company. The theatre's own repertory members present approximately 11 shows each year, including a pantomime every January, and an annual musical. A variety of other companies also perform at the theatre throughout the year &amp;ndash; about 15 additional productions.

==History==
Eltham Little Theatre (ELT) Company was formed on 12 November 1943, to promote drama, music and allied arts in Eltham and its immediate vicinity. During the early years, it was without a permanent home but early in 1946, ELT was able to arrange an annual lease on Eltham Parish Hall (the current theatre).&lt;ref name="greenwich2000.com"&gt;[http://wwp.greenwich2000.com/heritage/vip/folk/bob-hope.htm Bob Hope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404225556/http://wwp.greenwich2000.com/heritage/vip/folk/bob-hope.htm |date=4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eltham Parish Hall (built in 1910) was unavailable earlier as it was being used as a military furniture store for the duration of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/73DB5EF0-F4A3-4530-A88A-2C1CD4EB4C1E/0/060217ElthamTrailLeaflet4FinalVersion.pdf|title=Greenwich Accessibility features|first=|last=Greenwich|website=www.greenwich.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period from 1948 to 1950 there were some 600 individual members and 25 affiliated societies, and a production was staged every other weekend throughout the season.&lt;ref name="greenwich2000.com"/&gt;

Throughout this time, the theatre’s management aimed eventually to purchase the building. Members were continually engaged in fund-raising activities to that end. By 1957, however, it became apparent that the asking price was beyond reach, and a sub-committee memorandum was submitted to the Borough Council with a recommendation that the building be acquired as an artistic centre for Eltham. While rejecting the recommendation, the council awarded the theatre a grant in aid, towards running expenses, in the sum of £150. This grant, increased to keep step with inflation, continued until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobhopetheatre.co.uk/BHT%20History%20Booklet%20April%202005.pdf |title=A Brief History |website=Bobhopetheatre.co.uk |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bob Hope Theatre is a member of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]].

==Bob Hope intervention==
During the late 1970s, several commercial concerns expressed an interest in the building for such purposes as a video recording studio, a sports centre and a multi-entertainment complex. None of these came to fruition for one reason or another. However, in 1979, the owner of the theatre wanted to sell the land and so would not renew the lease and without funds to find another base, members were widely resigned to the closure of both the building and the company.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

By chance, [[Bob Hope]], who was born in Craigton Road, Eltham, was in the UK to promote the [[Bob Hope British Classic]] [[Golf]] Tournament when he heard about the plight of the theatre.

Hope resolved to do what he could to help, and raised £58,000 through the 1980 and 1981 golf tournaments.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2943934.stm|title=BBC NEews - Entertainment - Hope's hometown legacy|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope was assisted by celebrity friends in fund-raising for the theatre. While negotiations for the purchase of the building continued, [[Dickie Henderson]] (vice-chairman of the Bob Hope British Golf Classic) gave a benefit performance of his one-man show at the theatre to raise funds towards refurbishment. This was a tremendous evening of entertainment, enhanced by
the presence in the audience of several star personalities, including [[Max Wall]].&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

In November 1982, the purchase of the freehold was completed and Eltham Little Theatre was renamed The Bob Hope Theatre.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

In September 1982, Hope became co-honorary president of Eltham Little Theatre Company along with former [[President of the United States]] [[Gerald Ford]], who was heavily involved with the [[Bob Hope Classic]] [[Golf]] Tournament.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In August 1991, Hope donated £28,000 from the benefit performance he staged at the London Palladium to raise money directly for the theatre.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

'''Underground art''', is any form of [[art]] that operates outside of conventional norms in the art world, part of [[underground culture]]. This can include essentially any [[genre]] of art that is not popular in the art world, including [[visionary art]] and [[street art]]. Underground art can include art created both legally and illegally, organized or unauthorized, and can essentially exist in any form.

Visionary Art is often considered a form of underground art because of it popularity outside conventional art channels. Rather than being displayed in [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[museum]]s, most visionary art is displayed online, at music festivals, or other forms of gatherings such as Burning Man and Rainbow Gatherings.

Street Art, also is often considered a form of underground art because of its unconventional settings. Again, rather than galleries and museums, street art exists in outdoors spaces, utilizing stickers, [[Lock On (street art)|Lock On]] sculptures, [[Street installation|installations]], [[Stencil graffiti|stencils]], and/or [[spray paint]] as its medium.

[[Graffiti]], a form of street art, typically refers to illegal forms of street art. Public response to graffiti is not always favorable and is often negative. Others say that unauthorized art comes from a desire to spread beauty and make [[cityscape]]s more interesting by painting over blank or barren walls.
A controversial point is whether or not these types of art should be taught in a formal setting. Guerrilla art falls under that umbrella of thought.  It is understood, that these acts mostly happen on [[public property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=7556|title=Stage - Vaude-Villains|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-daum12apr12,0,5834055.column|title=Obama as an Art Form|accessdate=2008-04-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613080430/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-daum12apr12,0,5834055.column &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Combat du Romulus mg 5098.jpg|thumb|300px|Battle of the [[French ship Romulus (1812)|Romulus]] (1848)]]
'''Joseph Vincent François Courdouan''' (7 March 1810, [[Toulon]] - 8 December 1893, Toulon) was a French painter who specialized in maritime scenes.

== Biography ==
His father was a [[farrier]] and veterinarian. He began his artistic studies at the age of twelve with the local artist {{ill|Pierre Letuaire|fr}}. Later, he spent some time at the "École des Beaux-Arts de la Marine", a small school under the direction of the naval sculptor Félix Brun (1763-1831).&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.toulon.fr/laissez-seduire/article/vincent-courdouan Brief biography] @ the Ville de Toulon website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, he went to Paris where he studied engraving and worked in the studios of the painter [[Jean-Baptiste Paulin Guerin|Paulin Guérin]], who was also originally from Toulon.

After completing his studies, he returned home and, in 1833, became a member of the Académie du Var,&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; a group that promotes the arts and sciences in that region and can boast of many prominent members; including [[André-Marie Ampère]], [[Louis Lumière]] and [[Georges Eugène Haussmann]]. Three years later, he was back in Paris with his first exhibition at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], where he continued to exhibit, winning a Third Class Medal in 1838 for his watercolors and [[pastels]].

===First successes===
[[File:Courdouan-embarquement-zouaves-narbonne.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Zouave]]s Heading for Algeria (1855)]]
In 1840, he began accepting students. He travelled to Naples in 1844. The following year, he turned more to oil painting and exhibited widely throughout France, notably in [[Lyon]]. In 1847, he visited Algeria and achieved a Gold Medal at the Salon in 1848 for his painting "Battle of the Romulus".&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; This recognition was a major factor in his receiving a Professorship at the "École de la Marine de Toulon" in 1849. Three years later, he was awarded the [[Légion d’Honneur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/leonore_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;FIELD_1=NOM&amp;VALUE_1=COURDOUAN&amp;NUMBER=5&amp;GRP=0&amp;REQ=%28%28COURDOUAN%29%20%3aNOM%20%29&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=9&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;MAX1=1&amp;MAX2=1&amp;MAX3=100&amp;DOM=All Documentation] @ the Base Léonore.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named Honorary Director of the {{ill|Musée d'art de Toulon|fr}} in 1857 and, five years later, was admitted into the [[Félibrige]] (an [[Occitan]] cultural association) by its founder, [[Frédéric Mistral]]. The following year, at the age of 53, he married one of his students.

He continued to exhibit and travel widely for many years (including a trip to Egypt in 1866). He had his last showing at the Salon in 1883 and his last major exhibitions at [[Hyères]] and [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 1886. He died in the same house where he had been born.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

This modification process must reflect specific language and cultural preferences in the content, images and overall design and requirements of the site – all while maintaining the integrity of the website.  Culturally adapted web sites reduce the amount of required cognitive efforts from visitors of the site to process information, making navigation easier and attitudes toward the web site more favorable.&lt;ref name="Shneor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rotem|date=2014-02-28|title=Influences of culture, geography, and infrastructure on website localization|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1034102170?accountid=14667|journal=Cross Cultural Management|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|access-date=2017-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modification of the website must additionally take into consideration the stated purpose of the new website with a focus on the targeted audience/market in the new locale.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI/&gt; Website localization aims to customize a website so that it seems "natural", to its viewers despite cultural differences between the creators and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rodem|title=Influences of culture, geography and infrastructure on website localization decisions|journal=Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal|date=2012|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17047475|accessdate=19 March 2014|doi=10.1108/13527601211247099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two factors are involved—programming expertise and linguistic/cultural knowledge.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

The proliferation of website localization is the result of the popularity of computer and Internet users. People all over the world treat the Internet as their main location for information and services. These people do not all speak the same language. As a result, website localization has become one of the primary tools for business global expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website Localization|url=https://asianabsolute.co.uk/website-localization|publisher=Asian Absolute|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to website communication across multiple cultures for multiple needs, the Internet has given way to non professional translation practices. Because website localization involves mixed strategies, organizations tend to maintain a global image while using website localization to appeal to local users.&lt;ref name="Pym"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199239306.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199239306-e-028|title = Oxford Handbooks|last=Pym|first=Anthony|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of website localization has become even more important as websites increasingly have the potential to both supplement and replace presence in foreign markets.  As web design becomes more congruent with national culture, it will foster online consumer purchasing.&lt;ref name="Shneor"/&gt; Creators take into account the "language, education level, belief and value systems, [and] traditions and habits" of the target culture in order to optimize results.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

==Process==
Website localization is more than mere [[translation]].&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-08-06/business/0108060190_1_localization-translation-web-sites|title=Translators go beyond language as Web sites cross borders|last=Tan|first=Shannon|date=6 August 2001|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uabN4muG|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translating only solves partial language problems. Measurement units must be converted; images and text are modified to appeal to the target culture.&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt;

The process of website localization is complex and involves three different levels of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Localization?|url=http://www.gx-localizations.com/about.asp|publisher=GX Localizations|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First is translation. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into the language of the country. It is important that translation of information be “clear and understandable” to avoid cultural misunderstanding or offense.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; In order to translate, the "target culture" must be known.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=John|title=SIGDOC '99 Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Computer documentation|year=1999|publisher=ACM|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-58113-072-4|pages=127–129|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/320000/318569/p127-stanley.pdf?ip=141.213.236.110&amp;id=318569&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=B5D9E165A72B697C%2E0A17827594E6F2C8%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=419590667&amp;CFTOKEN=40207095&amp;__acm__=1394480330_f23b71ce60f010c26de5d84eebbfbb5b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second is the actual localization, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and graphics are “linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.” &lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; Target locale is understood as the “[[Market segmentation|market segment]] defined by criteria including language, currency, and perhaps educational level or income bracket.” &lt;ref name=PYM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pym|first=Anthony|title=Website localization|year=2011|url=http://usuaris.tinet.cat/apym/on-line/translation/2009_website_localization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many technical elements which can be localized are: date and time formats, currency formats, number formats, address and telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt; In order to ensure effective communication during the localization process, it is important to consider the following items: [[information architecture]], theme and navigation, [[graphics]], photographs, audio, and visual.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"/&gt; Third is [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], which involves making sure that the software being used is fully compatible with the technology of the country in question.

There are two important considerations to keep in mind during the process of website localization. The first is to focus on the demands of the user.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; The readers of the “localized version of the website” want to be able to read and understand the pages in a way that makes sense to them.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  A second consideration is to take into account the goals of the client, whether an institution, government or individual, for example.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;

==Backend localization==
Many elements of a website that are different according to the locale of the client need only minor manual changes by a localizer, or none at all. For example, the system on which the website is created should automatically produce the correct currency symbol based on the country in which the client is located.&lt;ref name=LAKO&gt;{{cite web|last=Lako|first=Cristian|title=The Elements of the Website Localizations Process|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1321921734/abstract?accountid=14667|work=Studia Universitatis Petru Major. Philogia|publisher=Universitatea Petru Maior|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Website Analytics Software:&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt; This software can be created once generally, and then applied to each of the localized domains.
* Site Search: Results can be reviewed using an algorithm that sifts through possible results using [[metadata]]. For example, a consumer who makes a query in the United States should not be shown a good that can only be purchased in Portugal.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Testimonials: Comments and feedback are often a vital part of a website. Localization efforts usually only include censorship. This can be done largely by software, however human review is sometimes necessary.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Information Storage: [[Databases]] are often used to store large amounts of information. They can be used to store generic data, like product information, as well as more specific information pertaining to certain locales.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;

==The business of website localization==
Using website localization to its best advantage is vital to any business seeking to move into international markets. With more and more companies seeking to tap into these lucrative markets, website localization has become quite profitable.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  The business side involves global and local coordination; production and operations, including finance; sales and marketing; language translation, including technology and linguistic coordination; software engineering, as well as design.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wandrianne|first=Dias|title=The Business Behind Translation|url=http://www.ccaps.net/blog/the-business-behind-translation/|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The higher the technological abilities of the target culture, the more likely it is for website localization to be implemented and used effectively.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

===First publication of stories===
Details of the first UK publication of the stories published in ''While the Light Lasts'' are as follows:

* ''The House of Dreams'': First published in issue 74 of the ''Sovereign'' Magazine in January 1926, illustrated by Stanley Lloyd.
* ''The Actress'': First published in issue 218 of ''The Novel Magazine'' in May 1923 under the title of ''A Trap for the Unwary'', with an illustration by Emile Verpilleux. Prior to the publication of this volume, the story (with its 1923 illustration) was reprinted in the 1990 paperback ''Agatha Christie – Official Centenary Celebration'' by Belgrave Publishing ({{ISBN|0-00-637675-4}}). ''The Actress'' is Christie's original title for this story.
* ''The Edge'': First published, unillustrated, in issue 374 of ''Pearson's'' Magazine in February 1927.
* ''Christmas Adventure'': First published, unillustrated, in issue 1611 of ''[[The Sketch]]'' Magazine on 11 December 1923. The story was later expanded into novella form and was printed as the [[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding|title story]] in the 1960 UK collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]''.
* ''The Lonely God'': First published in issue 333 of the ''[[Royal Magazine]]'' in July 1926, with illustrations by H. Coller.  Christie's original title for this story was ''The Little Lonely God''.
* ''Manx Gold'' was one of the most unusual commissions undertaken by Christie in her career. As described in detail in an editorial note, the idea of a [[treasure hunting]] story was prompted by a wish on the part of Manx politicians to promote tourism to the [[Isle of Man]].  Christie wrote a short story which was serialised in the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' in five instalments on 23, 24, 26, 27 and 28 May 1930. The story gave the clues to the location of four [[snuffbox]]es hidden on the island, each of which contained a voucher for £100 – a considerable sum in 1930. Island residents were barred from taking part. To further promote the hunt, the story was then published in a promotional booklet entitled ''June in Douglas'' which was distributed at guesthouses and other tourist spots. Although a quarter of a million copies of this booklet were printed, only one is known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twbooks.co.uk/crimescene/christienews.html Announcement of publication of "Manx Gold"], twbooks.co.uk; accessed 6 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Within a Wall'': First published in issue 324 of the ''[[Royal Magazine]]'' in October 1925.
* ''The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest'': First published in issue 493 of the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in January 1932. The story was later expanded into novella form and was printed as ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#The Mystery of the Spanish Chest|The Mystery of the Spanish Chest]]'' in the 1960 UK collection ''The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding''.
* ''"While the Light Lasts"'': First published in issue 229 of ''The Novel Magazine'' in April 1924, with two illustrations by Howard K. Elcock. The plot of this short story is similar to that of her novel ''[[Giant's Bread]]''.

'''''Wivenhoe Park''''' is a painting of an [[English landscape park]], the estate of the Rebow family, by the English Romantic painter, [[John Constable]] (1776–1837).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcist.com/2010/03/permanent_collection_john_constable.php|title=permanent_collection_john_constable|publisher=dcist.com|access-date=22 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507214945/http://dcist.com/2010/03/permanent_collection_john_constable.php|archivedate=7 May 2015|df=}} Re-Retrieved 12 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''“No two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither was there ever two leaves of tree alike since the creation of the world.” So said John Constable (1776–1837), regarded by many as England’s greatest landscape painter. His work Wivenhoe Park, Essex (1816) at the National Gallery of Art vibrates with the verdant essence of the countryside. Constable’s studies, sketchbooks and paintings all reveal the profound connection he felt to the landscapes of his native Suffolk and the surrounding counties.'' Quote from Aleid Ford's project, Art 2010, for DCist online magazine for the Washington DC USA area. Ford is a staff member of DCist.]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Constable was born in Suffolk, and is known principally for his landscape paintings, especially the landscapes of the countryside where he spent his childhood. His paintings are now considered among the most popular and valuable in British art.&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collection Highlights|title=Wivenhoe Park, Essex|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/highlights/highlight1147.html|website=nga.gov|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''Major-General Rebow, a friend of Constable’s father, commissioned the artist to capture the beauty of his estate, inviting him to spend some weeks on the premises. General Rebow specified that certain features be included in the painting. Constable arranged these harmoniously, modifying the actual location of certain elements (for example, the house and lake were not actually part of the same view). Typically, the owner of such a house might wish for a more grandiose portrait of it, but Constable preferred the everyday poetry of landscape and sky.''Quote from Aleid Ford's project, Art 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
[[The National Gallery of Art]] holds this painting as one of its highlights:&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A pleasant sense of ease and harmony pervades this landscape of almost photographic clarity. The large areas of brilliant sunshine and cool shade, the rambling line of the fence, and the beautiful balance of trees, meadow, and river are evidence of the artist's creative synthesis of the actual site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting was commissioned by the owner of [[Wivenhoe Park]], Major General Francis Slater-Rebow, who was among the artist's first patrons, being a close friend of the artist's father, Golding Constable. Wivenhoe Park is {{convert|200|acres|ha}} of parkland, purchased by the Rebow family before 1734.&lt;ref name=marsden&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsden|first1=Pat|title=Wivenhoe House: A Tale of Two Lost 18th Century Mansions and the Sea-Captains who Built Them|url=http://www.wivencyclopedia.org/History/Wivenhoe%20House%20for%20blog%2022%2005%2012.pdf|website=Wivenhoe Encyclopedia|publisher=Eugene Kraft|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=col_uni&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Colchester Campus|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/about/campuses/colchester/|website=essex.ac.uk|publisher=Essex University|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slater-Rebow commissioned several paintings from Constable, including a portrait of the general's seven-year-old daughter in 1812. She also figures in this painting, in a donkey cart to the left. This painting, finished in September 1816, earned the artist enough money to allow him to marry his long-time love, Mary Bicknell. They married in October 1816.&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''The painting was a important project for Constable on a personal level: He needed the income the commission generated in order to provide for his longtime love, Maria Bicknell, and enable them to marry with the approval of her parents, who opposed the match for a number of years. ''Wivenhoe Park, Essex'' was finished by September 1816, and Bicknell and Constable were at last married on October 2, 1816.'' Quote from Aleid Ford's project, Art 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constable's art is always penetrated by longing, melancholy and a yearning for the simple, natural life, for a [[bucolic]], [[pastoral]] idyll,  to [[rural]] subjects and aspects of life in the countryside, a "golden age" when people lived together in harmony with nature, a world on its way of disappearing when he painted his landscapes thanks to the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He was aware of the issue of [[Urban area|urban]] growth, of urban life's  unpleasantness-  which he contrasted to life in the [[countryside]]. Constable's art was rather unconventional for his time, and he loved simple things, a natural landscape without the ruins, dramatic effects or exalted, often excessive feelings, like the ones displayed in the paintings of his contemporary, [[J. M. W. Turner]]. His landscapes are flooded by a silvery brilliant light in the water and air and in the sky - and are characterised  by a special intensity that is such an important feature of this artist's works.{{sfnp|Beckett|1994|p=268|ps=}}

'''Zurich University of the Arts''' (ZHdK, {{lang-de|'''Zürcher Hochschule der Künste'''}}) has approximately 2,500 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK)|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it the largest arts university in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Departement Design &amp; Art Education Zurich University of the Arts|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2007, following the merger between Zurich’s School of Art and Design (HGKZ) and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT). ZHdK is one of four universities affiliated to [[Zürcher Fachhochschule]].

ZHdK offers Bachelor’s and master's degree courses and further education programmes in [[art]], [[design]], [[music]], [[art education]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[dance]], transdisciplinary studies as well as PhD programmes in collaboration with different international Art Uniuversities and with [[ETH Zurich]]. ZHdK holds an active role in research, especially in artistic research and design research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zürcher Hochschule der Künste|url=http://www.eenc.info/fr/organisation/zurich-university-of-the-arts/|work= eenc.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliated to ZHdK are the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]], the Theater der Künste (Theatre of the Arts), the Mehrspur Music Club, and the Media and Information Centre (MIZ).

== History ==
Established on 1 August 2007, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) resulted from the merger between the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich]] (HGKZ), which had arisen from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] (founded in 1878), and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich University of the Arts Universities Handbook |url=http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |work= universitieshandbook.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501144050/http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding president of the new arts university was Professor Hans-Peter Schwarz. Since November 2009, Professor Thomas D. Meier has been president of ZHdK.

The Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich (HGKZ) arose from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] Zürich (founded in 1878). It was located in a building constructed by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender, which today also houses the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]].

The School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT) was the result of a merger in 1999 between Winterthur and Zurich conservatories of music, Zurich’s Jazz School, Zurich’s Theatre and Acting Academy, and the Swiss Professional Ballet School. ZHdK’s programme in Theatre Studies (affiliated to the Department of Performing Arts and Film) was originally established in 1937, in the context of the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]] (the city’s principal theatre), and known as the  Bühnenstudio Zürich. It was renamed Schauspiel-Akademie Zürich in the early 1970s.

Following the 2007 school merger, ZHdK occupies 35 sites, spread across the cities of Zurich (Ausstellungsstrasse, Florhof, Mediacampus, Gessnerallee) and Winterthur. In the autumn of 2014, ZHdK will be relocating to its new campus: the Toni Areal (under construction) in the city’s thriving western district ([[Zurich West]]). With the exception of its Gessnerallee annex, ZHdK will be leaving all other sites to unite the arts under one roof. The [[Museum of Design, Zurich]] and the Bellerive Museum will remain at their current locations.

== Teaching and research ==
ZHdK offers taught Bachelor’s and master's degree courses, which have replaced the former diploma courses in the wake of the [[Bologna Process]]. Places on all degree courses are limited. The university also offers a foundation course in art and design and various further educating courses, leading either to a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) or a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).

With research becoming more firmly established at universities of applied sciences, ZHdK has significantly intensified its research activities. Its seven research institutes and two centres of excellence focus on artistic research in particular. Research is also undertaken in the fields of [[design]], [[art history]], art education, and [[musicology]]. And, ZhdK is also running several joint PhD programmes in cooperation with national and international universities.

== Departments ==
ZHdK has five departments:

The '''Department of Music''' is the largest department at ZHdK. It provides instrumental and voice training in Classical, Jazz, and Popular Music, as well as programmes in conducting and composition.
