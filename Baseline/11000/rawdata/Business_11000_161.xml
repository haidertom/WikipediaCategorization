{{Politics}}
The term '''administration''', as used in the context of government, differs according to [[jurisdiction]].
==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Government --&gt;

In [[Americans|American]] usage, the term generally refers to the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] under a specific [[President of the United States|president]] (or [[Governor#United States|governor]], [[Mayor#United States|mayor]], or other local executive);  or the term of a particular executive; for example: "President Y's administration" or "Secretary of Defense X during President Y's administration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/administration administration noun – definition in American English Dictionary – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also mean an executive branch agency headed by an administrator, as the [[Small Business Administration]] or the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

The term "administration" has been used to denote the executive branch in [[presidential system]]s of government.

==Europe==
The term's usage in [[Europe]] varies by country, but most typically the word "administration" refers to [[management | managerial functions]] in general, which may include local governments, or the hierarchy of national and local government, that applies to a town or district. More specifically, it may refer to [[public administration]], the business of administering [[Policy|public policy]] as determined by government. However, outside France and Romania, this usage of the word is uncommon.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

For the British sense{{which?|date=January 2018}} of the word, most countries (be they [[English language|English-speaking]] or not) use the term ''government'', referring to the "administration" of [[Winston Churchill]] as the "Churchill government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/government_1 government noun (GROUP) – definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the non-European members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  An older, chiefly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] usage, is the term [[Ministry (collective executive)| "ministry"]], as in "Churchill Ministry", which is still in official and academic use in Britain, Australia and Canada to refer the terms of [[prime ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ministry Ministry – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of government, the word [[coalition]] may be used for a specific government. In the Netherlands, cabinet is the most-used term (as in "the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]]"), although "coalition" or "government" are also used when one does not refer to a specific coalition (note that the two terms have slightly different meanings).

'''''Belorusy i rynok''''' ({{lang-ru|Белорусы и рынок}}, {{IPA-ru|bʲɛləˈrusɨ ɪ ˈrʲnək|pron}}) is the main business weekly newspaper published in [[Belarus]].

The newspaper was founded in 1990 under the name ''Belorusskij rynok'' (Белорусский рынок, ''The Belarusian Market'') and was one of the first private media in Belarus.

In 2005 the newspaper had to change its name following a decree of president [[Lukashenka]] that forbid usage of the words ''National'' and ''Belarusian'' in names of organisations and newspapers.

Current chief editor is [[Viačasłaŭ Chadasoŭski]].

The newspaper is published mainly in [[Russian language]].

The '''British Iron and Steel Federation''' ('''BISF'''), formed in 1934, was an organisation of British iron and steel producers responsible for the national planning of steel production.  Its creation was imposed on the industry by [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[National Government 1931–1935|National Government]] as a precondition to the establishment of steel import tariffs.  It was a successor to the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, formed in 1918.

Sir William James Larke was the first director of the federation.

It continued to exist until 1967 when the industry was nationalised as [[British Steel Corporation]] during [[Harold Wilson]]'s first term in government.

'''Caliper, A PerkinElmer Company'''  is based in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]] with direct sales, service and application-support operations in countries around the globe.  Founded in 1995, Caliper
develops products and services to the life sciences research community, including [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] companies, and government and other not-for profit research institutions.

Caliper’s integrated systems, consisting of instruments, software and [[reagents]], [[laboratory automation]] tools and [[drug discovery]] assay services enable researchers to better understand the basis for disease and more effectively discover safe and effective drugs.  Caliper’s product portfolio includes,  [[microfluidics]], lab automation &amp; liquid handling, optical imaging technologies, and [[drug discovery]] &amp; [[drug development]] outsourcing solutions.

== Microfluidic platform ==
Caliper is a pioneer in [[microfluidic]] [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology which represents a significant advancement in laboratory experimentation, bringing the benefits of miniaturization, integration and automation to numerous research-based industries.  Caliper’s proprietary microfluidic sipper chips are a high-throughput complement to the planar chips which Caliper manufactures for the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.  The microfluidic technology forms the basis of Caliper’s LabChip EZ reader systems used for drug screening and profiling and the LabChip GX series for molecular biology [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[protein analysis]].

== Optical imaging ==
Through its acquisition of Xenogen Corporation in 2006, Caliper is now a developer of [[in vivo]] biophotonic imaging technology, which allows for real-time, non-invasive exploration of [[genes]], proteins, pathogens, and tumor cells in living animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Advancing bioluminescence imaging technology for the evaluation of anticancer agents in the MDA-MB-435-HAL-Luc mammary fat pad and subrenal capsule tumor models.| date=2009-01-01 | publisher=| pmid=19118051| doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0897| volume=15| issue=1| journal=Clin. Cancer Res.| pages=238–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caliper offers a complement of patented biophotonic and fluorescent imaging technologies, as well as genetically modified animal programs.  Caliper’s imaging product lines include a suite of IVIS imaging systems - many measuring both bioluminescence and fluorescence, ''in vivo'' imaging reagents, specialized light producing animal models, and genetic modification programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development. In a recent Japanese study, the IVIS imaging system was used to evaluate the binding affinity and RNA interference ([[RNAi]]) of LMWC/[[siRNA]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evaluation of the binding affinity and RNA interference of low-molecular-weight chitosan/siRNA complexes using an imaging system | date=2008-10-30 | publisher=| pmid=19337002 | volume=129 | issue=4 | journal=Yakugaku Zasshi | pages=475–84 | doi=10.1248/yakushi.129.475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lab automation and liquid handling ==
Caliper has held a long standing position in laboratory automation starting with the introduction of the world’s first lab robotic system, the Zymark Zymate.  To date, Caliper has a number of lab automation and liquid handling systems for the life sciences industry.  In January 2009, the Zephyr Genomics Workstation was introduced which promises to deliver a benchtop solution for automating routine but critical processes for [[molecular biology]] such as [[nucleic acid purification]], reaction setup and normalization.

In addition to automating molecular biology, Caliper has many other [[robotic]] systems including the Zephyr SPE and RapidTrace SPE workstations to automate [[solid phase extraction]] and several liquid handling and plate management systems including the Sciclone ALH 3000 liquid handler and Twister II systems to automate drug discovery and development.

Caliper also custom designs integrated vendor-neutral instruments and software such as the Twister II - LightCycler (Roche) integrated system which fully automates real-time [[PCR]].

== Discovery and development outsourcing solutions ==
Caliper’s Discovery Alliances &amp; Services division (CDAS) was created from the acquisitions of NovaScreen, a provider of [[in vitro]] &amp; [[in vivo]] discovery services.  CDAS develops, utilizes, and provides a comprehensive array of services to improve the productivity, accelerate the pace, and reduce the cost of the [[drug discovery]] process. The ''in vitro'' service arm of CDAS includes a comprehensive array of ''in vitro'' drug discovery and development solutions including more than 1000 screening [[assays]] that help define the mode of action, side effect profiles, selectivity, and other relevant activities of drug candidates. ''In vivo'' capabilities include:  non-invasive ''in vivo'' [[optical imaging]], OncoMouse studies, and ''in vivo'' compound evaluations for safety assessment and [[drug repositioning]].

== History ==
Caliper Life Sciences was founded in 1995 by [[Larry Bock]] and Drs. Michael Knapp, Michael Ramsey and Andreas Manz. as Caliper Technologies with a strong focus on microfluidics technology. In 2003, Caliper acquired Zymark a leader in laboratory automation and robotics and Caliper Life Sciences was born.  In October 2005, Caliper acquired NovaScreen Biosciences Corporation a privately held CRO offering pre-clinical drug discovery and development services.  NovaScreen’s services included ''in vitro'' compound profiling for safety assessment, drug discovery screening services for targets such as  GPCRs, Kinases, Ion Channels, Transporters, Nuclear Receptors and customized assay development services.  In August 2006, Caliper acquired Xenogen Corporation,  a developer of ''in vivo'' optical imaging systems (IVIS systems) and its division, Xenogen Biosciences a CRO offering ''in vivo'' transgenic animal production, phenotyping, gene targeting and ''in vivo'' optical imaging services.

At the end of October 2008, SOTAX—a tester and software developer of medical devices—acquired Caliper's Pharmaceutical Development &amp; Quality Analysis (PDQ) Division for $15.8 Million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Caliper sells biz unit for $15.8M to SOTAX | date=2008-10-30 | publisher=Mass High Tech | url=http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/10/27/daily33-Caliper-sells-biz-unit-for-158M-to-SOTAX.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Caliper Grabs $15.8M In Product Line Sale | date=2008-10-30 | publisher=Worcester Business Journal | url=http://www.wbjournal.com/news41938.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter on November 10, 2008, Caliper's AutoTrace(r) line of product was acquired by [[Dionex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dionex Enters Into Agreement With Caliper Life Sciences to Acquire Product Line for Water Sample Preparation | date=2008-11-10 | publisher=MarketWatch | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Dionex-Enters-Into-Agreement-With/story.aspx?guid=28223301-9045-48B7-A4B0-FEF2C02E2C73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, [[Taconic Biosciences]] acquired XenoGen Biosciences ''in vivo'' pre-clinical CRO subsidiary of Caliper Life Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Taconic Acquires Xenogen Biosciences Subsidiary of Caliper Life Sciences| date=2009-12-14 | publisher=Taconic | url=http://www.taconic.com/resources/newsroom/2009/xenogen-biosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later in December 2010, Caliper purchased Cambridge Research &amp; Instrumentation Inc. for about $20 million in a cash and stock deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Caliper buying Cambridge Research for $20 million | date=2010-12-09 | publisher=Bloomberg | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-09/caliper-buying-cambridge-research-for-20-million.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, PerkinElmer agreed to buy Caliper Life Sciences for $600 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Construction accounting''' is a form of [[project accounting]] applied to construction projects.  See also [[production accounting]].  Construction accounting is a vitally necessary form of accounting, especially when multiple [[contracts]] come into play. The construction field uses many terms not used in other forms of accounting, such as "draw" and [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progress-billings.asp progress billing]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progress-billings.asp|title=Progress Billings|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2011-01-02|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Construction accounting may also need to account for vehicles and equipment, which may or may not be owned by the company as a [[fixed asset]]. Construction accounting requires [[invoicing]] and [[vendor]] [[payment]], more or less as to the amount of [[business]] done.

In the United States, the authoritative literature on Construction accounting is [[AICPA Statements of Position|AICPA Statement of Position]] [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aicpa/id/3678 SOP 81-1].

== Construction Costs ==
These are all cost related to the construction process, right from materials, labor costs, consultancy and all management expenses.
Construction accounting involves charging construction costs to the applicable contract.  Costs fall into three categories. [[Direct costs]] are labor, material, and subcontracting costs, land.&lt;ref&gt;AICPA SOP 81-1 Para. 72 a.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Indirect costs]] include indirect labor, supervision, tools, equipment costs, supplies, insurance, and support costs.&lt;ref&gt;AICPA SOP 81-1 Para. 72 b.&lt;/ref&gt;  Selling, general and administrative costs, are generally excluded from contract costs.&lt;ref&gt;AICPA SOP 81-1 Para. 72 c,d.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue Recognition ==

Construction accounting requires unique [[revenue recognition]] rules for contracts in progress.

In most cases, revenue is recognized using the Percentage of Completion Method.  Under this method, revenue is recognized using an estimate for the overall anticipated profit for a particular contract multiplied by the estimated percent complete of that contract.&lt;ref&gt;AICPA SOP 81-1 Para. 22-25&lt;/ref&gt;  This involves the inherent risk of relying upon estimates.&lt;ref&gt;SOP 81-1 Para. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a Percentage of Completion Method:
  
A construction company has entered into contract to construct a building for $10,000,000.  The building was completed in 2020.


                                                                 2018               2019                 2020
Contract Price                                              $10,000,000          $10,000,000          $10,000,000
Actual cost to date                                          $2,291,000           $6,146,000          $10,211,000
Estimated cost to complete                                   $5,609,000           $4,210,000              $0
Total estimated cost                                         $7,900,000          $10,356,000          $10,211,000
Estimated gross profit (loss) (actual in 2020)               $2,100,000           $(356,000)           $(211,000)

Revenue Recognition:

2018:  $2,291,000 / $7,900,000 = 29% * $10,000,000 = $2,900,000

2019:  $6,146,000 / $10,356,000 = 59% * $10,000,000 - $2,900,000 = $3,000,000

2020:  $10,000,000 - $5,900,000 = $4,100,000

Gross Profit:

2018:  $2,900,000 - $2,291,000 = $609,000

2019:  $(356,000) - $609,000 = $(956,000)

2020:  $(211,000) - $(956,000) - $609,000 = $145,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spiceland|first1=David|title=Intermediate Accounting|publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using the Percentage of Completion Method you start with the contract price in this example is $10,000,000 for the entire job. The job is to be completed in three years.  To record the first years revenue you start with computing the 2018 actual cost to date divided by the total estimated cost to get the percentage of completion for 2018 which is 29% of the job completed in 2018.  You than take the 29% multiply by the cost of the job $10,000,000 and you get $2,900,000 of revenue fore 2018.  To compute 2019 you take the same steps you take the actual cost to date of $6,146,000 divide it by total estimated cost of $10,356,000 and you get 59%.  That is the percentage of the job completed in 2019.  Now you take 59% multiply by contract price of $10,000,000 then subtract the previous years revenue of $2,900,000 and 2019 revenue recognized is $3,000,000.  For 2020 you take the contract price of $10,000,000 and subtract the total of both previous years revenue which is $5,900,000 to get 2020 completed revenue of $4,100,000.  
To compute the gross profit for 2018 you take 2018 revenue of $2,900,000 and subtract the actual cost to date of $2,291,000 to get a gross profit of $609,000 for 2018.  For 2019 you take the estimated gross profit form the table of $(356,000) subtract the 2018 gross profit total of $609,000 and you get $(956,000) for 2019.  2020 gross profit you take the estimated gross profit from the table of $(211,000) subtract the previous years of $(956,000) and $609,000 and you get $145,000 of gross profit.           


Under SOP 81-1, revenue is also allowed to be computed using the Completed Contract Method.&lt;ref&gt;SOP 81-1 Para. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this method, contract revenues and costs are not recognized until the contract is substantially complete.  However, this method is not allowable if the results are significantly different than results using the Percentage of Completion Method.&lt;ref&gt;SOP 81-1 Para. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  The Completed Contract Method is allowed in circumstances in which reasonable estimates cannot be determined.&lt;ref&gt;SOP 81-1 Para. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these types of circumstances can be construed as a lack of internal control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2659">In [[Canadian contract law]], '''Contract A''' is a concept that has recently been applied by courts regarding the fair and equal treatment of bidders in a [[contract tendering process]]. Essentially this concept formalizes previously applied precedents and strengthens the protection afforded to those who submit bids in the tendering process. The concept was introduced in 1981 by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], in ''[[R. v. Ron Engineering and Construction (Eastern) Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;Government Procurement, Fourth Edition, by Paul Emanuelli, p. 125, Published by Lexis Nexis Canada, Year of Publication: 2017, {{ISBN|978-0-433-47454-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court found that a "[[duty of fairness]]" was owed to all bidders by an owner in a tendering process.

The Contract A is formed when a "request for proposal" is responded to in the form of a valid bid, sometimes also known as submission of price. As many Contracts A are formed between the owner (person, company or organization tendering the project) and the bidders as their bids are received. The owner must now deal fairly and equally with all bidders, and must not show any favouritism or [[prejudice]] towards any bidder(s). In essence, this concept boils down to the right of an individual to have equal opportunity to be successful with their bid for work.

A breach of Contract A may occur if the owner (or an owner's officer or representative, see [[vicarious liability]]), provides information, changes specification during the tendering process to unfairly benefit a particular bidder, enters into closed negotiations with an individual bidder in an effort to obtain more desirable contract conditions, etc. The most common situation in which an owner is accused of having breached Contract A occurs when a bidder is selected who is not the lowest bidder. This contravenes established custom and practice, which would normally dictate that the lowest bid be awarded the contract, but is not normally a source of a breach if handled properly. The successful suits for breach typically occur if the lowest bidder has been excluded based on a stipulation not clearly outlined in the tender documents (such as preference for local bidders) or when the [[Privilege Clause]] employed by the owner to exclude a principle of custom and practice is judged by the courts to be too broadly worded to have any meaning.

'''ExpertVoice''' is a [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]-based company that helps brands and retailers improve product recommendations through education, product seeding and by offering first-hand product experience to retail sales associates and category-specific experts. ExpertVoice was previously named "Experticity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/experticity]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The company was founded in 2004 by Paul Kirwin under the name 3point5, Inc. (referencing the fact that 3.5 feet was considered the optimal distance between two people in a one-one-one conversation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snewsnet.com/news/3point5-promises-to-take-the-yawn-out-of-retail-training/]&lt;/ref&gt; Kirwin's idea was to create an entertaining, web-based training platform for retail salespeople using brand discounts to incentivize them to complete training.

Built on Kirwin’s television news background, Kirwin Productions was founded in 1985 and specialized in creating videos to train retail salespeople on a brand’s new technology and products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/8906/UTAH-TELEVISION-GRABS-22-EMMYS.html?pg=all]&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Kirwin got the idea of training retail salespeople online.

In 2007, 3point5 acquired Influence Technologies, which among other things operated a discount marketplace for influencers called BroForm.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2007/10/16/3point5com-acquires-influence#.VDw949TaE6W]&lt;/ref&gt; BroForm was renamed Promotive.

In 2009, the company changed its name to SwarmBuilder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2009/07/15/3point5com-changing-its-name#.U1WUw_ldWSp]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, it purchased a platform and named it ProMotive.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signalpeakvc.com/news/29/19/Parent-of-3point5-com-Re-named-SwarmBuilder]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the company was ranked 100th on Inc. magazine’s list of 500 Fastest Growing Companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700060194/14-Utah-companies-make-the-Inc-500-list.html?pg=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, SwarmBuilder was rebranded as Experticity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705397112/SwarmBuilder-rebrands-as-eXperticity-to-link-experts.html?pg=all]&lt;/ref&gt; based on the idea that when buying a product, everyone wants to get advice from an expert. The name “Experticity” was purchased from an unrelated Seattle based-business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vspring.com/news/91/19/SwarmBuilder-Rebrands-as-eXperticity]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Experticity was renamed ExpertVoice, the name is meant to reflect the fact that consumers turn to the voices of experts for advice on what to buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.experticity.com/experticity-now-expertvoice/|title=Experticity is now ExpertVoice - ExpertVoice|date=2018-03-13|work=ExpertVoice|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

3point5.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/3point5-com]&lt;/ref&gt;  trains retail sales associates across various industries through a patented “Edu-Game” format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/25/idUS115441+25-Jan-2012+BW20120125]&lt;/ref&gt;  When sales associates complete Edu-Games demonstrating product knowledge, they are rewarded with gratis or discounted products from the brand sponsoring the training.

ProMotive.com is an online marketplace for experts with significant personal and professional industry influence. ProMotive.com automates brand incentive programs and rewards industry professionals and influencers with product offers, discounts, samples and insider knowledge applicable to their field of expertise.

Each of the Experticity platforms displays users’ expert score, which is a composite blend of product knowledge, purchases and professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/25/idUS115441+25-Jan-2012+BW20120125]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive Leadership==

Tom Stockham is the CEO  of Experticity, having served on the company’s board of directors since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/thomas-stockham/]&lt;/ref&gt; He was formerly CEO and president of [[Ancestry.com]] and president of [[Ticketmaster.com]].

'''''Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work and in Life One Conversation at a Time''''' ({{ISBN|0-425-19337-3}}) is a [[self-help book]] written by Susan Scott, about how to have a difficult conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astd.org/Publications/Blogs/Learning-Executive-Blog/2012/04/Book-Review-Fierce-Conversations |title=Book Review - Fierce Conversations |author=Steve Gladis |date=April 19, 2012 |work=Learning Executive Blog |publisher=[[American Society for Training &amp; Development]] |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction states that ''Fierce Conversations'' is a "guide to tackling your toughest challenges and enriching relationships with everyone important to your success and happiness through principles, tools, and assignments designed to direct you through your first fierce conversations with yourself on to the most challenging and important conversations facing you."&lt;ref name=page1-2&gt;Scott et al., p. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectconnections.com/knowhow/book_reviews_short/brs_fierce-conversations.html |title=Book review of "Fierce Conversations" |author= |date= |work=ProjectConnections |publisher=Emprend, Inc |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author states that the book is based on her experience running think tanks and designing and delivering training.&lt;ref name=page1-2 /&gt; The book was published by Viking in 2002 (hardcover version) and then by the [[Berkley Publishing Group]] in 2004 (paperback version). It has since become a [[Wall Street Journal]] and [[UPI]] bestseller.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Fierce conversations==
The author defines a fierce conversation as "One in which we come out from behind ourselves, into the conversation and make it real."&lt;ref name=page7&gt;Scott et al., p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that interpersonal difficulties are a direct result of our inability to communicate well.&lt;ref name=page7/&gt;

Michael Brisciana has stated that "I worry that some of their most enthusiastic adherents can seem more eager for the 'fierce' (i.e., 'confrontational') part of the concept than the 'conversation'".  Perhaps due to a misunderstanding of the book, they have the wrong kind of conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrperspectives.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/constructive-conversations-not-fierce-ones/#more-1171 |title=Constructive Conversations&amp;nbsp;...

The '''Financial District''' is a [[highrise]] office area of within the central business district of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]'s [[Downtown Vancouver|downtown peninsula]]. Located roughly along [[Burrard Street|Burrard]] and [[Georgia Street|West Georgia Street]]s, the Financial District contains more than 60% of [[Greater Vancouver]]'s office space and is home to headquarter offices of forest products and mining companies. The area contains numerous federal and non-governmental organizations (NGO) offices, Overseas missions and consulates, and headquarter and branch offices of national and international banks and financial services, accounting and law firms, and luxury hotels.

==History==

The city's financial district emerged in the early 1900s when the building boom in the area began. From 1907 to 1913 a number of office buildings were built in the area along West Hastings Street:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Vancouver%27s+financial+district+emerged&amp;meta=&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sun Tower
* Dominion Trust Building
* Vancouver Stock Exchange

The financial district only expanded after the 1970s, with much of the new buildings emerging after the 1980s.

Vancouver's financial district is compact area when compared to other world cities. Most of the skyscrapers in the district are regional offices of the Big Five Canadian-based or International banks and various financial services institutions.

The '''Hamburg Chamber of Commerce''' (''Handelskammer Hamburg''), originally named the '''Commercial Deputation''' (''Commerz-Deputation''), is the [[chamber of commerce]] for the city state of [[Hamburg]], and was founded in 1665. Hamburg has for centuries been a commercial centre of [[Northern Europe]], and the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce currently has 160,000 companies as its members. It was traditionally one of the three main political bodies of Hamburg.

==Role==

The chamber has several official responsibilities. The [[Hamburg Stock Exchange]] (founded in 1558) is owned by and subordinate to the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has its offices in the old stock exchange building.&lt;ref&gt;Leitbild der Handelskammer Hamburg ''[http://www.hk24.de/servicemarken/ueber_uns/wir/Leitbild_Endversion_Handbuch.PDF www.hk24.de]'' (PDF) {{de icon}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Commercial Deputation, founded in 1665, originally consisted of seven members, elected among the city's "honourable merchants." Each member became President of the Commercial Deputation during his last year in office. The Commercial Deputation was officially recognised by the Hamburg council (senate) in 1674 as the representation of the city's merchants. From 1710, all the seven members of the Commercial Deputation were also ''[[ex officio]]'' members of the ''Erbgesessene Bürgerschaft'' (the [[Hamburg Parliament]]). The Commercial Deputation was, along with council/senate and ''Bürgerschaft'', one of the most important political bodies of Hamburg. 

In 1735, the ''Commerzbibliothek'' (Library of Commerce) was founded, and is the oldest library of its kind. In 1867, the Commercial Deputation was transformed into the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce. 

Since 2004 the Chamber of Commerce organizes the bi-annual [[Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe]].

International economic structures range from complete [[autarky]] to complete market openness. This structure has undergone numerous changes since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The state-power theory as put into perspective by [[Stephen Krasner]] (1976), explains that the structure of international trade is determined by the interests and power of states acting to maximize their aggregate national income, social stability, political power and economic growth. Such state interests can be achieved under free trade.

The relationship between these interests and the level of openness depends upon the economic power of states. Power is dependent upon a states size and level of economic development.

Krasner contends that distributions of potential power may vary from multipolar to hegemonic; and different international trading structures are made of either of these. The key to this argument is that a hegemonic distribution of potential economic power is likely to result in an open trading system. Since states act to maximize their aggregate economic utility, maximum global welfare is achieved under free trade.

Neoclassical trade theory posits that the greater the degree of openness in the international trading system, the greater the level of aggregate economic income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krasner|first=Stephen D|title=State Power and the Structure of International Trade|journal=World Politics|year=1976|volume=28|issue=3|pages=317–347|doi=10.2307/2009974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Realism===

[[Robert Gilpin]] and [[Stephen Krasner]] are advocates of the realist tradition, which emphasises the hegemonic system. The hegemonic system contends that there are states that are much larger and more developed than their trading partners and therefore, the costs and benefits of openness are not symmetrical for all members of the system. Krasner (1976) contends that the hegemonic state will have a preference for an open structure because it will increase its aggregate national income and  power.

Realism emphasizes states' demands for power and security. Military force is therefore, the most important power resource. States must rely ultimately on their own resources and must strive to maintain their power positions in the system, even at high economic costs. For realism, the most important variables are the economic and military strength of hegemonic states; and international hostilities are mainly because of variations in the distribution of political-military capabilities between states.

====Hegemonic stability====

The theory of hegemonic stability by the realist school argues that dominance of one country is necessary for the existence of an open and stable international economy. The relationship between hegemony and an open, stable economy has been challenged by some scholars “As US behaviour during the interwar period illustrates, the possession of superior resources by a nation does not translate automatically into great influence or beneficial outcomes for the world.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=H V|title=International Political Economy: Beyond Hegemonic Stability|journal=Foreign Policy|year=1998|volume=110|pages=112–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development policy====

Realist trade encourages [[Import substitution industrialization]] (ISI) replacing imports with domestic production. Realism recognises that trade regulations can be used to correct domestic distortions and to promote new industries.

Under realism, states possess a high degree of discretionary power to influence many variables and prices in the economy. The government influences the distribution of investment, thus protecting national industries.

====International institutions====

Realists with their focus on power and the struggle for survival in an anarchical world, criticize the role of international institutions that govern the world economy, such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[European Union|EU]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).  Scholars argue that the influence exerted by international institutions is dependent upon the states that form part of them, and therefore international institutions have little independent impact. Accordingly, the realist school emphasises the impact of state power over the strength of the institution per se.

===Liberalism===

The liberal tradition consists of two schools of thought on the causes of peace, one emphasises representative government and international institutions and the other advocates global markets and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gartzke &amp; Hewitt|title=International Crisis and the Capital Peace|journal=International Interactions|year=2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=115–145|doi=10.1080/03050621003784846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism traces back to [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kantian Liberalism posits that democracy, economic interdependence and international organisations are optimal solutions for reducing the incidence of conflict. It is not individual factors, which lead to a more peaceful world, but rather all three elements working in conjunction, which eliminates conflict.

Oneal and Russett’s (2001) research design has become a standard choice of replications in studies assessing the Kantian peace triangle where democracies tend to be interdependent and members of the same International Government Organisations (IGOs). Their research is consistent with the argument that democratic peace advocates economic interdependence and a joint need to attain membership in IGOs in order to prevent the incidence of conflict. However, the empirical findings on the Kantian peace triangle as a joint force to eliminate conflict presents some limitations, as one study found that the three Kantian peace variables are less robust in explaining leaders’ conflict behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=Seung-Whan|title=Beyond Kantian Liberalism: Peace through Globalisation?|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|year=2010|volume=27|pages=272–295|doi=10.1177/0738894210366513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keohane and Nye (2000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keohane|first=Robert|author2=Nye|title=Power and Interdependence Revisited|journal=International Organization|year=1987|volume=41|pages=725–753|doi=10.1017/s0020818300027661}}&lt;/ref&gt; go further to include the lack of additional components in this theory including environmental and military measurements.

====Trade====

Liberals emphasise two main aspects of the benefits of trade. First, trade promotes states to work together and cooperatively, reinforcing peaceful relations among trading partners. The second benefit is based on the expected utility model of trade and conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiang, Xu &amp; Keteku|title=Power: The Missing Link in the Trade Conflict Relationship|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=2007|volume=51|issue=4|pages=646–663|doi=10.1177/0022002707302802}}&lt;/ref&gt;   which emphasises the potential economic consequences of a disruption in trade. Countries are therefore deterred from initiating conflict against a trading partner for fear of losing the welfare gains associated with trade.

====Interdependence====

Liberals argue that economic interdependence between states reduces conflict because conflict discourages commerce.

Recent cost-benefit calculations of trade take into account information as an important component in the explanation of the pacifying aspect of economic interdependence. Through open trade, states reveal their intentions and capabilities and thus “relations become more transparent and reduce uncertainty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bussman|first=Margit|title=Foreign direct investment and militarized international conflict|journal=Journal of Peace Research|year=2010|volume=47|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1177/0022343309354143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, economic interdependence makes costly signals possible. If military action did not entail loss, national leaders would not be able to communicate their capabilities and resolve. This acts as a deterrent and promotes peace between states. “Mechanisms that facilitate the transmission of credible information across international boundaries limit bargaining failure, enhancing interstate peace.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|title=Domestic Political Audiences and the Escalation of International Disputes|journal=American Political Science Review|year=1994|volume=88|pages=577–592|doi=10.2307/2944796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement about the interdependence liberal thesis among some scholars. Kenneth Waltz, for example, argues that since "close interdependence means closeness of contact and raises the prospect of at least occasional conflict . . . the [liberal] myth of interdependence . . . asserts a false belief about the conditions that may promote peace." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mansfield &amp; Pevehouse|title=Trade blocs, trade flows and international conflict|journal=International Organization|year=2000|volume=54|issue=4|pages=775–808|doi=10.1162/002081800551361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the scrutiny, there is a long-held position that economic interdependence has a pacifying effect on interstate relations, evidenced by research conducted by Oneal &amp; Russett 1999 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oneal &amp; Russett|title=Assessing the Liberal Peace with alternative specifications: Trade still reduces conflict|journal=Journal of Peace Research|year=1999|volume=36|pages=423–442|doi=10.1177/0022343399036004003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Xiang et al. 2007.

According to the liberal view, the costly nature of conflict is central to contemporary bargaining theory.

Keohane &amp; Nye (1987) put forth four conditions that make the use of force by large states costly:

# Risks of nuclear escalation
# Resistance by people in poor or weak countries
# Uncertain and possibly negative effects on the achievement of economic goals
# Domestic opinion opposed to the human costs of the use of force

====Development policy====

Liberal trade encourages export led growth (ELG), leaving traders and consumers dependent on foreign markets. Liberals argue that these actors have an incentive to avoid hostilities with their trading partners, since any disruption in commercial relations would be costly.

====International institutions====

International institutions are a key feature of the liberal peace, because they represent credible signals of resolve to defend member states in times of crisis, regulate state behaviour, facilitate communication and create common security interests between member states.

==The argument about trade and conflict==

The relationship between international trade and conflict has been a source of controversy among international relations scholars. Some scholars argue that trade does not reduce conflict even though conflict reduces trade; while others report that international trade fosters a peaceful disposition among states, which are less likely to resort to armed conflict in times of crisis.

The argument that open trade inhibits conflict dates back to the classical liberal movement of free trade and world peace. This view argues that increasing interaction among traders and consumers (interdependence) promotes peace; free trade fosters a sense of international community that reduce interstate conflict and tensions. Liberals posit that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict. The contrasting contemporary view is that open trade dampens political conflict by promoting economic dependence.

Economic dependence has negative consequences for interstate conflict. [[Albert O. Hirschman]] (1945)  for example, has pointed out that the “gains from trade do not accrue to states proportionately and the distribution of these gains can affect interstate power relations. Moreover, shifts in power relations are widely regarded as a potent source of military conflict.”

===Economic interdependence===

Economic interdependence and greater openness exposes domestic economies to the exigencies of the world market. Social instability is therefore increased by exposure to international competition. This negative force undermines the Kantian peace and remains a cause for concern in international conflict. Although this concern seems legitimate given the economic disparities between developed and developing countries, studies fail to provide comprehensive empirical evidence.

Another view at odds with liberalism is that technological innovation and industrialization increase the ability of some countries to exercise power. As trade flows and the level of interdependence increases, so do the incentives for states to take military actions to reduce their economic vulnerability.

The adverse effect of trade on state security is difficult to determine, however the more competition, the more aggressive the environment. Openness and competition increases social instability because domestic prices need to adjust to changes in international prices. Consistent with the realists view that states are essentially always in conflict, social instability and resource competition are motives for conflict and states will rely on the use of force to attain their own political goals and interests.

===The role of military power===

A number of international relations scholars, notably Xiang, Xu &amp; Keteku 2007; [[Mearsheimer]] 2001, recognise the role of military power in initiating conflict, as well as the role militarily powerful countries play in international trade. One argument suggests that militarily capable countries are more likely to have the motivation to initiate armed conflict due to their awareness of their capabilities and to their confidence in achieving favourable outcomes.

A second argument suggests that power facilitates trade. Third, there are positive benefits from economic interdependence on military power. Finally, the economic stature of a country determines both the military power and level of trade of that country, hinting that economic powerful states trade more. Because powerful countries are better positioned to take advantage of the benefits resulting from international trade and to transform welfare gains into military power, they also are more likely to use force when their positions are threatened.

Similarly, Gartzke &amp; Hewitt (2010) argue that the “extension of economic and other interests beyond national borders increases incentives to police relevant regions and exercise influence, sometimes through force.”

===Unequal peace===

The motives for conflict, which historically were concentrated among the powerful and their ambitious challengers, are today clustered among the poor, and between the poor and the rich (Gartzke &amp; Hewitt (2010). Theory has prompted to inequality as a potential source of internal conflict. ”Inequalities within the same countries has increased, not through impoverishment of the masses, but because while wealth is created many people remain left behind in poverty. Thus, we have an unequal peace." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleditsch|first=Nils Petter|title=The Liberal Moment Fifteen Years On|journal=International Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=52|issue=4|pages=691–712|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00522.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 60 countries suffer not only from low GDP per capita but also low or negative growth. These countries tend to be caught in armed conflict among other development traps. Some argue that the evidence surrounding inequality and conflict remains inconclusive, calling for further empirical studies.

Studies show that states with the most dissimilar interests possess a motive for conflict but whether they experience conflict (or not) depends on external determinants of bargaining success or failure. These determinants include uncertainty about the balance of power, opponent’s resolve as well as policy dissimilarities between competing states.  Interests are important determinants of whether conflict occurs.  According to Gartzke &amp; Hewitt (2010), promoting democratic interests, or even imposing them for peace, is not likely to reduce conflict “it may even lead to a weakening of the actual determinants of liberal peace”, thereby increasing interstate tensions. Contemporary research demonstrates that promoting free markets and economic development helps mitigate conflict and promote peace

==Capitalist peace==

The capitalist peace thesis suggests that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict.

Research on the capitalist peace has chosen to pursue the liberal political economy school, with a particular focus on Kant's [[Perpetual Peace]].  The same set of theoretical frameworks that evolved in democratic peace research now asserts itself in the capitalist peace (Gartzke &amp; Hewitt 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;121).

The capitalist peace sees capitalism as creating conditions to make war more costly and therefore undesirable by trading states. Traditional interpretations of the capital peace contend that development and global markets will eventually eliminate resource competition as a motive for war. This view was eventually deemed outdated, as “it became clear that needed raw materials would continue to make their way to industrial centers through free markets, rather than through mercantilist autarkies (Gartzke &amp; Hewitt, 2010, p. 122).

The capitalist theory contends that as economies become stronger, prosperous capitalist states no longer need to threaten one another over access to inputs to production. Consequently, the security dilemma loses its relevance.

Scholars like [[Michael Mousseau]] argue that democracies are only peaceful in pairs. Other research has demonstrated that the democratic peace is even more exclusive than previously imagined, limiting the finding to developed democracies. Gartzke and Hewitt (2010) challenged this by demonstrating that it is economic development and market freedoms, rather than political liberty that result in interstate peace.

===Deterrent effect of institutional ties===

International Government Organisations (IGOs) are designed to promote cooperation and inhibit political disputes. Institutional ties promote the exchange of information about the economic gains and losses of participating member states, thereby reducing uncertainty about the distribution of benefits.

Regional institutions also present great influence in addressing issues beyond trade. Regional economic institutions help develop trade expectations for the future. “High economic stakes that states have in the continuation and growth of economic activity in the context of economic regionalism lead to a security community in which states develop a genuine interest in not only keeping peace with each other, but also defending their relationship against outside aggressors.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aydin|first=Aysegul|title=The deterrent effects of economic integration|journal=Journal of Peace Research|year=2010|volume=47|pages=523–533|doi=10.1177/0022343310370290}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to their role in dispute settlement, regional arrangements can deter aggressors from targeting institutionally connected states.

Aydin (2010) makes an important contribution to the extended deterrence literature and economic peace research through his empirical study on the deterrent effect of economic integration. This study shows that trade has a general deterrent effect on attackers when the target is economically integrated with potential defenders through regional trade institutions. When trade is conducted in an institutionalised setting it can have political implications beyond bilateral interdependence.

Research shows that economic integration decreases the opportunities to fight and enhances the opportunities to intervene in crisis. Mansfield &amp; Pevehouse (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;776) present strong evidence that “the combination of PTA membership (preferential trading arrangements) and a high level of trade is quite likely to discourage belligerence.”

Many PTAs have become venues for addressing political disputes between participants and fostering cooperation. Observers have widely acknowledged, for example, that [[ASEAN]] has helped to manage tensions in Southeast Asia. Mercado Comun del Sur ([[MERCOSUR]]) has done likewise, improving political-military relations throughout the southern cone. (Mansfield &amp; Pevehouse, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;781). The reciprocal nature of this system helps guarantee that economic concessions made by one state will be repaid, rather than exploited by its counterpart.

==International investment flows==

Another area to add to the existing literature on economic integration is the impact of militarized conflict on foreign investment.

Bussman’s (2010) contribution to the liberal notion that conflict inhibits foreign investment, complements the liberal peace arguments in conflict studies. Bussman’s research shows that international conflict reduces international investment flows considerably.

Bussman contends that “as with trade, foreign investment could be an important factor in promoting peace. States might avoid violent conflict in order not to deter foreign investors.”  By ensuring political stability, states can thus create an environment that is desirable to foreign investors. It is therefore, in the best interest of states to keep away from belligerent behaviour as they could potentially miss out on the welfare gains associated with foreign investment.

As a result, states that benefit from foreign direct investment flows are less likely to experience the onset of militarized conflict.

'''Jacob Muschong''' ({{lang-hu|Jakab Muschong}}, {{lang-ro|Iacob Muschong}}, born 1868, [[Nagykikinda]], [[Austria-Hungary]] - died December 13, 1923, [[Lugoj]], [[Romania]]) was a [[Banat German]] industrialist, business magnate, philanthropist and investor who made a fortune producing bricks.&lt;ref name="József Kádár - Az óbudai Viktória"&gt;[http://epa.oszk.hu/03000/03058/00001/pdf/EPA03058_budapest_2015_01_011-013.pdf József Kádár - Az óbudai Viktória]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as the ''Brick King''. He revived the Spa of [[Busiasch]].

==Life==
===Early years===
He was born in [[Nagykikinda]] (Serbian: ''Velika Kikinda, ''now ''Kikinda'', [[Serbia]]), a town in the [[Banat]], in a [[Banat Swabian]] family with a long tradition in the production of bricks, however he had [[French people in Hungary#Banat French|Banat French]] origin.&lt;ref name="József Kádár - Az óbudai Viktória"/&gt; His surname was written as ''Mougeon'' before it got germanized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/17330/1/tanarkepzo_1958_1_155-175.pdf László Palásti - Franciák és a francia nyelv a Bánátban a XVIII. és a XIX. században]&lt;/ref&gt; His grandparents and great-grandparents produced bricks in workshops located at the edge of [[Lugoj]].&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1732790-jacob-muschong-cel-mai-bogat-lugojean-din-toate-timpurile.htm|title=Jacob Muschong, cel mai bogat lugojean din toate timpurile|date=2005-08-12|publisher=hotnews.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dampfziegelwerke AG===
[[File:Actiune Muschong 25000 Lei.jpg|thumb|right|250px|25,000 share of the ''Dampfziegelwerke AG'' (''Stream Brick Factory'') in [[Lugos]] (1923)]]
At the age of 20 years he married Margaret Bohn the daughter of a famous [[Germany|German]] industrialist specialized in the production of tiles and bricks that built the brick factory at [[Zsombolya]] (now Jimbolia, Romania) and [[Gyertyámos]] (Cărpiniş) and had other several factories in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt;

At the age of 20, Muschong and his wife founded the ''M. Bohn &amp; Comp.'' which in 1888 built a brick factory in [[Lugoj]]. After several years  he built a new plant in Lugoj and bought several factories from his competitors. In 1908 the company changed its name to ''J. Muschong &amp; Comp.''&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; Muschong brick and tile products were of high quality and were sold throughout the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and then in [[Greater Romania]]. Muschong built more factories in [[Banat]] but he also built one at the outskirts of [[Budapest]]. In 1910 his company had 357 employees which made it the 23rd biggest employer in the [[Banat]] and the biggest in Lugoj.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vikek.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KEKNo292015.2.szám.pdf Közép-Európai Közlemények - A történelemtudomány, a regionális tudomány, a földrajztudomány, és a gazdálkodás- és szervezéstudományok művelőinek folyóirata - VIII. year 2.

===Bad Busiasch===
He was also the founder of the [[Buziaş|Buziaş Spa]] (''{{lang-de|Bad Busiasch}}'', ''{{lang-hu|Buziásfürdő}}'').&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; He bought the bath and the 100 ha forest around it in 1906 from the family of the Hungarian tire manufacturer, Ernő Schottola. He built a bottling hall to produce bottled mineral water under the names ''Phönix''&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.nyugatijelen.com/2003/2003%20februar/feb.%2022-23%20szombat-vasarnap/jelen.html Nyugati Jelen - Sipos - Újabb tulajdonosváltás előtt Buziásfürdő?]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Muschong''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/de/record/2032009/Hungarian_20National_20Museum_data_hnm_hu_object_1453957.html Europeana Collections - Buziási "Phönix" forrás savanyúvize | Muschong Jakab; Grafikai Intézet Rt.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also built a carbon acid factory in 1907 for 2 million [[Austro-Hungarian krone|krones]]. The main export market for the mineral waters was the [[Balkan]] region. The plant had 700 m^2 area where the 700 [[horsepower|HP]] steam engine and 60 HP electric engines provided the driving force. The plant had 36 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/magyarorszgvrmeg18szik/magyarorszgvrmeg18szik_djvu.txt Samu Borovszky - Magyarország vármegyéi és városai - MAGYARORSZÁG MONOGRÁFIÁJA - Temes vármegye]&lt;/ref&gt;

He carried out probing drills, which were successful: the water came from 103 meters deep and it became medically proven that the water was good for [[gout]] or [[gastric lavage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infotourism.info/hu/news/Temes-megye-----Buziasfurdo infotourism.info - Temes megye – Buziásfürdő]&lt;/ref&gt; He also laid the beautiful spa gardens with valuable plants, built a 500-meter-long covered walkway, 22 villas for spa guests, a zoo and sports fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adz.ro/banater-zeitung/artikel-banater-zeitung/artikel/gruenes-licht-fuer-sanierung-des-kurparks/ Balthasar Waitz - Grünes Licht für die Sanierung des Kurparks - February 8, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; He also raised a hotel in 1922-1923 which he named ''Muschong Hotel'' (now ''Felix Hotel'') after himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hetiujszo.ro/graur-janos-buziasfurdo-legenda-es-valosag-az-emlekek-tukreben-6-befejezo-resz/ Heti Újszó - Graur János – Buziásfürdő Legenda és valóság az emlékek tükrében]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he built a 2.9&amp;nbsp;km long railway with a normal gauge (1435&amp;nbsp;mm) between [[Buziaş]] railway station and the spa. According to the 1958 timetable, the journey took 7 minutes between the two stations. (On October 10, 1973 the railway line was dismantled.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vasutallomasok.hu/allomas.php?az=buzb - Buziásfürdő]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1948 the spa, the hotels and the bottling plant stayed in the Muschong family's ownership. Then it was nationalized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://geografie.uvt.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/15_Ribana.pdf Ribana Linc, Angela Ioana MARUŞCA - Spas at the west of the country]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budapest===
According to the ''Cégfelszámoló'' (''Company Directory'') he was named as liquidator of the ''Egyesült magyar kénsavgyárak értékesítő szövetkezete'' (''United Sulfuric Acid Manufacturers Cooperative'', est. 1909, 11 Ipar utca, [[Ferencváros|District IX]], [[Budapest]]), shareholder of ''Kőbányai Gőztéglagyár'' (''Steam Brick Factory of Kőbánya'', est. 1876, 1 Erzsébet-körút, [[Erzsébetváros|District VII]], [[Budapest]]) and shareholder of the ''Közönséges tömörfaltéglákat árusító részvénytársaság'' (''Ordinary Solid Wallbrick Selling plc'', est. 1900, 27 [[Andrássy út]], [[Terézváros|District VI]]).&lt;ref name="library.hungaricana.hu"&gt;[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/FszekCimNevTarak_26_028/?pg=307&amp;layout=s&amp;query=muschong Cégmutató Budapest bejegyzett működő cégeiről 1921.

[[File:Hotel Timis Lugoj.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Muschong Palace'' (today ''Timiș Hotel'') in [[Lugoj]]]]

One of the most emblematic buildings of Lugoj is the ''Timiș Hotel'' which was built in 1926 as the ''Muschong Palace'' and was owned by Jakob Muschong.

===Later years===
In 1913 he worked as the CEO of ''Ziegel- und Kalkbrennerei AG'' in [[Budapest]] while his son, ''Jakab Muschong Jr'' was the manager of [[Bad Busiasch]], co-leader of the ''Ziegel- und Kalkbrennerei AG'' and ''Hatzfelder Dampfziegelei AG'', [[Zsombolya]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.zedhia.at/page/public/cpa_000273-1850/compass-1913-i-band Compass 1913, I. Band - Seite 1850]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Great Union]] of 1918 the Romanian authorities began the persecution of Jacob Muschong, considering that he opposes Romanian capital development.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; He is teased and persecuted by a broad campaign of denigration by the media. Many financial controls from the authorities followed which discovered accounting irregularities alleged in the statements of income, considering the amounts invested by Muschong as profit and forcing him to pay tax on them.

===Death===
Soon after, Muschong died in a heart attack on December 13, 1923 at his residence in Lugoj.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt;

After his death no one in the family could raise to the level of driving experience and ability that Jacob had. His wealth re-evaluated in today's money would probably amounts to over three billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1722574-imperiul-muschong-naste-mostenitori.htm|title=Imperiul Muschong naste mostenitori|date=2006-04-15|publisher=hotnews.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; All his factories were nationalized by the communists in 1948 and largely demolished. Instead of his largest brick factory located on Timişorii street in [[Lugoj]] the communists built the Tiles and Sanitary Equipment Factory ''Mondial'' which was later privatized in 1996 to German investors and still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://emt.ro/sites/default/files/archivum/program/Esemény%20archívum%20beküldése/emt_bkf_program_2007.pdf Dr Árpád Jancsó - Bányászati-kohászati kirándulásvezet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married to Margaret Bohn and had two daughters, Margit and Borbála and a son, Jakab. According to the ''Cégfelszámoló'' (''Company Directory'') his son, Jakab Muschong Jr. had a grenade patron company in 6203 Külső Bécsi út, [[Budapest]], [[Óbuda-Békásmegyer|Disctrict III]].&lt;ref name="library.hungaricana.hu"/&gt;

Salami was born in [[Ibadan]] to the family of Salami and Oyebimpe Oyetunde, his father was a younger brother to the late [[Olubadan]] Shittu Akintola Oyetunde. The family's compound was in the Eleta neighborhood of Ibadan, hence he was given the moniker Salami Eleta when he was young.{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=6}} He started learning by taking Quranic lessons at the age of three and when he was seven, he started attending an Islamic School. He later attended Ibadan Boys High School and [[Lisabi Grammar School]], Abeokuta.{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=7}}

Thereafter, he aligned with [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] and was a member of [[Akintola]]'s faction.{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=25}} He was elected back into the Ibadan District Council in 1961 and was later appointed as executive director, Western Nigeria Development Corporation. After the military coup of [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|January 15, 1966]], Salami was placed in detention for five months{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=27}} before he was freed by soldiers during the [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|counter-coup of July 1966]].

===relationship with Shooting Stars===
Salami had been a fan of many amateur local football clubs since 1937 when the first amateur team in Ibadan, Hercules club was founded.

During his time with the group, he was a team manager of the lions and later president of the association. His appointment to the Western Nigeria Sports Council led to his resignation from the association due to potential conflict of interest. But while in the association, he joined a group of young members such as J.O. Obi and supported renumeration for football players{{sfn|Sanni|2005|p=34}} during a time football in the city was still at an amateur stage and players had part-time work and sometimes bought their own equipment. In 1963, when he was appointed an executive director with [[Western State (Nigeria)|Western Nigeria]] Development Corporation. At WNDC, he helped launch the Ibadan-based WNDC Sports club later known as WNDC Shooting Stars, IICC Shooting Stars and 3SC.

'''Mary Parker Follett''' (September 3, 1868 - December 18, 1933) was an American social worker, [[management consultant]], philosopher and pioneer in the fields of [[organizational theory]] and [[organizational behavior]]. Along with [[Lillian Gilbreth]], she was one of two great women management experts in the early days of classical management theory. She has been called the "Mother of Modern Management".&lt;ref&gt;"The Theory of Social and Economic Organizations"; Talcott Parsons, transl., 1947; distilled from Weber's multi-volume work, "Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft" (Economy and Society).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Follett was born in 1868 in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], Massachusetts to a wealthy [[Quaker]] family.  Her family was composed of Charles Allen Follett, a machinist in a local shoe factory, and Elizabeth Curtis (née Baxter) Follett, respectively of English-Scottish and Welsh descent, and a younger brother. Follett attended [[Thayer Academy]], a collegiate preparatory day school in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], while spending much of her free time caring for her disabled mother. In September 1885 she enrolled in [[Anna Eliot Ticknor|Anna Ticknor]]'s [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mary P. Follett: Creating Democracy, Transforming Management'', Tonn, Joan C., New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003. p. 34&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1890-91, she studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] and then moved to study at Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] (later known as [[Radcliffe College]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Administrative Theories and Management Thought|last=Sapru|first=R.K.|publisher=PHI Learning|year=2010|isbn=8120335619|pages=160–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 6 years Follett attended the university on an irregular basis eventually graduating summa cum laude in 1898. Her Radcliffe thesis, ''The Speaker of the House of Representatives'', was published in 1896. She would go on to apply to Harvard but would be denied entrance to the university on the basis that she was a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Follett, M.P. (1918). ''The New State, Chapter XIV'': The Group Principle at Work".&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next three decades, she published many works. She was one of the first women ever invited to address the [[London School of Economics]], where she spoke on cutting-edge management issues. She also distinguished herself in the field of management by being sought out by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as his personal consultant on managing not-for-profit, non-governmental, and voluntary organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Stohr, Mary, Collins, Peter A., ''Criminal Justice Management, 2nd Ed.: Theory and Practice in Justice-Centered Organizations''
(United Kingdom, Taylor Francis Ltd, 2013), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and influences==
Follett's educational and work background would shape and influence her future theories and writings. One of her earliest career positions would see her working as a social worker in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston from 1900-08. During this period her interactions with the Roxbury community would lead her to realize the importance of community spaces as areas to meet and socialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212320/Mary-Parker-Follett|title=M.P. Follett|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=May 4, 2015|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|last=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her experience in developing vocational guidance and evening programs in public schools, she would develop what would be her life's work and her theories in group dynamics. "The New State", her second writing published in 1918, would evolve from a report into her second published work. This publication would go on to lay the foundational theories for her most important theories and become a major center of attention of her career.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.com.washington.edu/graduate/assets/publicservice/ps_bassett.html "Mary Parker Follett: A Public Scholar "Far Ahead of Her Time""], Bassett, D. (Retrieved Dec. 6, 2011). "Mary Parker Follett: A Public Scholar 'Far Ahead of her Time'", washington.edu; accessed June 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

By participating in local recreational, educational, and advocacy groups Parker developed her ideals of participatory democracy and her ideals of society as "integrative." Observing people led Parker to believe that the boundaries of a person's identities are porous, effected by the society around them, and that society in turn is effected by the identities of the people within it. Thus the self and the society, according to Parker, are in a cycle in which they constantly help to create one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whipps|first1=J|title=A Pragmatist Reading of Mary Parker Follett's integrative process|journal=Transactions of the Charles S Pierce Society|date=2014|volume=50|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational theory===
In her capacity as a management theorist, Follett pioneered the understanding of lateral processes within hierarchical organizations (which recognition led directly to the formation of matrix-style organizations, the first of which was DuPont, in the 1920s), the importance of informal processes within organizations, and the idea of the "authority of expertise"—which really served to modify the typology of authority developed by her German contemporary, [[Max Weber]], who broke authority down into three separate categories: rational-legal, traditional and charismatic.&lt;ref&gt;"The Theory of Social and Economic Organizations"; Talcott Parsons (translated 1947); distilled from Weber's multi-volume work, ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'' (''Economy and Society'').&lt;/ref&gt;

She recognized the holistic nature of community and advanced the idea of "reciprocal relationships" in understanding the dynamic aspects of the individual in relationship to others. Follett advocated the principle of what she termed "integration," or noncoercive power-sharing based on the use of her concept of "power with" rather than "power over."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mary P. Follett. "Dynamic Administration: The Collected Papers of Mary Parker Follett", ed. by E. M. Fox and L. Urwick (London: Pitman Publishing, 1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

Follett contributed greatly to the [[win-win]] philosophy, coining the term in her work with groups. Her approach to conflict was to embrace it as a mechanism of diversity and an opportunity to develop integrated solutions rather than simply compromising.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, D.[http://www.com.washington.edu/graduate/assets/publicservice/ps_bassett.html "Mary Parker Follett: A Public Scholar 'Far Ahead of Her Time'"], washington.edu; retrieved December 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a pioneer in the establishment of [[community centers]].

===Follett's writings===
Follett's unique background often led her to take positions on major issues that mediated between the conventional viewpoints. In ''The New State'', she took the position on societal change that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is a mistake to think that social progress is to depend upon anything happening to the working people: some say that they are to be given more material goods and all will be well; some think they are to be given more "education" and the world will be saved. It is equally a mistake to think that what we need is the conversion to "unselfishness" of the capitalist class.''" &lt;ref&gt;Follett, M.P. (1918). ''The New State, Chapter XIV'': "The Group Principle at Work"&lt;!-- page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly her position on the Labor Movement was: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Neither working for someone nor paying someone's wages ought to give you power over them.''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mele|first1=D|title=Ethics in management: exploring the contributions of Mary Parker Follett|journal=International Journal of Public Administration|date=2007|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Transformational leadership===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
Ann Pawelec Deschenes (1998) found obscure reference pointing to Mary Parker Follett having coined the term "transformational leadership".  She quotes from Edith A. Rusch's ''The Social Construction of Leadership: From Theory to Praxis'' (1991):&lt;blockquote&gt;''... writings and lectures by Mary Parker Follett from as early as 1927 contained references to transformational leadership, the interrelationship of leadership and [[followership]], and the power of collective goals of leaders and followers'' (p. 8).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burns makes no reference to Follett in ''Leadership''. However, Rusch was able to trace what appear to be parallel themes in the works of Burns and Follett.  Rusch presents direct references in Appendix A.  Pawelec (Deschenes) found further parallels of transformational discourse between Follett's (1947, 1987) work and Burns (1978).{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

From The Collected Papers of Mary Parker Follett (p 247): "Moreover, we have now to lay somewhat less stress than formerly on this matter of the leader influencing his group because we now think of the leader as also being influenced by his group."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Influences==
Although most of Follett's writings remained known in very limited circles until republished at the beginning of this{{Which|date=August 2016}} decade, her ideas gained great influence after [[Chester Barnard]], a New Jersey Bell executive and advisor to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], published his seminal treatment of executive management, ''[[The Functions of the Executive]]''. Barnard's work, which stressed the critical role of "soft" factors such as "communication" and "informal processes" in organizations, owed a telling yet undisclosed debt to Follett's thought and writings. Her emphasis on such soft factors paralleled the work of [[Elton Mayo]] at Western Electric's Hawthorne Plant, and presaged the rise of the [[Human Relations Movement]], as developed through the work of such figures as [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Douglas McGregor]], [[Chris Argyris]] and other breakthrough contributors to the field of [[Organizational Development]] or "OD".&lt;ref&gt;Art Kleiner, ''The Age of Heretics: Heroes, Outlaws, and the Forerunners of Corporate Change'', New York: Doubleday, 1996.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Her influence can also be seen indirectly perhaps in the work of Ron Lippitt, Ken Benne, Lee Bradford, Edie Seashore and others at the [[National Training Laboratories]] in [[Bethel, Maine|Bethel]], Maine, where T-Group methodology was first theorized and developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, 1996, pp. 31-59 and photos, pp. 190-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Follett's work set the stage for a generation of effective, progressive changes in management philosophy, style and practice, revolutionizing and humanizing the American workplace, and allowing the fulfillment of Douglas McGregor's management vision—quantum leaps in productivity effected through the humanization of the workplace.&lt;ref name="mcgregor"&gt;Douglas McGregor, ''The Human Side of Enterprise'' (1960) McGraw-Hill, OCLC 573825859.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and legacy==
Follett died on December 18, 1933, in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Massachusetts. After her death her work and ideas would disappear from American organizational and management circles of the time but would continue to gain followership in Great Britain. In the last decades her work has been rediscovered. During the 1960s her ideas would re-emerge in Japan where management thinkers would apply her theories to business.

Management theorist [[Warren Bennis]] said of Follett's work, "Just about everything written today about leadership and organizations comes from Mary Parker Follett's writings and lectures."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.com/management/management-theory-of-mary-parker-follett/&lt;/ref&gt;

Her texts outline modern ideas under participatory management: decentralized decisions, integrating role of groups, and competition authority. Follett managed to reduce the gap between the mechanistic approach and contemporary approach that emphasizes human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mary Parker Follett Prophet of Management|last=Graham|first=Pauline|publisher=Beard Books|isbn=1587982137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her advocacy for schools to be used after hours for recreational and vocational use affected the Boston area where schools opened their doors after hours for such uses, and community centers were built where schools were not located, a revolutionary concept during the 20th century. Her experience working in this area taught her a lot about notions of democracy and led her to write more for a wider audience – particularly the business world.  She believed that good practice amongst business people would have a significant impact on other institutions.&lt;ref name="mcgregor"/&gt;

Follett's legacy has been recognized through the establishment, in 1992, of the annual Mary Parker Follett Award for the outstanding paper to appear each year in ''[[Accounting, Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal]]''. The award citation states that it is named "in memory of a pioneering woman in the field of management and accountability literature who was international and interdisciplinary in her approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Emerald Journals |title=Mary Parker Follett Awards 2017 |url=http://emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/news_story.htm?id=7518 |website=Emerald Publishing |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73495">The '''Master of [[Business Administration]]''' ('''MBA''' or '''M.B.A.''') degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought [[scientific management|scientific approaches to management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is “a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside”: Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as [[accounting]], [[applied statistics]], [[business communication]], [[business ethics]], [[business law]], [[finance]], [[managerial economics]], [[management]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[marketing]] and [[operations management|operations]] in a manner most relevant to management [[analysis]] and strategy.

Most programs also include [[elective course]]s and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example accounting, finance, and marketing. MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about sixty [[Course credit|credits]], nearly twice the number of credits typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the [[Master of Economics]], [[Master of Finance]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Science in Marketing]] and [[Master of Science in Management]].

The MBA is a [[terminal degree]] and a [[Professional school|professional degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/getting-your-masters-degree.aspx |title=Getting Your Master's Degree |publisher=Peterson's |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2014 | quote=A master's degree comes in only two options: a professional, or "terminal" master's degree, or an academic master's degree...A terminal degree is a means to an end; it will prepare you for entrance into a specific type or group of jobs.

Degrees from professional master's programs are usually marked by specific initials that denote their area of specialty, such as a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A) or Master of Library Science (M.L.S.) degree...Conversely, an academic degree centers on research and scholarly studies in a specific area.

A number of master's degrees lead students directly to, well, the end of the formal educational line.  One such example is the MFA, which is earned by practicing artists in fields such as creative writing, visual arts, and theater.  In the world of business administration degrees, an MBA is terminal.  Although a little research might turn up a handful of PhD options in the creative arts or business, these are different monsters; they don't take away from the fact the person with the MFA or the MBA has a terminal degree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[School accreditation|Accreditation]] bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education.

The first school of business in the [[United States]] was [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|The Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] established in 1881 through a donation from [[Joseph Wharton]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration]] established the first MBA program in 1908, with 15 faculty members, 33 regular students and 47 special students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = Andreas | year = 2014 | title = European management and European business schools: Insights from the history of business schools | url = | journal = European Management Journal | volume =  32| issue = | pages =  529–534| doi = 10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/about/history.html|title=History – About Us – Harvard Business School|work=Hbs.edu|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first-year curriculum was based on [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]’s scientific management. The number of MBA students at Harvard increased quickly, from 80 in 1908, over 300 in 1920, and 1,070 in 1930.&lt;ref name="Leach 1993 288"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire: Merchants, Power, and the Rise of a New American Culture|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=PA288}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, only American universities offered MBAs.

==Accreditation==

===United States===
[[Business school]] or MBA program accreditation by external agencies provides students and employers with an independent view of the school or program's quality, as well as whether the curriculum meets specific quality standards. The three major accrediting bodies in the United States are:
* [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), 
* [[Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs]] (ACBSP), and
* [[International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education]] (IACBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | ssrn=2144954 | first1 = Kyle E. | last1 = Brink | first2 = Clair | last2 = Smith | title = A Comparison of AACSB, ACBSP, and IACBE Accredited U.S. Business Programs: An Institutional Resource Perspective | journal = Business Education &amp; Accreditation | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages=1–15 | date = 2012 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these groups also accredit schools outside the US. The [[ACBSP]] and the [[IACBE]] are themselves recognized in the United States by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chea.org/programmatic-accrediting-organizations|title=CHEA Directory of Programmatic Accrediting Organizations}} Retrieved 23 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; MBA programs with specializations for students pursuing careers in healthcare management also eligible for accreditation by the [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME).

US MBA programs may also be accredited at the institutional level. Bodies that accredit institutions as a whole include:
* [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] (MSA),
* [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC),
* [[Higher Learning Commission]] (HLC),
* [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]] (NWCCU),
* [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS), and
* [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Other countries===
Accreditation agencies outside the United States include the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA), a UK-based organization that accredits MBA, DBA and MBM programs worldwide, government accreditation bodies such as the [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE), which accredits MBA and Postgraduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) programs across India. Some of the leading bodies in India that certify MBA institutions and their programs are the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC). A distance MBA program needs to be accredited by the Distance Education Council (DEC) in India. The Council on Higher Education (CHE) in South Africa, the [[European Foundation for Management Development]] operates the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS) for mostly European, Australian, New Zealand and Asian schools, the [[Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation]] (FIBAA), and [[Central and East European Management Development Association]] (CEEMAN) in Europe.

==Programs==
Full-time MBA programs normally take place over two academic years (i.e. approximately 18 months of term time). For example, in the Northern Hemisphere they often begin in late August or early September of year one and continue until May or June of year two, with a three to four month summer break in between years one and two. Students enter with a reasonable amount of prior real-world work experience and take classes during weekdays like other university students. A typical full-time, accelerated, part-time, or modular MBA requires 60 credits (600 class hours) of graduate work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=All Business Schools | title=How Long Does it Take to Get an MBA? | url=https://www.allbusinessschools.com/mba/length-of-mba-program/ | date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerated MBA programs are a variation of the two-year programs. They involve a higher course load with more intense class and examination schedules and are usually condensed into one year. They usually have less down time during the program and between semesters. For example, there is no three to four-month summer break, and between semesters there might be seven to ten days off rather than three to five weeks vacation. Accelerated programs typically have a lower cost than full-time two-year programs.

Part-time MBA programs normally hold classes on weekday evenings after normal working hours, or on weekends. Part-time programs normally last three years or more. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who take a light course load for a longer period of time until the graduation requirements are met.

Evening (second shift) MBA programs are full-time programs that normally hold classes on weekday evenings, after normal working hours, or on weekends for a duration of two years. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who can not leave their work to pursue a full-time regular shift MBA. Most second shift programs are offered at universities in India.

Modular MBA programs are similar to part-time programs, although typically employing a lock-step curriculum with classes packaged together in blocks lasting from one to three weeks.

{{Anchor|Executive MBA (EMBA)}}Executive MBA (EMBA) programs developed to meet the educational needs of managers and executives, allowing students to earn an MBA (or another business-related graduate degree) in two years or less while working full-time. Participants come from every type and size of organization – profit, nonprofit, government – representing a variety of industries. EMBA students typically have a higher level of work experience, often 10 years or more, compared to other MBA students. In response to the increasing number of EMBA programs offered, The Executive MBA Council was formed in 1981 to advance executive education.

Full-time executive MBA programs are a new category of full-time 1 year MBA programs aimed at professionals with approx. 5 years or more. They are primarily offered in countries like India where the 2-year MBA program is targeted at fresh graduates with no experience or minimal experience. These full-time executive MBA programs are similar to 1 year MBA programs offered by schools like Insead and IMD.

[[Distance learning]] MBA programs hold classes off-campus. These programs can be offered in a number of different formats: [[correspondence course]]s by [[postal mail]] or email, non-interactive [[broadcast video]], pre-recorded video, live [[teleconference]] or [[videoconference]], offline or online computer courses. Many schools offer these programs.

Blended learning programs combine distance learning with face-to-face instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=de l'Etraz, Paris |title=What Can an Online Program Do for You? |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |date=1 November 2009 |publisher=BizEd Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040945/http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs typically target working professionals who are unable to attend traditional part-time programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Hebert-Maccaro | title=Blended MBA Programs: An Optimized Form of Learning | url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/business/info/learning/images/pedagogy.pdf | date=8 September 2011 | publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBA dual degree programs combine an MBA with others (such as an MS, MA, or a [[Juris Doctor|JD]], etc.) to let students cut costs (dual programs usually cost less than pursuing 2 degrees separately), save time on education and to tailor the business education courses to their needs. This is generally achieved by allowing core courses of one program count as electives in the other. Some business schools offer programs in which students can earn both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] and an MBA in five years.

[[Mini-MBA]] is a term used by many non-profit and [[for-profit]] institutions to describe a [[training]] regimen focused on the fundamentals of business. In the past, Mini-MBA programs have typically been offered as non-credit bearing courses that require less than 100 hours of total learning. However, due to the criticisms of these certificates, many schools have now shifted their programs to offer courses for full credit so that they may be applied towards a complete traditional MBA degree. This is to allow students to verify business related coursework for employment purposes and still allow the option to complete a full-time MBA degree program at a later period, if they elect to do so.

==Admissions criteria==
Many programs base their admission decisions on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole.

The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MBA programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MBA programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission. In order to achieve a diverse class, business schools also consider the target male-female ratio and local-international student ratios. In rare cases, some MBA degrees do not require students to have an undergraduate degree and will accept significant management experience in lieu of an undergraduate degree. In the UK, for example an HND or even HNC is acceptable in some programs.

Depending on the program, type and duration of work experience can be a critical admissions component for many MBA programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why You Should Work Before Pursuing an MBA|url=http://www.bangalorean.co.in/2013/06/why-you-should-work-before-pursuing-mba.html|work=Bangalorean|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many top-tier programs require five or more years of work experience for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MBAapplicant.com |title=Number 5 – YOUR WORK EXPERIENCE:  |url=http://www.mbaapplicant.com/5_experience.htm |date=31 July 2009 |publisher=MBA Applicant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SMU Cox|title=Part Time MBA Programs – Side By Side Comparison |url=http://www.cox.smu.edu/web/guest/side-by-side-comparison |date=19 January 2010 |publisher=SMU Cox School of Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBA admissions consulting services exist to counsel MBA applicants to improve their chances of getting admission to their desired Business Schools. These services range from evaluating a candidate's profile, GMAT preparation, suggesting the schools to which they can apply, writing and editing essay, conducting mock interviews as preparation for MBA admission interviews, as well as post-MBA career counseling.

==Content==
In general, MBA programs are structured around core courses (an essentially standard curriculum&lt;ref name="Core Courses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description"/&gt;) and elective courses that (may) allow for a subject specialty or concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graduate Management Admission Council|GMAC's]] [http://www.mba.com/schools-and-programs/evaluating-schools/curriculum-and-course-selection.aspx Curriculum and Course Selection].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 
in the program's first year (or part), students acquire both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills required for these, while in the second year (part), students pursue elective courses, which may count towards a specialization.  (Topics in [[business ethics]] may be included at the generalist or specialist level.) After the first year, many full-time students seek [[internship]]s. The degree culminates with coursework in [[business strategy]], the program capstone. A [[dissertation]] or [[Project#School and university|major project]] is usually a degree requirement after the completion of coursework.  Many MBA programs end with a comprehensive exit examination; see below.

For Executive MBA programs, the core curriculum is generally similar, but may seek to leverage the strengths associated with the more seasoned and professional profile of the student body, emphasizing leadership, and drawing more from the specific experience of the individual students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutgers.edu.sg/emba-program/executive-mba-emba-vs-traditional-mba-full-timepart-time Executive MBA (EMBA) vs. Traditional MBA], rutgers.edu.sg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insead.edu/m-programmes/MBA-vs-EMBA EXECUTIVE MBA VS MBA: THE DIFFERENCE], insead.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs are designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].&lt;/ref&gt; Courses include lectures, case studies, and team projects; the mix though, will differ by school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/|title=Is the MBA Case Method Passé?|first=Ronald|last=Yeaple|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[#Programs|by format]]. Theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[professor|academic faculty]], and is reinforced through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker. Similar to real world business situations, cases include both constraints and incomplete information. Practical learning (field immersion) often comprises [[management consulting|consulting projects]] with real clients, and is generally undertaken in teams{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} (or "syndicates"). The practical elements (as well as the case studies) often involve [[Clinical professor|external practitioners]]—sometimes business executives—supporting the teaching from academic faculty. (See [[Business school #Use of case studies]] and [[Business_school#Other_approaches|#Other approaches]].)

As above, courses begin with underlying topics&lt;ref name="Core Courses"&gt;See: [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB's]] [http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/business/standards/aol/standard15.asp Standard 15: Management of Curricula]; [[Association of MBAs|AMBA's]] [http://www.mbaworld.com/accreditationcriteria New Accreditation Criteria]; [[Educational Testing Service|ETS's]] [http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/mba Major Field Test for the MBA].&lt;/ref&gt; and then progress to more advanced functional topics where these are applied; see aside.

The analytic skills required for management are usually covered initially.  The accounting course(s) may treat [[financial accounting|financial]] and [[management accounting]] separately or in one hybrid course.  Financial accounting deals mainly in the preparation of financial statements while management accounting deals mainly in analysis of internal results. [[Managerial economics]] is a technical course that mainly focuses on product pricing as influenced by many micro-economic theories and principals, while the aggregate or macro-economics course deals with topics like the banking system, the money supply, and inflation. [[Operations Research]] and statistics are sometimes combined as "Managerial Decision-Making" or "Quantitative Decision-Making"; organizational behavior and human resource management may similarly be combined. In many programs, applicants with appropriate background may be exempt from various of the analytical courses.

As regards the functional courses, some programs treat the curricula here in two parts: the first course provides an overview, while the second revisits the subject in depth (perhaps as specializations); alternatively, the first addresses short-term, tactical problems, while the second addresses long-term, strategic problems (e.g., "Financial Management I" might cover [[working capital management]], while part II covers [[Corporate finance#Investment and project valuation|capital investment decisions]]).  An [[Information systems]] / [[Information technology|technology]] course is increasingly included as a core functional course rather than an elective. Ethics training is often delivered with coursework in corporate social responsibility and corporate governance. Note that courses here, although technical in content are, ultimately, oriented toward corporate management. (For example, the principal finance course may cover the technicalities  of financial instrument valuation and [[Capital market|capital raising]], but is in fact focused on [[managerial finance|managerial-]] and [[corporate finance]].)  Technically-oriented courses, if offered, will be via a specialization.

Programs may also include (coursework-based) training in the skills needed at senior levels of management:  [[soft skills]], such as (general) leadership and negotiation; hard skills, such as [[spreadsheets]] and project management; [[Outline of thought#Creative processes|thinking skills]] such as [[innovation]] and creativity. Training in areas such as [[multiculturalism]] and corporate social responsibility is similarly included. Company visits (including overseas travel), and guest lectures or seminars with CEOs and [[Business guru|management personalities]] may also be included. These, with the core subjects, provide the graduate with breadth, while the specialty courses provide depth.

For the business strategy component, the degree capstone, the focus is on finding [[competitive advantage]] and the long-term positioning and management of the entity as a whole.  Here, the key functional areas are thus synthesized or integrated into an overall view and the strategy course depicts how the various sub-disciplines integrate to tell one continuous story with each discipline complementing the others.  Corresponding training in [[entrepreneurial leadership|business leadership]] may also be scheduled and participation in a [[business simulation]] or [[business game|game]] is also a common degree requirement. "Strategy" may be offered as a sequence of courses, beginning in the first part (planning) and culminating in the second (execution), or as a single intensive course, offered during the second part. Some programs offer a specialization in "strategy", others in management consulting which substantially addresses the same issues.

The MBA dissertation (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, comprise the following in some combination:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kangis | first1 = Peter | last2 = Carman | first2 = Robert | year = | title = Research, Knowledge and Method: the purpose and role of MBA dissertation | url = http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/bmaf/documents/publications/ijme/vol1no2/kangis_purpose_of_mba_dissert.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The International Journal of Management Education | volume = 1 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[literature review|discussion of the literature]], providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a [[case study]] that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project.&lt;ref name="degree.net"/&gt; Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an [[action learning]] orientation, these may be practically oriented.&lt;ref name="degree.net"&gt;[http://www.degree.net/resources/degree-level/mba-degree-guide_201002182375.html MBA degree-guide], degree.net&lt;/ref&gt; Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.

===Exit examination===
Many MBA programs culminate in a [[Comprehensive examination|comprehensive exit examination]]. The national [[standardized exam]] known as the [[Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration|Major Field Test for MBAs]] (MFT-MBA) has been administered in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MFT-MBA aims to assess skills, knowledge, and reasoning ability within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/mft_mba_flyer.pdf |title=MFT-MBA Test Description |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by [[Educational Testing Service]]. Another prominent option for comprehensive exit exams is the Common Professional Component Comprehensive Exam for MBAs (CPC COMP Exam for MBAs) owned by Peregrine Academic Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.peregrineacademics.com/media.ashx/exam-summary-business-compgraduatefinal29oct2014.pdf |title=Business Administration CPC-Based COMP Exam Summary: Masters Level |publisher=Peregrine Academic Services |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs choose to administer their own in-house exam rather than a standardized test.

==Honor societies==

Honor societies recognize individuals for high achievement in MBA programs.  These honor societies include:
* Beta Gamma Sigma - membership requires one to be in the top 20% of their program's class after completing half of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.betagammasigma.org/about/invitation-process | title =Invitation Process| website =Beta Gamma Sigma | publisher =Beta Gamma Sigma  | access-date =April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, INSEAD (French name "Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires", or European Institute of Business Administration) became the first European university offering the MBA degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kaplan A.: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[EDHEC]] Business School in 1959 and [[ICADE]] in 1960 (who had started offering in 1956 a "Technical Seminary for Business Administration"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icade.es/presentacion/pres_hist.aspx?nivel=3&amp;id=90 Historia de la Universidad Pontificia Comillas].

Vlerick.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1969 by the [[HEC School of Management]] (in French, the École des Hautes Études Commerciales) and the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]]. In 1972, Swiss business school [[IMEDE]] (now [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]]) began offering a full-time MBA program, followed by [[IE Business School]] (in Spanish, Instituto de Empresas) in 1973, and AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland in 1974. In 1991, [[IEDC-Bled School of Management]] became the first school in the ex-socialist block of the Central and Eastern to offer an MBA degree.

===Bologna Accord===
In Europe, the recent [[Bologna Accord]] established uniformity in three levels of higher education: Bachelor (three or four years), Masters (one or two years, in addition to three or four years for a Bachelor), and Doctorate (an additional three or four years after a Master). Students can acquire professional experience after their initial bachelor's degree at any European institution and later complete their masters in any other European institution via the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]].

===Accreditation standards===
Accreditation standards are not uniform in Europe. Some countries have legal requirements for accreditation (e.g. most German states), in some there is a legal requirement only for universities of a certain type (e.g. Austria), and others have no accreditation law at all. Even where there is no legal requirement, many business schools are [[School accreditation|accredited]] by independent bodies voluntarily to ensure quality standards.

===Austria===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
In Austria, MBA programs of [[private university|private universities]] have to be accredited by the Austrian Accreditation Council (''Österreichischer Akkreditierungsrat''). State-run universities have no accreditation requirements, however, some of them voluntarily undergo accreditation procedures by independent bodies. There are also MBA programs of non-academic business schools, who are entitled by the Austrian government to offer these programs until the end of 2012 (''Lehrgang universitären Charakters''). Some non-academic institutions cooperate with state-run universities to ensure legality of their degrees.

===Czech Republic===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
January 1999 saw the first meeting of the Association of the Czech MBA Schools (CAMBAS). The association is housed within the Centre for Doctoral and Managerial Studies of UEP, Prague. All of the founding members of the association to have their MBA programs accredited by partner institutions in the United Kingdom or United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The university of Finance and administration Prague|url=http://www.shortcoursesportal.eu/universities/1176/the-university-of-finance-and-administration-prague.html#tab:about|journal=Shortcoursesportal.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France and French speaking countries===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
In France and in the [[Francophone]] countries such as Switzerland, Monaco, Belgium, and Canada, the MBA degree programs at the public accredited schools are similar to those offered in the [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] countries. Most French Business Schools are accredited by the [[Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)|Conférence des Grandes Écoles]], which is an association of higher educational establishments outside the mainstream framework of the public education system.

===Germany===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
Germany was one of the last Western countries to adopt the MBA degree. In 1998, the ''Hochschulrahmengesetz'' (Higher Education Framework Act), a German federal law regulating higher education including the types of degrees offered, was modified to permit German universities to offer master's degrees. The traditional German degree in business administration was the [[Diplom]] in ''Betriebswirtschaft'' (Diplom-Kaufmann) but since 1999, bachelor's and master's degrees have gradually replaced the traditional degrees due to the [[Bologna process]]. Today most German business schools offer the MBA. Most [[States of Germany|German states]] require that MBA degrees have to be accredited by one of the six agencies officially recognized by the German ''Akkreditierungsrat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akkreditierungsrat.de/index.php?id=44&amp;L=1|work=Akkreditierungsrat.de|title=Accreditation Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; (accreditation council), the German counterpart to the American [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation|CHEA]]. The busiest of these six agencies (in respect to MBA degrees) is the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA). All universities themselves have to be institutionally accredited by the state (''staatlich anerkannt'').

===Italy===

{{main article|List of business schools in Asia}}
International MBA programs are acquiring brand value in Asia. For example, while a foreign MBA is still preferred in the Philippines, many students are now studying at one of many "Global MBA" English language programs being offered. English-only MBA programs are also offered in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. For international students who want a different experience, many Asian programs offer scholarships and discounted tuition to encourage an international environment in the classroom.

Rankings have been published for Asia Pacific schools by the magazine [[Asia Inc.]] which is a regional business magazine with distribution worldwide. The importance of MBA education in China has risen, too.&lt;ref&gt;Alon, Ilan and John R. McIntyre, eds.

===Japan===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

In Japan 2 business schools offer the accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA or EQUIS). The concept of an MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, some companies have been known to place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees who have spent years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to reinvent the perception of the MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The New York Times | title=M.B.A.s in Japan Struggle for Respect

Since 1967, publications have ranked MBA programs using various methods.&lt;ref name="whatswrong"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong With MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |year=1993 |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |accessdate=22 July 2011 |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Gourman Report]]'' (1967–1997) did not disclose criteria or ranking methods,&lt;ref&gt;Selingo, Jeffrey.

''Chronicle of Higher Education'' (7 November 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and these reports were criticized for reporting statistically impossible data, such as no ties among schools, narrow gaps in scores with no variation in gap widths, and ranks of nonexistent departments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bedeian, Arthur G.]] [http://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/tipjan02/07bedeian.aspx Caveat Emptor: The Gourman Report]. ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist'' (June 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 ''The Carter Report'' ranked MBA programs based on the number of academic articles published by faculty, the ''Ladd &amp; Lipset Survey'' ranked business schools based on faculty surveys, and ''MBA Magazine'' ranked schools based on votes cast by business school deans.&lt;ref name="whatswrong" /&gt;

Today, publications by the [[Aspen Institute]], ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Quacquarelli Symonds]], ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'', and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''  make their own rankings of MBA programs. Schools' ranks can vary across publications, as the methodologies for rankings differ among publications:

* The [[Aspen Institute]] publishes the ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' rankings which are based on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Rankings from a small sample of well-known schools are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=18 June 2011|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Forbes'' considers only the return of investment five years after graduation. MBA alumni are asked about their salary, the tuition fees of their MBA program and other direct costs as well as opportunity costs involved. Based on this data, a final "5-year gain" is calculated and determines the MBA ranking position.&lt;ref name="Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2011/08/03/the-best-business-schools/|accessdate=3 August 2011|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] ''QS Global 200 Business Schools Report'' compiles regional rankings of business schools around the world.

* ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' incorporates responses from deans, program directors, and senior faculty about the academic quality of their programs as well as the opinions of hiring professionals.

* The ''Wall Street Journal'', which stopped ranking full-time MBA programs in 2007, based its rankings on skill and behavioral development that may predict career success, such as social skills, teamwork orientation, ethics, and analytic and problem-solving abilities.&lt;ref name="How the Rankings were Compiled"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Rankings were Compiled|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204251404574344784066900244|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranking of MBA programs has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caution and Controversy |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |accessdate=6 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |archivedate=26 October 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="MRN"&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, INSEAD, Wharton and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hemel |first=Daniel J |title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=12 April 2004 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 |accessdate=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can approximately duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications, and concluded that a truly objective ranking would use objective measures of program quality and be individualized to the needs of each prospective student.&lt;ref name="MRN" /&gt; National publications have recognized the value of rankings against different criteria, and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings have yet to meet the critique that rankings are not tailored to individual needs, that they use an incomplete population of schools, may fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.

==Criticism==
The media raised questions about the value and content of business school programs after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. In general, graduates had reportedly tended to go into finance after receiving their degrees.&lt;ref name="retrain"&gt;{{cite news|author=Holland, Kelley | title=Is It Time to Retrain B-Schools? | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/y15/business/15school.html | date=14 March 2009 | newspaper=Th York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As financial professionals are widely seen as responsible for the global economic meltdown, anecdotal evidence suggests new graduates are choosing different career paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stossel, John | title=The New Normal | publisher=ABC News | newspaper=20/20 | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deans at top business schools have acknowledged that media and public perception of the MBA degree shifted as a result of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name="overhaul"&gt;{{cite news | author=Bradshaw, Della | title=Deans fight crisis fires with MBA overhaul | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a2353870-53c4-11de-be08-00144feabdc0.html | date=18 June 2009 |newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles have been written about public perceptions of the crisis, ranging from schools' acknowledgment of issues with the training students receive&lt;ref name="retrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overhaul"/&gt; to criticisms of the MBA's role in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Stewart, Matthew | title=RIP, MBA | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29895258 | date=25 March 2009 | publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MBA title has acquired a mixed reputation in that the MBA curriculum tends to educate students in the "[[greed]] is good" direction based on various simplistic assumptions about human behaviour.&lt;ref name="Parker 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Parker | first=Martin | title=Why we should bulldoze the business school | website=the Guardian | date=2018-04-27 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school | access-date=2018-05-24|quote=There are 13,000 business schools on Earth.

==Education==

Kutle was born in Lištica, (today [[Široki Brijeg]]) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
He attended school and the [[University of Zagreb]], where he graduated at the Faculty of Law in 1982.&lt;ref name="leksikon"/&gt;

==Business empire==

In 1989 he founded UTP Globus, and in 1992 Globus Holdings,&lt;ref name="leksikon"/&gt; later to become Globus Group d.o.o. (Globus Grupa). In 1992, he was voted Manager of the Year (Small Businesses) by CROMA, The Croatian Managers Association&lt;ref name="leksikon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="croma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croma.hr/?id=13 |title=Overview of the winners of annual awards HUM-CROMA 1992-2001|publisher=HUM-CROMA |language=Croatian |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, Kutle's business empire expanded to include the companies Jadrantekstil, [[Slobodna Dalmacija]], Radio Dalmacija, [[TV Marjan]],  Kastelanska Rivijera, [[Dalma (company)|Dalma]] and [[Splitska banka]].

==Privatization and controversy==

The rapid expansion of Kutle's business empire took place during the years following the independence of the new [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]]. Previously State-owned and run businesses were [[privatized]], in what has become a [[Croatian privatization controversy|controversial process]]. The relationship between Kutle, the then President [[Franjo Tudjman]], the ruling [[HDZ]] party and the non-transparency of the transactions has come under scrutiny in the Croatian courts a number of times since 2000.

In 1999, the [[Croatian Privatization Fund]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski fond za privatizaciju}}, a government agency formed for the purpose of privatizing state-owned businesses)&lt;ref name="hfp"&gt;[http://www.hfp.hr/default.asp?ID=4 Croatian Privatization Fund Official website (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618090334/http://www.hfp.hr/default.asp?ID=4 |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; confiscated the companies Diona, Jadrantekstil and Koteks, while Tisak and [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] were removed by court decisions.&lt;ref name="aim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199902/90210-003-trae-zag.htm |title=The Epilogue of the Story of Kutle |first=Ivica |last=Djikic |date=2 February 1999 |publisher=AIM |location=Zagreb |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, following the death of Tudjman, a new coalition government took over and started investigating corruption in the previous administration.&lt;ref name="nacional2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacional.hr/en/clanak/18063/kutle-grubisic-and-gucic-targets-of-the-state-audit |title=Kutle, Grubišić and Gucić: targets of the State Audit |first=Berislav |last=Jelinić |date=29 May 2002 |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]] |location=Zagreb |accessdate=12 June 2010 |quote=The findings of the State Audit which reviewed the first 100 privatized companies, showed that 80 of those companies had elements of irregularity or illegality.

'''Pantone LLC''' is a U.S. corporation headquartered in [[Carlstadt, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Horyn, Cathy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/fashion/20COLOR.html "Pantone's Color of the Year Is..."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 20, 2007.  Accessed September 8, 2008. "Nonetheless, Pantone's choice of blue iris, or No. 18-3943, got some news media attention last week, which seemed to be partly the objective of the company, which is based in Carlstadt, NJ."&lt;/ref&gt; The company is best known for its '''Pantone Matching System''' ('''PMS'''), a [[patent|proprietary]] [[color space]] used in a variety of industries, primarily printing, though sometimes in the manufacture of colored paint, fabric, and plastics.

[[X-Rite]] Inc., a supplier of color measurement instruments and software, purchased Pantone Inc. for $180 million in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Printing talk | url = http://www.printingtalk.com/news/xri/xri117.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202181819/http://www.printingtalk.com/news/xri/xri117.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-12-02 | title = Pantone US$180m Acquisition Completion For X-Rite: News from X-Rite }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Pantone began in New York City in the 1950s as the commercial [[printer (publishing)|printing]] company of M &amp; J Levine Advertising.  In 1956, its founders, advertising executives brothers Mervin and Jesse Levine, hired recent [[Hofstra University]] graduate [[Lawrence Herbert]] as a part-time employee. Herbert used his chemistry knowledge to systematize and simplify the company's stock of [[pigment]]s and production of colored [[ink]]s; by 1962, Herbert was running the ink and printing division at a profit, while the commercial-display division was $50,000 in debt; he subsequently purchased the company's technological assets from the Levine Brothers for $90,000 ({{Inflation|USD|710,000|1962|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) and renamed them "Pantone".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Funding universe | contribution-url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Pantone-Inc-Company-History.html | title = Company histories | contribution = Pantone Inc. History}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's primary products include the Pantone Guides, which consist of a large number of small (approximately 6×2&amp;nbsp;inches or 15×5&amp;nbsp;cm) thin [[Paperboard|cardboard]] sheets, printed on one side with a series of related [[Color chart#Color selection chart|color swatches]] and then bound into a small "fan deck".  For instance, a particular "page" might contain a number of yellows of varying [[tint]]s.

The idea behind the PMS is to allow designers to "color match" specific colors when a design enters production stage, regardless of the equipment used to produce the color. This system has been widely adopted by graphic designers and reproduction and printing houses. Pantone recommends that PMS Color Guides be purchased annually, as their inks become yellowish over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://inksystemsinc.com/ | title = Senior Staff | type = interview | date = October 27, 2006 | publisher = Ink Systems, Inc}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Color variance also occurs within editions based on the paper stock used (coated, matte or uncoated), while interedition color variance occurs when there are changes to the specific paper stock used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=588&amp;idPressRelease=190 | archive-url= https://archive.is/20130131020005/http://pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=588&amp;idPressRelease=190 | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2013-01-31 |accessdate = 2007-02-23 | title=Pantone Press Release, 6 May 2004 | quote = Colors in the new formula guide and chips books have changed due to a shift to coated paper that is brighter and whiter}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantone Color Matching System==

The Pantone Color Matching System is largely a standardized color reproduction system.  By standardizing the colors, different manufacturers in different locations can all refer to the Pantone system to make sure colors match without direct contact with one another.

One such use is standardizing colors in the [[CMYK]] process.  The CMYK process is a method of printing color by using four inks—cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. A majority of the world's printed material is produced using the CMYK process, and there is a special subset of Pantone colors that can be reproduced using CMYK.{{Citation needed| date = January 2011}}  Those that are possible to simulate through the CMYK process are labeled as such within the company's guides.

However, most of the Pantone system's 1,114 [[spot color]]s cannot be simulated with CMYK but with 13 base pigments (14 including black) mixed in specified amounts.&lt;ref name = patone2 /&gt;

[[File:SG50 logo.jpg|thumb|A logo commissioned by the [[Government of Singapore]] to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the nation's independence. The usage instructions for the logo described it as being in Pantone Red 032 and White.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Celebrating the Little Red Dot|url=https://www.singapore50.sg/SG50/About|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318200600/https://www.singapore50.sg/SG50/About|archivedate=18 March 2015|publisher=SG50 Programme Office|year=2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Pantone system also allows for many special colors to be produced, such as metallics and fluorescents. While most of the Pantone system colors are beyond the printed CMYK gamut, it was only in 2001 that Pantone began providing translations of their existing system with screen-based colors.  Screen-based colors use the [[RGB color model]]—red, green, blue—system to create various colors.&lt;ref name = patoneRGB&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/pantone.aspx?pg=20136&amp;ca=10 | title = Pantone announces RGB conversions for Pantone system | type = press release | quote = Providing Designers with simple and accurate methods for recreating Pantone Matching System colors in Web designs}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The (discontinued)&lt;ref name="pantone.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pantone.com/goe|title=Graphics - Pantone Goe System|publisher=Pantone|website=www.pantone.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goe system has RGB and [[Lab color space|LAB]] values with each color.

Pantone colors are described by their allocated number (typically referred to as, for example, "PMS 130").  PMS colors are almost always used in branding and have even found their way into government legislation and military standards (to describe the colors of [[flag]]s and [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s).&lt;ref name=USCGHeraldry&gt;{{Citation | title = Directive | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | publisher = USCG | url = http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5200_14A.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, the [[Scottish Parliament]] debated a petition (reference PE512) to refer to the blue in the [[Flag of Scotland|Scottish flag]] as "Pantone 300". Countries such as [[Flag of Canada|Canada]] and [[Flag of South Korea|South Korea]] and organizations such as the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] have also chosen to refer to specific Pantone colors to use when producing flags. US states including [[Texas]] have set legislated PMS colors of their flags.&lt;ref name=texascolors&gt;{{Citation | chapter-url = http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/GV/content/htm/gv.011.00.003100.00.htm#3100.001.00 | place = [[Texas|TX]], US | title = Statute | chapter = 3100.

==Pantone Goe System==
On September 5, 2007, Pantone introduced the Goe System.&lt;ref name=goesystem&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/Pantone.aspx?pg=20494&amp;ca=10 | title = Pantone Unveils Goe System | type = press release | quote = Over 2,000 new Pantone colors to inspire, explore and express the color of ideas | accessdate = September 5, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Goe consisted of over 2,000 new colors in a new matching and numbering system. In addition to the standard swatch books (now called the GoeGuide), the new system also included adhesive-backed GoeSticks, interactive software, tools, and an online community where users were able to share color swatches and information.

The Goe system was streamlined to use fewer base colors (ten, plus clear coating for reflections) and accommodate many technical challenges in reproducing colors on a press.&lt;ref name= patone2&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Creative Pro | url = http://www.creativepro.com/article/pantone-2-0-after-45-years-the-sequel-to-pms- | title = Pantone 2.0: After 45 Years, the Sequel to PMS}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pantone Goe system was discontinued in November 2013.&lt;ref name="pantone.com"/&gt;

==Other products==
In mid-2006 Pantone, partnering with Vermont-based [[Fine Paints of Europe]], introduced a new line of interior and exterior paints. The color palette uses Pantone's color research and trending and has more than 3,000 colors.
In November 2015, Pantone partnered with Redland London to create a collection of bags inspired from Pantone's authority on color.

Pantone also produced [[Hexachrome]], a patented six-color printing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,734,800.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5,734,800&amp;RS=PN/5,734,800 | publisher = PTO | place = US | title = Patent | id = 5734800}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = About us | type = press release | url = http://www.pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=64&amp;idPressRelease=38 | publisher = Pantone}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to custom CMYK inks, Hexachrome added orange and green inks to expand the color gamut, for better color reproduction. It was therefore also known as a CMYKOG process.  Hexachrome was discontinued by Pantone in 2008 when Adobe Systems stopped supporting their HexWare plugin software.

Pantone Color Manager allows for users of the Adobe Creative Suite as well as other software to import the most up to date information inclusive of [[L*a*b*]] numbers as well as CMYK and RGB representations of all the various palettes. L*a*b* numbers allow for the most accurate representation of color in a device independent manner.

==Color of the Year==
Since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pantone.com/|title=Trend Forecasting - Celebrate Color: Color by Decade Infographic from Pantone.com|last=PANTONE|website=PANTONE|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pantone Color Institute declares a particular color "Color of the Year". Twice a year the company hosts, in a European capital, a secret meeting of representatives from various nations' color standards groups. After two days of presentations and debate, they choose a color for the following year; for example, the color for summer 2013 was chosen in London in the spring of 2012.{{Sfn | Vanderbilt | 2012}}  The color purportedly connects with the [[zeitgeist]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}; for example, the press release declaring Honeysuckle the color of 2011 said "In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going&amp;nbsp;– perfect to ward off the blues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Pantone | url = http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/pantone.aspx?pg=20824&amp;ca=10 |title= Pantone Reveals Color of the Year for 2011: Pantone 18-2120 Honeysuckle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of the meeting are published in ''Pantone View'', which fashion designers, florists, and many other consumer-oriented companies purchase to help guide their designs and planning for future products.{{Sfn | Vanderbilt | 2012}}

The person behind Pantone's Color of the Year, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute [[Leatrice Eiseman]], explains in an interview how 2014's Color of the Year, Radiant Orchid, was chosen:
{{Quote | I look for ascending color trends, colors that are being used in broader ways and broader context than before...  In this case, Radiant Orchid descends from the purple family, which is kind of a magical color that denotes creativity and innovation. Purple is just that kind of a complex, interesting, attracting kind of color...  [The] back-story to purple is that it inspires confidence in your creativity, and we're living in a world where that kind of creative innovation is greatly admired. In the world of color, purple is an attention-getter, and it has a meaning. It speaks to people, and we felt that it was time for the purple family to be celebrated.  That's why we chose the particular shade called Radiant Orchid. | [[Leatrice Eiseman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Eiseman | first = Leatrice |title= Lee Eiseman, Executive Director, Pantone Color Institute | url= http://www.signazon.com/spotlight-lee-eiseman-part-1.aspx |work= Spotlight |publisher = Signazon |accessdate= 24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

Pantone has said that color "has always been an integral part of how a culture expresses the attitudes and emotions of the times."&lt;ref name="Celebrate Color"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrate Color.|url=http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone.aspx?pg=21111&amp;ca=90|website=pantone.com|publisher=Panton|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''period of [[financial distress]]''' occurs when the price of a company or an asset or an index of a set of assets in a market is declining with the danger of a sudden crash of value occurring, either because the company is experiencing increasing problems of cash flow or a deteriorating credit balance or because the price had become too high as a result of a speculative bubble that has now peaked.

==Background==
It is not known when this phrase was first used or by whom.  However, it or phrases closely equivalent were almost certainly first used in connection with the theory of [[value investing]] as developed initially by [[Benjamin Graham]] in his famous book  [[Security Analysis]] (Graham and Dodd, 1934).  This theory advocated long-term investing in stocks or assets that are underpriced compared to their [[Intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]], that is they have suffered “distress sales” and the stock or asset of company is going through a “period of financial distress.”  If such a period is temporary, and the company can be expected to return to an improved condition of normal solvency, then investing in such an asset can be expected to outperform the stock market in general in the longer run.  In connection with this Graham developed the [[Benjamin Graham formula]], also known as “[[net current asset value]].”  A similar analysis was done by [[John Burr Williams]] who developed his [[discounted cash flow]] theory (Williams, 1938).  A prominent advocate of Graham and his approach has been [[Warren Buffett]], who has claimed that he is an “85% Graham investor” (Buffett, 2003).

This approach has been criticized by advocates of [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) and the closely related doctrine of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (EMH) most closely associated with [[Eugene Fama]] (Fama, 1970).  These theories argue that if a stock or asset is selling at what appears to be a “distress value” compared to some estimate of its true value based on its current income flows, then the market has information about the expected future of the company or asset that is not reflected in its current income flow.  In this regard, investors such as Buffett who have successfully used the Graham approach should expect to spend extra resources to have better information about the companies or assets they purchase compared to most agents in the market.  A study that shows that the Graham approach may well do better than various other alternatives (such as the “three-factor theory” that Fama and French, 1996, have argued performs better than the EMH), is Xiao and Arnold (2008).

==Use in forecasting corporate bankruptcies==
Another use of this phrase has been in connection with efforts to predict corporate bankruptcies that may come out of such a period of financial distress.  One who developed an approach to making such predictions has been [[Edward Altman]], who developed the [[z-score]] financial analysis tool (Altman, 1968).  Further study of this and related tools has been done by Altman and Hotchkiss (2005).  This idea can be related to the earlier issue in that presumably why the Graham approach might not do as well as such alternatives as MPT or EMH is that it does not satisfactorily account for the risk of such bankruptcies.  Again, it is clear that to outperform such models a Graham-style investor will have to have sufficiently good information about such possibilities to know whether or not such a threat can be discounted.

==Use in analysis of speculative bubbles and crashes==
Drawing on these uses from [[corporate finance]], [[Hyman Minsky]] applied the phrase to analyzing speculative bubbles and crashes (Minsky, 1972), using it to characterize a period in a speculative bubble that follows a peak in price, in which the price gradually declines, and which is then followed by a crash in which the price falls precipitously.  This analysis was adopted by [[Charles P. Kindleberger]], who in Appendix B of the 4th edition of his book, ''Manias, Panics, and Crashes'' (2000) identified 37 out of 47 historical bubbles as exhibiting such a pattern, including most of the more famous ones. Although the phrase was not used, participants in periods of financial distress in early bubbles used a variety of colorful terms and phrases for them, such as "apprehension" or "an ugly drop in the market" during the South Sea bubble in Britain in 1720 (Carswell, 1960, p. 139). Arguably the recent global bubble in financial derivatives exhibited this pattern, with a peak in August 2007, followed by a crash in September 2008.
The first to develop a mathematical model of this period of financial distress was [[J. Barkley Rosser, Jr.]] (Chapter 5, 1991), drawing on catastrophe theory, while a more detailed such model using [[agent-based modeling]] and relying on the wealth constraint idea due to Minsky has been done by Gallegati, Palestrini, and Rosser (2011.)

== Roots ==

=== Process Capital in Organisations ===
Organisations invest in process capital in order to build a company’s unique infrastructure for achieving operational and strategic goals. Given the dynamics of industry and technology, the development of process capital evolves and interacts with environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shang, S. and Lin, S.-F.

The vast investments include: [[IT infrastructure]] implementation, [[quality improvement|quality-improvement]] projects, process-redesign projects, and various process integration projects. Although process capital plays an important role in organising resources, processing information, interacting with stakeholders, and delivering organisational values,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The intellectual capital dimensions of ducati's turnaround: exploring knowledge assets grounding a change management program|url = http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1363919608001935|journal = International Journal of Innovation Management|date = 2008-06-01|issn = 1363-9196|pages = 161–193|volume = 12|issue = 02|doi = 10.1142/S1363919608001935|first = Giovanni|last = Schiuma|first2 = Antonio|last2 = Lerro|first3 = Damiano|last3 = Sanitate}}&lt;/ref&gt; few studies have discussed its specific content, and it is rare to focus attention on the level of its management. Instead, process capital has usually been hidden in the measurement of IT investment or organisational intellectual capital as an intangible element of organisational assets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Failure to treat process capital as a separate and unique management issue is widespread among both businesses and researchers because most of the systems and processes within the organisations are interdependent. Therefore, a systematic approach to measuring process capital is necessary in order to manage process potential to its full extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How knowledge assets lead to a sustainable competitive advantage: are organizational capabilities a missing link?|url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/kmrp/journal/v7/n4/abs/kmrp200926a.html|journal = Knowledge Management Research &amp; Practice|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 1477-8238|pages = 339–355|volume = 7|issue = 4|doi = 10.1057/kmrp.2009.26|first = Karim|last = Moustaghfir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
[[Capital (economics)|Capital]] is something owned which provides ongoing services. In the national accounts, or to firms, capital is made up of durable investment goods, normally summed in units of money. Process capital, in practice, embraces the practical knowledge of operations, techniques, and employee programs in the effort to extend and enhance the efficiency of manufacturing or the delivery of products and services for long-term value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Failure to treat process capital as a separate and unique management issue is widespread among both businesses and researchers because most of the systems and processes within the organisations are interdependent. Therefore, a systematic approach to measuring process capital is necessary in order to manage process potential to its full extent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Strategy Development ==
Process capital is essential for strategy development and implementation. Business processes are large with technology, location and other factors combining to generate limitless possibilities. Throughout the process of developing and appropriating technology-enabled processes, collective brainpower is formalised, captured, and leveraged to produce an asset of higher value and affect organisational performance in all aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge Driven Service Innovation and Management: IT Strategies for Business Alignment and Value Creation: IT Strategies for Business Alignment and Value Creation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uc2v0omGt5oC|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2012-11-30|isbn = 9781466625136|first = Chew, Eng|last = K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organisational Performance ===
Organisational performance can include the operational, managerial, and strategic impacts of different business efforts on the management of business processes. However, because organisational performance is influenced by numerous factors, the benefits from process capital can be expected to take up to several years to filter through the various levels of business performance. For example, a process integration technology may take months to develop and transform into real processes and to generate increased productivity. In addition, after processes emerge into business operation, greater managerial and strategic performance may appear later. Therefore, it is important to use proper measures to reflect process value for both the short and long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Performance of organisations treating lean as an ideology|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/14637151111182729|journal = Business Process Management Journal|pages = 986–1011|volume = 17|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/14637151111182729|first = Sanjay|last = Bhasin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring process capital ==

=== Input Method ===
The input method is measured by the resources invested in process capital for business operations. In economic terms, this is expected to predict the future value of the processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring process capital from a system model perspective|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/BPMJ-11-2012-0117|journal = Business Process Management Journal|pages = 662–679|volume = 19|issue = 4|doi = 10.1108/bpmj-11-2012-0117|first = Shari S.C.|last = Shang|first2 = Ya‐Ling|last2 = Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two measurement indicators for this method are investment in information technology and administrative expanses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intellectual Capital: Realizing Your Company's True Value by Finding Its Hidden Brainpower|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fJWgQgAACAAJ|publisher = HarperCollins|date = 1997-03-06|isbn = 9780887308413|first = Leif|last = Edvinsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firm size and industry type are the two controlled variables that are used in all three methods.

=== Output Method ===
The output method is measured by the total effort of managing the technology and operations which achieve business effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Total Quality Management and Business Excellence|last = Kueng|first = P|publisher = |year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 67–85|chapter = “Process performance measurement system: a tool to support process-based organizations”|volume = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process indicators measure the actual value of labor productivity, such as profit per employee, to determine the contribution to the firm's overall productivity. This method is based on reviewing past performances to predict future results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Management Capability ===
Management capability is the capability of constructing and coordinating resources to integrate and develop processes to respond to changing business conditions. The method measures the value of the process capital at the time of the measurement as a percentage change of the productivity compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|journal = Strategic Management Journal|date = 1997-08-01|pages = 509–533|volume = 18|issue = 7|first = David J.|last = Teece|first2 = Gary|last2 = Pisano|first3 = Amy|last3 = Shuen|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z|jstor=3088148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green Capital ==
Studies show that process capital has a positive influence on competitive advantages of firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Positive Effect of Green Intellectual Capital on Competitive Advantages of Firms|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-006-9349-1|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|date = 2007-03-17|issn = 0167-4544|pages = 271–286|volume = 77|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s10551-006-9349-1|first = Yu-Shan|last = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitive Advantage ===
Companies engaging in environmental management and green innovation actively can not only minimise production waste and increase productivity, but also charge relatively high prices for green products, improve corporate images, and thereby obtain corporate competitive advantages under the trends of popular environmentalism consciousness of consumers and severe international regulations of environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Proactive Corporate Environmental Management: A New Industrial Revolution|journal = The Academy of Management Executive (1993-2005)|date = 1998-05-01|pages = 38–50|volume = 12|issue = 2|first = Michael A.|last = Berry|first2 = Dennis A.|last2 = Rondinelli|doi=10.5465/ame.1998.650515|jstor=4165456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the stocks of organisational capabilities, organisational commitments, knowledge management systems, reward systems, information technology systems, databases, managerial institution, operation processes, managerial philosophies, organisational culture, company images, patents, copy rights, and trademarks, etc. about environmental protection or green innovation within a company can help companies obtain competitive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toward a New Conception of the Environment-Competitiveness Relationship|url = https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.9.4.97|journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives|pages = 97–118|volume = 9|issue = 4|doi = 10.1257/jep.9.4.97|first = Michael E|last = Porter|first2 = Claas van der|last2 = Linde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring Green Capital ===
The measurement of green structural capital comprises the following nine items:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal of Knowledge Management Practice,|url = http://www.tlainc.com/articl25.htm|website = www.tlainc.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process Capital and Nursing ==
Process capital is one of the three components of [[structural capital]].  Nursing structural capital is knowledge converted into information structures that nurses can use to assist with their clinical decision-making and care planning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The middle-range theory of nursing intellectual capital|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04626.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing|date = 2008-07-01|issn = 1365-2648|pages = 94–103|volume = 63|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04626.x|first = Christine L.|last = Covell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing structural capital in the form of practice guidelines, care maps or protocols is believed to provide relevant information to nurses for improving the quality of care they deliver. Care maps, practice guidelines and protocols have been found to contribute to improved patient outcomes and reduce the rate of adverse events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Transforming Human Capital to Structural Capital ==

=== Distinguishing between Information Elements  ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Intellectual Capital Relations Chart.jpeg|thumb|337x337px|Figure 1]] --&gt;
The intellectual capital model distinguishes between three distinct elements: Human Capital, Structural Capital, and Relational Capital. Leadership represents ideas of Human Capital, the intellectual value of the employees in a firm. All intellectual capital first originates as Human Capital. Innovation and process capital represents components of structural capital, elements that show the legal and process value of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1st|title = Intellectual Capital: Core asset for the third millennium|url = https://www.amazon.com/Intellectual-Capital-asset-third-millennium/dp/1861524080|publisher = Cengage Learning|date = 1996-07-30|location = London|isbn = 9781861524089|first = Annie|last = Brooking|first2 = Brooking|last2 = a|first3 = Brooking|last3 = Annie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation capital includes embodied knowledge sets like patents and copyrights. Process capital tends to consist of more intangible elements of a tacit knowledge set which includes process technologies. In other words, structural capital consists of  elements with which the firm's members interact to create more knowledge or get the work done. Relational capital is moderated by cultural capital and both of these elements represent the knowledge needed to provide ongoing value-added relations with shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tacit knowledge the key to the strategic alignment of intellectual capitalnull|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/eb054547|journal = Planning Review|date = 1996-02-01|issn = 0094-064X|pages = 10–16|volume = 24|issue = 2|doi = 10.1108/eb054547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Figure 1 source.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Leveraging intellectual capital through product and process management of human capital|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/14691930210448323|journal = Journal of Intellectual Capital|pages = 415–429|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1108/14691930210448323|first = William H.A.|last = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key Principle ===
The key principle illustrated in Figure 1 is that no element of intellectual capital by itself creates ongoing value for the firm but is value creating only when interacting with other elements of the intellectual capital model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Organizational Behavior 2: Essential theories of process and structure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qqZ_FDFoDcMC|publisher = M.E. Sharpe|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9780765615251|first = John B.|last = Miner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the true nature of the intellectual capital machine within the firm is dynamic and with reference to measurement issues. Measuring one elements may affect the measurement of another and once measurements are made of the element its magnitude and direction of flow may have already changed. Total knowledge of the intellectual capital system through measurement is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mapping Strategic Knowledge|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LE95fcRz_IcC|publisher = SAGE|date = 2002-01-31|isbn = 9781446232279|first = Anne Sigismund|last = Huff|first2 = Mark|last2 = Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutionalisation Issues ===
A problem that may result from narrowly defining the knowledge stocks to be measured is that of reification and institutionalisation of such stock. Identifying a set of importance may over-emphasise the real strategic value of the set, especially in times of strategical change. When knowledge stocks are identified and attention given to them their importance may be rectified by those within the firm and results in the development of core rigidities, or strategic commitment, which may stagnate potentially revitalising innovation. Leonard-Barton identified knowledge as one of the most difficult to change. When it is past success and attention, it creates core rigidities. The term she uses to demonstrate the basic principle is a "way of seeing is also a way of not seeing." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Wellsprings of Knowledge" by Dorothy Leonard-Barton|url = http://www.strategy-business.com/article/8599?gko=8edb4|website = strategy+business|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuralization assumption ==
The predominance of a structuralization assumption is that all knowledge needs to be structuralized to be valuable to a firm, leading to reification of knowledge as explicit. This assumption treats all knowledge as easily distinguishable from human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly|date = 1959-06-01|pages = 129–131|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2390654|first = William H.|last = Form|jstor=2390654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lynn's anecdote ===
A woman who had been working in North America for a German company was fired when the firm downsized and moved all its operations back to Germany. Later, the company learned that the woman had been working on strategically important information on the North American market, thus the knowledge this woman had created had been erroneously "let go" in the process of downsizing.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Intellectual capital: perceptions of productivity a and investment|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1415-65552011000200006&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Revista de Administração Contemporânea|issn = 1415-6555|pages = 249–260|volume = 15|issue = 2|doi = 10.1590/S1415-65552011000200006|first = Aristides Isidoro|last = Ferreira|first2 = Luís Fructuoso|last2 = Martinez}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral of the story espoused by the author was that the company should have structuralized this knowledge so that it could be owned and retained by the firm even after eliminating the woman from its payroll. Why was the woman fired? Surely, the firm should have been more aware of its developing knowledge sets because knowledge sets are the bases from which all intellectual capital emanates. Furthermore, the strategically relevant information is communicable and could have been codified.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Issues in managing multiple capital ===
How does the firm manage both its structural capital as product and its human capital as process? If this flip side seems humanistic, it is. The human intellect is the only entity that has the capacity to create new knowledge that has value. Computers may reassemble information into new modes analytically but cannot integrate these into something new. Structuralization of human capital may be only possible and desired when it can be used to further help the development of human capital, as non-contextual data or information, or sold as a product for profit. An important insight is that the firm need not own something outright in order for it to profit from association. An example of such an intangible tacit knowledge set that the firm could hardly structuralize and yet profits by association is seen in the relational capital created between a sales agent and client.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The move towards structuralization of tacit, experiential knowledge may result in other problems. Attempts to measure knowledge stock may disrupt the very process involved in creating new knowledge stocks. In such attempts, will we have killed the goose in order to get the golden egg? That is, the very process of measurement may interfere with the process by which knowledge creates value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Tacit Dimension|url = http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo6035368.html|website = University of Chicago Press|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, firms should also look towards leveraging intellectual capital through "organising" rather than "structuralizaing" their knowledge assets: organising attempts to coordinate the intellectual capital elements such that their interaction increases ongoing value of the firm as a  " going concern" rather than simply as an asset on a balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another problem here may be called the "false recipe" syndrome where the metaphor is that of the chef who, unconsciously or otherwise, neglects to communicate subtle but important elements of a recipe. Managers often lose the support of labor in initiating productivity improvement  exercise because, rightly or wrongly, they are perceived as designed to put workers out of a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Commitment: Dynamic of Strategy|url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/Commitment-Dynamic-Strategy-Pankaj-Ghemawat/dp/0029115752|publisher = The Free Press|date = 1991-08-15|location = New York|isbn = 9780029115756|first = Pankaj|last = Ghemawat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product and process ==
In managing intellectual capital there are at least two distinct things that are being managed. Figure 2 illustrates these two streams flowing from the development of human capital.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (Figure 2 source.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;)

=== Stock ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Process and product chart.jpeg|thumb|450x450px|Figure 2]] --&gt;
The first is the knowledge stock itself. The most successful examples of managing intellectual capital from the literature are indicative of this type. Because this type represents the structural capital of the "structuralization" assumption, this is not surprising. It is, however, important. Usually these consist of the products of the intellectual capital development process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Work ===
The second thing being managed is the knowledge work itself. This is more difficult to manage than the first because of its intangible nature. Inevitably the knowledge worker will be the best equipped to understand the full requirements of any particular job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intellectual Capital for Communities|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qtwJBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2012-06-25|isbn = 9781136395000|first = Ahmed|last = Bounfour|first2 = Leif|last2 = Edvinsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, managers must act as facilitators, setting up the structures and process that will help the knowledge worker will be best equipped to understand the full requirements of any particular job. In this case, managers must act as facilitators, setting up the structures and processes that will help the knowledge worker's development and allow for the efficient interaction of human capital with the other elements of the intellectual capital framework.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[European Union]] (EU) '''directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights (2005/0127/COD)''' was a proposal from the European Commission for a [[European Union directive|directive]] aimed "to supplement [[Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights|Directive 2004/48/EC of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (Civil enforcement)]]" (''Source: Justification for the proposal, COM(2005) 276 final, July 12, 2005''). The directive was proposed on July 12, 2005 by the [[Commission of the European Communities]].

Being the second directive on the enforcement of "intellectual property rights", it is commonly called '''IPRED2''' (Second Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive). The first directive on the enforcement of Intellectual property rights, Directive 2004/48/EC deals with civil enforcement of intellectual property rights ("IPRED1"). IPRED1 was hastily passed before the [[Enlargement of the European Union#Madrid European Council Criteria|Fifth Enlargement of the European Union]] of May 1, 2004 and did originally include criminal sanctions provisions, but this rather controversial part was omitted in order to be able to meet the deadline of May 1, 2004.

As announced in Official Journal C 252 of 18 September 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:252:0007:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the European Commission decided to withdraw the proposal for a directive. Criminal sanctions for enforcement of intellectual property rights are therefore not currently formally proposed, even if it is part of the [[EU acquis]] since the [[Lisbon Treaty]].

==Subject matter==

This proposed directive incriminates infringements of intellectual property rights. It deals with intentional infringements on a commercial scale or aiding, abetting or inciting to the infringements.

===Community IP Rights===

The proposed directive applies to "such intellectual property rights as are provided for in Community legislation and/or national legislation in the Member States". No definition is provided in the original draft&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005PC0276(01):EN:NOT&lt;/ref&gt; and in that form, the Directive would apply to any intellectual property right. Subsequent readings of the Directive have included clarifications. Examples of such expressly included rights are ''sui generis'' rights of database makers or trademark rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2/JURI_Tabled_Amendments&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents===

The Directive, in its first draft, includes patent violation, traditionally a civil issue. This would possibly have far-reaching consequences for the EU economy as the risk of criminal prosecution for violating patents when new products or new functions are included is great.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsfe.org/en/fellows/gerloff/blog/ipred2_universally_unloved&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, traditionally, a large majority of all patent disputes are settled out of court before civil infringement disputes continue. The bill also includes a provision which would allow intellectual property holders to assist the police in an investigation, which cedes great power from the state to a patent-holder to threaten rivals with imprisonment, rather than a civil suit alone.&lt;ref name="fipr.org"&gt;http://www.fipr.org/copyright/ipred2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament has, in subsequent reading, excluded patents from the scope of the Directive.

===Consumers===

The Directive applies to ''willful, commercial or intentional'' violations of trademark or copyright laws.&lt;ref name="Article 1"&gt;Article 1&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment that would have limited the directive to commercial activity done with the intent to earn a profit was rejected. Instead, consumers will be criminally liable if their behavior is not for ''personal and not for profits purposes'' and was done for the purpose of obtaining ''an economic advantage''.

==Criticism==

According to some, IPRED2 does not seem to be a particularly well drafted Directive.&lt;ref name="fipr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2&lt;/ref&gt; The number of amendments passed and adopted in subsequent readings is unusual, as is evident from the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5263692&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions, usually contained in the preamble or the beginning articles, were missing until subsequent readings. Originally about commercial piracy and counterfeit goods only, in its present form it includes any violation of Intellectual Property rights.&lt;ref name="Article 1"/&gt;

The criticism voiced by [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]],&lt;ref name="eff.org"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005174.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]],&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"&gt;http://action.ffii.org/ipred2/FFII_Analysis?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=introduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Law Society of England and Wales,&lt;ref name="lawsociety.org.uk"&gt;http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/secure/file/157008/e:/teamsite-deployed/documents//templatedata/Internet%20Documents/Non-government%20proposals/Documents/ipcriminalsanctions310806.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Dutch Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=354&amp;res=1024_ff&amp;print=0&lt;/ref&gt; and others includes:

*The original proposal did not explain the terms it was using. The definitions section (Article 1) was only added in the subsequent readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ip.mpg.de/shared/data/pdf/directive_of_the_european_parliament_and_of_the_council_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222010703/http://www.ip.mpg.de/shared/data/pdf/directive_of_the_european_parliament_and_of_the_council_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The scope of the Directive is too wide (Article 2). The draft directive still applies to a broader range of intellectual property infringements than commercial piracy and counterfeiting. As a result, it is far broader than the current international standard for criminal IP enforcement — the 1994 TRIPs agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_01_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Patents have recently been taken out of the scope but many other IP rights have not. Some of the latter are poorly suited to criminal regulation (such as database rights or conditional access to pay TV regimes).&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"/&gt;
*The inclusion of aiding, abetting or inciting (Article 3) puts businesses at unnecessary risk of criminal liability.&lt;ref name="lawsociety.org.uk"/&gt;
*The sanctions provisions (Article 4) has been hastily put together and contains draconian measures poorly suited to intellectual property infringements.&lt;ref name="action.ffii.org"/&gt;

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law and that IPRED2 presents a risk to industry and innovation.&lt;ref name="eff.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005139.php&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] (FFII), it is impossible not to violate [[software patent]]s, and the IPRED 2 directive threatens most of Europe's software developers with imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown authors, [http://wiki.ffii.org/Ipred2Pr060512En ''EU Commission proposes to criminalise European software industry''], Cooperative Web Editing System (wiki) at FFII. Consulted on February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch parliament]] wrote a letter to EU Commissioner Frattini with a thorough legal analysis of the proposed directive, concluding that the subject-matter of the proposed directive definitely falls outside the [[European Community]]’s competence (as defined in the EU treaties).&lt;ref&gt;Monika Ermert, [http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=354&amp;res=1024_ff&amp;print=0 ''EU IP Enforcement Directive Questioned On Procedure''], Intellectual Property Watch, July 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajaji Salai,''' also known as '''North Beach Road''' or '''First Line Beach''', is one of the main thoroughfares of the commercial centre of [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The road connects [[Royapuram]] in the north with Quibble Island in the south. Being the main thoroughfare connecting the erstwhile Whitetown and Blacktown, the road has several historical landmarks that date back to the colonial era.

==Landmarks==
Once the seat of power, Rajaji Salai still retains its importance with several important buildings, including [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St. George]], [[Chennai Port Trust Centenary Building|Chennai Port Trust]], [[Reserve Bank of India, South Zonal Office|Reserve Bank of India]], [[Chennai District Collectorate]] and the [[Madras High Court]]. Half way towards the south, the road borders the eastern end of [[China Bazaar Road, Chennai|China Bazaar Road]], marking one of the most famous junctions of the city, the [[Parry's Corner]]. More historical and heritage buildings are located on important streets around Rajaji Salai, such as the Armenian Church, the Anderson Church, the Gokhale Hall, the State Bank of India Local Head Office building, Dare House and the Collectorate Building. During the regime of former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, the present subway on Rajaji Salai was constructed, replacing the level crossing between Chennai Beach and Chennai Fort stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Sergio Mantegazza''' (born 1927) is a Swiss-Italian businessman, chairman and owner of [[Group Voyagers|Globus]], a multinational travel company. According to ''[[Forbes]]'', Mantegazza is the 16th richest person in Switzerland, with an estimated net worth of US$2.9 billion as of March 2018.

==Early life==
Sergio Mantegazza was born in [[Lugano]], Switzerland, to Antonio and Angelina Mantegazza in 1927. He has a brother, Geo Mantegazza. He was educated at [[Istituto Elvetico]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; and [[Gademann Business School]].

==Career==
As a young man, Mantegazza developed further business and entrepreneurial skills by working in the family business after leaving education. Founded by his father Antonio in 1928,  [https://www.globusjourneys.com/Travel-Globus/History/ Globus Viaggi] initially started with a single gondola ferrying tourists and goods across and around [[Lake Lugano]], Switzerland. Antonio Mantegazza went on to acquire a fleet of 12 coaches to transport tourists around the area. By 1950, the company operated 33 coaches with the addition of overnight excursions to Rome, Venice and the French Riviera.

Globus operated circular tours to provide a more complete travel experience for its customers as well as providing the option of budget motor-coach European holidays. They later introduced the concept of Grand European Touring by offering first-class European tours to tourists. 

In 1961, the Globus group launched Cosmos Holidays in the United Kingdom and air holiday packages to southern Europe. This also led to other destinations like Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

In the late 1960's, [[Monarch Airlines]] was financed by the Globus Partners. This airline, established by two British businessmen, Bill Hodgson and Don Peacock, operated independently of Globus Getaway Holidays. [[Monarch Airlines]], working with Cosmos, were pioneers of packaged holidays and chartered flights in the UK. 

Mantegazza took over as president of Globus in 1975 and expanded the travel and tour business, introducing travel packages to Africa, Australia and South America. Globus also launched its North American company [[Group Voyagers]], overseeing US tour operations and the American market for the Globus and Cosmos brands.&lt;ref name="IB"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/monarch-restructuring-secretive-billionaire-mantegazza-family-behind-airline-1467206|title=Monarch Restructuring: The Secretive Billionaire Mantegazza Family Behind the Airline|last1=Allison|first1=Ian|date=25 September 2014|work=IB Times|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, Avalon Waterways and Monograms were also created, focusing on independent travel and river cruises.

'''Sergio Marchionne''' ({{IPA-it|ˈsɛrdʒo marˈkjɔnne|lang}}; June 17, 1952 – July 25, 2018) was an Italian-Canadian businessman, widely known for his turnarounds of the automakers [[Fiat]] and [[Chrysler]], his business acumen and his outspoken and often frank approach, especially when dealing with unpalatable issues related to his companies and the automotive industry. 

Marchionne was the chairman of [[CNH Industrial]], the chief executive officer (CEO) of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], the chairman and CEO of [[Chrysler|FCA US LLC]], the chairman and CEO of [[Ferrari]], and the chairman of [[Maserati]]. He was the chairman of Swiss-based [[SGS S.A.|SGS]] and vice chairman of [[UBS]] from 2008 to 2010, as well as the chairman of the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]] for 2012 (first elected in January 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotiveworld.com/WVMA/content.asp?contentid=57460 |title=Europe: Sergio Marchionne re-elected president of ACEA |publisher=Automotive World |date=January 12, 2007 |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/21/business/ubs.php|title=UBS Plans to Cut Chairman's Next Term After Subprime Losses.|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], and the chairman of the Italian branch of the [[Council for the United States and Italy]].

Noted for his keen observations of the automotive industry, Marchionne's insights ranged from frank criticism of his company's own products to a highly-regarded 2015 presentation titled ''Confessions of a Capital Junkie,'' extolling the benefits of industry consolidation.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite web

Marchionne was widely recognized for turning around [[FCA Italy|Fiat Group]] to become one of the fastest growing companies in the [[automotive industry|auto industry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2007/01/fiat_on_a_roll.html|title=Fiat Burning Rubber|publisher=BusinessWeek|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in less than two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/16806317|title=Fiat Net Profit Soars as Automaker Promises the First Dividend Since 2002|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he was instrumental in Fiat Group forming a strategic alliance with the ailing US automaker [[Chrysler]], with the support of the U.S. and Canadian governments and trade unions. Less than two years later, following its emergence from Chapter 11, Chrysler returned to profitability, repaying all government loans. In 2014, Fiat and Chrysler merged into a new holding company, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], now the seventh-largest automobile manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Fiat Chrysler to spin off Ferrari, issue $2.5 billion convertible bond|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/29/us-fiatchrysler-ferrari-divestiture-idUSKBN0II1DB20141029|newspaper = Reuters|date = October 29, 2014|access-date = July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Marchionne was born in [[Chieti]], [[Abruzzo]], Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fiatspa.com/en-US/governance/management/FiatDocuments/cv/Marchionne%20Sergio_CV_GEC_02-01-2012_eng.pdf |title="Marchionne Sergio CV" (PDF).

His father served as a ''[[Carabiniere]]'' in Istria, where he met his future wife. Marchionne's grandfather, Giacomo Zuccon, was killed in September 1943 by [[Yugoslav Partisans]] near [[Barban]] in Istria, while his uncle Giuseppe Zuccon was killed by the Nazis the same year. In 1945, when the region was occupied by the Yugoslav army, Marchionne's parents moved to [[Chieti]] in Abruzzo, where Sergio was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secoloditalia.it/2018/07/marchionne-il-nonno-infoibato-listria-nel-sangue-il-dramma-di-una-famiglia-italiana/ |title=Marchionne, il nonno infoibato, l’Istria nel sangue: il dramma di una famiglia italiana |publisher=Secoloditalia.it |date=February 23, 1976 |accessdate=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 13, Marchionne emigrated with his family to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, where they had relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abruzzoemigrazione.it/e_view.asp?E=44|title=Emigrazione Abruzzese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722023047/http://www.abruzzoemigrazione.it/e_view.asp?E=44|archivedate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying dual Canadian and Italian citizenship, he spoke fluent English, French and Italian. Marchionne was a Canadian [[Chartered Professional Accountant|certified general accountant]] (FCGA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/Programs/ScholarshipsAwardsAndOpportunities/HonoursAndAwards/FellowshipAward/Pages/ca_members_hon_awards_fcga_recipients.aspx |title=2011 CGA Fellowship Recipients |publisher=Cga-canada.org |date=December 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[barrister]], and a fellow of the [[Certified General Accountants of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webeconomia.it/sergio-marchionne-ecco-chi-lo-sostituira-in-fca/17356/ Sergio Marchionne: ecco chi lo sostituirà in FCA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchionne attended [[St. Michael's College School]], before completing his undergraduate studies in philosophy at the [[University of Toronto]] and earning a bachelor of commerce degree (1979) and an MBA (1985) from the [[University of Windsor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwindsor.ca/alumni/sergio-marchionne-bcomm-79-mba-85|title=Sergio Marchionne BComm '79, MBA '85, Alumni Association, University of Windsor}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a law degree from [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] of [[York University]] (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?Article=2903|title=York in the Media|publisher=Y-File|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an honorary doctorate from [[Walsh College]] (2013).&lt;ref name="FCA-profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/group/governance/board_of_directors/Pages/sergio_marchionne.aspx|title=Sergio Marchionne|publisher=www.fcagroup.com|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchionne was elected as an independent member of the Board of Directors of Fiat S.p.A. in May 2003, until being appointed CEO in 2004.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=July |first=Bloomberg |url=http://fortune.com/2018/07/21/sergio-marchionne-fiat-chrysler/ |title=A Timeline of Sergio Marchionne's Transformative Fiat Chrysler Tenure |publisher=Fortune.com |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chrysler===

In June 2009, when [[Chrysler]] emerged from [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection, Fiat Group received a 20% stake in Chrysler Group LLC and Marchionne was appointed CEO, replacing existing CEO [[Robert Nardelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Noah Joseph RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/05/07/breaking-marchionne-confirmed-as-post-bankruptcy-chrysler-ceo/ |title=BREAKING: Marchionne confirmed as post-bankruptcy Chrysler CEO |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 Marchionne sparked widespread controversy in the U.S. when he remarked at the [[J.D. Power &amp; Associates]] International Automotive Roundtable that Chrysler's [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|bail-out loans]] from the U.S. government carried "[[shyster]] rates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2515333e-321d-11e0-a820-00144feabdc0.html|title=Fiat in firestorm for floating Detroit move|author=Rachel Sanderson and John Reed|date=February 6, 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marchionne immediately issued a public apology, stating "I regret the remark and consider it inappropriate" and going on to explain that "As the only parties willing to underwrite the risk associated with Chrysler’s recovery plan, the two governments [U.S. and Canadian] levied interest rates that, although appropriate at the time, are above current market conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-05/chrysler-s-marchionne-says-he-regrets-loans-comment-update1-.html|title=Chrysler's Marchionne Says Calling Loans `Shyster Rates' Was Inappropriate|author=Dan Hart|date=February 5, 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg News|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, following the purchase of the ownership interests held by Canada and the US Treasury, Fiat’s stake in Chrysler increased to 53.5% and in September 2011, Marchionne was also elected Chairman of Chrysler. Fiat and Chrysler officially merged under Marchionne's leadership on August 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/media_center/FiatDocuments/2014/Agosto/Approval_of_Cross_Border_Merger.pdf?redirectFromFiatspa=1|title=APPROVAL OF CROSS-BORDER MERGER TO CREATE FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES N.V. (FCA)|website=www.fcagroup.com|publisher=Fiat S.p.A.|accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2015 [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]], in January 2017, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] also accused Fiat Chrysler of illegally installing [[Defeat device#2010s|software that allowed excess diesel emissions to go undetected]]. Marchionne denied any wrongdoing. Therein he was critical of the EPA and rejected comparisons between Fiat Chrysler and [[Volkswagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiatchrysler-emissions-idUSKBN14W29S|title=EPA accuses Fiat Chrysler of excess diesel emissions|author1=David Shepardson|author2=Bernie Woodall|date=January 13, 2017|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/business/epa-emissions-cheating-diesel-fiat-chrysler-jeep-dodge.html|title=E.P.A.

The only thing that matters to him is results. If you don't deliver, you are out. He is quite ruthless. When Marchionne took over the company [Fiat], he was literally firing one manager a day but there was a leadership problem and nobody wanted to take hard decisions. The communication from bottom to top in management was slow and wrong. He also changed that. He reduced the layers of management and gave his role a more direct view of what the business was doing. And of course his ego is very big and sometimes people who had clashes with him were basically fired. Looking at his style from outside it seems awful, but he delivered."}}

Despite the buttoned-down business world in which he worked, Marchionne disliked having to think about his wardrobe, and became known for wearing black sweaters and jeans &amp;mdash; keeping a supply of both in each of his residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sergio Marchionne, Who Revived Fiat and Chrysler, Dies at 66 |publisher = The New York Times |author = Neal E.

==Views and ideology==
He supported [[Muslim Brotherhood]] against the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]]. He is a member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Kuwait and has been described in US State Department cables as a "moderate Islamist".&lt;ref&gt;"Help cure West's ills, Muslims told", Catherine Porter, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', Monday, January 6, 2003, Ontario edition, Section: News, p. A08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/05KUWAIT3384_a.html|title=Cable: 05KUWAIT3384_a|work=wikileaks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he said "If Islamists start to become tyrants in the countries that were hit by the [[Arab Spring]], we will revolt against them just like we did against their predecessors.” and that “Freedom is a holy right and is one of the principles in Islam ... Freedom is to do and say what a person wishes but in a polite manner and without hurting others.” &lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/25/203152.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he demanded that the [[European Union]], as well as the rest of the world, enact “a law that forbids the insult to religious figures and religious sacred opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecews5f7xts|title=Mohammed Cartoons - Tareq Al-Suweidan|date=7 February 2009|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has supported women's rights within Islamic [[sharia]] law and advocated for reforming traditional understanding of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedohadebates.com/debates/item/indexbae7.html|title=This House believes that Arab women should have full equality with men|work=thedohadebates.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Suwaidan is one of the signatories of [[A Common Word Between Us and You]], an open letter by Islamic scholars to [[Christian]] leaders, calling for peace and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=faq#link7|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679252|title=Qatar Opens Debate on Thorny Muslim, Arab Issues|date=3 June 2005|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Suwaidan has condemned the [[9/11]] terrorists saying "these people are very dangerous to themselves, to the Arab world, to the Islamic world itself, and to Islam itself." 
 	
Al-Suwaidan is a strong supporter of women's rights in the Middle East and has participated in the Doha Debates arguing in favor of women's political and social rights. He spoke out against forced marriages calling it "un-Islamic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVQhmfe6iiQ|title=BBCDohaDebates - June 1, 2005 - Series 1 Episode 7 (Part 6)|first=|last=BBCDohaDebates|date=27 July 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Suwaidan has also been a harsh critic of the US and the West and at conference of the [[Islamic Circle of North America]] in 2000, Al-Suwaidan said: "We must tell the West that we are extending a hand of peace now, but it will not be so for long." "Even if a civilization is ready to crumble – like the West, with all the characteristics of deterioration of past fallen empires – it will not fall until we, the Muslims, strive to give it that last push, the last straw that will break the camel's back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/mixed-messages-from-touring-muslim-lecturer/story-e6frgcjx-1226386791743&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the [[Islamic Association of Palestine]] in Chicago in 2000 Al-Suwiadan said "Palestine will not be liberated but through Jihad. Nothing can be achieved without sacrificing blood. The Jews will meet their end at our hands." He was subsequently banned from the US.&lt;ref&gt;"Hardline cleric banned in the US will preach to British universities" Patrick Sawer; Philip Sherwell The Sunday Telegraph (London) January 24, 2010 Section: News; Pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2007, Al-Suwaidan was listed by U.S. federal prosecutors, along with a group of U.S. Muslim Brotherhood members, as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]] in the [[terrorism financing]] case against the [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development]] which was convicted along with its leaders of financing [[Hamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/112508dnmetholylandverdicts.1e5022504.html?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202111922/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/112508dnmetholylandverdicts.1e5022504.html|title=Holy Land Foundation defendants guilty on all counts -  News for Dallas, Texas - Dallas Morning News  -  Latest News|archivedate=2 December 2008|work=dallasnews.com|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/423.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/national/islamic-groups-named-in-hamas-funding-case/55778/|title=Islamic Groups Named in Hamas Funding Case|work=nysun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Federal court subsequently ruled that the list of unindicted co-conspirators should not have been released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20101106-Judge-ruled-prosecutors-should-not-have-6808.ece|title=Judge ruled prosecutors should not have publicly released Holy Land unindicted co-conspirators list|work=dallasnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In an April 2012 interview for Al-Quds, a TV station affiliated with [[Hamas]], he claimed that since politicians were controlled by money and the media which are controlled by the Jews, only "armed resistance"  and not Western aid or Western popular sympathy could change the situation in Palestine and Jerusalem. He also said in the interview that the most dangerous thing facing Muslims is the Jews calling them "the greatest enemy." &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/mixed-messages-from-touring-muslim-lecturer/story-e6frgcjx-1226386791743&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Suwaidan subsequently denied charges of antisemitism stating, "We are not against the Jews, let this be very clear." He alleged that the comments were based on a report by [[MEMRI]] which he called a "Zionist organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimvillage.com/2012/06/26/24397/tareq-al-suwaidan-defends-charges-anti-semitism/|title=Tareq Al Suwaidan defends charges of anti-semitism|work=MuslimVillage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In a sermon to Hamas which was later posted on the internet on July 14, 2014, Al-Suwaidan described Israel as "a deviant country...[that] is destined to be eradicated in its entirety," explaining that "We do not demand a ceasefire. Rather, we demand that the rockets continue to be launched until they bow before us." Al-Suwaidan further stated that:

{{cquote|All the mothers of the Islamic nation – not only Palestinian mothers – should suckle their babies on the hatred of the sons of Zion. We hate them. They are our enemies. We should instill this in the souls of our children, until a new generation arises and wipes them off the face of the earth...Each and every one of us, when leaving this hall, should be contemplating a plan how to wipe out Israel.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4361.htm Kuwaiti Cleric Tareq Al-Suwaidan to Hamas: Do Not Agree to Ceasefire until They Bow Before Us. We Must Contemplate a Plan to Erase Israel], [[MEMRI]],  Clip No. 4361 (transcript), July 14, 2014. (video clip [http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4361.htm available here])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/RichLowry/Israel/2014/07/25/id/584876/ Hamas Peace Plan Is to Wipe Out Israel] by Rich Lowry, [[Newsmax Media]], July 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In November 2014, Al-Suwaidan was banned by the Belgium government from attending a Muslim Fair in [[Brussels]] on the basis of the comments made in this sermon. On his Twitter account, Al-Suwaidan wrote, "Under pressure from the Zionist Lobby, the Belgium government decided to prevent me from entering the country despite holding a valid visa."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kuwaiti Muslim scholar denied entry to Belgium|url = https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/europe/15101-kuwaiti-muslim-scholar-denied-entry-to-belgium|website = Middle East Monitor - The Latest from the Middle East|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the reason they denied him entry was his "candid position regarding Zionism and the barbaric crimes of the Israeli occupation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Belgium government announced that it had decided to prevent Al-Suwaidan from visiting Brussels, because of his "anti-Semitic" remarks in the past.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Belgian Prime Minister and Interior Minister said "This preacher has unacceptable anti-Semitic beliefs and his presence here is a threat to public order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/141104/belgium-bars-kuwaiti-preacher-alleged-anti-semitism|title=Belgium bars Kuwaiti preacher for alleged anti-Semitism|work=GlobalPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Suwaidan used his Twitter account to promote what he calls electronic Jihad. On January 17, 2012, Al Suwaidan tweeted: "I see the need in uniting the efforts of the hackers within the electronic jihad project against the Zionist enemy, and it is an effective and important jihad, and its reward is great – Allah willing." AlSuwaidan: "I Strongly Encourage Young People To Undertake Electronic Jihad... I View This As Better Than 20 Jihad Operations."

In a June 4, 2011 interview on [[AlQuds TV]], AlSuwaidan called for armed resistance and electronic jihad against Israel: "The other day, I was asking myself: Why shouldn't I personally go on jihad? First of all, my body cannot tolerate it. Secondly, is what I am doing any less important than jihad? I would like us all to feel that we are in the same trench. There is such a thing as media jihad, political jihad, and a form of jihad that I strongly encourage young people to undertake – electronic jihad. Some of our youth are extremely clever. I hope that a group of hackers will get together, and will wage resistance over the Internet, targeting Israeli and Zionist sites and destroying them electronically.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Clashes with Gulf states===
In November 2012 a [[UAE]] police official said that suspects arrested in UAE had met with Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood members who are the ‘mentors of other groups’. He said "They hold courses and teach members how to act and resist, such as Tareq Al-Suwaidan. His anti-regime attitude is very clear." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/11/12/dubai-top-cop-spews-bile-at-brotherhood-some-kuwaiti-mps-barred-from-uae/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |work=archive.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117035052/http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/11/12/dubai-top-cop-spews-bile-at-brotherhood-some-kuwaiti-mps-barred-from-uae/ |archivedate=2012-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In October 2013, Al-Suwaidan tweeted that he had been barred from performing the lesser [[Umrah]] pilgrimage in [[Saudi Arabia]], stating "I have been banned from entering Saudi Arabia solely for my views and my position against the coup in [[Egypt]] and I say that my love for Saudi Arabia and its people is unshaken and that ideas can [never] be banned.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/kuwaiti-preacher-barred-from-makkah-pilgrimage-1.1238437|title=Kuwaiti preacher barred from Makkah pilgrimage|author=Gulf News Report|work=gulfnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity ==
Al-Suwaidan has authored over 30 books, but his popularity is largely a result of his widespread [[social media]] activity– including: YouTube, Vimeo, iTunes, Facebook, Twitter.

'''''The Goal''''' is a [[business fable|management-oriented novel]] by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]], a business consultant known for his [[Theory of Constraints]],  and [http://jeffcox.com/books.html Jeff Cox], a best selling author and co-author of multiple management-oriented novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/authors/Jeff-Cox/1306788|title=Jeff Cox|website=Simon &amp; Schuster|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''The Goal'''''  was originally published in 1984 and has since been revised and republished.  This book can be used for case studies in operations management, with a focus geared towards the Theory of Constraints, bottlenecks and how to alleviate them, and applications of these concepts in real life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/products/9780566086656 A summary of ''The Goal'' by Gower Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in management colleges to teach students about the importance of strategic capacity planning and constraint management. [[Time (magazine)|''Time Magazine'']] listed the book as one of "The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books|url = http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2086680_2086683_2087672,00.html|newspaper = Time|date = 2011-08-09|access-date = 2016-02-20|issn = |first = Nate|last = Rawlings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
Like other books by Goldratt and by Cox, ''The Goal'' is written as a piece of fiction. The main character is Alex Rogo, who manages a production plant owned by UniCo Manufacturing, where everything is always behind schedule and things are looking dire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = “Then Why Did We Buy the NCX-10?”|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/business/operations/2012/06/the_goal_eli_goldratt_s_gripping_thriller_about_operations_theory_.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2012-06-08|access-date = 2016-02-20|issn = 1091-2339|language = en-US|first = Seth|last = Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the book, Bill Peach, a company executive, tells Alex that he has three months to turn operations at his plant around from being unprofitable and unreliable to being successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maaw.info/ArticleSummaries/ArtSumTheGoal.htm A chapter-by-chapter summary of ''The Goal'']&lt;/ref&gt; His distant acquaintance, Jonah (a physicist), whom many believe represents Goldratt himself, helps him solve the company's problems through a series of telephone calls and short meetings. A second story line is introduced involving Alex's marital life.  Perhaps surprisingly, Jonah's concepts are also applied successfully in this alternative story line.

==Bottlenecks==
The book goes on to point out the role of [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]]s ([[Theory of Constraints#Constraints|constraints]]) in a manufacturing process, and how identifying them not only makes it possible to reduce their impact, but also yields a useful tool for measuring and controlling the flow of materials. Alex and his team identify the bottlenecks in their process and immediately begin to implement changes to help increase capacity and speed up production. In response to questions about the logic of using outdated technology in modern manufacturing, Alex's team brought in an old machine they received for free (which had previously been used at their plant in conjunction with two other machines) in order to increase the capacity of the NCX-10 machine, which had been identified as one of the two bottlenecks. Further more, they identified processes at the [[heat treating|heat treat]], identified as their second bottleneck, that caused massive delays in their getting product through the heat-treat and which had also caused some products to be heat-treated multiple times (to make softer and then harder again) instead of just once or not at all.

==Socratic method==
In the book, Jonah teaches Alex Rogo by using the [[Socratic method]]. Throughout the book, whenever a meeting or telephone call dialogue happens with Jonah he poses a question to Alex Rogo or a member of his crew which in turn causes them to talk amongst themselves to come up with a solution to their problem. When Alex Rogo is with his wife, he finds the Socratic method to be a way to fix his marriage which he then uses, with his crew, to come up with the five steps they should use to fix problems in the plant which ultimately leads him and Lou to think up the three things every division manager, the position Rogo is promoted to, should be able to do.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9767">The '''Training Within Industry''' ('''TWI''') service was created by the [[United States Department of War]], running from 1940 to 1950 within the [[War Manpower Commission]].  The purpose was to provide consulting services to war-related industries whose personnel were being [[Conscription|conscripted]] into the [[United States Army|US Army]] at the same time the War Department was issuing orders for additional [[matériel]].  It was apparent that the shortage of trained and skilled personnel at precisely the time they were needed most would impose a hardship on those industries, and that only improved methods of job training would address the shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ATO/Admin/WarProgram/charts/WarProgram-20.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of [[World War II]], over 1.6 million workers in over 16,500 plants had received a certification. The program continued post-war in Europe and Asia, where it aided reconstruction.  It is most notable in the business world for inspiring the concept of [[kaizen]] in Japan.

==Overview==

The four basic training programs (10-hour sessions) developed by TWI were developed by experts on loan from [[Private sector|private industry]]. Because of the intensity of the situation, a large number of experimental methods were tried and discarded. This resulted in a distilled, concentrated set of programs. Each program had introductory programs called "Appreciation Sessions" that were used to sell the programs to top management and introduce the programs to middle management of a company. Each program also had 'Train-the-Trainer' programs and handbooks called "Institute Conductor's Manual" for the master trainers.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations&gt;{{cite book | last = Dinero | first = Donald | title = Training Within Industry: The Foundation of Lean | year = 2005 | location = Portland, OR | publisher = Productivity Press | isbn = 9781563273070 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The TWI Service also developed a number of "Staff Only" training programs to support staff development and to improve the implementation success.

The TWI trainers had to be invited to a factory in order to present their material.  In order to market the service, they developed the Five Needs of the Supervisor: every supervisor needs to have Knowledge of the Work, Knowledge of Responsibility, Skill in Instructing, Skill in Improving Methods, and Skill in Leading.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;  Each program was based on Charles Allen's 4-point method of Preparation, Presentation, Application, and Testing.

The 10-hour Sessions were:

* Job Instruction (JI) - a course that taught trainers (supervisors and experienced workers) to train inexperienced workers faster. The instructors were taught to break down jobs into closely defined steps, show the procedures while explaining the key points and the reasons for the key points, then watch the student attempt under close coaching, and finally to gradually wean the student from the coaching.  The course emphasized the credo, "If the worker hasn't learned, the instructor hasn't taught".&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt; At the request of enterprises outside of manufacturing, variations to the JI program were developed for hospitals, office and farms.
* Job Methods (JM) - a course that taught workers to objectively evaluate the efficiency of their jobs and to methodically evaluate and suggest improvements. The course also worked with a job breakdown, but students were taught to analyze each step and determine if there were sufficient reason to continue to do it in that way by asking a series of pointed questions. If they determined some step could be done better by eliminating, combining, rearranging, or simplifying, they were to develop and apply the new method by selling it to the "boss" and co-workers, obtaining approval based on safety, quality, quantity, and cost, standardizing the new method, and giving credit.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;
* Job Relations (JR) - a course that taught supervisors to deal with workers effectively and fairly. It emphasized the lesson, "People Must Be Treated As Individuals".&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;
* Program Development (PD) - the meta-course that taught those with responsibility for the training function to assist the line organization in solving production problems through training.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;

There was also a short-lived course that taught union personnel (UJR) to work effectively with management.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;

=== Additional programs ===

Internal training programs were; "Management Contact Manual" (1944) - a formal training course on how to sell the TWI programs to management, "How to get Continuing Results from TWI Programs in a Plant" (1944) - this training program was the out-growth of two years of practical experimentation and experience on what it took to have a successful implementation of TWI.

* Job Safety (JS) - While the US TWI Service chose to not develop a JS program, stating that safety was part of every job, Canada led the way with the first variant that was closely modeled on the JI program. This program was offered to England, which declined and developed a JS program that focused on discovery of risk and resolution. Copies of the British programs were circulated in Japan starting about 1948.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archive SCAP collection)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Problem Solving (PS) - There are two different programs using similar names. The TWI Foundation released their PS program in 1946 and follows the standard J program format. TWI, Inc. released their program in 1955 and is a much more comprehensive program that revolves around using the JI, JR and JM programs for problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archive SCAP collection; US National Archive TWIF Collection)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discussion Leading (DL) - This is an early work in developing what is now recognized as facilitation skills. TWIF also produced a variant of this program called Conference Leading.

=== Expansion to other nations ===

There were several groups that had an impact in the expansion of the TWI programs around the world - [[United States Department of State|US State Department]], [[United States Army|US Army]], [[British Ministry of Labour,]] [[International Labour Organization|International Labor Organization]] (ILO) and [[Standard Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archives ; British National Archives; ILO Archives Geneva)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1944, the British Ministry of Labour sent [[Frank Perkins (British Politician)|Frank Perkins]] to the US to evaluate the TWI programs.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: British National Archives - Perkins Report - folder LAB 18-139)&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1944, Perkins returned to England to establish a similar program. The British Ministry of Labour actively promoted the TWI programs, listing 65 countries in addition to the US and England where TWI was known to be in use as of 1959.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: British National Archive - folder LAB 18-724)&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion into Europe was led by Standard Oil, which led the translation efforts of the manuals into native languages. 
Some European TWI activity was done under the [[Marshall Plan]] by "Visiting Experts" (VE), with limited success. It was the later work by the ILO using the Standard Oil translations and re-translation efforts that established the TWI programs in Europe. The ILO TWI training program in [[Bangalore|Bangalore India]] has the distinction of training the first Japanese about 1947.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference: US National Archive SCAP collection - Japan; ILO Archives Geneva)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post war ===

Although the TWI program funding for application of the programs in the USA by the government ended in 1945, the US government did fund the introduction to the war-torn nations of Europe and Asia. Several private groups continued to provide TWI in the US and abroad. Channing Dooley, Walter Dietz, Mike Kane and [[Bill Conover]] (collectively known as "the Four Horsemen") continued the development of the 'J' programs by establishing the TWI Foundation.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt; This group was responsible for continuing the spread of TWI throughout Europe and Asia. The Director of one of the district offices established TWI, Inc., and was hired by the US Government to provide TWI training in Japan. It was especially well received in Japan, where TWI formed the basis of the [[kaizen]] culture in industry.  ''Kaizen'', known by such names as ''Quality Circles'' in the West, was successfully harnessed by [[Toyota Motor Corporation]] in conjunction with the [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] or [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] principles of [[Taiichi Ohno]].  In the Foreword to Dinero's book "Training Within Industry", John Shook relates a story in which a Toyota trainer brought out an old copy of a TWI service manual to prove to him that American workers at [[NUMMI]] could be taught using the "Japanese" methods used at Toyota.  Thus, TWI was the forerunner of what is today regarded as a Japanese creation.&lt;ref name = dinero-foundations/&gt;

The '''UNSW Business School''' at the [[University of New South Wales]] is a business school located in [[Sydney]], Australia. It is a [[University and college admission|highly selective]], [[Reputation|prestigious]] and [[Leading University|world leader]] in business education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/degrees-courses|title=Degrees &amp; Courses|work=UNSW Business School|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNSW business school leads in research and rankings of its educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/research/research-grants/rankings|title=Rankings|work=UNSW Business School|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school offers 42 programs, including 26 undergraduate and 26 specialist master's degrees, as well as six [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] and executive programs through the [[Australian Graduate School of Management]].

== History ==
Accountancy, the first school of the Faculty of Commerce, began operations in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/documents/Accountancy-A249.pdf|title=Agency Details - School of Accountancy/Accounting|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty of Commerce was then formed formally in 1957 - later re-named the Faculty of Commerce and Economics in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/documents/A22-FCE.pdf|title=Agency Details - Faculty of Commerce/Commerce and Economics|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 the [[Australian Graduate School of Management]] (AGSM) was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/documents/A403-AGSM.pdf|title=Agency Details - Australian Graduate School of Management|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Faculty of Commerce and Economics and the AGSM merged to form what was initially known as the Faculty of Business, before being renamed the Australian School of Business (ASB) in 2007.  In 2014 the ASB was renamed the UNSW Business School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/documents/A317-ASB.pdf|title=Agency Details - Faculty of Business/Australian School of Business/UNSW Business School|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5718">[[Image:CVP-TC-FC-VC.svg|thumb|right|240px|Decomposing [[Total Costs]] as [[Fixed Costs]] plus '''Variable Costs'''.]]

'''Variable costs''' are costs that change in proportion to the good or service that a business produces.&lt;ref name="GNB pp 48"&gt;Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 48&lt;/ref&gt; Variable costs are also the sum of [[marginal cost]]s over all units produced. They can also be considered normal costs. [[Fixed cost]]s and variable costs make up the two components of [[total cost]]. '''Direct costs''', however, are costs that can easily be associated with a particular [[cost object]].&lt;ref name="GNB pp 51"&gt;Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 51&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all variable costs are direct costs. For example, variable manufacturing [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] costs are variable costs that are [[indirect costs]], not direct costs.  Variable costs are sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.

Direct labor and overhead are often called '''conversion cost''',&lt;ref name="GNB pp 39"&gt;Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 39&lt;/ref&gt; while direct material and direct labor are often referred to as '''prime cost'''.&lt;ref name="GNB pp 39" /&gt;

In [[marketing]], it is necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed. This distinction is crucial in forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 60 percent responded that they found the "variable and fixed costs" metric very useful.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-705829-2}}. Content used from this source has been licensed under CC-By-SA and GFDL and may be reproduced verbatim. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of variable cost is influenced by many factors, such as [[fixed cost]], [[Duration (project management)|duration of project]], [[uncertainty]] and [[Interest rate|discount rate]]. An analytical formula of variable cost as a function of these factors has been derived. It can be used to assess how different factors impact variable cost and total return in an investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last=Chen|first=Jing|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
===Example 1===

Assume a business produces clothing. A variable cost of this product would be the direct material, i.e., cloth, and the direct labor. If it takes one laborer 6 yards of cloth and 8 hours to make a shirt, then the cost of labor and cloth increases if two shirts are produced.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! 1 shirt  !! 2 shirts !! 3 shirts
|-
| Cloth (Direct Materials) || 6yds || 12yds || 18yds
|-
| Labor (Direct Labor) || 8hrs || 16hrs || 24hrs
|}


The amount of materials and labor that goes into each shirt increases in direct proportion to the number of shirts produced. In this sense, the cost "varies" as production varies.

===Example 2===
For example, a firm pays for [[raw materials]]. When activity is decreased, less raw material is used, and so the spending for raw materials falls. When activity is increased, more raw material is used, and spending therefore rises. Note that the changes in expenses happen with little or no need for managerial intervention. These costs are variable costs.

A company will pay for line rental and maintenance fees each period regardless of how much power gets used. And some electrical equipment (air conditioning or lighting) may be kept running even in periods of low activity. These expenses can be regarded as fixed. But beyond this, the company will use electricity to run plant and machinery as required. The busier the company, the more the plant will be run, and so the more electricity gets used. This extra spending can therefore be regarded as variable.

In retail the cost of goods is almost entirely a variable cost; this is not true of manufacturing where many fixed costs, such as depreciation, are included in the cost of goods.

Although taxation usually varies with profit, which in turn varies with sales volume, it is not normally considered a variable cost.

For some employees, salary is paid on monthly rates, independent of how many hours the employees work. This is a fixed cost. On the other hand, the hours of hourly employees can often be varied, so this type of labour cost is a variable cost.  The cost of material is a variable cost.
