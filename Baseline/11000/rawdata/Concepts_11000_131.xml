'''Ackermann's formula''' is a [[control system]] design method for solving the [[Full state feedback|pole allocation]] problem. One of the primary problems in control system design is the creation of controllers that will alter the dynamics of a system and alter the poles to a more suitable, and sometimes more stable, state. Such a problem can be tackled by many different methods; one such solution is the addition of a feedback loop in such a way that a gain is added to the input with which one can change the poles of the original system. If the system is [[ Controllability|controllable]], an efficient method for pole placement is Ackermann's formula, which allows one to choose arbitrary poles within the system. &lt;ref&gt; Modern Control System Theory and Design, 2nd Edition by Stanley M. Shinners &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/utari/acs/ee4314/lectures/Lecture%2022.pdf |format=PDF |title=State variable feedback  |website=Uta.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State feedback system==
Consider a linear time invariant system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/State_Feedback#Ackerman.27s_formula|title=Control Systems/State Feedback - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[state-space representation]]

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; y(t)=Cx(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the state vector, &lt;math&gt; u(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the input vector, and &lt;math&gt; A,B,C &lt;/math&gt; are matrices of compatible dimensions that represent the dynamics of our system, and, for simplicity's sake, assume  &lt;math&gt; D=0 &lt;/math&gt;. An input-output description of this system is given by the [[transfer function]]

: &lt;math&gt; C(sI-A)^{-1}B=C\ \frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)}\ B.&lt;/math&gt;

Since  &lt;math&gt;(sI-A)^{-1}=\frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)} &lt;/math&gt;,  the denominator of the system is given by the [[characteristic polynomial]] of  &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the poles of the system are the [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

If the system is [[Exponential stability|unstable]], or has a slow response or any other characteristic that does not specify the design criteria, it could be advantageous to make changes to it. The realization given by &lt;math&gt;\{A,B,C\}&lt;/math&gt;, however, represents the dynamics of the system, and sometimes cannot be altered. Thus, one approach to this problem might be to create a feedback loop with a gain &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that will feed the state variable into the input.

If the system is [[Controllability|controllable]], there is always an input &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that any state &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; can be transferred to any other state &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. With that in mind, a feedback loop can be added to the system with the control input &lt;math&gt;u(t)=r(t)-Kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such that the new dynamics of the system will be 

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+B[r(t)+Kx(t)]= [A+BK] x(t)+Br(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y(t)=Cx(t).&lt;/math&gt;

In this new realization, the poles will be dependent on the characteristic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{new}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A-BK&lt;/math&gt;, that is 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(s)=\det(sI-(A-BK)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Ackermann's formula==

Computing the characteristic polynomial and choosing a suitable feedback matrix can be a challenging task, especially in larger systems. One way to make computations easier is through Ackermann's formula. For simplicity's sake, consider a single input vector with no reference parameter &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, such as 

: &lt;math&gt;u(t)=-k^T x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot x(t)=Ax(t)-Bk^T x(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; is a feedback vector of compatible dimensions. Given that the system is still controllable, Ackermann's method states that the design process can be simplified by the following equation: 

: &lt;math&gt;k^T =\left[0\ 0\ \cdots \ 0\ 1\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta_\text{new}(A),
&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

=== Proof===
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c18/e6-43-13-11.pdf |title=Pole Placement Control |format=PDF |website=Eolss.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Assume that the system is [[Controllability|controllable]]. Defining &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}:=(A-Bk^{T})&lt;/math&gt; gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A_{CL})^n + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \alpha_k A_{CL}^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the powers of &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt; results in 

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^0=(A-Bk^T)^0=I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^1 = (A-Bk^T)^1=A-Bk^T&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^2=(A-Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A+(Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-(Bk^T)[A-Bk^T]=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^n = (A-Bk^T)^n=A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}- \cdots -Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing the previous equations into &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})&lt;/math&gt; yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}-\cdots-Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1})+\cdots+\alpha_2(A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}) + \alpha_1 (A-Bk^T)+\alpha_0I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL}) =(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1}+\cdots + \alpha_2 A^2+\alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)-(A^{n-1}Bk^{T}+A^{n-2}Bk^T A_{CL}+\cdots+Bk^TA_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots +\alpha_2 (ABk^T+Bk^T A_{CL})+\alpha_1(Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1} + \cdots + \alpha_2 A^2 + \alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-(A^{n-1}Bk^T+A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL} + \cdots + Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots + \alpha_2 (ABk^T + Bk^T A_{CL}) +\alpha_1 (A+Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the above equation as a matrix product and omitting the terms that  &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; does not appear isolated gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1} B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]],  &lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(A_{CL}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;, thus

&lt;math&gt;\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right] &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Controllability#Continuous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems|controllability matrix]] of the system. Since the system is controllable,  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. Thus, 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

To find &lt;math&gt;k^{T}&lt;/math&gt;, both sides can be multiplied by the vector &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;. This yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

Consider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.31/www/Fall06/1631_topic13.pdf |format=PDF |title=Topic #13 : 16.31 Feedback Control|website=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]x+\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]u&lt;/math&gt;

We know from the characteristic polynomial of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that the system is unstable since &lt;math&gt;det(sI-A)=(s-1)(s-2)-1=(s-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will only have positive eigenvalues. Thus, to stabilize the system we shall put a feedback gain &lt;math&gt;K=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
k_1 &amp; k_2\end{array}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

From Ackermann's formula, we can find a matrix &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  that will change the system so that its characteristic equation will be equal to a desired polynomial. Suppose we want &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(s)=s^2+11s+30&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(A)=A^2+11A+30I&lt;/math&gt; and computing the controllability matrix yields

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
B &amp; AB\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Also, we have that &lt;math&gt;A^2=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, from Ackermann's formula

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right]+11\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]+30I\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
43 &amp; 14\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
29 &amp; -43\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
14 &amp; 57\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Acute stress reaction''' (also called '''acute stress disorder''', '''psychological shock''', '''mental shock''', or simply '''shock''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] condition arising in response to a terrifying or [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]], or witnessing a traumatic event that induces a strong [[emotional response]] within the individual. It should not be confused with the unrelated circulatory condition of [[shock(circulatory)|shock/hypoperfusion]]. Acute stress reaction (ASR) may develop into delayed stress reaction (better known as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], or PTSD) if stress is not correctly managed. ASR is characterized by re-living and avoiding reminders of an aversive event, as well as generalized [[hypervigilance]] after initial exposure to a traumatic event. ASR is differentiated from PTSD as a disorder that precedes it, and if symptoms last for more than one month, it will develop into PTSD. It can thus be thought of as the acute phase of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17588928.2014.996212 |pmid=25599382 |title=Acute stress disorder modifies cerebral activity of amygdala and prefrontal cortex |journal=Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |year=2015 |last1=Reynaud |first1=Emmanuelle |last2=Guedj |first2=Eric |last3=Trousselard |first3=Marion |last4=El Khoury-Malhame |first4=Myriam |last5=Zendjidjian |first5=Xavier |last6=Fakra |first6=Eric |last7=Souville |first7=Marc |last8=Nazarian |first8=Bruno |last9=Blin |first9=Olivier |last10=Canini |first10=Frédéric |last11=Khalfa |first11=Stephanie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The ''DSM-IV'' specifies that ASD must be accompanied by the presence of dissociative symptoms, which largely differentiates it from PTSD.

Dissociative symptoms include a sense of numbing or detachment from emotional reactions, a sense of physical detachment, such as seeing oneself from another perspective, decreased awareness of one’s surroundings, the perception that one’s environment is unreal or dreamlike, and the inability to recall critical aspects of the traumatic event (dissociative amnesia).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Acute Stress Disorder: A Handbook Of Theory, Assessment, And Treatment |last=Bryant |first=R. |last2=Harvey |first2=A. |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2000 |isbn= |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=3–40, 87–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the characteristic dissociative symptoms, Acute Stress Disorder from the DSM-5 can present from four other distinct symptom clusters such as&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;:

* Intrusion Symptom Cluster
** recurring and distressing dreams, flashbacks, and/or memories related to the traumatic event.
** intense/prolonged psychological distress or somatic reactions to internal or external traumatic cues.
* Negative Mood Cluster
** a persistent inability to experience positive emotions such as happiness, loving feelings, or satisfaction.
* Avoidance Symptom Cluster
** the avoidance of distressing memories, thoughts, feelings, or external reminders of said distressing memories, thoughts, and feelings of, or closely associated to traumatic event.
* Arousal Symptom Cluster
** Sleep disturbances, hypervigilance, difficulties with concentration, easy to startle, and irritability/anger/aggression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Causes ==
There are several theoretical perspectives on trauma response, including cognitive, biological, and psychobiological. While the theories are PTSD-specific, they are still useful in understanding ASD, as both share many symptoms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Acute stress disorder (abbreviated ASD, and not to be confused with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]]) is the result of a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]] in which the person experiences or witnesses an event that causes the victim/witness to experience extreme, disturbing, or unexpected fear, stress, or pain, and that involves or threatens serious injury, perceived serious injury, or death to themselves or someone else. A study of rescue personnel after exposure to a traumatic event showed no gender difference in acute stress reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1534765606294557 |title=Gender differences and acute stress reactions among rescue personnel 36 to 48 hours after exposure to traumatic event |journal=Traumatology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=139–42 |year=2006 |last1=Ben-Ezra |first1=Menachem |last2=Essar |first2=Nir |last3=Saar |first3=Ronen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acute stress reaction is a variation of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

A recent study found that a ''single'' stressful event may cause long-term consequences in the brain.  This result calls the traditional distinction between the effects of acute vs chronic stress into question.&lt;ref name="pmid 27698433"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/mp.2016.175 |pmid=27698433 |laysummary=http://neurosciencenews.com/brain-changes-stress-event-5589/ |laysource=Neuroscience News |laydate=November 23, 2016 |title=Acute stress is not acute: Sustained enhancement of glutamate release after acute stress involves readily releasable pool size and synapsin I activation |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1226–1227 |year=2016 |last1=Musazzi |first1=L |last2=Tornese |first2=P |last3=Sala |first3=N |last4=Popoli |first4=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
Stress is characterized by specific physiological responses to aversive or noxious stimuli.

[[Hans Selye]] was the first to coin the term “general adaptation syndrome”, to suggest that stress induced physiological responses proceed through the stages of alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8199583 |pmc=2560943 |year=1993 |author1=Butler |first1=G |title=Definitions of stress |journal=Occasional paper (Royal College of General Practitioners) |issue=61 |pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system gives rise to a specific set of physiological responses in response to physical or psychological stress. The body’s response to stress is also termed “fight-or-flight response”, and it is characterized by an increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles, the heart and brain, a rise in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as dilation of pupils, and an increase in the amount of glucose released by the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms Of Body Function |last=Widmaier |first=Eric P. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-259-60779-0 |location=Boston |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of an acute stress response is associated with specific physiological actions in the sympathetic nervous system, both directly and indirectly through the release of [[adrenaline]] and to a lesser extent [[noradrenaline]] from the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal gland]]s. These catecholamine [[hormone]]s facilitate immediate physical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and breathing, constricting blood vessels. An abundance of catecholamines at neuroreceptor sites facilitates reliance on spontaneous or intuitive behaviors often related to combat or escape.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Normally, when a person is in a serene, unstimulated state, the "firing" of neurons in the [[locus ceruleus]] is minimal. A novel stimulus, once perceived, is relayed from the [[sensory cortex]] of the brain through the [[thalamus]] to the [[brain stem]]. That route of signaling increases the rate of noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus, and the person becomes alert and attentive to the environment.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

If a stimulus is perceived as a threat, a more intense and prolonged discharge of the locus ceruleus activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (Thase &amp; Howland, 1995). The activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of [[norepinephrine]] from nerve endings acting on the heart, blood vessels, respiratory centers, and other sites. The ensuing physiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response. The other major player in the acute stress response is the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]]. Stress activates this axis and produces neurobiological changes. These chemical changes increase the chances of survival by bringing the physiological system back to homeostasis. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsigos|first=Constantine|last2=Chrousos|first2=George P|date=October 2002|title=Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, neuroendocrine factors and stress|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00429-4|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=53|issue=4|pages=865–871|doi=10.1016/s0022-3999(02)00429-4|issn=0022-3999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomic nervous system controls all automatic functions in the body and contains two subsections within it that aids in response to an acute stress reaction. These two subunits are the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic response is colloquially known as the "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]" response, indicated by accelerated pulse and respiration rates, pupil dilation, and a general feeling of anxiety and hyper-awareness.  This is caused by the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. The epinephrine and norepinephrine strike the beta receptors of the heart, which feeds the heart sympathetic nerve fibers in order to increase the strength of heart muscle contraction; as a result more blood gets circulated, increasing the heart rate and respiratory rate. The sympathetic nervous system also stimulates the skeletal system and muscular system in an effort to pump more blood to those areas to handle the acute stress. Simultaneously the sympathetic nervous system inhibits the digestive system and the urinary system in order to optimize blood flow to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscles. This plays a role in the alarm reaction stage. The para-sympathetic response is colloquially known as the "rest and digest" response, indicated by reduced heart and respiration rates, and more obviously by a temporary loss of consciousness if the system is fired at a rapid rate. The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates the digestive system and urinary system in order to send more blood to those systems to increase the process of digestion. In order to do this, it must inhibit the cardiovascular system and respiratory system in an effort to optimize blood flow to the digestive tract causing low heart and respiratory rates. Parasympathetic plays no role in acute stress response (VanPutte Regan Russo 2014).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Wilderness and Rescue Medicine |last=Isaac |first=Jeffrey E. |last2=Johnson |first2=David E. |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-7637-8920-6 |location=Burlington, MA |pages=27–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that patients with ASD have overactive right amygdalae and pre-frontal cortices, both structures that are involved in the fear-processing pathway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Diagnosis==
According to the DSM 5, symptom presentation must last for 3 days in order for a diagnosis of ASD to be made. If symptoms persist past 1 month, the diagnosis of PSTD is explored.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5 ed.)|last=American Psychiatric Association|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There must be a clear temporal connection between the impact of an exceptional stressor and the onset of symptoms; onset is usually within a few minutes or days but may occur up to one month after the stressor. In addition, the symptoms show a mixed and usually changing picture; in addition to the initial state of "daze," depression, anxiety, anger, despair, overactivity, and withdrawal may all be seen, but no one type of symptom predominates for long; the symptoms usually resolve rapidly in those cases where removal from the stressful environment is possible; in cases where the stress continues or cannot by its nature be reversed, the symptoms usually begin to diminish after 24–48 hours and are usually minimal after about 3 days.&lt;ref name="Mental-Health-Matters.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mental-health-matters.com/disorders/anxiety-disorders/acute-stress |title=Acute Stress Disorder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726172815/http://www.mental-health-matters.com/disorders/anxiety-disorders/acute-stress |archive-date=2013-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''DSM-5'' specifies there is a higher prevalence rate of ASD in females compared to males due to higher risk of experiencing traumatic events and neurobiological gender differences in stress response that increase the risk of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5 ed.)|last=American Psychiatric Association|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
This disorder may resolve itself with time or may develop into a more severe disorder such as PTSD. However, results of Creamer, O'Donnell, and Pattison's (2004) study of 363 patients suggests that a diagnosis of acute stress disorder had only limited predictive validity for PTSD. Creamer et al. did find that re-experiences of the traumatic event and arousal were better predictors of PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(03)00141-4 |pmid=14975772 |title=The relationship between acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in severely injured trauma survivors |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=315–28 |year=2004 |last1=Creamer |first1=Mark |last2=o'Donnell |first2=Meaghan L |last3=Pattison |first3=Phillipa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early pharmacotherapy may prevent the development of posttraumtic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14573324 |year=2003 |author1=Vaiva |first1=G |title=Immediate treatment with propranolol decreases posttraumatic stress disorder two months after trauma |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=947–9 |last2=Ducrocq |first2=F |last3=Jezequel |first3=K |last4=Averland |first4=B |last5=Lestavel |first5=P |last6=Brunet |first6=A |last7=Marmar |first7=C. R |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(03)00412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, early trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TFCBT) for those with a diagnosis of ASD can protect an individual from chronic PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kornør|first=Hege|last2=Winje|first2=Dagfinn|last3=Ekeberg|first3=Øivind|last4=Weisæth|first4=Lars|last5=Kirkehei|first5=Ingvild|last6=Johansen|first6=Kjell|last7=Steiro|first7=Asbjørn|date=September 2008|title=Early trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy to prevent chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and related symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of counselling and psychotherapy for people with ASD. Cognitive behavioral therapy which included exposure and cognitive restructuring was found to be effective in preventing PTSD in patients diagnosed with ASD with clinically significant results at 6 months follow-up. A combination of relaxation, [[cognitive restructuring]], imaginal exposure, and in vivo exposure was superior to supportive counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lambert |editor1-first=M.J. |year=2004 |title=Bergin and Garfield's Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavioral Change |location=New York |publisher=Wiley }}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mindfulness]] based stress reduction programs also appear to be effective for stress management.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2156587214543143 |pmid=25053754 |title=Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction as a Stress Management Intervention for Healthy Individuals |journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=271–86 |year=2014 |last1=Sharma |first1=Manoj |last2=Rush |first2=Sarah E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wilderness context where counseling, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy is unlikely to be available, the treatment for acute stress reaction is very similar for the treatment of [[cardiogenic shock]], [[Shock (circulatory)|vascular shock]], and [[hypovolemic shock]]; that is, allowing the patient to lie down, providing reassurance, and removing the stimulus for the occurrence of the reaction.  In traditional shock cases, this is generally the relieving of pain from injuries or the stopping of blood loss.  In an acute stress reaction, this may be pulling a rescuer away from the emergency to calm down, or blocking the sight of an injured friend from a patient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== History ==
The term ASR was first used to describe the symptoms of soldiers during [[World War I]] and [[World War II|II]], and it was therefore also termed [[combat stress reaction]] (CSR). Approximately 20% of U.S. troops displayed symptoms of CSR during WWII, and it was assumed to be a temporary response of healthy individuals to witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, withdrawal, confusion, paranoia and sympathetic hyperactivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association|APA]] officially included the term ASD in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' in 1994, and prior to that, symptomatic individuals within the first month of trauma were diagnosed with [[adjustment disorder]]. According to the ''DSM IV'', ASR refers to the symptoms experienced right after exposure to a traumatic event, up until 48 hours after it. In contrast, ASD is defined by symptoms experienced after 48 hours of the event, up until one month past the event. Symptoms experienced for longer than one month are consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Against Equality of Opportunity''''' is a 2002 book by [[Matt Cavanagh]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/against-equality-of-opportunity-by-matt-cavanagh-660575.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Against Equality of Opportunity by Matt Cavanagh - Reviews}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The work is a critique of the doctrine of [[equal opportunity]]. Cavanagh argues against the conventional understanding of equal opportunity, in particular both meritocracy and most substantial interpretations of equality, including the idea of ‘equal life chances’. Instead, he argues for a more limited approach of trying to eliminate specific kinds of discrimination (including race discrimination), together with trying to provide enough opportunities, and help to access them, such that most people have some degree of control over their lives.&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/19930/part_2/more-like-a-beauty-contest.thtml ''Against Equality of Opportunity''] Review in ''The Spectator''  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504134943/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/19930/part_2/more-like-a-beauty-contest.thtml |date=May 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Allegations of racism===
The book caused some controversy when the author was appointed as an adviser to then Labour Minister [[David Blunkett]] when it was revealed that the book argued that it was sometimes rational (in an economic sense) for white employers to discriminate against black applicants&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Suroor, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/03/23/stories/2004032302561700.htm "Asian MPs protest `racist' remarks of Blunkett's adviser"], ''The Hindu'', 22 March 20045&lt;/ref&gt; which in some eyes amounted to effectively condoning racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1457399/Labours-black-and-Asian-members-demand-sacking-of-Blunkett-race-adviser.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Melissa | last1=Kite | first2=Rajeev | last2=Syal | title=Labour's black and Asian members demand sacking of Blunkett race adviser | date=21 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to widespread calls for Cavanagh to be sacked, with questions tabled in Parliament, and the affair rumbled on for a few days. ''The Guardian'''s letters page carried a balance of letters for and against Cavanagh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/mar/22/immigrationpolicy | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Letters: Philosophy and the real world | date=22 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews and academic reaction===
The book received positive reviews in the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''&lt;ref&gt;John Dunn, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=169885&amp;sectioncode=5 "Why we should spurn equality and meritocracy"], ''Times Educational Supplement'', 21 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Spectator]]'',&lt;ref name=Spectator/&gt; and in academic journals including ''[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10|title=The American Economic Review | volume=16 | pages=670–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Notre Dame Philosophical Review'',&lt;ref&gt;Louis Pojman, [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1041 Matt Cavanagh – Against Equal Opportunity – Review], ''Philosophical Reviews'', University of Notre Dame, 1 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Theory and Research in Education]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://tre.sagepub.com/content/2/1/85.extract ] ''Theory and Research in Education'', vol '''2'''(1), (March 2004), pp. 85–96&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Contemporary Political Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knowles | first1 = Dudley | year = 2003 | title = Against Equality of Opportunity review | url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cpt/journal/v2/n1/abs/9300060a.html | journal = Contemporary Political Theory | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 131–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were more mixed, including the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n18/jeremy-waldron/deservingness "Deservingness"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. '''24''', No. 18, 19 September 2002, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; ''Philosophical Books''&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Cruft, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0149.2005.0357a.x/abstract "Against Equality of Opportunity"], ''Philosophical Books'', Volume '''46''', Issue 1, pp. 59–65, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Political Studies Association|Political Studies Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Mason, [http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/PSR/R_1478_9299_1078_1003296.asp Against Equality of Opportunity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927225534/http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/PSR/R_1478_9299_1078_1003296.asp |date=September 27, 2011 }}, ''Political Studies Review'', Volume '''1''', Issue 3, pp. 346–82, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Utilitas]]'', the latter two arguing that the work does not adequately engage other scholarly literature relating to equality of opportunity by authors such as [[Joel Feinberg]] or [[George Sher]].

[[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield]] MP, [[Barry Sheerman]], said that the 15-year-old victim came to his office in late October asking for help: “The young man himself turned up at my office and told me he was being bullied and appealed for my help".&lt;ref name=hugg-Almondbury-assault&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Syrian Boy Who Was Victim Of Alleged Attack Begged MP For Help Against Bullies|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/syrian-boy-who-was-victim-of-alleged-racist-attack-begged-mp-for-help-against-bullies_uk_5bfecb4fe4b0e254c926ca4e|accessdate=29 November 2018|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=29 November 2018| last=Day| first=Aasma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheerman reported the allegations to council leader at Kirklees, and the Head of Children’s Services. 

[[Almondbury]]'s Conservative Councillor, Bernard McGuin, revealed Jamal wrote to authorities in a desperate plea for help three weeks before the filmed attack. In the email entitled “complaint: please help me”, the youngster said he had been subjected to bullying since he joined the school two years ago in year 9 and listed “incidents and allegations” at the school.&lt;ref name=independent-Almondbury-incident&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian refugee attacked at Huddersfield school asks people not to threaten alleged bully|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/syrian-refugee-boy-bully-school-jamal-video-huddersfield-almondbury-community-a8662411.html|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[The Independent]]|date=1 December 2018| last=Drury| first=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Suspect===
A 16-year-old boy has been interviewed by [[West Yorkshire Police ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/news-appeals/update-assault-almondbury-community-school-huddersfield| title=UPDATE: Assault, Almondbury Community School, Huddersfield.| work=[[West Yorkshire Police ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported for summons for an offense of assault. The 16-year-old suspect had shared numerous posts from far-right social media accounts.&lt;ref name=independent-Almondbury-rightwing&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian refugee attack: Family plan to sue Tommy Robinson over allegations against teenage victim|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/syrian-refugee-school-attack-huddersfield-tommy-robinson-family-sue-victim-police-a8659921.html|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[The Independent]]|date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspect’s mother had previously been prosecuted over racist behaviour.&lt;ref name=inews-Almondbury-ofstead/&gt;The mother's case reached court in November 2017, where she ­admitted racially ­aggravated ­threatening behaviour and was fined.&lt;ref name=mirror-Almondbury-mother&gt;{{cite news|title=Mum of 'bully' accused of waterboarding refugee boy is a convicted racist|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-schoolboy-accused-waterboarding-refugee-13672146|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[The Sunday People]]|date=2 December 2018| last=Cardy| first=Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
On 27th Nov 2018, protesters took part in a peaceful demonstration outside the school organised by the'' 'Huddersfield Pakistani Community Alliance'''.&lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-jamal&gt;{{cite news|title=Bullied Syrian refugee says he will not return to Huddersfield school|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/29/bullied-syrian-refugee-huddersfield-school|accessdate=29 November 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 November 2018| last=Parveen| first=Nazia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victim, identified as Jamal, told [[the Guardian]] that he and his sister did not wish to return to school and a solicitor representing the family indicated they were considering moving away from the area.&lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-jamal/&gt; 

Jamal asked people not to attack his alleged bully and was alarmed by the violent threats being made online towards the alleged attacker.&lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-robinson/&gt;

The school is to face an emergency inspection by [[Ofsted]]. Amanda Spielman, Chief Inspector of Schools, said she was “appalled” by the video and had received complaints from people dismayed by the video.&lt;ref name=times-Almondbury-ofstead&gt;{{cite news|title=Almondbury, the school in Jamal bully video, faces Ofsted inspection|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/almondbury-the-school-in-jamal-bully-video-faces-ofsted-inspection-5t0dxznfk|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[The Times]]|date=2 December 2018| last=Griffiths| first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inews-Almondbury-ofstead&gt;{{cite news|title=School attended by Syrian refugee filmed being bullied faces emergency Ofsted inspection|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/syrian-refugee-teenager-attack-almondbury-community-school-attack-ofsted-inspection/|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[iNews]]|date=2 December 2018| last=Alibhai| first=Zaina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False claims===
[[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] incorrectly claimed the Syrian refugee had previously attacked two schoolgirls. &lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-robinson&gt;{{cite news|title='Waterboarded' Syrian refugee's sister attempted suicide after headscarf attack|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/30/syrian-boy-jamal-asks-people-not-to-attack-his-alleged-bully-huddersfield|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 November 2018| last=Parveen| first=Nazia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just hours after spreading the claims during two [[Facebook live]] broadcasts, Robinson admitted to his followers that he had helped spread fake news. Explaining he had been duped: “I have been completely had, how embarrassing man".&lt;ref name=standard-Almondbury-robinson&gt;{{cite news|title=Tommy Robinson admits he shared 'fake news' about Muslims attacking boy at school where Syrian refugee was filmed being bullied|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/tommy-robinson-admits-he-shared-fake-news-about-muslims-attacking-boy-at-school-was-syrian-refugee-a4005301.html|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syrian refugee family’s lawyers, ''Farooq Bajwa &amp; Co'', issued a letter to Robinson stating "We wish to place you on notice that our client intends to pursue legal action against you in respect of these contents of these publications and you will shortly be receiving formal pre-action correspondence in this respect".&lt;ref name=standard-Almondbury-robinson/&gt; [[CNN International]] reported Robinson had deleted the videos and admitted to posting a fake photograph purporting to show violence by a Muslim gang.&lt;ref name=CNN-Almondbury-robinson&gt;{{cite news|title=Far-right activist Tommy Robinson removes videos after legal threat|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/uk/tommy-robinson-syrian-refugee-gbr-intl-scli/index.html|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[CNN International]]|date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the photos used by Robinson as supposed proof of violence at the school was stolen from a 2017 news article on a teenage cancer patient from Surrey.&lt;ref name=independent-Almondbury-rightwing/&gt;

==Other incidents on school playground==
In Nov 2018, a third video emerged which showed an assault of a young girl that was filmed by pupils in what appears to be a pre-arranged fight. It shows youngsters at the school gathered round on the drive by the playing fields encouraging two girls to fight.&lt;ref name=examiner-Almondbury-video&gt;{{cite news|title=Is behaviour at Almondbury Community School out of control?

'''Ars Mathematica''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "[the] Mathematical Art") is a [[Paris]], [[France]]-based, international and [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1992 by Christian Lavigne and Alexandre Vitkine to promote the interconnection between [[art]], [[science]], and [[technology]], with a particular focus on digital [[sculpture]].

Since 1993, the association has organized a biennial exhibition of digital sculpture. "Intersculpt '95," the second show, was jointly sponsored by U.S.-based [[Computer and Sculpture Forum]]. During the expo, a [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] [[videoconference]] between [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and Paris resulted in the creation of a shared sculpture, "the Temple Hands," based on a concept by David Morris, and the first transatlantic telesculpture, sent by Stewart DICKSON via the Internet and materialized in Paris.

Since 1996, many digital sculptures showed during the Intersculpt events are displayed on [[Active Worlds]], in the DAAP zone founded, curated and managed by the Pr. Derrick WOODHAM (professor Emeritus at the [[University of Cincinnati]] ).

A '''clipping path''' (or "deep etch"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=93 |title=How to start and produce a magazine or newsletter |author=Gordon Woolf S|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzSzC0VXU_UC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=deep+etching+photoshop&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iMaoTqXLJcn2mAWr9-mjDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a closed [[vector path]], or shape, used to cut out a [[2D computer graphics|2D image]] in [[image editing]] software. Anything inside the path will be included after the clipping path is applied; anything outside the path will be omitted from the output. Applying the clipping path results in a [[aliasing|hard (aliased) or soft (anti-aliased) edge]], depending on the image editor's capabilities[[File:Clipping Path.jpg|thumb|Clipping path]]

By convention, the inside of the path is defined by its direction. Reversing the direction of a path reverses what is considered inside or outside. An ''inclusive path'' is one where what is visually "inside" the path corresponds to what will be preserved; an ''exclusive path'', of opposite direction, contains what is visually "outside" the path. By convention, a clockwise path that is non-self-intersecting is considered inclusive.

A '''compound path''' results from the combination of multiple paths (inclusive and exclusive) and the Boolean operations that ultimately determine what the combined path contains. For instance, an inclusive path which contains a smaller exclusive path results in a shape with a "hole" (defined by the exclusive path).

One common use of a clipping path is to cull objects that do not need to be rendered because they are outside the user's [[viewport]] or obscured by display elements (such as a [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]]).

==In 3D graphics==
{{main|Clipping (computer graphics)}}
Clipping [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s are used in [[3D computer graphics]] in order to prevent the renderer from calculating surfaces at an extreme distance from the viewer. The plane is perpendicular to the [[camera]], a set distance away (the ''threshold''), and occupies the entire viewport. Used in real-time [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], clipping planes can help preserve processing for objects within clear sight.

The use of clipping planes can result in a detraction from the realism of a scene, as the viewer may notice that everything at the threshold is not rendered correctly or seems to (dis)appear spontaneously. The addition of ''fog''—a variably transparent region of color or texture just before the clipping plane—can help soften the transition between what should be in plain sight and [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], and what should be beyond notice and fully [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], and therefore does not need to be rendered.

==Clipping path service==
Clipping path services are professional offerings provided by companies for extracting objects or people from still imagery, and typically includes other [[Image editing|photo editing]] and [[photo manipulation|manipulation]] services. Addressees of such services are primarily photography and graphic design studios, advertising agencies, web designers, as well as lithographers and printing companies. Clipping path service companies commonly reside in [[developing countries]] such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Philippine]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Nepal]], which can provide their services at comparatively low cost to developed countries, fostering [[outsourcing]] of such activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4988">[[File:RandomPoints.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Up to 10,000 points randomly distributed inside a square with apparent "clumps" or clusters]]
The '''clustering illusion''' is the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable "streaks" or "clusters" arising in small samples from random distributions to be non-random. The illusion is caused by a human tendency to underpredict the amount of [[Statistical dispersion|variability]] likely to appear in a small sample of random or semi-random data.&lt;ref name="gilovich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas|title=How we know what isn't so: The fallibility of human reason in everyday life|year=1991|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-911706-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Thomas Gilovich]], an early author on the subject, argued that the effect occurs for different types of random dispersions, including two-dimensional data such as  clusters in the locations of impact of [[World War II]] [[V-1 flying bomb]]s on maps of London; or seeing patterns in [[stock market]] price fluctuations over time.&lt;ref name="gilovich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kv"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|author2=Amos Tversky|title=Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1972|volume=3|pages=430–454|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Londoners developed specific theories about the pattern of impacts within London, a statistical analysis by R. D. Clarke originally published in 1946 showed that the impacts of [[V-2 rocket]]s on London were a close fit to a random distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=R. D.|title=An application of the Poisson distribution|journal=Journal of the Institute of Actuaries|year=1946|volume=72|page=481|url=https://www.actuaries.org.uk/documents/application-poisson-distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilovich, 1991 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mori|first=Kentaro|title=Seeing patterns|url=http://forgetomori.com/2009/skepticism/seeing-patterns/|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bombing London|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/stat.web/bomb.htm|accessdate=3 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221221013/http://www.dur.ac.uk/stat.web/bomb.htm|archive-date=2012-02-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tierney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|title=See a pattern on Wall Street?|url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/see-a-pattern-here/|publisher=New York Times|work=TierneyLab|accessdate=3 March 2012|format=October 3, 2008|authorlink=John Tierney (journalist)|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clustering illusion is central to the "[[hot hand fallacy]]", the first study of which was reported by Gilovich, Robert Vallone and [[Amos Tversky]]. They found that the idea that [[basketball]] players shoot successfully in "streaks", sometimes referred to by sportcasters as having a "hot hand" and widely believed by Gilovich et al.'s subjects, was false. In the data they collected, if anything the success of a previous throw very slightly predicted a subsequent miss rather than another success.&lt;ref name="grt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |author2=Robert Vallone |author3=Amos Tversky |title=The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences |journal=Cognitive Psychology |year=1985 |volume=17 |pages=295–314 |url=http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113003955/http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar biases==
Using this [[cognitive bias]] in causal reasoning may result in the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]]. More general forms of erroneous pattern recognition are ''[[pareidolia]]'' and ''[[apophenia]]''. Related biases are the ''[[illusion of control]]'' which the clustering illusion could contribute to, and ''[[insensitivity to sample size]]'' in which people don't expect greater variation in smaller samples. A different cognitive bias involving misunderstanding of chance streams is the [[gambler's fallacy]].

==Possible causes==
[[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] explained this kind of misprediction as being caused by the [[representativeness heuristic]]&lt;ref name="kv"/&gt; (which itself they also first proposed).

'''Contempt''', not classified among [[Paul Ekman]]'s six [[Emotion#Basic emotions|basic emotions]] of [[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]], and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], is a mixture of [[disgust]] and [[anger]].&lt;ref&gt;TenHouten, W.D. (2007). ''General Theory of Emotions and Social Life''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} The word originated in 1393, from the [[Latin]] word ''contemptus'' meaning "scorn". It is the [[past participle]] of ''contemnere'' and from ''com''- intensive prefix + ''temnere'' "to slight, scorn". The origin is uncertain. ''Contemptuous'' appeared in 1529.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contempt. (n.d.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=April 20, 2008 | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/contempt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert C. Solomon]] places contempt on the same continuum as [[resentment]] and anger, and he argues that the differences between the three are that [[resentment]] is anger directed toward a higher-status individual; [[anger]] is directed toward an equal-status individual; and contempt is anger directed toward a lower-status individual.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;Solomon R.C. (1993). ''The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life''. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==Cultural context==
[[File:PSM V36 D704 Facial expression of contempt.jpg|thumb|Facial expression of contempt]]
[[Paul Ekman|Ekman]] and [[Friesen]] (1986) identified a specific [[facial expression]] that observers in ten different cultures, both Western and non-Western, agreed signaled contempt. In this study, citizens of West Sumatra, Indonesia, were given photos of American, Japanese, and Indonesian peoples. Their ability to classify some facial expressions as contempt versus the primary emotions of anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, fear, or surprise showed that across cultures, general contempt is universally understood (with level of agreement equating to 75%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P | last2 = Heider | first2 = K.G. | year = 1988 | title = The Universality of Contempt Expression: A Replication | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 303–308 | doi=10.1007/bf00993116}}&lt;/ref&gt; “An expression in which the corner of the lip is tightened and raised slightly on one side of the face (or much more strongly on one side than the other) signaled contempt.” This study showed that contempt, as well as the outward expression of contempt, can be pointed out across Western and Non-Western peoples when contrasted with other primary emotions.

==Characteristics==
[[Paul Ekman]], a widely recognized psychologist, found six emotions that were universally recognized: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Findings on contempt are less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. &amp; Friesen, W. V (1969). The repertoire of nonverbal behavior: Categories, origins, usage, and encoding. Semiotica, 1, 49–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s Ekman proposed an expanded list of emotions, this time including contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekman|last2=Heider|title=The Universality of a Contempt Expression: A Replication|url=https://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Universality-Of-A-Contempt-Expression-A-Replication.pdf|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume= 12| issue =  3|doi=10.1007/bf00993116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining features==
Contempt has five features.&lt;ref name="Bell2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-2001.2005.tb00537.x| title = A Woman's Scorn: Toward a Feminist Defense of Contempt as a Moral Emotion| year = 2005| last1 = Bell | first1 = M. | journal = Hypatia| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contempt requires a judgment concerning the appearance or standing of the object of contempt.  In particular, contempt involves the judgment that, because of some moral or personal failing or defect, the contemned person has compromised his or her standing ''vis-à-vis'' an interpersonal standard that the contemptor treats as important.  This may have not been done deliberately but by a lack of [[social status|status]]. This lack of status may cause the contemptuous to classify the object of contempt as utterly worthless, or as not fully meeting a particular interpersonal standard. Therefore, contempt is a response to a perceived failure to meet an interpersonal standard. Contempt is also a particular way of regarding or attending to the object of contempt, and this form of regard has an unpleasant [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] element. However, contempt may be experienced as a highly visceral emotion similar to disgust, or as cool disregard.
[[File:Contempt facial expression.jpg|thumb|Facial expression showing subtle contempt|alt=]]
Contempt has a certain comparative element. In [[David Hume]]'s studies of contempt, he suggests that contempt essentially requires apprehending the “bad qualities” of someone “as they really are” while simultaneously making a comparison between this person and ourselves. Because of this reflexive element, contempt also involves what we might term a “positive self-feeling” of the contemptuous. A characteristic of contempt is the psychological withdrawal or distance one typically feels regarding the object of one’s contempt. This psychological distancing is an essential way of expressing one’s nonidentification with the object of one’s contempt and it precludes sympathetic identification with the object of contempt. (Hume, 2002, 251) Contempt for a person involves a way of negatively and comparatively regarding or attending to someone who has not fully lived up to an interpersonal standard that the person extending contempt thinks is important.  This form of regard constitutes a psychological withdrawal from the object of contempt.&lt;ref name="Bell2005" /&gt;

==Virtues==
Contempt can be useful to being a functioning member of the moral community. An ethics of contempt provides a much larger breadth of answers than other competing systems of ethics, whether they be based on ethics of actions (judging actions by their rightness or wrongness) or ethics of feelings (e.g., ethics of resentment). By feeling contempt for those things which are found to be unethical, immoral, or morally unsavory, one can both show that they are bad and remove them from the moral community.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M. (2013). ''Hard Feelings: The Moral Psychology of Contempt.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0199794146}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==Response==
[[File:Contempt.jpg|thumb|Facial expression showing obvious contempt]]
The main response of contempt lies within “publicized expression of low regard for the objects held in contempt” (Miller, C.H., 2005). By this reasoning, a person holding contempt would not have the urge to openly confront the person with whom they are at odds, nor would they themselves try to remove the object of contempt; rather, one who holds contempt would have the tendency to hold the view that others should remove the object of contempt, or hold the view that the object of contempt should remove itself. So while one would make their feelings known to others, the person with contempt would not necessarily want to directly deal with the situation at hand. One who is experiencing contempt would exhibit negative affective behaviors that may be labeled as “cold” – this simply meaning that one who is experiencing the emotion of contempt would tend to [[social alienation|alienate]] those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. H. (2035). How dare you! A measure of indignation. Manuscript in preparation, University of Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==Contempt in relationships==
===Gender differences===
Men and women act differently when displaying contempt in same-sex relationships. Not only do girls engage in more non-verbal forms of social aggression than boys do, girls dissembled more than boys do, speaking nicely but making mean faces. In the research provided by Underwood (2004) in their laboratory observation studies where they watch girls and boys in an identical social context in which best friends respond to a provoking newcomer, gender differences emerge not for the verbal behaviours, but for the nonverbal expressions of disdain and contempt (which are so glaring that they were observed with high degrees of inter-coder reliability by both women and men, kappa’s exceeding .8; Underwood et al., 2003).&lt;ref name="Underwood, M. K. 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0959353504044637| title = III. Glares of Contempt, Eye Rolls of Disgust and Turning Away to Exclude:         Non-Verbal Forms of Social Aggression among Girls| year = 2004| last1 = Underwood | first1 = M. K.| journal = Feminism &amp; Psychology| volume = 14| issue = 3| pages = 371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several reasons why girls can be especially prone to conveying anger and contempt by nonverbal forms of social exclusion. One reason may be that girls are socialized from infancy onward to be overtly nice and conciliatory and do so to avoid conflict whenever possible, for fear of being [[social rejection|excluded from relationships]], disliked, or punished (for reviews, see Brown and Gilligan, 1993; Underwood, 2003; Zahn-Waxler, 2000). Non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be a highly effective way to harm someone with relatively few social consequences; the hurtful act is fleeting, can often be executed behind the victim’s back and outside of the watchful eyes of adults, and, even if caught, mean faces are typically not punished. Second, girls may hurt one another via non-verbal expressions of exclusion or disdain because girls and women may gaze at others more for reasons related to their lower social status, so as to learn as much as possible about others’ needs and desires (see LaFrance, 2002, for a discussion of ‘Smile boycotts and other body politics’, p.&amp;nbsp;319). Because girls and women gaze at others often, perhaps mean glares are more effective as a means of wielding power. Third, non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be powerful for girls because their relationships involve high levels of intimacy and self-disclosure (see Buhrmester and Prager, 1995, for a review), thus even subtle indicators of exclusion are threatening. Fourth, non-verbal forms of social exclusion may be powerful for girls because although they fiercely desire and defend popularity with other girls, they dread being labelled as ‘stuck up’ (Merten, 1997).&lt;ref name="Underwood, M. K. 2004"/&gt;

===Legal responses===
In 2003, the [[Palo Alto]] City Council defeated a resolution that would have discouraged elected officials from facial expressions conveying contempt at public meetings; this was proposed because council members were so weary of colleagues intimidating one another by these subtle but rude facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;"City Council Allows Frowning", ''Daily Southtown'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Research demonstrates how [[childhood abuse]] ties into maladaptive [[Interpersonal communication|communication]] dynamics consisting of contempt-laden conflict and [[emotional withdrawal]]. These findings are important because maladaptive marital communication may be one mechanism by which traumatic childhood experiences translate into poor adult relationship quality.

Forms of verbal aggression, such as contempt, belligerence, and defensiveness, are associated with destructive, hostile patterns of conflict resolution ( [Gottman et al., 1998] and [Straus, 1979]). Couples who use such communication styles are more likely to have higher levels of marital distress (Roberts, 2000), lower levels of marital satisfaction (Holman and Jarvis, 2003), and lower levels of marital stability ([Gottman et al., 1998], [Holman and Jarvis, 2003] and [DeMaris, 2000]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.05.003| title = Fiery wives and icy husbands: Pre-marital counseling and covenant marriage as buffers against effects of childhood abuse on gendered marital communication?| year = 2010| last1 = Krivickas | first1 = K.

Gottman (1999) identified several behaviors that are particularly indicative of distress in relationships. One series of behaviors, which he termed the "four horsemen," includes a cascading of responses such as expressing criticism, defensiveness, contempt, [[sarcasm]], [[hostility]], and withdrawal, the combination of which indicate a critical state of marriage dissolution.&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10896-010-9305-9| title = Self-Reported Communication Variables and Dating Violence: Using Gottman's Marital Communication Conceptualization| year = 2010| last1 = Cornelius | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Shorey | first2 = R. C. | last3 = Beebe | first3 = S. M. | journal = Journal of Family Violence| volume = 25| issue = 4| pages = 439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) found that “Negative emotional behavior, such as expressed anger, sadness, contempt, and other negative emotions, appears to be the best discriminator between satisfied and dissatisfied marriages”. Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) also discovered that “In terms of speaker behaviors, wives were coded as showing more total emotion, negative emotion, anger, joy, contempt, whining, and sadness.” This supports the stereotype that women express more emotion than men both in general and in relationships. It also supports the idea that men are less expressive than women and tend to be more defensive minded in conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.10.1.140| title = Emotional behavior in long-term marriage| year = 1995| last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. L. | last2 = Gottman | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Levenson | first3 = R. W. | journal = Psychology and Aging| volume = 10| pages = 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six short self-report measures were used to assess several component communication skills (Gottman 1999). Specifically, the questionnaires assessed Repair Attempts, Accepting Influence, Harsh Start-Up, Flooding, Gridlock, and the Four Horsemen. These six measures were chosen because they were of theoretical and clinical interest to the authors, incorporated both adaptive and maladaptive communication behaviors, and included those aspects of couple communication considered by many to be most toxic, including withdrawal and contempt (Gottman 1999; Gottman et al. 1998; Johnson 2003).&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"/&gt;

Finally, the Four Horsemen create a cascading sequence of responses in which one partner expresses criticism and the other partner responds with defensiveness, causing the first partner to react to the defensiveness with contempt, sarcasm, and/or hostility with their partner, eventually withdrawing from, or stonewalling, the conversation. This cascading negative sequence which occurs as a repetitive, interlocking pattern is believed to signify a critical end-stage process of relationship dissolution, representing a final common causal pathway to relationship dissolution (see Gottman 1994).&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"/&gt;

In the book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, author Malcolm Gladwell discusses John Gottman's theories of how to predict which couples will stay married. Gottman's theory states that there are four major emotional reactions that are destructive to a marriage: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most destructive of them all.&lt;ref name="Gladwell" /&gt;

For all other forms of aggression the Four Horsemen emerged as significant predictors of classification, which is expected given that this construct includes very negative, contemptuous behaviors. This is consistent with marital research, which contends that these communication behaviors are highly toxic, and erode relationship satisfaction (Cornelius et al. 2007; Gottman 1999).&lt;ref name="Cornelius, T. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladwell"&gt;{{cite book

== The protest ==
On Saturday, 22 May 1971 the group met at [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly Station]] in [[Dublin]] and then traveled to Belfast in [[Northern Ireland]] to purchase contraceptives, which were banned in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The IWLM members were divided about who should go to Belfast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">In mathematics, the '''Coxeter complex''', named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], is a geometrical structure (a [[simplicial complex]]) associated to a [[Coxeter group]]. Coxeter complexes are the basic objects that allow the construction of [[building (mathematics)|buildings]]; they form the apartments of a building.

==Construction==
===The canonical linear representation===
The first ingredient in the construction of the Coxeter complex associated to a Coxeter group ''W'' is a certain [[representation (mathematics)|representation]] of ''W'', called the canonical representation of ''W''.

Let &lt;math&gt;(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Coxeter group|Coxeter system]] associated to ''W'', with [[Coxeter group#Coxeter matrix|Coxeter matrix]] &lt;math&gt; M = (m(s,t))_{s,t \in S}&lt;/math&gt;. The canonical representation is given by a vector space ''V'' with basis of formal symbols &lt;math&gt; (e_s)_{s \in S}&lt;/math&gt;, which is equipped with the symmetric bilinear form &lt;math&gt; B(e_s,e_t) = - \cos \left ( \frac{\pi}{m(s,t)} \right )&lt;/math&gt;. The action of ''W'' on this vector space ''V'' is then given by &lt;math&gt; s(v) = v - 2 \frac{B(e_s,v)}{B(e_s,e_s)}e_s&lt;/math&gt;, as motivated by the expression for reflections in [[root system]]s.

This representation has several foundational properties in the theory of Coxeter groups; for instance, the bilinear form ''B'' is positive definite if and only if ''W'' is finite. It is (always) a [[faithful representation]] of ''W''.

===Chambers and the Tits cone===
One can think of this representation as expressing ''W'' as some sort of reflection group, with the caveat that ''B'' might not be positive definite. It becomes important then to distinguish the representation ''V'' from its dual ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. The vectors &lt;math&gt;e_s&lt;/math&gt; lie in ''V'', and have corresponding dual vectors &lt;math&gt;e_s^\vee&lt;/math&gt; in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \langle e_s^\vee, v \rangle = 2 \frac{B(e_s,v)}{B(e_s,e_s)},&lt;/math&gt;

where the angled brackets indicate the natural pairing of a dual vector in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with a vector of ''V'', and ''B'' is the bilinear form as above.

Now ''W'' acts on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and the action satisfies the formula

: &lt;math&gt; s(f) = f - \langle f, e_s \rangle e_s^\vee, &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; s \in S&lt;/math&gt; and any ''f'' in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. This expresses ''s'' as a reflection in the hyperplane &lt;math&gt; H_s = \{ f \in V^*: \langle f, e_s \rangle = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. One has the fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} = \{ f \in V^* : \langle f, e_s \rangle &gt; 0 \ \forall s \in S \}&lt;/math&gt;, this has faces the so-called walls, &lt;math&gt;H_s&lt;/math&gt;. The other chambers can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; by translation: they are the &lt;math&gt; w\mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; w \in W&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the '''Tits cone''' is defined to be &lt;math&gt; X = \bigcup_{w \in W} w \overline{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt;. This need not be the whole of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Of major importance is the fact that the Tits cone ''X'' is convex. The action of ''W'' on the Tits cone ''X'' has [[fundamental domain]] the fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Coxeter complex===
Once one has defined the Tits cone ''X'', the Coxeter complex &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; of ''W'' with respect to ''S'' can be defined as the quotient of ''X'', with the origin removed, by the [[positive reals]] (ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ×):
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(W,S) = (X \setminus \{ 0 \}) / \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
===Finite dihedral groups===
The dihedral groups &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; (of order 2''n'') are Coxeter groups, of corresponding type &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(n)&lt;/math&gt;. These have the presentation &lt;math&gt; \left \langle s, t \, \left | \, s^2, t^2, (st)^n \right \rangle \right . &lt;/math&gt;.

The canonical linear representation of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the usual reflection representation of the dihedral group, as acting on a ''n''-gon in the plane (so &lt;math&gt; V = \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; in this case). For instance, in the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, we get the Coxeter group of type &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(3) = \mathrm{A}_2&lt;/math&gt;, acting on an equilateral triangle in the plane. Each reflection ''s'' has an associated hyperplane ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; in the dual vector space (which can be canonically identified with the vector space itself using the bilinear form ''B'', which is an inner product in this case as remarked above), these are the walls. They cut out chambers, as seen below:

[[File:Spherical dihedral complex.svg | 300px]]

The Coxeter complex is then the corresponding 2''n''-gon, as in the image above. This is a simplicial complex of dimension 1, and it can be colored by cotype.

===The infinite dihedral group===
Another motivating example is the [[infinite dihedral group]] &lt;math&gt; D_{\infty} &lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen as the group of symmetries of the real line that preserves the set of points with integer coordinates; it is generated by the reflections in &lt;math&gt; x= 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = {1 \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;. This group has the Coxeter presentation &lt;math&gt; \left \langle s, t \, \left | \, s^2, t^2 \right \rangle \right . &lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, it is no longer possible to identify ''V'' with the dual space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, as ''B'' is not positive definite. It is then better to work solely with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, which is where the hyperplanes are defined. This then gives the following picture:

[[Image:Affine dihedral complex.svg|300px]]

In this case, the Tits cone is not the whole plane, but only the upper half plane. Quotienting out by the positive reals then yields another copy of the real line, with marked points at the integers. This is the Coxeter complex of the infinite dihedral group.

==Alternative construction of the Coxeter complex==
Another description of the Coxeter complex uses standard cosets of the Coxeter group ''W''. A standard coset is a coset of the form &lt;math&gt; w W_J &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; W_J = \langle J \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for some subset ''J'' of ''S''. For instance, &lt;math&gt; W_S = W &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; W_\emptyset = \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The Coxeter complex &lt;math&gt; \Sigma(W,S) &lt;/math&gt; is then the [[poset]] of standard cosets, ordered by reverse inclusion. This has a canonical structure of a simplicial complex, as do all posets that satisfy:
*Any two elements have a greatest lower bound.
*The poset of elements less than or equal to any given element is isomorphic to the poset of subsets of &lt;math&gt; \{1, 2, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; for some integer&amp;nbsp;''n''.

==Properties==
The Coxeter complex associated to &lt;math&gt;(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; has dimension &lt;math&gt;|S|-1&lt;/math&gt;. It is homeomorphic to a &lt;math&gt;(|S|-1)&lt;/math&gt;-sphere if ''W'' is finite and is [[contractible space|contractible]] if ''W'' is infinite.

'''Dangler''' is a literary term meaning a [[plotline]] that is metaphorically left to "dangle" or "hang".  A ''dangler'', or ''dangling plotline'', is a [[plot device]] in fiction where a plotline is forgotten, phased out and eventually dropped, thus a resolution is never achieved.  Although dangling plotlines can occur in all forms of media, they typically appear in comic books, movies and book sequels, where the original writer or creative team can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;http://dollhousewiki.fox.com/thread/2975709/DOLLHOUSE+Season+1+WRAP-UP%3A+Top+10+Plot+Danglers!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showfaq.asp?fldAuto=18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dexterwiki.sho.com/page/Dexter%3A+Plot+Holes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for danglers ==
Typically, a writer will pepper the main story with smaller back-stories.  It then becomes evident to the reader that these smaller back-stories have the potential to build up into a bigger story and reach a conclusion of some sort.

Editorial mandate can also force a writer to drop a building plotline due to fan backlash or an editor's lack of interest to pursue such a plot.

== Examples of danglers ==
In [[television]], when a creative team fears that their show may not be picked up for another season, they will end the [[season finale]] with a [[cliffhanger]] in order to conjure a fan outcry and interest to continue the series.  When the series is not picked up for another season, the cliffhanger creates a dangling plotline.  Usually the original writer, fan of the series, or the company who produced the series, will look to another form of media to continue the story. ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' was able to resolve some dangling plotlines due to the release of the [[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me|theatrical film]]. ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' got its own comic book series appropriately named ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', which was written by series creator [[Joss Whedon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/14-111/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-Season-8-1&lt;/ref&gt; In an extremely rare occasion, ''[[Futurama]]'' was continued six years later through [[direct-to-DVD]] films, which eventually led to the resurrection of the series in its original television format.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedbumpstudios.com/futurama/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[comic book]]s, it is a common practice for writers to resolve their own dangling plotlines in other comic books within the [[shared universe]].  A good example is [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]], who started a [[Weapon X]] story in [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]], who then later became the writer of his own Weapon X series and as the series ended abruptly, was forced to continue some of his side-stories in a miniseries called ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now''.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;  One lingering plotline left a character in limbo from the ''Weapon X'' series until Frank Tieri took the reins of ''[[New Excalibur]]'',&lt;ref&gt;New Excalibur #8-15&lt;/ref&gt; where he proceeded to close this character's storyline, five years later.  [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Warren Ellis]] are also known for continuing their own stories throughout other books they write for.  In a similar fashion, [[Mark Millar]] has continued the story of an ever-dangling character, [[Clyde Wyncham]], all throughout his runs on ''[[Marvel 1985]]'', ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Old Man Logan]]''.

Because of the unsatisfying nature of having a plotline dangle, fans sometimes take matters into their own hands.  One famous example of this, the numerous directors and writers in the ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' series each had different directions for their story of [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]].  This left many [[plot holes]] and dangling storylines after each movie.  Seemingly unconnected, the movies would end with a cliffhanger and continue with absolutely no mention of the previous movie's occurrences.  To remedy this mess of [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], [[Chaos Comics]] published a comic book series to bridge the gaps between all the movies into one continuous [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

An '''ecodistrict''' or eco-district is a neologism associating the terms "district" and "eco" as an abbreviation of ecological.
It designates an [[Urbanism|urban]] planning aiming to integrate objectives of "[[sustainable development]]" and reduce the [[ecological footprint]] of the project. This notion insists on the consideration of the whole environmental issues by attributing them ambitious levels of requirements.

The '''Edict of Milan''' ({{lang-la|Edictum Mediolanense}}) was the February 313 AD agreement to treat Christians benevolently within the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Frend"&gt;Frend, W. H. C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Western Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], who controlled the Balkans, met in [[Milan]] and, among other things, agreed to change policies towards Christians&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt; following the [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] issued two years earlier in [[Serdica]]. The Edict of Milan gave Christianity a legal status, but did not make Christianity the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]; this took place under Emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 380 AD with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].

The document is found in [[Lactantius]]' ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' and in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s [[Church History (Eusebius)|''History of the Church'']] with marked divergences between the two.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"&gt;Cross and Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' 1974 art. '''Milan, Edict of.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not there was a formal 'Edict of Milan'&amp;thinsp; is debated by some.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"/&gt; It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire he had just conquered by defeating [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]]&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; later in the same year and issued in Nicomedia.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ImperialpalaceMilan.jpg|thumb|300 px|Remains of the Imperial palace of Mediolanum (Milan). The imperial palace (built in large part by [[Maximian]], colleague of [[Diocletian]]) was a large complex with several buildings, gardens, and courtyards, used for the Emperor's private and public activities, and for his court, family, and imperial bureaucracy.]]
Ever since the fall of the [[Severan dynasty]] in 235 AD, rivals for the imperial throne had bid for support by either favouring or [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuting Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Frend, W.H.C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The previous [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] had been recently issued by the emperor [[Galerius]] from [[Serdica]] and was posted at [[Nicomedia]] on 30 April 311. By its provisions, the Christians, who had "followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity", were granted an indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God for our safety, for that of the republic, and for their own, that the commonwealth may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be able to live securely in their homes.}}

Their confiscated property, however, was not restored until 313, when instructions were given for the Christians' meeting places and other properties to be returned and compensation paid by the state to the current owners:&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 5.15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.}}

It directed the provincial magistrates to execute this order at once with all energy so that public order may be restored and the continuance of divine favour may "preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state."

The actual letters have never been retrieved. However, they are quoted at length in [[Lactantius]]' ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors'' (''De mortibus persecutorum''), which gives the Latin text of both Galerius's Edict of Toleration as posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311 and of Licinius's letter of toleration and restitution addressed to the governor of Bithynia and posted at Nicomedia on 13 June 313.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'' 34.1–35.1, 48.1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eusebius]] of Caesarea translated both documents into Greek in his ''History of the Church'' (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''). His version of the letter of Licinius must derive from a copy posted in the province of [[Palaestina Prima]] (probably at its capital, [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]]) in the late summer or early autumn of 313, but the origin of his copy of Galerius's Edict of 311 is unknown since that does not seem to have been promulgated in Caesarea. In his description of the events in Milan in his ''[[Life of Constantine]]'', Eusebius eliminated the role of Licinius, whom he portrayed as the evil foil to his hero Constantine.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Edict was in effect directed against [[Maximinus Daia]], the Caesar in the East who was at that time styling himself as Augustus. Having received the emperor Galerius' instruction to repeal the persecution in 311, Maximinus had instructed his subordinates to desist, but had not released Christians from prisons or virtual death-sentences in the mines, as Constantine and Licinius had both done in the West.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"&gt;Inscription printed in Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Galerius' death, Maximin was no longer constrained; he enthusiastically took up renewed persecutions in the eastern territories under his control, encouraging petitions against Christians. One of those petitions, addressed not only to Maximin but also to Constantine and Licinius, is preserved in a stone inscription at Arycanda in Lycia, and is a "request that the Christians, who have long been disloyal and still persist in the same mischievous intent, should at last be put down and not be suffered by any absurd novelty to offend against the honour due to the gods."&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"/&gt;

The Edict is popularly thought to concern only Christianity, and even to make Christianity the official religion of the Empire (which recognition did not actually occur until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380). Indeed, the Edict expressly grants religious liberty not only to Christians, who had been the object of special persecution, but goes even further and grants liberty to all religions:

{{quote|text=When you see that this has been granted to [Christians] by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship for the sake of the peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity of any religion.|sign="Edict of Milan"|source=Lactantius, ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors (De Mortibus Persecutorum)'', ch. 48. opera, ed. 0. F. Fritzsche, II, p 288 sq. (''Bibl Patr. Ecc. Lat.'' XI).&lt;ref&gt;And similarly in [http://wadsworth.com/history_d/special_features/ilrn_legacy/wawc1c01c/content/wciv1/readings/eusebius.html Eusebius].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since Licinius composed the Edict with the intent of publishing it in the east{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} upon his hoped-for victory over Maximinus, it expresses the religious policy accepted by Licinius, a pagan, rather than that of Constantine{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}, who was already a Christian. Constantine's own policy went beyond merely tolerating Christianity: he tolerated paganism and other religions, but he actively promoted Christianity.

==Religious statement==
Although the Edict of Milan is commonly presented as Constantine’s first great act as a Christian emperor, it is disputed whether the Edict of Milan was an act of genuine faith. The document could be seen as Constantine's first step in creating an alliance with the Christian God, who he considered the strongest deity.&lt;ref&gt;Sordi, Marta. ''The Christians and the Roman Empire.'' Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. p134.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, he was concerned about social stability and the protection of the empire from the wrath of the Christian God: in this view, the Edict could be a pragmatic political decision rather than a religious shift. However, the majority of historians believe that Constantine's conversion to Christianity was genuine, and that the Edict of Milan was merely the first official act of Constantine as a dedicated Christian. This view is supported by Constantine's ongoing favors on behalf of Christianity during the rest of his reign. &lt;ref&gt;Maier, Paul L. ''Eusebius: The Church History''. Grand Rapids: Kegel Publications, 1999. p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Edict of Milan required that the wrong done to the Christians be righted as thoroughly as possible; it claims “it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever.”&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"&gt;"Paul Halsall, “Galerius and Constantine: Edicts of Toleration 311/313,” Fordham University; [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/edict-milan.asp Fordham.edu]; Internet, accessed 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The edict further demanded that individual Romans right any wrongs towards Christians, claiming that “the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.” These provisions indicate that more than just the establishment of justice was intended. After demanding the immediate return of what was lost by the Christians, the edict states that this should be done so that “public order may be secured”, not for the intrinsic value of justice or the glory of God.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt; The exhortation to urgently right wrongs reflects the leaders' desires to avoid unfavorable consequences, which in this case included social unrest and further conquests. Constantine was superstitious and believed enough in the existence of the non-Christian gods to not want to offset the balance of good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yuri Koszarycz |title=Constantinian Christianity |publisher=The Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies |url=http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |website=The-orb.net |access-date=14 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215120014/http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |archivedate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that, the sooner this balance was restored by the Romans establishing a state of justice with the Christians, the sooner the state would become stable.

'''Effects of domestic violence on children,''' result from witnessing [[domestic violence]] in a home where one of their parents are abusing the other parent, plays a tremendous role on the [[Quality of life|well-being]] and [[Child development|developmental growth]] of children witnessing the violence. In 2009 in the [[Philippines]], it was estimated that as many as 7 to 14 million children were exposed to domestic violence&lt;ref name="Eldeson"&gt;Edleson, J. L., Ellerton, A. L., Seagren, A. E., Kirchberg, S. O., &amp; Ambrose, A. T. (2007). Assessing child exposure to adult domestic violence. ''Children and Youth Services Review,'' 29(7), 961-971.&lt;/ref&gt; with about 3.3 million children exposed to domestic violence in their homes every year.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;

Children who witness domestic violence in the home often believe that they are to blame, live in a constant state of fear and are 15 times more likely to be victims of [[child abuse]]. Close observation during an interaction can alert providers to the need for further investigation and intervention, such as&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, W. and Shupe, A. ''The Family Secret.'' Boston, MA. Beacon Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; dysfunctions in the [[#Physical|physical]], [[#Behavioral|behavioral]], [[#Emotional|emotional]], and [[#Social|social]] areas of life, and can aid in early intervention and assistance for child victims.

==Symptoms children may have while witnessing==

==={{visible anchor|Physical symptoms|Physical}}===
In general, children who witness domestic violence in the home can suffer an immense amount of physical symptoms along with their emotional and behavioral state of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]]. These children may complain of general aches and pain, such as [[headache]]s and [[stomach ache]]s. They may also have irritable and irregular bowel habits, [[cold sore]]s, and they may have problems with [[bed-wetting]]. These complaints have been associated with depressive disorders in children, a common emotional effect of domestic violence. Along with these general complaints of not feeling well, children who witness domestic violence may also appear nervous, as previously mentioned, and have short [[attention span]]s. These children display some of the same symptoms as children who have been diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. On the reverse, these children may show symptoms of [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and constant tiredness. They may fall asleep in school due to the lack of sleep at home. Much of their night may be spent listening to or witnessing violence within the home. Children of domestic violence victims are often frequently ill, and may suffer from poor [[personal hygiene]]. Children who witness domestic violence also have a tendency to partake in high risk play activities, self-abuse, and [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=acadv&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/children.html ''The Effects of Domestic Violence on Children.''] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021103134717/http://www.acadv.org/children.html |date=2002-11-03 }} Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prenatal====
The physical effects of domestic violence on children, different than the effects of direct abuse, can start when they are [[fetus]] in their mother's womb, can result in low infant [[birth weight]]s, [[premature birth]], excessive [[bleeding]], and [[fetal death]], due to the mother's [[trauma (medicine)|physical trauma]] and [[emotional stress]]. Increased maternal stress during the times of abuse, especially when combined with [[smoking]] and [[drug abuse]], can also lead to premature deliveries and low weight babies.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, G. (2005). Domestic violence and children: effects of domestic violence on children. ''Journal of Pediatric Health Care,'' 19(4):206-212.&lt;/ref&gt; When a woman is stressed while pregnant, the baby can be born with stress and anxiety and can sometimes have problems with growth.

====Infants====
Infant children who are present in the home where domestic violence occurs often fall victim to being "caught in the crossfire." They may suffer physical injuries from unintentional trauma as their parent is suffering from abuse. Infants may be inconsolable and irritable, have a lack of responsiveness secondary to lacking the emotional and physical attachment to their mother, suffer from [[developmental delay]]s, and have excessive [[diarrhea]] from both trauma and stress.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Infants are most affected by the environment of abuse because the child's brain hasn't fully developed.

====Older children====
Physical effects of witnessing domestic violence in older children are less evident than behavioral and emotional effects. The trauma that children experience when they witness domestic violence in the home, plays a major role in their [[child development|development]] and physical [[Quality of life|well being]]. Older children can sometimes turn the stress towards behavioral problems. Sometimes children who see the abuse turn to drugs, hoping to take the pain away. The children, however, will exhibit physical [[symptom]]s associated with their behavioral or emotional problems, such as being withdrawn from those around them, becoming non-verbal, and exhibiting regressed behaviors such as being clingy and whiney. [[Anxiety]] often accompanies a physical symptom in children who witness domestic violence in the home. If their anxiety progresses to more physical symptoms, they may show signs of tiredness from lack of sleep and weight and [[nutrition]]al changes from poor eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Volpe, J. (1996). Effects of Domestic Violence on Children and Adolescents: An Overview. American Academy of Experts in Trauma Stress, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assessment====
Children who witness domestic violence in the home should be assessed for the physical effects and physical injuries. Some physical findings may be difficult to evaluate, like changes in their eating habits, sleep patterns, or bowel patterns should be further examined or questioned by someone whom they trust.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Behavioral symptoms===
Children exposed to domestic violence are likely to develop [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] problems, such as [[Regression (psychology)|regressing]], exhibiting out of control behavior,&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt; and imitating behaviors. Children may think that [[violence]] is an acceptable behavior of intimate relationships and become either the abused or the abuser. Some warning signs are bed-wetting, [[nightmare]]s, distrust of adults, acting tough, having problems becoming attached to other people and isolating themselves from their close friends and family. Another behavioral response to domestic violence may be that the child may lie in order to avoid [[social conflict|confrontation]] and excessive attention-getting.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In addition, to the behavioral symptoms of children, a source that supports this article is about a study that has been done by Albert Bandura (1977). The study that was presented was about introducing children to a role model that is aggressive, non-aggressive and a control group that showed no role model. This study is called, "The Bobo Doll Experiment", the experiment has influenced the children to act similar to their role model towards the doll itself. The children who were exposed to violence acted with aggression, the children who were exposed to a non-aggressive environment were quite friendly. As a result, children can be highly influenced by what is going on in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/bobo-doll.html|title=Bobo Doll Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescents are in jeopardy of academic failure, school drop-out, and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=cpfm&gt;[http://www.custodyprepformoms.org/haca.htm ''How are children affected by domestic violence?''] Custody Preparation for Moms. 2002 - 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their behavior is often guarded and secretive about their family members and they may become embarrassed about their home situation. Adolescents generally don't like to invite friends over and they spend their free time away from home. [[Denial]] and [[aggression]] are their major forms of problem-solving. Teens cope with domestic violence by blaming others, encountering violence in a relationship, or by running away from home.&lt;ref name=cpfm/&gt;

====Teen dating violence====
An estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violent situations experience [[teen dating violence]], regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually and/or physically. 30 to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;[http://www.sassnh.org/ ''Sexual Assault Survivor Services''] (SASS) Facts about domestic violence. (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical symptoms===
Physical symptoms are a major effect on children due to parental domestic violence. In a study, 52% of 59 children yelled from another room, 53% of 60 children yelled from the same room, a handful actually called someone for help and some just became significantly involved themselves during the abusive occurrence. When the unfortunate violent situation is at its peak and a child tries to intervene, logically we would have thought that in order to save their child from harm, parents would control themselves, however, statistics show otherwise. It is said that about 50% of the abusers also end up abusing their children. Another alarming statistic is that 25% of the victims of the abusive relationship also tend to get violent with their children. The violence imposed on these children can in some cases be life-threatening. If a mother is pregnant during the abuse, the unborn child is at risk of lifelong impairments or at risk of life itself. Researchers have studied, amongst perinatal and neonatal statistics, mothers who experience domestic violence had more than double the risk of child mortality.

===Emotional symptoms===
Children exposed to violence in their home often have conflicting feelings towards their parents; For instance, [[distrust]] and [[affection]] often coexist for the abuser. The child becomes overprotective of the victim and feels sorry for them.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"&gt;Baker, L.L., Jaffe, P.G., Ashbourne, L. (2002). [http://www.lfcc.on.ca/ece-us.PDF ''Children Exposed to Domestic Violence.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

They often develop anxiety, fearing that they may be injured or abandoned, that the child's parent being abused will be injured, or that they are to blame for the violence that is occurring in their homes.&lt;ref name=Edleson1999&gt;Edleson, J.L., (1999) [http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=392 ''Problems Associated with Children's Witnessing of Domestic Violence.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grief]], [[shame]], and low [[self esteem]] are common emotions that children exposed to domestic violence experience.&lt;ref name=Edleson1999/&gt;

====Depression====
[[Depression (clinical)|Depression]] is a common problem for children who experience domestic violence. The child often feels helpless and powerless. More girls internalize their emotions and show signs of depression than boys. Boys are more apt to act out with aggression and hostility.&lt;ref name=Edleson1999/&gt; Witnessing violence in the home can give the child the idea that nothing is safe in the world and that they are not worth being kept safe which contributes to their feelings of low self-worth and depression.

====Anger====
Some children act out through [[anger]] and are more aggressive than other children. Even in situations that do not call for it, children will respond with anger.&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, L. (2009). [http://www.livestrong.com/article/18332-emotional-effects-domestic-violence-children/ ''Emotional Effects of Domestic Violence on Children.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Children and young people particularly highlighted angry feelings as a consequence of experiencing domestive violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Nicky|last2=Miller|first2=Pam|last3=Richardson Foster|first3=Helen|date=2012-05-01|title=Engaging with children's and parents' perspectives on domestic violence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2206.2012.00832.x/abstract|journal=Child &amp; Family Social Work|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=192–201|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2206.2012.00832.x|issn=1365-2206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical aggression can also manifest towards the victim from the children as the woman does not have the ability to develop authority and control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Stephanie|last2=Buckley|first2=Helen|last3=Whelan|first3=Sadhbh|date=2008-08-01|title=The impact of exposure to domestic violence on children and young people: a review of the literature|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=32|issue=8|pages=797–810|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.02.004|issn=0145-2134|pmid=18752848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post traumatic stress disorder====
[[Post traumatic stress disorder]] can result in children from exposure to domestic violence. Symptoms of this are nightmares, [[insomnia]], anxiety, increased alertness to the environment, having problems concentrating, and can lead to physical symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aardvarc.org/dv/effects.shtml ''An Abuse, Rape and Domestic Violence Aid and Resource Collection.''] (2008). Long-Term Effects of Domestic Violence.&lt;/ref&gt; If the child experiences chronic early maltreatment within the caregiving relationship, then [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] can result.

====Role reversal====
There is sometimes role reversal between the child and the parent and the responsibilities of the victim who is emotionally and psychologically dysfunctional are transferred to the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parentification.ua.edu ''The Empirical Study of Parentification.'' Parentification Research.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, the parents treat their child as a therapist or confidant, and not as their child. They are forced to mature faster than the average child. They take on household responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for younger children.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, C.J. (2001). [http://www.findcounseling.com/journal/domestic-violence/domestic-violence-children.html ''Effects of Domestic Violence on Children and Teenagers.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibilities that they take on are beyond normally assigned chores and are not age appropriate. The child becomes socially isolated and is not able to participate in activities that are normal for a child their age. The parentified child is at risk for becoming involved in rocky relationships because they have been isolated and are not experienced at forming successful relationships. Also, they tend to become perfectionists because they are forced to live up to such high expectations for their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. (2010). [http://charactertherapist.blogspot.com/2010/06/t3-parentification.html ''Parentification.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social symptoms===
Children exposed to domestic violence frequently do not have the foundation of safety and security that is normally provided by the family. The children experience a [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] to aggressive behavior, poor anger management, [[Learned helplessness|poor problem solving skills]], and learn to engage in exploitative relationships.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;

* Symptoms include isolation from friends and relatives in an effort to stay close to siblings and victimized parent.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;
* The adolescent may display these symptoms by joining a gang or becoming involved in dating relationships that mimic the learned behavior.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;

Children exposed to domestic violence require a safe nurturing environment and the space and respect to progress at their own pace. The caretaker should provide reassurance and an increased sense of security by providing explanations and comfort for the things that worry the children, like loud noises.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt; The children should develop and maintain positive contact with significant others such as distant family members.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt; All family members are encouraged to become involved in community organizations designed to assist families in domestic violence situations.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Effects on infants and toddlers==
[[File:Toddler in fright - nz 0457.jpg|thumb|200px|Frightened toddler]]
Children exposed to domestic violence at [[infancy]] often experience an inability to bond and form secure attachments, often resulting in intensified startle reactions and an inhibited sense of exploration and play.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt;

Children may portray a wide range of reactions to the exposure of domestic violence in their home. The [[preschool]] and [[kindergarten]] child does not understand the meaning of the abuse and may believe they did something wrong, this self-blame may cause the child feelings of guilt, [[worry]], and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Bermann, S. (1994). ''Preventing domestic violence.'' University of Michigan research information index.&lt;/ref&gt; Younger children do not have the ability to express their feelings verbally and these emotions can cause behavioral problems. They may become withdrawn, non-verbal, and have regressed behaviors such as clinging and whining. Other common behaviors for a child being a victim of domestic violence are eating and sleeping difficulty, and [[concentration]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children.  In CH Zeanah (Ed.).  Handbook of Infant Mental Health—3rd Edition.  New York: Guilford Press, Inc.  pp. 197-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preschoolers]] living with violence internalize the learned gender roles associated with [[victimization]], for instance seeing males as perpetrators and females as victims.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt; This symptom presents itself as the preschooler imitating learned behaviors of intimidation and abuse. The preschooler may present with aggressive behavior, lashing out, defensive behavior, or extreme separation anxiety from the primary caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH (2011).  The relationship of violent fathers, post-traumatically stressed mothers and symptomatic children in a preschool-age inner-city pediatrics clinic sample.  Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26(18), 3699-3719.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics show that a child who witnesses violence between their parents or guardian is more likely to carry on violent behaviors in their own adult lives. "Even when child witnesses do not suffer physical injury, the emotional consequences of viewing or hearing violent acts are severe and long-lasting. In fact, children who witness violence often experience many of the same symptoms and lasting effects as children who are victims of violence themselves, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)". Also in the article Breaking the Cycle of Violence "it is clearly in the best interest of the child and criminal justice system to handle child victims and witnesses in the most effective and sensitive manner possible. A number of studies have found the following: reducing the number of interviews of children can minimize psychological harm to child victims (Tedesco &amp; Schnell, 1987); testifying is not necessarily harmful to children if adequate preparation is conducted (Goodman et al., 1992; Oates et al., 1995; Whitcomb, Goodman, Runyon, and Hoak, 1994); and, having a trusted person help the child prepare for court and be with the child when he or she testified reduced the anxiety of the child (Henry, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Office of Victims of Crime, OVC Monograph. Breaking the Cycle of Violence Recommendations to Improve the Criminal Justice Response to Child Victims and Witnesses. Retrieved, from http://www.ovc.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual exposure===
It is important to note that children exposed to domestic violence are more at risk for other forms of maltreatment such as physical abuse and neglect. Research suggests that parents who are violent with one another are at higher risk for physically abusing their children.&lt;ref name=Dong&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dong |first1=M |author2=Anda, R.F. |author3=Felitti, V.J. |author4=Dube, S.R. |author5=Williamson, D.F. |author6=Thompson, T.J. |author7=Loo, C.M. |author8=Giles, W.H. |title=The Interrelatedness of Multiple Forms of Childhood Abuse, Neglect, and Household Dysfunction |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |date=January 2004 |volume=28 |issue=7 |url=http://www.thecapcenter.org/admin/upload/ACEs%20Inter-Relatedness%20Article%202004.pdf |pages=771–84 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.01.008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206234513/http://www.thecapcenter.org/admin/upload/ACEs%20Inter-Relatedness%20Article%202004.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has proposed that the consequences of child abuse and domestic violence exposure are often similar and mimic one another. Children who are abused and exposed to domestic violence exhibit emotional, psychological, and behavioral consequences that are almost identical to one another. In fact, some researchers refers to this dual exposure as the "double whammy" effect because children are receive double exposure to traumatic events and thus react twofold to the abuse and exposure to domestic violence. Emotionally children who experience the "double whammy" effect can exhibit fear, guilt, isolation, and low self-esteem. Additional psychological outcomes for these children include depression, anxiety, and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=Herrenkohl&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Herrenkohl, T. I. |author2=Sousa, C. |author3=Tajima, E. A. |author4=Herrenkohl, R. C. |author5=Moylan, C. A. |title=Intersection of Child Abuse and Children's Exposure to Domestic Violence |journal=Trauma Violence and Abuse |date=January 2008 |volume=2 |pages=84–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who experience dual exposure to both physical abuse and domestic violence possess more behavioral problems than those who experience only one or the other.&lt;ref name=Sousa&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sousa, C.|author2=Herrenkohl, T. I.|author3=Moylan, C. A.|author4=Tajima, E. A.|author5=Klika, J. B.|author6=Herrenkohl, R. C.|author7=Russo, M. J.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Longitudinal study on the effects of child abuse and children's exposure to domestic violence, parent-child attachments, and antisocial behavior in adolescence|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |date=January 2011 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=111–136 |url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/26/1/111.short |doi=10.1177/0886260510362883|pmc=2921555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term effects of dual exposure in young children can have very negative outcomes later in life. These outcomes have been documented as leading to behavioral problems that include school dropout, violence, teen pregnancy, substance abuse, eating disorders, and even suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="Herrenkohl"/&gt; A study following children from preschool through adolescence found that young children exposed to domestic violence and child abuse were more likely to experience anti-social behaviors in their adolescence. Young children exposed to both domestic violence and child abuse were also more likely to commit an assault and participate in delinquent behavior in their adolescence than those not exposed at all.&lt;ref name="Sousa"/&gt; Lastly, the [[Adverse Childhood Experiences (study)|Adverse Childhood Experiences study]] (ACE) found a connection between multiple categories of childhood trauma (e.g., child abuse, household dysfunction including domestic violence, and child neglect) and health/behavioral outcomes later in life. The more traumas a child was exposed to, the greater risk for disabilities, social problems and adverse health outcomes. More recently, researchers have used elements of this model to continue analysis into different aspects of trauma and stressful experiences and later development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dube, S. R. |author2=Felitti, V. J. |author3=Dong, M. |author4=Giles, W. H. |author5=Anda, R.

==Ways to help==
Early intervention is one of the best ways to counteract the effects of witnessing abuse. Ways to help children who have witnessed domestic abuse include:{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* Arrange school age children to receive counseling from professionals at their school, often school counselors.
* Experiment with various types of counseling: play therapy, peer support groups, anger management classes and safety programs to teach kids how to extract themselves from dangerous situations.
* Help children find a loving and supportive adult to introduce to the child and encourage the child to spend as much time regularly with the adult. This may include a trusted family member or community advocate. [[Family Violence Defense Fund]] reports that the single most important ingredient to help children heal and develop resiliency is the presence of a loving adult.
* Provide a safe environment that does not include violence in any form after a child has witnessed domestic violence.
* Find ways to discipline that do not involve hitting, name-calling, yelling, or any form of verbally aggressive behavior.
* Help children create a sense of safety by having scheduled routines, such as regular meals and homework times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">An '''entitative graph''' is an element of the [[diagram]]matic [[syntax]]  for [[logic]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed under the name of '''qualitative logic''' beginning in the 1880s, taking the coverage of the [[formal system|formalism]] only as far as the [[propositional calculus|propositional or sentential]] aspects of logic are concerned.  See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''.

The [[syntax]] is:
*The blank page;
*Single letters, phrases;
*Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty.

The [[semantics]] are:
*The blank page denotes '''False''';
*Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be '''True''' or '''False''';
*To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes '''Truth''';
*All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]].

A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

Peirce soon abandoned the entitative graphs for the [[existential graph]]s, whose sentential (''alpha'') part is [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the entitative graphs. He developed the existential graphs until they became another formalism for what are now termed [[first-order logic]] and [[normal modal logic]].

The [[Laws of form|primary algebra]] of [[G. Spencer-Brown]] is isomorphic to the entitative graphs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29373">[[Fair division]] has mostly been researched theoretically. But in addition to theory, various experiments have been made for checking various fair division procedures.

== Case studies ==

=== Allocating indivisible heirlooms ===
1. Flood&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flood|first=Merrill M.|date=1958-10-01|title=Some Experimental Games|url=https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.5.1.5|journal=Management Science|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5–26|doi=10.1287/mnsc.5.1.5|issn=0025-1909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|case 4}} describes a division of a gift containing 5 parcels: whiskey, prunes, eggs, suitcase, etc. The division was done using the Steinhaus-Banach-Knaster procedure. The resulting division was fair, but in retrospect it was found that coalitions could gain from manipulation.

2. When Mary Anna Lee Paine Winsor died at the age of 93, her estate included two trunks of silver, that had to be divided among her 8 grandchildren. It was divided using a decentralized, fair and efficient allocation procedure, which combined [[market equilibrium]] and a [[Vickrey auction]]. Although most participants did not fully understand the algorithm or the preference information desired, it handled the major considerations well and was regarded as equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pratt|first=John Winsor|last2=Zeckhauser|first2=Richard Jay|date=1990|title=The Fair and Efficient Division of the Winsor Family Silver|url=https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.36.11.1293|journal=Management Science|language=en|volume=36|issue=11|pages=1293–1301|doi=10.1287/mnsc.36.11.1293|issn=0025-1909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allocating unused classrooms ===
In California, the law says that public school classrooms should be shared fairly among all public school pupils, including those in charter schools. Schools have [[dichotomous preferences]]: each school demands a certain number of classes, it is happy if it got all of them and unhappy otherwise. A new algorithm, devloped by &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurokawa|first=David|last2=Procaccia|first2=Ariel D.|last3=Shah|first3=Nisarg|date=2015-06-15|title=Leximin Allocations in the Real World|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2764468.2764490|publisher=ACM|pages=345–362|doi=10.1145/2764468.2764490|isbn=9781450334105}}&lt;/ref&gt;, allocates classrooms to schools using a non-trivial implementation of the ''randomized leximin mechanism.''  Unfortunately it was not deployed in practice, but it was tested using computer simulations based on real school data. While the problem is computationally-hard, simulations show that the implementation scales gracefully in terms of running time: even when there are 300 charter schools, it terminates in a few minutes on average. Moreover, while theoretically the algorithm guarantees only 1/4 of the maximum number of allocated classrooms, in the simulations it satisfies on average at least 98% of the maximum number of charter schools that can possibly be satisfied, and allocates on average at least 98% of the maximum number of classrooms that can possibly be allocated. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The partial collaboration with the school district lead to several practical desiderata in deploying fair division solutions in practice. First, the simplicity of the mechanism, and the intuitiveness of the properties of proportionality, envy-freeness, Pareto optimality, and strategyproofness, have made the approach more likely to be adopted. On the other hand, the use of randomization, though absolutely necessary in order to guarantee fairness in allocating indivisible goods such as classrooms, has been a somewhat harder sell: the term "lottery" raised negative connotations and legal objections.

=== Resolving international conflicts ===
The [[adjusted winner procedure]] is a protocol for simultaneously resolving several issues under conflict, such that the agreement is envy-free, equitable, and Pareto efficient. It has been commercialized through the [http://www.fairoutcomes.com FairOutcomes] website. While there are no account of it actually being used to resolve disputes, there are several counterfactual studies checking what would have been the results of using this procedure to solve international disputes: 

* For the [[Camp David Accords]], the authors construct approximate numeric valuation functions for Israel and Egypt, based on the relative importance of each issue for each country. They then run the AW protocol. The theoretical results are very similar to the actual agreement, which leads the authors to conclude that the agreement is as fair as it could be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brams|first=Steven J.|last2=Togman|first2=Jeffrey M.|date=1996|title=Camp David: Was The Agreement Fair?|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/073889429601500105|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=99–112|doi=10.1177/073889429601500105|issn=0738-8942|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* For the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], the author constructs the valuation functions based on a survey of expert opinions, and describes the agreement that would result from running the AW protocol with these valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massoud|first=Tansa George|date=2000-06-01|title=Fair Division, Adjusted Winner Procedure (AW), and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002700044003003|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=333–358|doi=10.1177/0022002700044003003|issn=0022-0027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*For the [[Spratly Islands dispute]], the authors construct a two-phase procedure for settling the dispute, and present its (hypothetic) outcome. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denoon|first=D. B. H.|last2=Brams|first2=S. J.|date=1997-02-01|title=Fair Division: A New Approach to the Spratly Islands Controversy|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718069720847997|journal=International Negotiation|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=303–329|doi=10.1163/15718069720847997|issn=1571-8069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allocating rooms and rent ===
[[Rental harmony]] is the problem of simultaneously allocating rooms in an apartment and the rent of the apartment among the housemates. It has several solutions. Some of these solutions were implemented in the [http://spliddit.org Spliddit.org] website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Jonathan|last2=Procaccia|first2=Ariel D.|date=2015-01-28|title=Spliddit: unleashing fair division algorithms|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2728732.2728738|journal=ACM SIGecom Exchanges|volume=13|issue=2|pages=41–46|doi=10.1145/2728732.2728738}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tested on real users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gal|first=Ya'akov (Kobi)|last2=Mash|first2=Moshe|last3=Procaccia|first3=Ariel D.|last4=Zick|first4=Yair|date=2016-07-21|title=Which Is the Fairest (Rent Division) of Them All?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2940716.2940724|publisher=ACM|pages=67–84|doi=10.1145/2940716.2940724|isbn=9781450339360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sharing cooperation surplus ===
When different agents cooperate, there is an economic surplus in welfare. [[Cooperative game theory]] studies the question of how this surplus should be allocated, taking into account the various coalitional options of the players. Several cases of such cooperation has been studied, in light of concepts such as the [[Shapley value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tijs|first=Stef H.|last2=Branzei|first2=Rodica|date=2004|title=Cases in Cooperation and Cutting the Cake|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=627424|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.627424|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair Bargaining ===
Flood&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; analyzed several cases of bargaining between a buyer and a seller on the price of purchasing a good (e.g. a car). He found that the "split-the-difference" principle was acceptable by both participants. The same cooperative principle was found in more abstract non-cooperative games. However, in some cases, bidders in an auction did not find a cooperative sollution.

== Computerized simulations ==

=== [[Fair cake-cutting]] ===
Walsh&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Walsh|first=Toby|title=Online Cake Cutting|date=2011|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24873-3_22|work=Algorithmic Decision Theory|pages=292–305|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24873-3_22|isbn=9783642248726|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed several algorithms for online [[fair cake-cutting]]. He tested them using a computerized simulation: valuation functions for each agent were generated by dividing the cake into random segments, and assigning a random value to each segment, normalizing the total value of the cake. The [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian welfare]] and the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian welfare]] of various algorithms were compared.

=== Welfare redistribution mechanism ===
Cavallo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cavallo|first=Ruggiero|date=2012-07-22|title=Fairness and welfare through redistribution when utility is transferable|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2900728.2900913|journal=Proceedings of AAAI 2012|publisher=AAAI Press|volume=|pages=1306–1312|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an improvemeot of the [[Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism]] in which money is redistributed in order to increase social welfare. He tested his mechanism using simulations. He generated piecewise-constant valuation functions, whose constants were selected at random from the uniform distribution. He also tried Gaussian distributions and got similar results.

=== [[Fair item assignment]] ===
It is known that, when items are indivisible, fair allocations might not exist. However, this is a worst-case scenario; in realistic settings, fair allocations often do exist. Computerized simulations show that, when the number of goods is larger than the number of agents by a logarithmic factor, fair allocations often exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickerson|first=John P.|last2=Goldman|first2=Jonathan|last3=Karp|first3=Jeremy|last4=Procaccia|first4=Ariel D.|last5=Sandholm|first5=Tuomas|date=2014-07-27|title=The computational rise and fall of fairness|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2893873.2894091|journal=Proceedings of AAAI 2014|publisher=AAAI Press|volume=|pages=1405–1411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, computerized simulations show that, in many cases, there exist allocations that are  ''necessarily fair'' based on a certain convexity assumption on the agents' preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segal-Halevi|first=Erel|last2=Aziz|first2=Haris|last3=Hassidim|first3=Avinatan|date=2017-08-19|title=Fair allocation based on diminishing differences|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3171642.3171820|journal=Proceedings of IJCAI 2017|publisher=AAAI Press|volume=|pages=1254–1261|isbn=9780999241103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory experiments ==
Several experiments were conducted with people, in order to find out what is the relative importance of several desiderata in choosing an allocation.

=== Fairness vs. efficiency - what outcome is better? ===
Sometimes, there are only two possible allocations: one is fair (e.g. [[envy-free division]]) but inefficient, while the other is efficient (e.g. [[Pareto-optimal]]) but unfair. Which division do people prefer? This was tested in several lab experiments. 

1. Subjects were given several possible allocations of money, and were asked which allocation they prefer. One experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engelmann|first=Dirk|last2=Strobel|first2=Martin|date=2004-08-01|title=Inequality Aversion, Efficiency, and Maximin Preferences in Simple Distribution Experiments|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002741|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=94|issue=4|pages=857–869|doi=10.1257/0002828042002741|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the most important factors were Pareto-efficiency and Rawlsian motive for helping the poor (maximin principle). However, a later experiment found that these conclusions only hold for students of economics and business, who train to acknowledge the importance of efficiency. In the general population, the most important factors are selfishness and [[inequality aversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fehr|first=Ernst|last2=Naef|first2=Michael|last3=Schmidt|first3=Klaus M|date=2006-11-01|title=Inequality Aversion, Efficiency, and Maximin Preferences in Simple Distribution Experiments: Comment|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.96.5.1912|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=96|issue=5|pages=1912–1917|doi=10.1257/aer.96.5.1912|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

2. Subjects were asked to answer questionnaires regarding the division of indivisible items between two people. The subjects were shown the subjective value that each (virtual) person attaches to each item. The predominant aspect considered was equity - satisfying each individual's preferences. The efficiency aspect was secondary. This effect was slightly more pronounced in economics students, and less pronounced in law students (who chose a Pareto-efficient allocation more frequently).&lt;ref name="hp1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Herreiner, Dorothea|author2=Puppe, Clemens|title=Distributing Indivisible Goods Fairly: Evidence from a Questionnaire Study|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/econ_fac/3/|journal=Loyola Marimount University - Economics Faculty Works}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

3. Subjects were divided into pairs and asked to negotiate and decide how to divide a set of 4 items between them. Each combination of items had a pre-specified monetary value, which was ''different'' between the two subjects. Each subject knew both his own values and the partner's values. After the division, each subject could redeem the items for their monetary value.     The items could be divided in several ways: some divisions were [[Equitable division|equitable]] (e.g., giving each partner a value of 45), while other divisions were Pareto efficient (e.g., giving one partner 46 and another partner 75). The interesting question was whether people prefer the equitable or the efficient division. The results showed that people preferred the more efficient division only if it was not "too unfair". A difference of 2-3 value units was considered sufficiently small for most subjects, so they preferred the efficient allocation. But a difference of 20-30 units (such as in the 45:45 vs. 46:75 example) was perceived as too large: 51% preferred the 45:45 division.    The effect were less pronounced when the subjects were only shown the ''rank'' of the item combinations for each of them, rather than the full monetary value.    This experiment also revealed a recurring process which was used during the negotiation: subjects first find the most equitable division of the goods. They take it as a reference point and try to find Pareto improvements. An improvement is implemented only if the inequality it causes is not too large. This process is called CPIES: Conditioned Pareto Improvement from Equal Split.&lt;ref name="hp10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herreiner|first1=Dorothea K.|last2=Puppe|first2=Clemens|date=November 2010|title=Inequality aversion and efficiency with ordinal and cardinal social preferences—An experimental study|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=76|issue=2|pages=238–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2010.06.002|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intra-personal vs. inter-personal fairness - which is more important? ===
What is the importance of ''intra-personal'' fairness criteria (such as [[envy-freeness]], where each person compares bundles based only on his own utility-function), vs. ''inter-personal'' fairness criteria (such as [[Equitable division|equitability]], where each person views the utilities of all other agents)? Using a free-form bargaining experiment, it was found that inter-personal fairness (e.g. equitability) is more important. Intra-personal fairness (such as envy-freeness) are relevant only as a secondary criterion.&lt;ref name="hp09"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herreiner|first1=Dorothea K.|last2=Puppe|first2=Clemens D.|year=2007|title=Envy Freeness in Experimental Fair Division Problems|journal=Theory and Decision|volume=67|pages=65|doi=10.1007/s11238-007-9069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fairness vs. simplicity - what procedure is more satisfactory? ===
[[Divide and choose]] (DC) is a fair and very simple procedure. There are more sophisticated procedures that have better fairness guarantees. The question of which were more satisfactory was tested in several lab experiments.

1. '''Divide-and-choose vs Knaster-Brams-Taylor.''' Several pairs of players had to divide among them 3 indivisible goods (a ballpoint pen, a lighter and a mug) and some money. Three procedures were used: the simple DC, and the more complicated ''Adjusted Knaster'' (an improvement of [[adjusted winner]]) and ''Proportional Knaster''.  The authors asked the subjects to select their favorite procedure. Then, they let them play the procedure in two modes: binding (strict adherence to the protocol rules) and non-binding (possible renegotiation afterwards). They compared the procedures performance in terms of efficiency, envy-freeness, equitability and truthfulness. Their conclusions are: (a) The sophisticated mechanisms are advantageous only in the binding case; when renegotiation is possible, their performance drops to the baseline level of DC. (b) The preference for a procedure depends not only on the expected utility calculations of the negotiators, but also on their psychological profile: the more "antisocial" a person is, the more likely he is to opt for a procedure with a compensatory mechanism. The more risk-averse a person is, the more likely he is to opt for a straightforward procedure like DC. (c) The final payoff of a participant in a procedure depends a lot on the implementation. If participants cannot divide the goods under a procedure of their own choice, they are more eager to maximize their payoff. A shortened time horizon is equally detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Gerald|last2=Krämer|first2=Ulrike Sabrina|date=2004|title=The Limitations of Fair Division: An Experimental Evaluation of Three Procedures|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4149806|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=48|issue=4|pages=506–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. '''Structured procedures vs. Genetic algorithms'''. Two pairs of players had to divide between them 10 indivisible goods. A [[genetic algorithm]] was used to search for the best division candidates: out of the 1024 possible divisions, a subset of 20 divisions was shown to the players, and they were asked to grade their satisfaction about the candidate division on a scale ranging from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 1 (fully satisfied). Then, for each subject, a new population of 20 divisions was created using a genetic algorithm. This procedure continued for 15 iterations until a best surviving allocation was found.    The results were compared to five provably-fair division algorithms: Sealed Bid Knaster, Adjusted Winner, Adjusted Knaster, Division by Lottery and  Descending Demand. Often, the best divisions found by the genetic algorithm were rated as more mutually satisfactory than the ones derived from the algorithms. Two possible reasons for that were: (a) ''Temporal fluctuation of preferences'' - the valuations of humans change from the point they report their valuations to the point they see the final allocation. Most fair division procedures ignore this issue, but the genetic algorithm captures it naturally. (b) ''Non-additivity of preferences''. Most division procedures assume that valuations are additive, but in reality they are not; the genetic algorithm works just as well with non-additive valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dupuis-Roy|first=Nicolas|last2=Gosselin|first2=Frédéric|date=2009|title=An Empirical Evaluation of Fair-Division Algorithms|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt0v65q415/qt0v65q415.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society|volume=|pages=2681-2686|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. '''Simple procedures vs. Strongly-fair procedures'''. 39 player-pairs were given 6 indivisible gift-certificates of the same value ($10) but from different vendors (e.g. Esso, Starbucks, etc.). Before the procedure, each participant was shown all the 64 possible allocations, and was asked to grade the ''satisfaction'' and ''fairness'' of each of them between 0 (bad) and 100 (good). Then, they were taught seven different procedures, with different levels of fairness guarantees: Strict Alternation and Balanced Alternation (no guarantees), Divide and Choose (only envy-freeness), Compensation Procedure and Price Procedure (envy-freeness and Pareto-efficiency), Adjusted Knaster and Adjusted Winner (envy-freeness, Pareto-efficiency and equitability). They practiced each of these against a computer. Then, they did an actual division against another human subject. After the procedure, they were asked again to grade the satisfaction and fairness of the outcome; the goal was to distinguish procedural fairness from distributional fairness. The results showed that: (a) procedural fairness had no significant impact; satisfaction was mainly determined by distributional fairness. (b) the results of simpler procedures (strict alternation, balanced alternation and DC) were considered fairer and more satisfactory. They explain this couter-intuitive result by showing that humans care about ''object equality'' - giving each agent the same number of objects (though this does not entail any mathematical fairness criterion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dupuis-Roy, Nicolas; Gosselin, Frédéric|first=|date=2011|title=The Simpler, the Better: A New Challenge for Fair-Division Theory|url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/Proceedings/2011/papers/0742/paper0742.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2011)|volume=|pages=3229–3234|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency vs. strategy - what procedure is more efficient? ===
Consider two agents that have to bargain on a deal, such as how to divide goods among them. Often, if they sincerely reveal their preferences, they can attain a win-win deal. However, if they strategically misrepresent their preferences in an attempt to gain, they might actually lose the deal. What negotiation procedure is most efficient in terms of attaining good deals? Several bargaining procedures were studied in the lab.

1. '''[[Sealed bid auction]]''': a simple one-shot negotiation procedure. In the lab, information-advantaged players aggressively exploited asymmetric information, and drastically misrepresented their true valuation through strategic bidding. This often resulted in a reduced bargaining zone, forgone deals and low economic efficiency. In one experiment, deals were made on only 52% of all trials, while 77% of all trials had a positive bargaining zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=T. E. Daniel, A. Seale, A. Rapoport|first=|date=1998|title=Strategic Play and Adaptive Learning in the Sealed Bid Bargaining Mechanism|url=http://www.academia.edu/download/39731579/Strategic_Play_and_Adaptive_Learning_in_20151105-8328-1ffut5t.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=42|pages=133–166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

2. '''Bonus procedure''': a procedure that gives a bonus was given to participants making a deal. This bonus is calculated such that it is optimal for players to reveval their true preferences. Lab experiments show that this does not help: subjects still strategize, although it is bad for them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parco|first=James E.|last2=Rapoport|first2=Amnon|date=2004-11-01|title=Enhancing Honesty in Bargaining Under Incomplete Information: An Experimental Study of the Bonus Procedure|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-005-3824-4|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=539–562|doi=10.1007/s10726-005-3824-4|issn=0926-2644|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [[Adjusted Winner|'''Adjusted Winner''']] (AW): a procedure that allocates divisible objects in order to maximize the total utility. In the lab, subjects bargained in pairs over two divisible objects. Each of the two objects was assigned a random value drawn from a commonly known prior distribution. Each player had complete information about their own values, but incomplete information about their co-bargainer’s values. There were three information conditions: (1)  Competing Preferences: Players know that the preferences of their co-bargainer are similar to their own; (2)  Complementary Preferences: Players know that the preferences of their co-bargainer are diametrically opposed to their own;  (3)  Unknown (Random) Preferences: Players do not know what their co-bargainer values most relative to their own preferences.  In condition (1), the bilateral decisions converge toward efficient outcomes, yet only one-third are "envy-free". In condition (2), while players dramatically misrepresent their true valuation for objects, both efficiency and envy-freeness approach maximum levels. In condition (3), pronounced strategic bidding emerges, yet the result is twice as many envy-free outcomes, with increased levels of efficiency (relative to condition 1). In all cases, the structured AW procedure was quite successful in attaining a win-win solution - about 3/2 times more than unstructured negotiation. The key to its success is that it forces players out of the ‘fixed pie myth’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniel|first=Terry E.|last2=Parco|first2=James E.|date=2005-05-01|title=Fair, Efficient and Envy-Free Bargaining: An Experimental Test of the Brams-Taylor Adjusted Winner Mechanism|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-005-1245-z|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=241–264|doi=10.1007/s10726-005-1245-z|issn=0926-2644|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. '''Conflict-resolution algorithm''': Hortala-Vallve and lorente-Saguer describe a simple mechanism for solving several issues simultaneously (analogous to Adjusted Winner). They observe that equilibrium play increases over time, and truthful play decreases over time - agents manipulate more often when they learn their partners' preferences. Fortunately, the deviations from equilibrium do not cause much damage to the social welfare - the final welfare is close to the theoretic optimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-11-01|title=A simple mechanism for resolving conflict|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825610000333|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=375–391|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2010.02.005|issn=0899-8256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How does sharing behavior develop in children? ===
In the lab, children were paired to "rich" and "poor" and were asked to share objects. There were differences in the perception of "initial belongings" vs. "things that have to be shared": young children (up to 7) did not distinguish them while older children (above 11) did. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moessinger|first=Pierre|date=1975|title=Developmental study of fair division and property|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2420050310|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=385–394|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420050310|issn=0046-2772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7500">A '''first principle''' is a basic, foundational, self-evident [[proposition]] or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. In [[philosophy]], first principles are taught by [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as [[postulate]]s by [[Kantian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Bourke, ''Ethics'', (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1966), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], first principles are referred to as [[axiom]]s or postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting.

==In formal logic==
In a formal [[logical system]], that is, a set of [[proposition]]s that are consistent with one another, it is [[Logical possibility|possible]] that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the [[syllogism]], ''"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal"'' the last claim can be deduced from the first two.

A first principle is an [[Axiom#Mathematical logic#Logical axioms|axiom]] that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of [[Euclid's Elements]]; its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and common notions: all three types constitute first principles.

==Philosophy in general==
In philosophy "first principles" are also commonly referred to as ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' terms and arguments, which are contrasted to ''[[a posteriori]]'' terms, reasoning or arguments, in that the former are simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as [[epistemology]], but are an important factor in any [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation.  

In philosophy "first principles" are often somewhat synonymous with ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'', datum and [[axiomatic reasoning]].

==Aristotle's contribution==
[[Terence Irwin]] writes:
{{quote|When Aristotle explains in general terms what he tries to do in his philosophical works, he says he is looking for "first principles" (or "origins"; archai):
:In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10–21)
The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as "the first basis from which a thing is known" (Met. 1013a14–15). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;

==Descartes==
Profoundly influenced by [[Euclid]], [[Descartes]] was a [[rationalist]] who invented the [[foundationalist]] system of philosophy. He used the ''method of doubt'', now called [[Cartesian doubt]], to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt, until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths. His most famous proposition is "Je pense, donc je suis." (''I think, therefore I am'', or ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]'')

Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644):
{{quote|I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called [284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest.&lt;ref&gt;VOL I, Principles, Preface to the French edition. Author’s letter to the translator of the book which may here serve as a preface, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==In physics==
In [[physics]], a calculation is said to be ''from first principles'', or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical [[Physical model|model]] and [[Curve fitting|fitting]] parameters.

For example, calculation of [[electronic structure]] using [[Schrödinger's equation]] within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' approach]].

Football [[hooliganism]] normally involves conflict between gangs, in English known as football [[List of hooligan firms|firm]]s (the term derives from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed for the purpose of intimidating and physically attacking supporters of other teams. Other English-language terms commonly used in connection with hooligan firms include "army", "boys", "[[Casual (subculture)|casuals]]", and "crew".  Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called [[local derby|local derbies]]) is likely to be more severe.

Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt; In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured [[riot police]] have intervened with [[tear gas]], [[police dogs]], [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; Hooligan-led violence has been called "aggro" (short for "aggravation") and "bovver" (the [[Cockney]] pronunciation of "bother", i.e. trouble).

Hooligans who have the time and money, may follow national teams to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team.  They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public.  While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance.

==Behavior==

Football hooliganism involves a wide range of behaviour, including:
* taunting
* spitting
* unarmed fighting
* throwing of objects on to the pitch, either in an attempt to harm players and officials or as a gesture of insult.
*throwing of objects at opposing supporters, including stones, bricks, coins, flares and [[Molotov cocktail]]s.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=novasports.gr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novasports.gr/default.asp |title=novasports.gr |publisher=novasports.gr |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314052754/http://www.novasports.gr/default.asp |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* fighting with weapons including [[baseball bats|sports bats]], glass bottles, rocks, [[rebar]], knives, [[machetes]] and [[firearms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwworld.de/dw/article/0,2144,1701053,00.html |title=German Hooligans Make Mark in Bratislava &amp;#124; World Cup 2006 &amp;#124; Deutsche Welle &amp;#124; 05.09.2005 |publisher=Dwworld.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* disorderly crowd behaviour such as pushing, which may cause stadium fixtures such as fences and walls to collapse.

==Early history==
The first instance of football violence is unknown, but the [[phenomenon]] can be traced back to [[History of England#14th century|14th-century England]]. In 1314, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] banned football (at that time, a violent, unruly activity involving rival villages kicking a [[pig's bladder]] across the local [[heath]]) because he believed the disorder surrounding matches might lead to [[Rebellion|social unrest]], or even [[treason]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"&gt;{{Cite news|title=When did football hooliganism start?|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 December 2006|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,618130,00.html|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London | first=Sean | last=Ingle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[University of Liverpool]] academic [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|paper]], conflict at an 1846 match in [[Derby]], England, required a reading of the "[[riot act]]" and two groups of [[dragoon]]s to effectively respond to the disorderly crowd. This same paper also identified "[[pitch invasion]]s" as a common occurrence during the 1880s in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html|work=University of Liverpool FIG Factsheet|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Pearson, G.|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the [[History of association football#From amateurism to professionalism|modern game]] allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when [[gang]]s of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 5–0 in a friendly match, both teams were [[wikt:pelt|pelted]] with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as "howling roughs".&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt; The following year, Preston fans fought [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] fans in a railway station—the first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were [[Trial|tried]] for hooliganism, including a "[[Public intoxication|drunk and disorderly]]" 70-year-old woman, following their match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt;

Although instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its history&lt;ref name="Dunning"&gt;Dunning, E, Murphy, P and Williams, J., 'The Roots of Football Hooliganism' 1988, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]'s ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media's attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in [[History of association football#South America|Latin American football]]. In the 1955–56 English football season, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label "football hooliganism" first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s,&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Stott, C. and Pearson, G., 'Football Hooliganism: Policing and the War on the English Disease', 2007 London: Pennant Books&lt;/ref&gt; leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this in turn created a 'moral panic' out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, S, 'The Treatment of 'Football Hooligans' in the Press', in Ingham et al., (1978) Football Hooliganism: The Wider Context, London: Inter-Action Inprint&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Football hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called "ritualized male violence".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Spaaij, Understanding Football Hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Countries&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Studies scholars Paul Gow and Joel Rookwood at [[Liverpool Hope University]] found in a 2008 study that "Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter’s sense of identity."&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031101939/http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] one study from 1986 claimed that alcohol, irregular tickets sales,  the disinterest of the organisers and the "'cowardly ineptitude'" of the police had led to the tragedy. Gow and Rookwood's 2008 study, which used interviews with British football hooligans found that while some identified structural social and physiological causes (e.g. aggression produces violent reactions) most interviewees claimed that media reports (especially in newspapers) and the police's handling of hooligan related events were the main causes of hooliganism.&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"/&gt; [[Politics|Political]] reasons may also play in part in hooliganism, especially if there is a political undertone to such a match (e.g. unfriendly nations facing each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9176000/9176519.stm|title=Why does football violence happen?|date=10 November 2010|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an attempt to explain the hooliganism phenomena in Brazil, Nepomuceno and other scholars at Federal University of Pernambuco has accessed 1363 hooligan incidents before and after an alcohol sanction enforced during 8 years. While alcohol presented low evidence to contribute for the incidents of violence, the knockout phases, finals, competitiveness (derby matches), small score boundaries and the pride levels were some of the potentials for the violence among sports spectators. Months after the work being conducted, the State Legislature of Pernambuco decided to abolish the sanction to allow alcohol intake in stadiums.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nepomuceno|first=Thyago Celso C.|last2=de Moura|first2=Jadielson Alves|last3=e Silva|first3=Lúcio Câmara|last4=Cabral Seixas Costa|first4=Ana Paula|date=December 2017|title=Alcohol and violent behavior among football spectators: An empirical assessment of Brazilian's criminalization|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|journal=International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice|volume=51|pages=34–44|doi=10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|issn=1756-0616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22158585 |title=BBC Sport – Millwall &amp; Newcastle violence: Who is to blame for football chaos? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bond stated that in the UK, {{quote|text=[h]igh-profile outbreaks of violence involving fans are much rarer today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. The scale of trouble now compared to then doesn't bear comparison – either in terms of the number of people involved or the level of organisation.  Football has moved on thanks to [[ban (law)|banning orders]] and better, more sophisticated policing.
And while it is too simplistic to say that the higher cost of watching football has pushed unsavoury elements out, there has been a shift in the way people are expected to behave inside grounds. Offensive chants are still way too commonplace but actual fighting doesn't happen very often.}}

==Subculture==
Football hooligans often appear to be less interested in the football match than in the associated violence. They often engage in behaviour that risks their being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium, ejected from the stadium during the match or banned from attending future matches. Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific section (called an ''end'' in England) of their team's stadium, and sometimes they include the section's name in the name of their group. In the United Kingdom, 1960s and early 1970s football hooliganism was associated with the [[skinhead]] subculture. Later, the [[casual (subculture)|casual]] subculture transformed the British football hooligan scene. Instead of wearing working class skinhead-style clothes, which readily identified hooligans to the police, hooligans began wearing [[Designer clothing|designer clothes]] and expensive "offhand" [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] (clothing worn without careful attention to practical considerations), particularly [[Stone Island]], [[Prada]], [[Burberry]], [[CP Company]], [[Sergio Tacchini]] and [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FASHION: On the Street; A Rainbow of Raincoats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/style/fashion-on-the-street-a-rainbow-of-raincoats.html|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 1989|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-hooligan measures==
Police and civil authorities in various countries with hooligan problems have taken a number of measures, including:
* banning items that could be used as weapons or missiles in stadiums, and searching suspected hooligans
* banning identified hooligans from stadiums, either formally via judicial orders, or informally by denying them admittance on the day
* moving to [[All-seater stadium|all-seated stadiums]], which reduces the risk of disorderly crowd movement
* segregating opposing fans, and fencing enclosures to keep fans away from each other and off the pitch
* banning opposing fans from matches and/or ordering specific matches to be played behind closed doors
* compiling registers of known hooligans
* restricting the ability of known hooligans to travel overseas.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Football hooliganism in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as [[FK Sarajevo]] ([[Horde Zla]]), [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo]] ([[The Maniacs]]), [[FK Velež Mostar]] ([[Red Army Mostar|Red Army]]), [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar]] (Ultrasi) and [[FK Borac Banja Luka]] (Lešinari).  Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include [[FK Sloboda Tuzla]] (Fukare), [[NK Čelik Zenica]] (Robijaši) and [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari).

Hooliganism reflects local ethnic divisions and tensions.  Bosniak oriented groups are fans of FK Sarajevo, FK Željezničar and FK Velež Mostar.  Serb oriented groups are fans of FK Borac Banja Luka, [[FK Slavija]], and [[FK Drina Zvornik]] (Vukovi). Croat oriented groups are fans of [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari) and HŠK Zrinjski Mostar.

Many fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as the [[Ustaše]], [[Chetniks]] and [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/ne-nacizmu/46262 |title=Ne nacizmu! |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[2009 NK Široki Brijeg–FK Sarajevo football riots|riots]] between supports of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Premier League]] club sides [[NK Široki Brijeg]] and [[FK Sarajevo]] left [[Horde Zla]] supporter Vedran Puljić (from [[Sarajevo]]) dead from a gunshot wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotonline.com/blog/2009/10/fc-sarajevo-fan-dies-in-riots/ |title=FC Sarajevo fan dies in riots! &amp;#124; Riot terrace fashion blog |publisher=Riotonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooliganism has also been present in lower leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/veliki-neredi-u-jablanici-spasavala-se-ziva-glava/106331 |title=Veliki neredi u Jablanici, spašavala se živa glava |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/sprijecen-sukob-navijaca-borca-i-zrinjskog-u-jablanici/104194 |title=Spriječen sukob navijača Borca i Zrinjskog u Jablanici |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
Football hooliganism in [[Croatia]] has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Day Yugoslav Soccer Died |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/football-war.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the best known [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firms]] are [[Torcida Split|Torcida]] ([[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]) and [[Bad Blue Boys]] ([[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]).&lt;ref name="soccerphile002"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Ultra Scene in Croatia and Serbia: Football Hooliganism Balkan Style |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/hooligans.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the groups are not just hooligan firms; they are more like the South American [[Torcida]] supporters groups and [[Ultras]] groups, with organised [[Tifo]]s and so on.

On 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia) Serbian club [[Red Star Belgrade]] was in [[Zagreb]] to play [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] at the [[Maksimir Stadium]]. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organized supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player [[Zvonimir Boban]] kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism,&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; although the racist remarks, if any appear, are pointed solely to opposing club's players, never to own squad.

Ethnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, [[Sydney United FC|Sydney United]] (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and [[Bonnyrigg White Eagles Football Club|Bonnyrigg White Eagles]] (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the [[New South Wales Premier League]]. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. [[Football NSW]] held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or that there was any ethnic rivalry.&lt;ref name="SMH050314"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Football riot's stupidity, not ethnic, say clubs|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=14 March 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Football/Football-riots-stupidity-not-ethnic-say-clubs/2005/03/14/1110649117701.html|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
P
Croatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.

Another incident occurred in [[Genoa]] in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made [[nazi]] salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in [[Osijek]] during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and [[Kohorta Osijek|Kohorta]] occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones.

A large riot occurred in 2008 in [[Prague]] prior to the [[Sparta Prague]]-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}[http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/bbb-se-susrecu-s-ljubiteljima-karadzica-i-mladica-kojima-ogradu-krasi-srpska-zastava/400226.aspx Index.hr] BBB se susreću s ljubiteljima Karadžića i Mladića, 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- just see the pictures --&gt; Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and 8 police officer were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local [[Romani people]] by giving [[nazi]] salutes.

A large riot occurred in 2010 on 1.May at the [[Maksimir stadium]] when the Bad Blue Boys clashed with the police resulting in many arrests and one critically injured police officer. After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the [[FC Timişoara]]-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident [[Romanians|Romanian]] police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the [[FC Timişoara]] stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at [[FC Timişoara]] fans resulting in severe injuries.
Many [[Croats|Croatian]] hooligan groups have also displayed [[nazi]] flags at matches and have [[neo-nazi]] [[skinheads]] in their ranks. Several incidents occurred when Bad Blue Boys and Torcida made racist chants towards opposing club's football players of [[Black people|African]]&lt;!-- Charlize Theron and Richard Gibson are also of African descent --&gt; descent and hurled bananas in the pitch. In 2010, a [[Cameroon]] player was attacked in [[Koprivnica]] resulting in severe injuries.

In December 2010. 10–15 Tornado ([[Zadar]]) hooligans attacked a [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010 30–40 [[Bad Blue Boys]] attacked a [[PAOK]] traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers.

In November 2014, during a [[Euro 2016]] qualifying game in [[Milan, Italy]] hooligans from Croatia threw flares and fireworks onto the field and the game had to be briefly suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2836967/Italy-1-1-Croatia-European-Championship-qualifier-suspended-10-minutes-second-half.html|title=Italy 1-1 Croatia: European Championship qualifier suspended for 10 minutes in second-half - Daily Mail Online|date=16 November 2014|work=Mail Online|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
Football hooliganism in Cyprus has been an issue for the past few decades and incidents are generally associated with the 5 major Cypriot clubs.

[[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]] fans have been in involved in many incidents on most occasions involving their ultras group "Mahites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/103398/epeisodia-ston-petosfairiko-agona-anagennisi-anorthosi|title=Επεισόδια στον πετοσφαιρικό αγώνα Αναγέννηση- Ανόρθωση|author=sigmalive/ΚΥΠΕ|date=22 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs in Limassol, [[AEL Limassol]] and [[Apollon Limassol]] have also been involved in numerous incidents, especially in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbeast.gr/sports/arthro/680998/epeisodia-amaurosan-to-derbi-ael-apoel/|title=Επεισόδια αμαύρωσαν το ντέρμπι ΑΕΛ-ΑΠΟΕΛ|work=Newsbeast.gr|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/153504/krisimos-travmatismos-nearou-sto-filiko-anorthosi-apollon|title=Κρίσιμος τραυματισμός νεαρού στο φιλικό Ανόρθωση-Απόλλων|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2013/11/03/treis-syllhceis-gia-ta-epeisodia-ston-ag/|title=ANT1 internet world - Τρεις συλλήψεις για τα επεισόδια στον αγώνα Απόλλων - ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of [[APOEL FC]] and [[AC Omonia Nicosia]], the two most successful and most popular clubs in the country are notorious for hooliganism. The most violent cases of hooliganism in Cyprus usually involve the two teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/200575/ektetamena-epeisodia-exo-apo-to-oikima-tou-apoel|title=Εκτεταμένα επεισόδια έξω από το οίκημα του ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/Cyprus/epeisodia-sthn-kupro.2792956.html|title=Επεισόδια και διακοπή στο ΑΕΛ - ΑΠΟΕΛ|author=Φώντας Σέμπρος|date=17 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2012/05/17/skhniko-polemoy-sth-lemeso-videos/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/multimedia/video/anorthwsh-omonoia-epeisodia.1977896.html|title=Ανόρθωση - Ομόνοια (επεισόδια)|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 APOEL fans entered the Omonia stand and engaged in fistfights with Omonia fans eventually throwing one down the stand stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=42915|title=Σοβαρά επεισόδια και διακοπή του ντέρμπι ΑΠΟΕΛ-Ομόνοια|work=Ελευθεροτυπία|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 months later in November fans of the two teams clashed close to the [[GSP Stadium]] when APOEL fans tried to hijack a futsal tournament organized by Omonia.

The rivalry between Omonia and APOEL has its roots in politics. APOEL fans are in their majority right wing whereas Omonia fans are left wing. Communist symbols in the Omonia stand and right wing or even fascist symbols in the APOEL stand are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftwingsoccer.com/politics-of-cypriot-football/|title=Left-Wing Soccer – Understanding the Political Divide in Cypriot Football|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limassol rivalry between Apollon and AEL Limassol is more a matter of what team dominates over the city.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623144937/http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |archive-date=23 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooliganism in the case of Anorthosis is also politically linked, especially when the club plays a left wing team such as Omonia. Other incidents between clubs of different cities that are of the same political orientation are associated with intercity rivalries, particularly when a club from Limassol faces a club from Nicosia.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"/&gt;

===France===

[[File:Supporters LOSC vs PSV Eindhoven.png|thumb|This photo of a match in [[Lille]] shows the use of flares by PSV Eindhoven supporters in football hooliganism.]]
Football hooliganism in France is often rooted in [[social conflict]], including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland.&lt;ref name = "Bay"&gt;{{Cite news| title =Racist insults infiltrate French soccer stadium|url =http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm | publisher =[[The Boston Bay State Banner]]| date= 20 April 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-21|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715011039/http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long-standing north/south rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and [[Olympique de Marseille]] (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent.&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{Cite news| title = PSG act after fan hurt

On 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4–2 to [[Israeli people|Israeli]] club [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] at the Parc des Prince in a [[UEFA Cup]] match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{Cite news| title = France faces up to football hooliganism |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6189888.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 27 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan who was shot, was linked with the ''Boulogne Boys'', a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group's name comes from the [[Kop of Boulogne]] (KOB), one of the two main home fan stand at the Parc des Princes.

The KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan.

The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest Police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium.

On 11 June 2016, during a Euro 2016 match in [[Marseille]] between Russia and England, violent conflict broke out between the fans and left 35 injured.

===Greece===
[[File:Panathinaikos-paok 1989.jpg|thumb|Hooligans of "GATE 13" Panathinaiko's attacking supporters of "GATE 4" Paok and punched in field of Leoforos Alexandras stadium.]]
The first incidents between Football fans in Greece were recorded in June 1930, after the match between [[Aris Thessaloniki]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving at the port of [[Piraeus]] from [[Thessaloniki]], Olympiakos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8–2) by [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] rioted with the green fans. 
The word "hooliganism" was recorded at the early '60s where Greek students in the UK who had experienced the phenomenon of hooliganism there first taught the term to the journalists who were unable to explain why the fans were fighting each other and gave this situation a name.
In 1962, after [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] and [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] match incidents, newspapers wrote for the first time that hooligans (Χούλιγκανς) vandalized [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]].
It was on 19 November 1966 that a big flag, at the 13th gate of [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]] announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. [[Gate 13]] would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions.
[[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] fans made Gate 4 in 1978 and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] fans create the Gate 7 in 1981.
In 1982, between Aris FC – Paok FC match incidents, Aris Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki's hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alkazar stadium of Larissa Charalambos Blionas was killed by a flare pistol thrown by the Paok fans. One month later anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match [[AEK Athens F.C.]] &amp; [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]]. In January 1991, before the derby of Aek F.C. and Olympiakos F.C., George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nea Filadelfia's stadium hit by flare pistol.
On 15 May 2005, in [[Thessaloniki]] derby [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]]-[[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris F.C.]], Aris' hooligans called ''Ierolohites'' invaded the pitch when the score was 2–1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and [[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris]] was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the [[Second Division (Greece)|Second Division]].
In April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in [[Greece]] for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in [[Athens]] on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival [[Super League Greece]] clubs [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], which is based in Athens, and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], which is based in nearby [[Piraeus]]. The [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters' organizations.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kitsantonis | first = Niki | title = Soccer: Greece wrestles with fan violence| work=International Herald Tribune | date = 19 April 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/19/sports/GREEKS.php | accessdate = 2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match between [[Panetolikos]] and [[Ilioupoli GS|Ilioupoli]] was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal.

On 18 April, rival fans clashed with each other and riot police in [[Ioannina]] during and after a [[Greek football Cup|Greek Cup]] semi-final match between local rivals [[PAS Giannena]] and [[AEL 1964|Larissa]]. There was trouble during the game in which Larissa won 2–0. Fans set fire to [[Waste container|rubbish bins]] and smashed shop windows, while police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt;

On 10 October 2009, a group of about 30 hooligans disrupted an "Under 17" match between local rivals PAOK and [[Aris Thessaloniki]]. Among the injured were a group of Aris Thessaloniki players and their coach, a veteran PAOK player and another official. On 7 October 2011, a group of Greek supporters firebombed the away section of a Euro 2012 qualifying match against Croatia in Athens.
On 18 March 2012, during the match for the Super League Greek Championship in Athens Olympic Stadium between Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, home team Panathinaikos's fans who were inside the stadium attacked police forces with Molotov bombs, causing extended damages to the stadium, while police forces were unable to keep peace.

Before the match clashes broke up between [[AEK Athens|AEK]] and [[Aigaleo FC|Aigaleo]] fans. Indeed, the clashes resulted in the arrest of a security guard of the stadium who was accused of participating in the clashes among [[Aigaleo]] hooligans and also accused of committing attempted murder against an [[AEK Athens|AEK]] fan.

On 15 September 2014, in [[Nea Alikarnassos]], the team Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;[[:el:Π.Α.Σ.Α. Ηρόδοτος]]&lt;/ref&gt; was hosting [[Ethnikos Piraeus]] , a [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match.

One of the biggest riots occurred at a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA – Group 2)|World Cup qualifying match]] between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in [[Chorzów]].

Arranged football hooligan fights in Poland are known as ''[[wikt:ustawka|ustawki]]''; they became common in Poland since the late 90s. On 30 March 2003, [[Polish police]] arrested 120 people after rival football supporters fought during a match between [[Śląsk Wrocław]] and [[Arka Gdynia]].&lt;ref name="BBC2901451"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Man killed in Polish football riot | publisher = BBC News | date = 30 March 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2901451.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wrocław football riot 2003|riot]], [[hooliganism|hooligans]] pelted police officers with stones and fought a running battle with knives and axes.

The most notable hooligan incidents happened in [[Kraków]] where supporters of the [[Wisła Kraków]] and [[KS Cracovia]] teams have a rivalry that reportedly extended to killings of opposing fans.

Country-wide riots involving football fans were seen in [[Słupsk street riots 1998|1998 in Słupsk]] and [[Knurów riots 2015|2015 in Knurów]], both incidents sparked by a killing of a fan by the police.

===Serbia===
The most prominent groups of hooligans are associated with [[Belgrade]] and [[Serbia]]'s two main clubs, [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]]. They are known as the ''[[Delije]]'' ("Heroes") and ''[[Grobari]]'' ("Gravediggers"), respectively. [[FK Rad]] is a less-successful Belgrade club, whose associated hooligans, known locally as "''United Force''", have notoriously been involved in many violent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1123137,00.html |title=The Observer: Football, blood and war |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2007, a plainclothes police officer was seriously injured when he was attacked during a [[Serbian Superliga]] match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]].&lt;ref&gt;The officer was attacked with burning flares and broken seats and he had to fire warning shots in the air in self-defence. He was treated for burns, cuts and bruises in a nearby hospital. The following day, the [[Football Association of Serbia]] requested government help to help crack down on football hooliganism in the country.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersidUKL0320214820071203"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Milosavljevic| first = Zoran| title = Soccer-Serbian government to take tougher stance on hooligans| publisher = Reuters | date = 13 December 2007 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL0320214820071203 | accessdate = 2007-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2008 a football fan was killed near [[Novi Sad]] after clashes between [[FK Partizan]]'s [[Grobari]] and fans of [[FK Vojvodina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL1686240920080416 |title=Soccer-Serbian FA issues anti-hooliganism appeal |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same week, after a Red Star Belgrade-Partizan cup match, three people were injured and a bus destroyed by hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=294429 |title=Vesti – Nova divljanja huligana – Internet, Radio i TV stanica; najnovije vesti iz Srbije |publisher=B92 |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Praha, Staré Město, Můstek, tag HCZ.JPG|thumb|Football firm [[graffiti]] in Prague.]]
On 19 September 2008 a Serbian football hooligan was sentenced to ten years in jail for an attack against a police officer at a [[Red Star Belgrade]]–[[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=53610|title=Red Star hooligan sentenced to 10 years|work=B92.net|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2010 Serbia's Euro 2012 Qualifying clash with Italy was abandoned after only 6 minutes after several Serbian fans threw flares and fireworks onto the pitch and caused severe trouble in and out of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbeta.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9086046.stm |title=BBC Sport – Football – Uefa begins investigation into Serbia fan violence |publisher=Newsbeta.bbc.co.uk |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partizan Belgrade were disqualified from the UEFA Cup, after crowd trouble in Mostar, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.

They attacked him and other fans with baseball bats and flares while wearing surgical masks. The hooligans received up to 35 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12279960 | work=BBC News | title=Serbia football fans jailed for 2009 Brice Taton murder | date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Football [[hooliganism]] in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some [[black people|black]] players have been victims of [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]]. [[Samuel Eto'o]], a former [[FC Barcelona]] player from [[Cameroon]], has denounced the problem.

The second source is the strong [[Major football rivalries|rivalry]] between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, [[Luís Figo]]'s appearance in Barcelona's [[Camp Nou|Nou Camp]] Stadium triggered a strong reaction. The crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other things (including a pig's head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish [[La Liga|Primera División]].

Hooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the [[General Franco]] fascist regime days (some [[Real Madrid]], [[Atlético Madrid]], [[Espanyol]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] or [[Valencia CF]] ultras are linked to franquista groups), the communist ones, (such as [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], [[Athletic Club Bilbao]], [[Sevilla FC]], [[Celta de Vigo]], [[Rayo Vallecano]]) and the independentist movements in [[Catalonia]] (like [[FC Barcelona]]), [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called ''grupos ultra''. Three notorious ones are the [[Boixos Nois]], the Frente Atlético and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid respectively.

In 1991, [[Frederiq Roiquier]], a French supporter of [[Espanyol de Barcelona]] was killed by [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans which mistook him for an Espanyol hooligan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1991/01/30/deportes/665190001_850215.html |title=Un 'ultra' azulgrana afirma que la muerte de un joven francés fue rigurosamente planeada &amp;#124; Edición impresa &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Elpais.com |date=30 January 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 a 13-year-old child died in [[Espanyol]] stadium before a flare impact in his thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-65085 |title=MURIÓ UN NIÑO POR BENGALA EN ESPAÑA – Archivo – Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 |publisher=eltiempo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Aitor Zabaleta, a supporter of [[Real Sociedad]] was killed by an [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/247076/l/ |title=El Tribunal Supremo confirma la pena por desórdenes contra Ricardo Guerra y otros miembros del grupo ultra Bastión |trans-title=The Supreme Court confirmed the sentence for disorderly conduct against Ricardo Guerra and other group members ultra Bastión |language=Spanish |publisher=20 Minutos |date=13 June 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was linked to a neo-Nazi group (Bastión), just before a match between these two teams. In 2003, a supporter of [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] was killed in riots by Deportivo hooligans, when he tried to protect a supporter of the opposing team, [[SD Compostela]]. Since then, authorities have made attempts to bring hooliganism more under control. In 2007, there were acts of hooliganism before a match between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, with several cars being destroyed and policemen injured by flares and bottles which were thrown at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Vandal incidents in Madrid|url =http://www.elcomerciodigital.com/prensa/20070225/deportes/vandalismo-frente-atletico_20070225.html | publisher =[[El Correo Digital]]| date= 24 February 2007| accessdate = 2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many black foreign players have been racially abused, such as at a 2004 friendly match between Spain and England, in which black England players such as [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] and [[Ashley Cole]] endured [[monkey chants]] from Spain supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/monkey-chants-force-clampdown-on-spains-racist-football-fans-525020.html |title='Monkey chants' force clampdown on Spain's racist football fans – Europe, World |publisher=The Independent |date=29 January 2006 |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London | first=Graham | last=Keeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also have been local disputes between rival teams, for example between [[Cádiz Club de Fútbol]] and [[Xerez CD]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] and [[Sevilla FC]] or [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] and [[Celta de Vigo]].

Hooligan violence in Spain decreased since the late '90s due to an alcohol ban in sporting events as well as hooligan laws which attempt fines up to 600,000 euros and bans of two years without access to stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/informacion/legislacion-basica/ley-del-deporte |title=Ley del Deporte – Portal del Consejo Superior de Deportes |language=es |publisher=Csd.gob.es |date=1 January 2000 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans, the [[Boixos Nois]] are not allowed to enter in [[Camp Nou]]. The hardcore of Barcelona hooligans subgroups were involved in police operations against organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/20100919/casuals-una-mafia-catalana/486250.shtml |title=Casuals, una mafia catalana – Sociedad – El Periódico |publisher=Elperiodico.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, after a hooligan incident versus [[Espanyol]], [[FC Barcelona]] very publicly took a stand on violence, saying it hoped to stamp out violence for good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada08-09/09/n080928105461.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801194615/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada08-09/09/n080928105461.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 August 2012 |title=FCBarcelona.cat |publisher=FCBarcelona.cat |date=28 September 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligans clashed with Aberdeen FC hooligans prior to a [[UEFA Cup]] match.In 2009 and 2010 [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligans also clashed with [[FC Porto]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] in Portugal during [[UEFA Cup]] games.
In 2012 a [[Rayo Vallecano]] Hooligan was arrested during riots in 14-November general strike and accused of terrorism.

In 2014, debate about eradicating Spanish hooligans arose after Frente Atlético members murdered a Riazor Blues member, [[Deportivo La Coruña]] radicals; and after members of the [[Boixos Nois]] stabbed two [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] supporters in Barcelona.

In 2016, Football-related violence came once again to the public debate after a Fight between [[Sevilla FC]] and [[Juventus FC]] Supporters that occurred the day before their [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage match. 2 Juventus supporters were stabbed (one of them was seriously injured but survived after being hospitalized) and a Sevilla supporter was hospitalized with head wounds caused by a glass bottle.

===Sweden===
Hooliganism began in Sweden at the turn of the 20th century as fans of [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] and [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] have been reported fighting after derbies in [[Stockholm]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Modern hooliganism began in 1970 when fans of [[IFK Göteborg]] invaded the pitch, destroyed the goalposts and fought the police at the end of a match that relegated Göteborg from the [[Allsvenskan]], although Hooliganism in Sweden became a growing problem in the 1980s, but [[pitch invasion]]s and violence at football grounds decreased in the late 1990s; when hooligan firms started pre-arranging their fights away from the grounds and the regular supporters. Seven clubs that have large organised hooligans firms are [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] (Firman Boys), [[IFK Göteborg]] (Wisemen) [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] (DFG) [[Hammarby IF]] (KGB) [[Malmö FF]] (True Rockers) [[GAIS]] (Gärningsmännen) and [[Helsingborgs IF]] (Frontline). But several other football, bandy and ice hockey clubs have active hooligan followings.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news| title =First Swedish football death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2169007.stm | publisher =BBC News| date= 2 August 2002 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, 12 members of the Wisemen stood trial for inflicting life-threatening injuries on a [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] fan in 2001.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In August 2002, [[Tony Deogan]], a member of the Wisemen, was killed after a pre-arranged fight against Firman Boys.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; A second fatality occurred in March 2014, when a 43-year-old [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] supporter was killed in [[Helsingborg]] in an assault on his way to Djurgården's opening match in the [[2014 Allsvenskan]] against [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]]. After the man's death became known, Djurgården supporters invaded the pitch after 42 minutes of play, prompting officials to abandon the match.&lt;ref name="Djurgården fan killed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/djurgarden/article18634468.ab |title=Djurgårdssupporter misshandlad till döds |work=[[Aftonbladet]] |language=Swedish |last1=Svensson |last2=Wagner |first1=Olof |first2=Michael |date=30 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tragedy in Helsingborg"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/arkiv/allsvenskan/tt/2014/03/helsingborg-djurgarden-avbruten/ | title=Djurgårdssupporter död efter bråk | publisher=The Swedish Football Association | work=svenskfotboll.se | date=30 March 2014 | accessdate=2 April 2014 | language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, hooligan incidents are rare due to the fact that the stadiums are small and teams are little.

One incident, dubbed the [[2006 Basel Hooligan Incident]], 13 May 2006, occurred on the last day of the 2005–06 season, when [[FC Zürich]] defeated [[FC Basel]] at [[St. Jakob Park]] to win the Swiss championship with a last-minute goal. After the final whistle, angry Basel hooligans stormed the field and attacked Zürich players. The Zürich team were forced to celebrate in the upper deck of the stands while the fighting continued. There was similar fighting in the streets that night.&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/2006/11/23/eng/article7274780.html |accessdate=6 December 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"/&gt;

===Turkey===

According to the ''[[Turkish Daily News]]'', hooligan groups are well organised, have their own "leaders", and often consist of organised [[street fighting|street fighters]]. These groups have a "racon" (code of conduct), which states that the intention must be to [[injury|injure]] rather than [[murder|kill]] and that a stab must be made below the waist.&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Chain of Fatal Mistakes | url = http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/h.php?news=chain-of-fatal-mistakes-2000-04-16 | publisher = [[Turkish Daily News]]| date = 16 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hooligans have fired firearms into the air to celebrate their team's victory, which has been known to accidentally kill innocent people watching the celebrations on their balconies.&lt;ref name="passionofturks"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Passion of Turkish fans| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/704374.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 6 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="givingperspective"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Giving perspective to football violence| url = http://www.soccernet.com/euro2000/columns/20000521featmike.html| publisher = [[Soccernet]]| date = 20 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trouble has arisen during matches between Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe.&lt;ref name="passionofturks" /&gt; However, the [[Turkish Football Federation]] has tightened security to try and contain the hooliganism. During the 2005 [[Turkish Football Cup|Turkish cup final]] between [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] and [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe]], 8,000 police, [[Football steward|stewards]] and officials were employed to prevent violence.&lt;ref name="istanbulready"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Istanbul ready to host final| url = http://www.newagebd.com/2005/may/15/spt.html| publisher = New Age Sports| location = Bangladesh| date = 15 May 2005| accessdate = 2006-10-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028021547/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/may/15/spt.html| archivedate = 28 October 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Turkish Football Federation introduced new measures to combat the threat of hooliganism and have made new regulations that allow the Professional Football Disciplinary Board to fine clubs up to YTL 250,000 for their fans behavior.

Before Galatasaray's [[UEFA Cup 1999-00#Semi-finals|semi-final UEFA Cup match]] with [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2000, two Leeds fans, Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, were [[2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence|stabbed to death]] in [[Istanbul]] following street fights between Turkish and British hooligans.&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes"/&gt; UEFA allowed the game to proceed and Galatasaray won 2–0.

Ali Ümit Demir was arrested and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for the stabbing, but the sentence was reduced to 5 years on the basis of heavy provocation, while five others were given lesser sentences of under four months.&lt;ref name="wcarchives"/&gt; The families of those accused of attacking with knives are reported to have defended their actions and approved of their children punishing the "rude British people".&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes" /&gt; Galatasaray fans were banned from traveling to the return match to try and avoid further clashes between fans, although there were reports of attacks by Leeds fans on Turkish television crews and the police.&lt;ref name="wildscenes"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Wild scenes greet Turkey's heroes| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/721664.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 21 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Assistant Chief Constable in charge of policing the game believed that the number of arrests was "no worse than a normal high category game".&lt;ref name="wildscenes" /&gt; [[Hakan Şükür]] was hit with projectiles from Leeds United supporters and the Galatasaray team bus was stoned after driving through an underpass. The game saw [[Emre Belözoğlu]] and [[Harry Kewell]] sent off and Galatasaray sealed their way to the final with a 2–2 score.

[[2000 UEFA Cup Final riots|Violence]] also occurred between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] fans (mainly from [[The Herd (hooligan firm)|The Herd]]) and Galatasaray fans before the [[UEFA Cup 1999-00#Final|2000 UEFA Cup final]] in Copenhagen&lt;ref name="arsenalfear"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Arsenal fans fear more violence| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/752001.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 17 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a Galatasaray fan, an Arsenal fan and a Dane were said to have been stabbed.&lt;ref name="threemorestabbed"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Three more stabbed in Copenhagen| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/752001.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 18 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galatasaray later won the match after a penalty shoot-out.

On 24 May 2001, 50 people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between French club PSG and Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.[16][17]PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500.[18] In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.

The 1967 Kayseri Atatürk Stadium Disaster was the worst hooliganism event that has ever happened in Turkey. It resulted in 40 deaths and some 600 were injured. The violence started following provocation of the Kayserispor fans in the half time, whose team went to leading by a goal scored in the first half.Supporters of the two teams threw rocks to each other.Some of the hooligans were also armed with bats and knives.The fleeing crowd caused a stampede in front of the stand exits.The events in the stadium were followed by vandalism in Kayseri and many-days lasting riots in Sivas.

{{Main|Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom}}

There are records of football hooliganism in the UK from the 1880s, and from no later than the 1960s the UK had a worldwide reputation for it&amp;nbsp;– the phenomenon was often dubbed the ''English Disease''.&lt;ref name="LiverpoolUni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html | title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM | accessdate=20 March 2011 | publisher=Football Industry Group, University of Liverpool}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title='Football Hooliganism: Policing the War on the English Disease' | author=Stott, Clifford | year=2007 | publisher=Pennant Books | isbn=978-1-906015-05-3 | author2=Pearson, Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnglishDiseaseBBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6532989.stm | title=The return of the English disease? | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=6 April 2007 | publisher=BBC | first=Mario | last=Cacciottolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndyEnglishDisease"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/another-sorry-outbreak-of-the-english-disease-730590.html | title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=17 June 2004 | publisher=The Independent on Sunday | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s, many organised hooligan firms sprang up, with most [[Football League]] clubs having at least one known organised hooligan element. Hooliganism was often as its worst when local rivals played each other. Supporters of teams including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Leicester City]] and 
[[Bristol City]] were among those most frequently linked to hooliganism.

Racism became a major factor in hooliganism around the same time, as black players became a regular feature in English league teams from the 1970s. Black players were frequently targeted with monkey chants, and had bananas thrown at them. Members of far-right groups including the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] also sprayed racist slogans and distributed racist literature at matches.

[[Sectarian]] violence has long been a regular factor of crowd violence, as well as offensive chanting, at matches in [[Scotland]] between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

As a result of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] at [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in [[1985 European Cup Final|1985]], where Liverpool FC fans rioting led to the death of 39 [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] fans, English clubs were banned from all European competitions until 1990, with Liverpool (the English team present) banned for an additional year.&lt;ref name="hillsboroughjustice"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign | url = http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/bowling.shtm | publisher = Hillsborough Justice Campaign | accessdate = 2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney in his autobiography 'The Undesirables', many of the football hooligan gangs in the UK used hooliganism as a cover for acquisitive forms of crime, specifically theft and burglary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |pages=1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been confirmed in numerous other articles on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Chester |title=Getting Life Lessons From Manchester's Jet-Setting Career Thieves |publisher=Vice Media |date=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J. |last=Sugden |title=Inside the Grafters' Game: An Ethnographic Examination of Football's Underground Economy |publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues |date=January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government led a major crackdown on football-related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations including pubs rather than at the matches themselves.

English clubs who have made the headlines for the worst and most frequent cases of hooliganism include Birmingham City (whose multi racial hooligan element gained the nickname "Zulus" from fans of rival teams in the 1970s when football hooligans were almost always white British), Chelsea (whose then chairman [[Ken Bates]] installed an electric fence at the club's stadium in the mid 1980s to combat hooligans, but was refused permission to switch it on during matches), Leeds United (who were banned from European competitions following a riot after the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern München), Liverpool (14 of whose fans were convicted after a riot at the 1985 European Cup final resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators at Heysel Stadium in [[Belgium]] when a stadium wall collapsed, leading to English clubs being banned from European competitions for 5 years), Manchester United (who were booted out of the European Cup Winner's Cup in 1977 after their fans rioted at a game in France, although they were reinstated to the competition on appeal), Millwall (whose most notorious hooliganism incident was in 1985 when their fans rioted in an FA Cup tie at [[Luton]]), Tottenham Hotspur who gained notoriety for the 1974 UEFA Cup Final disturbances and again in Rotterdam in 1983 (who had a section of fans banned from all football grounds in England in 2008 for their racial and homophobic abuse of former player [[Sol Campbell]]) and Wolves (who had dozens of fans convicted of incidents in the late 1980s involving the [[Subway Army]] hooligan firm at matches against teams including Cardiff City and Scarborough when they were in the Fourth Division).

=== Ukraine ===
Football [[hooliganism]] movement in [[Ukraine]] started in the 1980s. The first big fight (more than 800 people) involving football hooligans was registered in September 1987 between [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] fans in the center of [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusplt.ru/society/okolofutbol-evromaydan-7827.html|title=Родом из советского околофутбола|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s passed in relative silence, as there were no big fights between hooligans. The origin of the football hooligan movement in Ukraine started in the mid-90s. On September 5, 1998 an important game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s national football teams was played. Ukrainian hooligans began to unite in "National crews" to resist Russian fans. However, the mass union did not take place due to police intervention and were mainly composed of Ukrainian fans from [[Kiev]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. In March 2001, several crews united and attacked 80 [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] fans after match between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Belarus national football team|Belarus national football]] teams. At that exact time hooligans and ultras were separated, due to changes of views on supporting movement. One part decided to dedicate all time at the tribune to create a choreo in Italian style, and the others decided to remain faithful to English style with fighting and the same wear style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamo.kiev.ua/blog/91566-istoriya-i-natsionalnyie-osobennosti-fanatskogo-dvizheniya-ukrainyi-i-rossii|title=История и национальные особенности фанатского движения Украины и России|author=dynamo.kiev.ua|work=Новини Динамо К|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 April 2002 about 50 right Dynamo fans attacked [[Jewish]] quarter in [[Kiev]]. First, they stoned small shop and after that throw stoned in synagogue and beat up the head of synagogue and other believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rus.delfi.ee/archive/v-kieve-skinhedy-razgromili-sinagogu?id=3452154|title=В Киеве скинхеды разгромили синагогу|author=rus.delfi.ee|work=rus.delfi.ee|accessdate=15 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 clashes between hooligans occurred mostly outside the city because of the excessive attention of police. During the [[Euro 2012]] several leaders of football hooligans came under government pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9316682/Dont-judge-a-nation-like-Ukraine-by-its-hooligans.html|title=Don’t judge a nation like Ukraine by its hooligans|date=8 June 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Ukrainian revolution 2014]] was announced about unification of all fans and imposed a ban on any provocation as burning attributes, fighting, offensive songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24tv.ua/ukrayina/obyednannya_ukrayini_uzhe_prodemonstruvali_ultras_i_futbolni_fani__poroshenko/n402531|title=Об'єднання України уже продемонстрували ультрас і футбольні фани, — Порошенко|author=24tv.ua|work=Телеканал новин 24|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[war in eastern Ukraine]] many hooligans and ultras went to the defense of the state.

Because of the ban internal conflicts and successes in the international stage Ukrainian hooligans pay attention to foreign fans. After the match between [[FC Dnipro]] and [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint Etienne]] in [[Kiev]] several French fans were hospitalized with the stabbing. August 20, 2015 there was a big fight in [[Hydropark (Kiev Metro)|Hydropark]] between [[Legia Warsaw|Legia]] and [[Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo]]&amp;[[Zorya Luhansk|Zorya]] hools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ua.korrespondent.net/kyiv/3553356-u-kyievi-pobylysia-fanaty-dynamo-i-lehii|title=У Києві побилися фанати Динамо і Легії|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest clash since unification occurred in Kiev, 6 December 2016 between [[Dynamo Kiev|Dynamo]] and [[Besiktas]] hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultras-tifo.net/photo-news/4651-cl-dynamo-kyiv-besiktas-06-12-2016.html|title=CL: DYNAMO KYIV - BESIKTAS 06.12.2016|author=ultras-tifo.net|work=Ultras' news cite|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Turks it was very important match, because win of [[Turkey]] team mean's qualification to the European top stage.

====1920s====
The first murder related with Argentine football occurred on 21 September 1922 in [[Rosario]], during the second half of a match between [[Tiro Federal|Tiro Federal Argentino]] (in its stadium) and [[Newell's Old Boys]] for the Copa Estímulo of the local first division, in a discussion between two fans. Enrique Battcock, a railroad worker and supporter of the home club (also former footballer and former member of the club's directing) was interpellated for Francisco Campá (Newell's Old Boys' supporter and member of the club's directing) for his behaviour, which carried a discussion that ended when Battcock hit in the face to Cambá, who retired from the stadium, returned after a little while, extracted a gun and shot him, causing Battcock's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salvemosalfutbol.org/lista-de-victimas-de-incidentes-de-violencia-en-el-futbol/ Victims list] Salvemos al Fútbol&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 1924 in [[Montevideo]] ([[Uruguay]]), occurred another murder where an Argentina fan was involved. After the final match of the [[1924 South American Championship|South American Championship]] of this year between Uruguay and Argentina (that Uruguay won), in the Colón Hotel (where the [[Argentine national football team]] was staying) broke out a fight among Uruguay supporters and Argentine fans and footballers, where José Lázaro Rodríguez (a recognized Argentine supporter of Boca Juniors and the national team) shot to Pedro Demby, an Uruguayan fan that died consequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pelotaafuera.blogspot.com/2009/11/85-anos-de-la-muerte-de-pedro-demby.html To 85 years of the death of Pedro Demby] Pelota Afuera&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s====
On 14 May 1939 at the stadium of [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] (in the city of [[Lanús]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]), in a match of the minor divisions of the local team and Boca Juniors (previous to the match of the main teams of both clubs), after a foul committed by a player of Lanús, both teams began to fight. Seeing this, Boca Juniors fans wanted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them. But a police officer named Luis Estrella shot into the stands, killing two spectators: Luis López and Oscar Munitoli (a 9-year old).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=920643 An undesirable list who grow...] La Nación&lt;/ref&gt;

====1940s====
But this violence was not only among fans, footballers or the police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell's Old Boys and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] at Newell's Old Boys stadium (in the city of [[Rosario]]), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied on two goals when Cossio annulled a goal of the premises, and the third goal of San Lorenzo de Almagro in the next play worsened the situation. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell's Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2010/03/17/noticia_0049.html The shortest match of the history] La Capital&lt;/ref&gt;

====1950s====
Although in [[Football in Argentina|Argentine football]] violence was already present from the beginning (late 19th century), the organized groups ([[Barra brava|barras bravas]]) appeared in the 1950s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]], [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]], [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]], [[Rosario Central]], [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]], Racing, etc.) and 1960s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]], Boca Juniors, River Plate, etc.), and continued to grow in the coming decades. With the time, every big and small football club in Argentina started to have its own corresponding barra brava, and all are violent or prepared for violence. In Argentina there are the most dangerous organized supporter groups in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124431/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |archive-date=2 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of [[Club Atletico Independiente|Independiente]] ([[La barra del Rojo|La Barra Del Rojo]]), [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota1/d-07701.htm |title=Clarín digital &amp;#124; Deportes. River: la barra más temida |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this phenomenon suffered a major transformation in the late 1950s. The journalist Amílcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed since some years), with the random murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (a Boca Juniors supporter -not identified as such- that circumstantially was watching a match between [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] and River Plate at the [[Estadio José Amalfitani|José Amalfitani]] stadium), that was located in the grandstand of River Plate fans when some of them started a fight and the police burst throwing tear gas grenades, one of which hit to Linker in the chest, causing his death. Because of this murder in October 1958, the society notes the existence of this organized groups (the barras bravas). The so-called "industrialization of football" was the kickoff for this organization, because needed to control all aspects involved in the game. Before the emergence of these groups, when a team played as a visitor, was pressured by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure:

{{quote|In Argentine football, it was well established that if you played as the visiting team, you were inexorably in a tight spot. Although they were not barras bravas as we know them today, local fans would pressure you, and the police, when not looking the other way, would pressure you as well. That had to be offset by a doctrine that in the next decade became common currency: the only means by which to neutralize any effectual group with a reputation and capacity for violence, is with another, closer-knit group with as great, or greater, reputation for violence.|source=&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-22673-2003-07-13.html The barras appear with the industrialization of the football] Página/12&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Amílcar Romero}}

In this way, each club began having his barra brava, which was funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium, adding later other forms of financing. But the access to these "benefits" by the barra brava depended of the hierarchy inside her. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the number of dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota2/r-02401d.htm The origins of an evil without remedy] Clarín, especial "Violencia en el fútbol"&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Linker, in Argentine football began a phase marked by "habituation" to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Amílcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, that is, an average of one every three months. However, it also clarifies that the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or "accidents", its analysis tends to show some kind of negligence or violation of safety standards.

====1960s====
In 1964 more than 300 football fans died and another 500 were injured in [[Lima]] ([[Peru]]) in a riot during an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Perú on 24 May.&lt;ref name="Disasters in soccer stadiums"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/09/soccer.chronology |title=Disasters in soccer stadiums |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 1967 in Argentina, before a match between [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]] and Racing de Avellaneda, a Racing fan of 15 years died murdered by the Huracán barra brava&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efdeportes.com/efd8/amilc83.htm The Souto case] EF Deportes&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó|Tomás Adolfo Ducó]] stadium.

====1980s====
From the 1980s and onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the matches of the Argentina national football team in the [[FIFA World Cup]]s. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or [[ultras]]) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s were recorded the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged.

An example of the violence of this years was the Roberto Basile's death. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the ''[[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|Bombonera]]'' stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ The lost flare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528143424/http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ |date=28 May 2010 }} La Redo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, other supporter of Racing was killed, and the barra brava of Independiente was the main suspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/02/19/d-03401.htm Nobody is taking responsibility and today are football in Racing again] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; Independiente and Racing (both from the city of [[Avellaneda]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]) have a huge rivalry (they form the [[Avellaneda Derby]]), the second most important in Argentina but maybe the fiercest (noteworthy that their stadiums are apart only for about 300 meters).

The next year, one fan was killed and 12 people injured, including six police officers when fans of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]] and [[Club Atlético Independiente]] clashed in February 2002.

An Independiente fan was shot dead, and another fan was shot in the back and hospitalized when about 400 rival fans fought outside Racing Clubs [[Estadio Juan Domingo Perón]] in [[Avellaneda]] before the match. Between 70 and 80 people were arrested as a result. The match started late when Independiente fans threw a [[smoke bomb]] at Racing Club [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], Gustavo Campagnuolo. That same weekend, 30 people were arrested and 10 police officers injured when fighting broke out at a match between [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]] in [[La Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1826408.stm |title=AMERICAS &amp;#124;Football fan killed in Argentina |publisher=BBC News |date=18 February 2002 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in [[Argentina]] stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of [[knife]] and [[shotgun]] casualties. At one point the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information).&lt;ref&gt;The Boca group, known as La Doce (''The Twelfth'') has a long history of violence. In 2002 [[Diego Maradona]] was alleged to remain friends with the group's leaders, in spite of their reputation. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hooligans/2006647.stm Argentine hooligans revere Maradona]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, while driving up to [[Rosario]] to watch their side play [[Rosario Central]], Los Borrachos del Tablón (River's Barra Bravas) confronted a bus of Newell's firm (one of the big rival firms) on Highway 9, in a battle that killed two Newell's fans. Up to this day, some members of Los Borrachos still face charges because of the deaths.

In 2005 a footballer, Carlos Azcurra, was shot and seriously wounded by a police officer, when rival fans rioted during a [[Primera B Nacional Argentina|Primera B Nacional]] match between local [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] rivals (but not a derby) [[San Martín de Mendoza]] and [[Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba]].&lt;ref&gt;At half-time, fans had thrown rocks onto the pitch, and just before the end of the match, fans from both clubs invaded the pitch and started fighting. The players who had stayed on the pitch, including Ezcurra, tried to calm the fans, and he was shot when police tried to stop the fans by firing rubber bullets.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4238844.stm BBC NEWS | World | Americas |Argentine footballer shot in riot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, there was a confrontation&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/22/deportes/m-01501.htm Agited early morning] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; between 6 members of the barra brava of Independiente and 16 members of the barras bravas of Boca Juniors and [[Defensa y Justicia]] (both were together) in the [[Czech Republic]] (the country where the three barras bravas were housed). As a result of the fight, a supporter of Boca Juniors had to be hospitalized.

In 2007, during the match of the promotion/relegation playoff of the [[2006–2007 in Argentine football|2006–2007 season]] between [[Club Atlético Nueva Chicago|Nueva Chicago]] and [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] (in the Nueva Chicago's stadium), broke out a fight between the barras bravas of both teams because, when a penalty was sanctionaty for Tigre (who was winning the match 2–1, a result that relegated to Nueva Chicago to the Second division) in the 92nd minute, the barra brava of Nueva Chicago invaded the pitch and ran on direction to the stand occupied by the supporters of Tigre to attack them. After this, were serious riots near the stadium (not only caused by the barras bravas, but also by ordinary people), and as a result of it, a fan of Tigre died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.26noticias.com.ar/locura-en-mataderos-matan-a-un-simpatizante-de-tigre-43236.html Madness in Mataderos: kill a supporter of Tigre] 26 Noticias&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010s====
On 19 March 2010 in a bar of Rosario, the ex leader of the [[Newell's Old Boys]] barra brava (Roberto "Pimpi" Camino) was shot and later died in a hospital of that city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2010/03/19/noticia_0053.html Shot dead to ''Pimpi'' Camino, ex leader of the barra brava of Newell's] La Capital&lt;/ref&gt; Camino and his sub-group led the barra brava from 2002 to 2009, when they were expelled from it due to their defeat at the hands of another sub-group, which currently dominates [[La Hinchada Más Popular]] (name of the Newell's Old Boys barra brava). Some members of the now main sub-group are the suspects of the murder, and the bar's owners are suspected of helping them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=514066 War of barras: 5 suspects arrested for the murder of "Pimpi" Camino] Ámbito financiero&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning of 4 July 2010 (the next day of the match between Argentina and Germany for quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]) in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, there was a fight between some integrants of the barras bravas of Independiente and Boca Juniors. During the brawl, one member of the Boca Juniors barra brava lost consciousness after being brutally beating by the Independiente fanatics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://442.perfil.com/2010/07/05/internaron-a-un-barra-en-estado-delicado/ ''Barra'' interned in "delicated state"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709034700/http://442.perfil.com/2010/07/05/internaron-a-un-barra-en-estado-delicado/ |date=9 July 2010 }} Perfil&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to a hospital in the city and died there on 5 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/Murio-barra-argentino-golpeado-Sudafrica_0_146700063.html Died the Argentina ''barra'' who was beaten in South Africa] La Razón&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2015, in a game between [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Boca Juniors]] at [[La Bombonera]], hooligans sprayed a substance which irritated River Plate players' eyes, and the game was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/boca-juniors-vs-river-plate-copa-libertadores-match-suspended-after-players-hit-by-spray-051415|title=Boca Juniors vs. River Plate Copa Libertadores match suspended after players hit by spray|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Fans in Brazil join in organized groups known as [[torcida organizada|torcidas organizadas]] ("organized supporters") often considered criminal organizations that differ in many aspects from European hooligans. They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other "torcidas organizadas" as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul ([[Avaí Futebol Clube]]), Força Jovem Vasco ([[CR Vasco da Gama]]), Galoucura ([[Atlético Mineiro]]) and Mancha Verde ([[SE Palmeiras]]), the alliance between Torcida Independente ([[São Paulo F.C.]]), Torcida Jovem ([[CR Flamengo]]), Máfia Azul ([[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]]) and Leões da TUF ([[Fortaleza Esporte Clube]]) and some other alliances. The "torcidas organizadas" are usually bigger and more committed to the spectacle in the stadiums than the English hooligan fans&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but they often schedule fights against rival groups where many are injured and killed. Fans of local rivals TJP – Torcida Jovem Ponte Preta ([[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta]]) and TFI -Torcida Fúria Independente ([[Guarani Futebol Clube]]) clashed and rioted at a match in Campinas in 2002. Violence had been expected, and just before kick-off, fans started fighting. Police tried to intervene but were pelted by stones. As the fighting continued inside the stadium, a railing collapsed and numerous fans fell over 13&amp;nbsp;ft (four metres) into a pit between the stands and the pitch. Over 30 people were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2375033.stm |title=Brazil fans plummet into pit |publisher=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Porto Alegre]] on South Brazil, [[Grêmio]] and [[Internacional]] fans, have a different way to support their teams with too much beer, no samba, no T-shirt identification, these 2 firms in this big city results in a long history of tension and conflict.
[[PMERJ|Rio de Janeiro State Police]] has a special battalion to deal with torcidas called GEPE (Grupamento Especial de Policiamento em Estádios, Portuguese for Stadium Police Special Unit).

===Uruguay===
Following a 5-0 victory against arch-rivals Nacional in April 2014, Peñarol have undertaken an increasingly violent and unhinged attitude in the Uruguayan Clasico. While losing a championship play-off match against Nacional in June 2015, Peñarol's fans started a riot that delayed the game by 15 minutes before it was called off. In March 2016, Pablo Montiel - a supporter of Nacional - was shot to death by Peñarol fans after walking in the same neighborhood as Peñarol's new stadium named "Campeon del Siglo" (named after an IFFHS award not recognized by FIFA, intended as a petty insult towards Nacional). Ignacio Ruglio, a board member of Peñarol who have openly spread lies about Nacional, was interrogated by police following the murder of Montiel. In November 2016, the Uruguayan Clasico was cancelled before kick-off after Peñarol's supporters started a riot at the Estadio Centenario - one supporter was arrested holding a pistol, intended to shoot down Nacional players from the Amsterdam tribune. After winning a Clasico for Peñarol in September 2017, team captain Cristian Rodriguez openly called for murdering Nacional fans while celebrating the victory.

===El Salvador===
The ''[[Football War]]'' (Spanish: ''La guerra del fútbol''), also known as the ''Soccer War'' or ''100 Hour War'', was a brief war fought by [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]] in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from [[El Salvador]] to [[Honduras]]. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1–0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816–1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |author2= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after [[extra time]].

The war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969''. p. 105 Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to border clashes between the two nations.

===Mexico===
Football hooliganism in [[Mexico]] appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] and [[Monarcas Morelia|Morelia]] at a [[Primera División de México|Primera División]] match in [[Monterrey]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2992422.stm |title=Fatal Mexican football win |publisher=BBC News |date=15 June 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, one man died and several people were injured when Mexico football fans rioted after [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] lost to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[1998 World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/123024.stm |title=One killed in Mexican World Cup riots |publisher=BBC News |date=30 June 1998 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, hundreds of riot police were brought in to restore order because fans were looting and rioting. Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested.  In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas.  Several police were hospitalized.  As a result, Chivas banned all of their supporters for the Clasico against Club America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccerly.com/article/jonnyrico/chivas-bans-supporter-groups-for-el-clasico-after-violent-acts-in-gdl-derby|title=Chivas Place Indefinite Ban on Supporter Groups After Violent Acts in Derby|author=Jonny Rico  - jonnyrico|work=Soccerly|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
While soccer is traditionally viewed in the United States as a family-friendly event, played by children and supported by parents, some violence does still occur. For junior league soccer, parents can be overzealous and be begrudged over unrelated matters and fights between parents have been documented and reported with police being called and intervening. For major league soccer, on 20 July 2008, in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] between [[Major League Soccer]] side [[Columbus Crew]] and English [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], in [[Columbus Crew Stadium|Columbus, Ohio]], a fight broke out between rival fans. Police estimated more than 100 people were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | author2= | title=Crew-West Ham United friendly marred by brawl between fans | date=19 July 2008 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2008-07-20-crew-west-ham-friendly_N.htm | work =[[USA Today]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unruly encounter occurred between [[Toronto FC]] fans in 2009, upset from a loss in the [[Trillium Cup]], and [[Columbus Crew]] fans. One Toronto fan was tasered by Columbus police.

That same weekend, a riot was narrowly avoided at a packed [[Giants Stadium]] as members of the [[New York Red Bulls]] supporters club, [[Empire Supporters Club]] (ESC), and members of the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] security force clashed over what the ESC claimed was unfair and repeated mistreatment. Clashes also took place in the parking area around the stadium after the game, involving already ejected-for-life North Jersey Firm (NJF) members, and the [[New Jersey State Police]] were called to quell the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Ives | last=Galarcep | author2= | title=More mistreatment for Red Bulls fans at Giants Stadium | date=21 July 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/07/red-bulls-to-bl.html | work =Soccer By Ives | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several arrests, mostly of known NJF hooligans.

===Bangladesh===
Football hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a [[Bangladesh Professional Football League|B-League]] match between [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Bangladesh)|Mohammedan Sporting Club]] and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the [[Bangabandhu National Stadium]], [[Dhaka]]. When the [[referee (association football)|referee]] disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire [[tear gas]] at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/08/11/socceriot010811.html |title=At least 100 injured in Bangladeshi soccer riot |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=11 August 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi'an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism.&lt;ref name="BBC News1892421"/&gt;

In June 2002, riots in [[Fuzhou]], Fujian had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police.  The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the [[2002 World Cup|World Cup]] match between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at an outside broadcast.&lt;ref name="BBC News2036050"/&gt; On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when [[China national football team|China]] lost the final of the [[AFC Asian Cup]] to [[Japan national football team|Japan]], 3–1.

===India===
In [[India]], most of the documented football riots have primarily taken place in [[Kolkata]]. Everytime the [[Kolkata derby|Calcutta derby]] takes place between [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] and [[East Bengal F.C.]], tensions arise. However, it has taken the form of escalating violence twice- notably, at [[Eden Gardens]] on 16 August 1980. 16 people lost their lives that day due to a stampede. Another incident took place on 9 December 2012 at the [[Salt Lake Stadium]]. Though nobody was killed, [[Syed Nabi]], a [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] footballer, was injured by a brick thrown, according to the player, by [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eden Gardens]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/soccer/violence-mars-mohun-bagan-east-bengal-match--2492.html |title=Violence mars Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match |publisher=Indiatvnews.com |date=9 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In the 2000s, tensions surrounding the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] spilled over into sporadic riots between Jewish and Arab Israeli football fans. In December 2000 it was reported that every club in Israel was on a final warning following escalating violence and intimidation at matches.

A number of incidents have involved [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]], including racist abuse against overseas players,&lt;ref name="sundayherald001224"&gt;{{cite news|title=200 Beitar Jerusalem – Israel |work=Sunday Herald |date=24 December 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001224/ai_n13953505 |accessdate=2007-05-20 |first=Natasha |last=Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-Arab chants, use of smoke bombs and fireworks, and rioting. Beitar has a hooligan firm, [[La Familia (Beitar supporters' group)|La Familia]], whose members consider Israeli Arabs to be their enemy. In November 2007 the Israel Football Association (IFA) ordered Beitar to play their game against the Arab club, Bnei Sakhnin behind closed doors after Beitar fans, led by La Familia, broke a minute's silence for former Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin and sang chants in praise of his assassin, Yigal Amir.

Beitar was docked two points and had to play its remaining home games behind closed doors.

Gor Mahia were banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from playing in their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season, meaning that the club will not be able to play in neither the [[Nyayo National Stadium]] nor the [[Moi International Sports Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kenyanlist.com/kls-listing-show.php?id=82916 |title=Gor Mahia banned from using Sports Stadia facilities. |publisher=KenyanList.com |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kassfm.co.ke/news/sports/2323-gor-mahia-banned-from-nyayo-stadium- |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803170034/http://www.kassfm.co.ke/news/sports/2323-gor-mahia-banned-from-nyayo-stadium- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-03 |title=Gor Mahia Banned from Nyayo Stadium |publisher=Kass FM (kassfm.co.ke) |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kenya Premier League|KPL]] Board has yet to announce further disciplinary measures on the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201203300676.html |title=Kenya: Raila Slams Football Hooligans |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a 2014 case where Gor Mahia fans are alleged to have injured [[Machakos]] residents and also vandalized property.

===Libya===
Eight fans died and 39 were injured as troops opened fire to stop both pro- and anti-[[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] sentiments being expressed in a Tripoli stadium during a match between [[Al-Ahly (Tripoli)|Al Ahli]] and [[Al-Ittihad (Tripoli)|Al Ittihad]] in December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/09/soccer.chronology/ |title=Disasters in soccer stadiums |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mali===
After a World Cup qualifying match between [[Mali national football team|Mali]] and [[Togo national football team|Togo]] on 27 March 2005, which Togo won 2–1, Mali fans rioted and went on a spree of destruction and violence. The trouble started when Togo scored the winning goal. Police fired tear gas at Mali fans who had invaded the pitch. The match was abandoned and the result awarded to Togo. The result set off a wave of violence in the capital of Mali, [[Bamako]]. Thousands of Mali fans in Bamako began chanting threats toward the Mali players, cars were set on fire, stores looted, property and monuments destroyed and a building housing the local Olympics committee burnt down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/03/28/mali_soccer050328.html |title=Soccer fans riot in Mali over loss |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=28 March 2005 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mauritius===
In May 1999, seven people died when rioting football fans threw [[petrol bomb]]s into a casino, following a match in [[Port Louis]] between the [[Mauritian League]] champions, Scouts Club, and Fire Brigade SC. After the match which Fire Brigade SC won, hundreds of Scouts fans went on a rampage, attacking police vehicles and torching sugar cane fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/351666.stm |title=Mauritian football riots – seven dead |publisher=BBC News |date=24 May 1999 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozambique===
The government of [[Mozambique]] had to apologise for the violent behaviour of Mozambique fans, before, during and after a match between Mozambique team, [[Clube Ferroviário de Maputo]] and Zimbabwe team, [[Dynamos (Zimbabwe)|Dynamos]] on 10 May 1998. Ferroviário fans attacked the Dynamo players and the referee, stoned vehicles and fought running battles with riot police outside the stadium. Fifteen people, including four [[Red Cross]] workers, needed hospital treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poptel.org.uk/mozambique-news/newsletter/aim134.html#story2 |title=Government apologises for football riots |publisher=Poptel.org.uk |date=19 May 1998 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sundowns had just scored their sixth goal in the 82nd minute at Loftus Stadium on Saturday afternoon when irate Buccaneers supporters invaded the pitch and clashed with Sundowns fans, resulting in several injuries.

===Zimbabwe===
In July 2000 twelve people died following a stampede, when they were crushed, at a World Cup qualifying match between [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in [[Harare]]. Police fired [[tear gas]] when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had taken a two-goal lead. After [[Delron Buckley]] scored South Africa's second goal bottles began to fly onto the pitch. The police then fired tear gas into the 60,000 crowd, who began running to the exits to escape the effects of the tear gas. The match had to be abandoned as players from both sides felt the effects of the tear gas and had to receive medical treatment. The police were condemned for firing tear gas, calling it a total over-reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826301.stm |title=Zimbabwe football riot kills 12 |publisher=BBC News |date=9 July 2000 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2002, two fans were shot when police opened fire on rioting fans at a match in [[Bulawayo]].

==Oceania==
===Australia===
Since the formation of the [[A-League]] in 2004, and the fall of the [[National Soccer League]], football hooliganism has died off in competitions and incidents have become a one-off event during seasons.

The incident with most notoriety in Australia is the Pratten Park riot in 1985 where hundreds of fans stormed the pitch midway through a [[Sydney Olympic FC|Sydney Olympic]] v [[Hakoah Sydney City East FC|Sydney City]] match. In a match between [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]] and [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] in February 2013, 17 plastic seats were destroyed and flares were firing off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |title=Soccer fans destroy Vic stadium seats |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206232806/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a match between [[Sydney FC]] and Melbourne Victory in November 2013, one travelling Melbourne Victory fan was hospitalised with a stab wound by a sixteen-year-old civilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-stabbed-police-arrest-teenager-after-aleague-soccer-match-in-sydney-20131110-2x9an.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Man stabbed, police arrest teenager after A-League soccer match in Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a riot between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers broke out at a pub before the match later that day. 
At an international football friendly between [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] and [[Serbian national football team|Serbia]] in [[Melbourne]] in June 2011, fans lit flares both inside and outside the stadium, and in city streets. Banners supporting [[Ratko Mladić]], the Serbian military leader charged with war crimes by the [[International Court of Justice]], were displayed. A laser pointer was seen in use. A seat inside the stadium was deemed damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/friendly-fire-arrests-as-flares-disrupt-soccer-international-20110608-1frjs.html|title=Friendly fire: arrests as flares disrupt soccer international|publisher=The Age | location=Melbourne|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/police-angry-after-fans-let-off-flares-during-australia-v-serbia-match/story-fn7x8me2-1226071403244|title=Police flag heftier penalties for fans lighting flares at the soccer|publisher=Herald Dun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of unacceptable behaviour by fans.

Although it is nothing like football hooliganism in Europe (or what it used to be), anti-social events occur somewhat rarely. A primary example would be the Bourke Street Brawl between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers fans, who gathered in numbers before a match in late 2013 and had a brawl in Melbourne, concerning many who are involved with football in Australia and authorities. There are small hooligan/casual groups in Australia, the most prominent being from the League's biggest fanbases, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers though others exist within other supporter groups.

==Media portrayal==
Football hooliganism has been depicted in films such as ''[[I.D. (1995 film)|ID]]'', ''[[The Firm (1989 film)|The Firm]]'', ''[[Cass (2008 film)|Cass]]'', ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]'', ''[[Green Street (film)|Green Street]]'', ''[[Rise of the Footsoldier]]'', ''[[Awaydays]]'', ''[[The Brothers Grimsby]]'' and ''[[Eurotrip]]''. There are also many books about hooliganism, such as ''[[The Football Factory (novel)|The Football Factory]]'' and ''[[Among the Thugs]]''. Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5437">The '''Freedom from Union Violence Act''' of 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s105-230 S. 230 [105th&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-919&amp;tab=summary H.R. 919 [110th&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; were identical bills proposed in the [[United States Congress]]. Their intended purpose was to amend the [[Hobbs Act]] and make [[Union violence|violence committed in pursuit of labor union goals]] a federal crime.  They would impose a fine of up to $100,000, 20 years imprisonment, or both, on labor unions that commit or threaten to use violence, extortion, or the obstruction of commerce in the furtherance of labor union goals and objectives.

The bills faced strong opposition from labor unions and others, especially for the clause that would disallow "obstruction of commerce," and failed to pass into law both times.  Opponents noted that violence and extortion were already crimes, and argued that there was no need to pass a special law setting aside union violence and union extortion as being especially heinous.

== Background ==

The Hobbs Act, passed in 1946, was an anti-racketeering act intended to deter robbery and extortion across state lines.  It was commonly used to prosecute unions involved in restraint-of-trade to intimidate management.  In 1970, the federal government attempted to expand the Hobbs Act to be used against violence as well.  The indictment was appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court, discussing whether the Hobbs Act could be construed to cover violence as well.  In the 1973 Supreme Court case  ''[[United States v. Enmons]]'', the ruling declared that the [[Hobbs Act]] as written did not cover such incidents, and cited Congressional debates at the time of passage that it was not intended to.  Still, nothing prevented a new law from being passed.

Proponents of the Freedom from Union Violence Act have attempted to portray the ''United States v. Enmons'' as giving legal immunity to unions who engage in violence, though such an interpretation is incorrect; violence would fall under normal state laws prohibiting such activity.&lt;!-- Yes, this is original research from how this article was written before, but sorry, such claims are blatantly false.--&gt;

The [[National Right to Work Committee]], a strong proponent of the FUVA [states][http://www.nrtwc.org/facts-issues/fuva.htm]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Freedom from Union Violence Act closes a loophole in the federal Hobbs Anti-Extortion Act, eliminating the special judicially-created exemption in this law for union-related violence and extortion and holding union officials to the same legal standards as other Americans.

This legislation would establish that the 1946 Hobbs Act applies to all Americans, including union officials seeking to advance so-called "legitimate union objectives." Present law offers this unique exemption for union officials.

NILRR union violence investigations have determined that union violence is responsible for at least 203 Americans deaths since 1975; 5,869 incidents of personal injury; and more than 6,435 incidents of vandalism and tens of millions of dollars in property damage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The NWRC position on FUVA may be found [http://www.right-to-work.org/FactSheets/ViolenceFactSheet.pdf][here].

However, opponents of FUVA claim that the existence of union violence has been greatly exaggerated.  In a law review article, Julius G. Getman and F. Ray Marshall, The Continuing Assault on the Right to Strike, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 703, 712-13 (2001), law professor Julius Getman and former Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, analyzed the evidence of union violence.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The claim that strike violence is "escalating" has no empirical basis. Even the study conducted by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research - cited regularly as authority for this proposition by FUVA's proponents - draws no such conclusion. And the study itself is a scholarly monstrosity that seeks to study union violence by compiling media reports, mainly newspaper articles concerning strike violence. The Institute admits that it did not actually investigate any of the incidents reported and does not know if the reports are accurate. It concludes: "Because it relies on news accounts the Institute cannot guarantee the accuracy of the file itself." In fact, articles about employer-instigated violence are included in the study's effort to determine union violence. n59 It seems obvious that the methodology employed confuses those strikes most written about with those most violent. Further, the Institute includes incidents of "psychological violence; i.e., intimidation, coercion and verbal threats" - terms which it does not bother to define. It seems clear, however, that this definition would include nonviolent civil disobedience of the type used by the civil rights movement and increasingly by the labor movement. But whatever the definition, it is almost certain that strike-related violence has decreased since the Enmons decision because the number of strikes has declined significantly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# Positive body image and mindset: activities to boost [[self-image]]; understanding the effects of [[self-criticism]], depression and eating disorders.
# Making and keeping friends: social and life skills, independent critical thinking and developing satisfactory peer relationships.
# When it all seems like too much: teach girls when to seek help and how to find resources for help. 
# Let’s talk about sex: basics of reproduction, [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases|sexually transmitted diseases]], how to refuse [[Rape#Consent|unwanted advances]], and the effects of drugs and alcohol. 
# "Planning for the future": teach girls to make goals and work to achieve them.

== Criticism ==
The program has been criticized for lacking "the capacity to measure prevention." According to William Epstein, the program is also unlikely to make an impression on girls because of the didactic nature of its curriculum. He referred to the evaluation done by the LeCroy in 2004 as a "poorly designed study." confirming the need for a more authoritative evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZSiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22go+grrrls%22|title=Empowerment as Ceremony|last=Epstein|first=William M.|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412851602|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of '''human trophy collecting''' involves the acquisition of human remains.  The intent may be to demonstrate dominance over the deceased, such as [[scalping|scalp-taking]] or forming necklaces of human ears or teeth, or to commemorate the deceased, such as the veneration of the relics of saints.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  It can be done to prove one's success in battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=[[Academic American Encyclopedia]] |volume=10 |publisher=[[Grolier]] |year=1997 |quote=In some cultures head-hunting can be considered a manifestation of the widespread practice of removing parts of the body of a slain enemy — as in scalping or the severing of an ear or nose — for war trophies. |isbn=978-0-7172-2068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to show off one's power to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=[[Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics]] |page=534 |chapter=The head as trophy or cult object |volume=6 |year=1913 |isbn=978-0-543-97870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murderers' collection of their victims' body parts have also been described as a form of trophy-taking; the [[FBI]] draws a distinction between souvenirs and trophies in this regard.&lt;ref name=harold&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold Schechter|author2=David Everitt|title=The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HvZYXHdnBQC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=27 January 2011|date=4 July 2006|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-2174-7|pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*For example, groups such as the [[Scythians]] collected the skulls of the vanquished to make a [[skull cup]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*The practice continued up until the 20th century in the Balkans, and occurred on a smaller scale during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]]. About 60% of the bodies of Japanese soldiers recovered in the [[Mariana Islands]] and returned to Japan lacked skulls.&lt;ref name="Quigley2005"/&gt;

In North America, it was common practice before, during or after the [[lynching]] of African-Americans for those involved to take souvenirs such as body parts, skin, bones, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=[[Equal Justice Initiative]]|title=Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror|year=2017|location=Montgomery, Alabama|url=https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|page=14|edition=3rd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510151602/https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|archive-date=2018-05-10|quote=Public spectacle lynchings were those in which large crowds of white people, often numbering in the thousands, gathered to witness pre-planned, heinous killings that featured prolonged torture, mutilation, dismemberment, and/or burning of the victim.

It occurred at Doddsville, recently, and these are the circumstances as related by local newspapers: Luther Holbert, a negro, had a quarrel with a white man and, following the usual Mississippi method, they exchanged shots, the negro escaping and the white man being killed. The negro, knowing the penalty for killing a white man in that section, fled, of course, accompanied by his wife, who had had no part in the quarrel. They were captured by the mob and this is what was done to them, according to the statement of an eye-witness in the Vicksburg Herald."'When the two negroes were captured they were tied to trees, and while the funeral pyres were being prepared they were forced to suffer the most fiendish tortures. The blacks were forced to hold out their hands while one finger at a time was chopped off. The fingers were distributed as souvenirs. The ears of the murderers were cut off. Holbert was severely beaten, his skull was fractured, and one of his eyes, knocked out with a stick, hung by a shred from the socket. Neither the man nor the woman begged for mercy, nor made a groan or plea. When the executioners came forward to lop off fingers, Holbert extended his hand without being asked. The most excruciating form of punishment consisted in the use of a large corkscrew in the hands of one of the mob. This instrument was bored into the flesh of the man and the woman, in the arms, legs, and body, and pulled out, the spiral tearing out big pieces of raw, quivering flesh every time it was withdrawn.'""}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8613">{{Socrates}}
"'''I know that I know nothing'''" is a saying derived from [[Plato]]'s account of the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Socrates]]. It is also called the '''Socratic paradox'''. The phrase is not one that Socrates himself is ever recorded as saying.

This saying is also connected or conflated with the [[List of oracular statements from Delphi#440 BC|answer]] to a question Socrates (according to [[Xenophon]]) or [[Chaerephon]] (according to Plato) is said to have posed to the [[Pythia]], the [[oracle of Delphi]], in which the Oracle stated something to the effect of "Socrates is the wisest."&lt;ref&gt;H. Bowden,  ''Classical Athens and the Delphic Oracle: Divination and Democracy'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SoSJLj3O3tYC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Chaerophon+asked+the+Oracle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gAw4VYOBOZXjauPTgYAK&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chaerophon%20asked%20the%20Oracle&amp;f=false p. 82].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The phrase, originally&lt;!--see talk page section: "Original Greek"--&gt; from [[Latin]] ("''{{lang|la|ipse se nihil scire id unum sciat}}''"&lt;ref&gt;"He himself thinks he knows one thing, that he knows nothing"; [[Cicero]], ''Academica'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0032%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D16 Book I, section 16].&lt;/ref&gt;), is a possible paraphrase from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text (see below). It is also quoted as "''{{lang|la|scio me nihil scire}}''" or "''{{lang|la|scio me nescire}}''".&lt;ref&gt;A variant is found in [[Nicholas of Cusa|von Kues]], ''De visione Dei'', XIII, 146 (''Werke'', Walter de Gruyter, 1967, p. 312): "''...et hoc scio solum, quia scio me nescire {{sic}}...'' [I know alone, that (''or'' because) I know, that I do not know]."&lt;/ref&gt; It was later [[Back-translation|back-translated]]&lt;!--see talk page section: "Original Greek"--&gt; to [[Katharevousa Greek]] as "{{lang|grc|[ἓν οἶδα ὅτι] οὐδὲν οἶδα}}", [''èn oîda óti''] ''oudèn oîda'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translatum.gr/forum/index.php?topic=918.0 Translatum: The Greek Translation Vortal – Topic: All I know is that I know nothing]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Plato ==
The saying, though widely attributed to Plato's Socrates in both ancient and modern times, actually occurs nowhere in Plato's works in this form.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, "Does Socrates Claim to Know that He Knows Nothing?", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' vol. 35 (2008), pp. 49–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two prominent Plato scholars have recently argued that the claim should not be attributed to Plato's Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;Fine argues that "it is better not to attribute it to him" ("Does Socrates Claim to Know that He Knows Nothing?", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' vol. 35 (2008), p. 51). C. C. W. Taylor has argued that the "paradoxical formulation is a clear misreading of Plato" (''Socrates'', Oxford University Press 1998, p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that Socrates does not actually claim to know nothing can be found at ''Apology'' 29b-c, where he claims twice to know something. See also ''Apology'' 29d, where Socrates indicates that he is so confident in his claim to knowledge at 29b-c that he is willing to die for it.

In ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Plato relates that Socrates accounts for his seeming wiser than any other person because he does not imagine that he knows what he does not know.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Plato, ''Apology'' 21d.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|[…] ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.}}
&lt;br&gt;[…] I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The context in which this passage occurs should be considered; Socrates having gone to a "wise" man, and having discussed with him, withdraws and thinks the above to himself. Socrates, since he denied any kind of knowledge, then tried to find someone wiser than himself among politicians, poets, and craftsmen. It appeared that politicians claimed wisdom without knowledge; poets could touch people with their words, but did not know their meaning; and craftsmen could claim knowledge only in specific and narrow fields. The interpretation of the Oracle's answer might be Socrates' awareness of his own ignorance.&lt;ref name="PlatoKaplan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Morris Kaplan|title=The Socratic Dialogues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSous9E-3CwC&amp;pg=PR9|date=2009|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|isbn=978-1-4277-9953-1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates also deals with this phrase in Plato's dialogue ''[[Meno]]'' when he says:&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'' 80d1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|καὶ νῦν περὶ ἀρετῆς ὃ ἔστιν ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ οἶδα, σὺ μέντοι ἴσως πρότερον μὲν ᾔδησθα πρὶν ἐμοῦ ἅψασθαι, νῦν μέντοι ὅμοιος εἶ οὐκ εἰδότι.}}
&lt;br&gt;[So now I do not know what virtue is; perhaps you knew before you contacted me, but now you are certainly like one who does not know.] (trans. [[George Grube|G. M. A. Grube]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Socrates aims at the change of Meno's opinion, who was a firm believer in his own opinion and whose claim to knowledge Socrates had disproved.

It is essentially the question that begins "[[Pre-Socratic|post-Socratic]]" Western philosophy. Socrates begins all wisdom with wondering, thus one must begin with admitting one's ignorance. After all, Socrates' dialectic method of teaching was based on that he as a teacher knew nothing, so he would derive knowledge from his students by dialogue.

There is also a passage by [[Diogenes Laertius]] in his work ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' where he lists, among the things that Socrates used to say:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius II.32.&lt;/ref&gt; "{{lang|grc|εἰδέναι μὲν μηδὲν πλὴν αὐτὸ τοῦτο εἰδέναι}}", or "that he knew nothing except that he knew that very fact (i.e. that he knew nothing)".

Again, closer to the quote, there is a passage in Plato's ''Apology'', where Socrates says that after discussing with someone he started thinking that:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|τούτου μὲν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐγὼ σοφώτερός εἰμι· κινδυνεύει μὲν γὰρ ἡμῶν οὐδέτερος οὐδὲν καλὸν κἀγαθὸν εἰδέναι, ἀλλ᾽ οὗτος μὲν οἴεταί τι εἰδέναι οὐκ εἰδώς, ἐγὼ δέ, ὥσπερ οὖν οὐκ οἶδα, οὐδὲ οἴομαι· ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Alternative usage ==
"Socratic paradox" may also refer to statements of Socrates that seem contrary to common sense, such as that "no one desires evil"&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Irwin]], ''The Development of Ethics'', vol. 1, Oxford University Press 2007, p. 14; Gerasimos Santas, "The Socratic Paradoxes", ''Philosophical Review'' 73 (1964), pp. 147–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Socrates#Socratic paradoxes|Socratic paradoxes]]).

[[File:Rajagopal speaking to 25,000 people, Janadesh 2007, India.jpg|thumb|400px|Rajagopal speaking to 25,000 people.]]
'''Janadesh''' is the name of a national campaign on land rights in [[India]] launched by the movement [[Ekta Parishad]]. The [[word]] "Janadesh" means "The Verdict of the People" in [[Hindi]]. The campaign was launched in 2005 and culminated in 2007, in the form of a 350&amp;nbsp;km foot march involving 25,000 people. According to the organizers, the majority of the marchers were landless [[Adivasi]] and [[Dalit]].

According to Ekta Parishad the lack of secure land rights is a major contributor to rural poverty in India, and the government of India needs to undertake major [[land reform]]s to address this issue. The aim of the Janadesh campaign is to put pressure on the Indian government to undertake specific land reforms aimed at securing land rights for the poorest groups in India.

==Rural poverty in India==
According to a recent [[World Bank]] report [[poverty]] remains a significant problem in India, with India’s progress in reducing poverty compared with some of its Asian neighbors described as ‘modest’. According to the same report, poverty in India is most widespread in [[rural]] areas (where almost three out of four Indians live), and the highest incidence of poverty of all is found among the rural landless, 68% of whom are classed as living below the poverty line.
These findings are echoed in other reports on the subject. For example, Sundaram and Tendulkar found in a 2003 study of poverty in India that the highest levels of poverty were found among assetless (i.e. landless) rural households dependent on agricultural wage labor. Levels of poverty were found to be even higher among members of this group if they also belonged to either a [[Scheduled Tribe]] or [[Scheduled Caste]].
Furthermore, although at an overall percentage level rural poverty is decreasing in India, due to population growth the absolute number of people in rural areas below the poverty line is not decreasing.

Obviously there are differing viewpoints on what measures would be most effective to alleviate poverty among these groups. According to Ekta Parishad, the single most important measure that could be taken to reduce these levels of poverty would be to grant secure land rights to small pieces of land to landless peasants, reducing their dependence on casual wage labor and providing a measure of [[food security]].

These views are supported by research in the area. For example, Hanstad, Brown, and Prosterman suggest based on research in [[Karnataka]] and [[West Bengal]] that providing amply-sized plots of land (these can be as small as 0.05-0.15 acres in size) gives substantial benefits to landless families at relatively low costs. These benefits include increased income, increased access to credit, and increased social status. They also note that based on the land costs in their Karnataka study, the cost of a program to distribute packages of land like this to the ten million poorest families in India would be approximately 3,330 million rupees spread over ten years. By contrast, the central government’s rural housing scheme has cost 15,360 million rupees per year over the past five years, whilst producing housing viewed as being of very low quality by the participants in this study. Hanstad, Brown and Prosterman also cite numerous other studies from around the world which have shown results similar to their own.

==Current state of land reform in India==
In Ekta Parishad's experience of campaigning across eight states in India they found that even having a land entitlement did not necessarily equate to possessing land. In fact they found that in around 50% of cases having a land entitlement had not led to possession of the land itself.

There are a number factors involved in creating this situation.

Firstly, land records, which provide the basis for land ownership, are out of date in India. The [[Indian government]] is currently working to computerize land records to improve efficiency. However, a recent report by the [[Asian Development Bank]] pointed out that, more than computerizing records, correcting them should be the priority. They note that: "It is a common observation in villages that the person in whose name land is recorded is either deceased or does not possess the land".

Secondly, according to a recent discussion paper produced by PACS, even if land records are up to date, they do not ensure security of possession. If the poor are dispossessed of their land the record of their possession itself is of little use – instead they have to go to court to establish their title. The process for establishing title is such that a wealthy opponent is able to prolong the process for years through higher courts of appeal, which the poor can ill afford. Thus the land record system is fundamentally anti-poor, and provides little protection against land grabs by wealthier land-owners. These land grabs take a variety of forms, from simple violent expulsion through to bribery of government or bank officials. It is often more than a simple question of the economic value of the land. R Srivastava argues that the landed are often not in favor of giving land to the landless since it increases their autonomy and ability to demand better wages. He also notes the wealthy landed often have substantial influence over politician and administrators at the state level.

Finally, the national government has reserved for itself substantial powers of land acquisition through the ‘Land Acquisition Act’ of 1984. This permits the central government to acquire any area of land that it chooses if is in the ‘public interest’ to do so. However, the term ‘public interest’ is left undefined in this legislation, giving the government exceptionally broad powers to acquire land as and when it chooses.

Taken all together, these factors combine to create a system of land ownership which provides little security for the rural poor.

==Objectives of Janadesh 2007==
Based on this view of current land legislation Ekta Parishad argue that it is only through legislative action at a national level that lasting change can be achieved. Although campaigns at state level have resulted in a number of successes in terms of distributing land to the landless, there need to be major changes at the national level to create a system of land rights that protects the rights of the poor and ensures that they can actually benefit from their land.

The Janadesh campaign is seen as a means of connecting the numerous local campaigns which they are involved in into a single national campaign large enough to pressure the government into taking action.

The Janadesh 2007 campaign will culminate with a foot march by 25,000 people, mainly landless Adivasis and Dalits. The route of the march will be from [[Gwalior]] to [[Delhi]] in northern India, following the main highway (a distance of approximately 350&amp;nbsp;km). The march will set out from Gwalior on 2 October 2007 and will arrive in Delhi on 28 October 2007. This will be an act of mass non-violent civil disobedience in the tradition of [[Gandhi]]. According to Ekta Parishad, it will be the largest such action since the struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]].

The campaign has three specific demands around land reform. These are:

* Establishment of a National Land Authority to provide a clear statement of land utilization in India, identify the lands available for redistribution and strengthen pro-poor laws
* Establishment of fast track courts to settle past and future conflicts related to land
* Establishment of a single window system so that farmers can resolve easily and freely the land issues, without wasting time, money and energy

==Ekta Parishad==
The Janadesh 2007 campaign is being organized by Ekta Parishad, an organization that was formally established in 1990. According to its founder, [[P V Rajagopal|Puthan Veetil Rajagopal]], Ekta Parishad is not an NGO or a political party. It is instead a people’s movement, which works at the grass-roots level to mobilize people to challenge corruption and exploitation.
Quoted in the book "Truth Force" Rajagopal states this aim: "What I am trying to do, through Ekta Parishad, is to help people to understand that they can be leaders of the country". Ekta Parishad are particularly focused on land and livelihood issues amongst marginalized communities (such as Dalits and Adivasis) in rural India and are active in eight Indian states ([[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and in direct contact with around 4000 villages.

There are two main components to Ekta Parishad’s work – the struggle component and constructive work.

The struggle component involves mobilizing people to take part in various forms of non-violent resistance such as Padyatras (foot marches), Dharnas (sit-ins), Gheraos (preventing unjust incidents from taking place by encircling people who wield power), and Chakka jam (road blockades) to press for their land rights. This is based on the Gandhian tradition of non-violent resistance.

The constructive work focuses on running economic and development activities alongside the land rights struggle, with the intention of allowing villages that have gained land to become economically self-sufficient. These activities include:
* Providing spaces for the sale of village produce (e.g. handicrafts, [[khadi]], honey, rice, oil) in urban centers;
* Promoting agricultural development through [[organic farming]] methods and cultivation of herbal plants for medicinal purposes;
* Development of irrigation schemes, and small-scale economic programs like running shops, grain banks, fishery, poultry and goat rearing.

In [[science fiction]], a '''Jovian''' is an inhabitant of the planet [[Jupiter]].

==Jovians in literature==
* In [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]] (1928&amp;ndash;...), Jupiter was the one-time home of the [[flying polyp]]s.
* ''The Conquest of Two Worlds'' (1932) by [[Edmond Hamilton]]. Humans explore the solar system and discover intelligent life on Mars and Jupiter, and proceed to ruthlessly conquer and subjugate it. Jupiter is a humid jungle world with high gravity. The natives are friendly, hairless beings with thick hands and legs ending in flippers, small heads and large dark eyes.
* In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story ''[[Victory Unintentional]]'' (1942), human colonists on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] send robots to Jupiter to contact the Jovians, who are planning a war with the humans.
* In [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''Three Worlds to Conquer'', sympathetic [[Centaur]]-like Jovians are in danger of extinction by cruel invaders from another region of the planet. At the same time their friends, the human colonists of [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], are threatened by a powerful space warship commanded by a dictatorial militarist. Eventually, the two groups find ingenious ways to help each other defeat their respective enemies.
* In ''[[Skeleton Men of Jupiter]]'' (1943), the eleventh and last ''[[Barsoom]]'' book by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the hero [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] is kidnapped and taken to Jupiter (also called "Sasoom" in the Barsoom franchise) by its inhabitants called the Morgors (also called "Skeleton Men" because they look like walking human skeletons). Jupiter is described as a harsh world warmed only by volcanoes, with forests of sentient trees.
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[A Meeting with Medusa]]'' (1972) proposes giant mile sized medusa-like creatures living in Jupiter's atmosphere.
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' (1982) depicts city-sized, [[cloud]]-like creatures, [[squid]]-like animals, and creatures resembling terrestrial [[aircraft]].
* [[Ben Bova]]'s novel ''[[Jupiter (novel)|Jupiter]]'' (2001) also features massive whale-like creatures kilometers long living in the liquid stage of Jupiter's atmosphere and are pictured as being [[Extraterrestrial life|intelligent]].
* In the [[Larklight Trilogy]] by [[Philip Reeve]], Jupiter's moons are inhabited by a variety of races. The planet itself has sentient storms the largest of which, Old Thunderhead, is worshipped as a God.  The planet also possesses floating creatures that resemble animals in Earth's oceans.
* ''The Gobsmacking Galaxy'', an entry in the children's non-fiction series ''The Knowledge'' written by [[Kjartan Poskitt]], humorously describes hypothetical alien life forms which might evolve on planets in the solar system; the Jovian is portrayed as a creature comparable to a massive [[hot air balloon]] which has learned to subsist on the radiation in Jupiter's atmosphere.

==In comics==
* In the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book series ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', [[Charlie-27]] is from Jupiter and, being genetically engineered to survive in Jupiter's high gravity, which according to this is 11 times stronger than that of Earth, is stronger and tougher than a normal human. He is the last Jovian; all the others were wiped out by the [[Badoon]] invasion in the [[31st century]].
* In Indian cartoonist ''[[Pran Kumar Sharma|Pran]]'s'' [[Chacha Chaudhary]] series, one of the main characters [[Sabu (comics)|Sabu]] is a Jupiter native, but lives on earth with his best pal Chacha Chaudhary. Whenever Sabu is angry, it causes a volcanic eruption on the surface of Jupiter.
* In the original timeline of the [[Gundam]] metaverse, space colonies were established near Jupiter in order to harvest the planet's helium 3 as a power source. Generations later, the colonists rebelled against Earth, forming a "Jupiter Empire". All members referred to themselves as Jovians, and a select few even provoked their opponents by claiming that they were like sci-fi aliens, having been born apart from the human race on earth. The events of this war against the Jovians are depicted in the manga ''[[Crossbone Gundam]]''.
* In ''All-Star Comics'' #13, [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] finds Jupiter to be inhabited by flying people. By creating a giant cosmic rod, Starman helps them send dangerous matter from the [[Great Red Spot]] into space, and is rewarded by being given the means to make metal invisible.
* In ''[[Marvel Family]]'' #36, the Marvels go to Jupiter, which according to this story has gravity 300 times stronger than Earth (it actually has gravity nearly 2.3 times stronger), meaning they are much shorter than humans. They are an advanced and peaceful race, capable of interplanetary travel, and their scientific equipment helps the Marvels discover the nature of the Invaders from Infinity, which resemble giant fireballs, (see [[List of Captain Marvel (DC Comics) enemies]]). The Jovians are forced to evacuate after their fleet is defeated by the Invaders, but after the Invaders are contained and destroyed they get back to Jupiter, and tell the Marvels they will be their friends.
* As a boy, [[Superman|Clark Kent]] meets an eight-armed inhabitant of Jupiter publicly promoting an "Interplanetary Circus" (''Adventure Comics'' #198, Mar 1954: "The Super-Carnival from Space").

==In animated film and television==
* The plot of the [[anime]] ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' (1996) revolves around a mysterious invasion force based on Jupiter, named the "Jovian Lizards", or simply the "Jovians", and the attempts of Earth's forces, and specifically the ship ''Nadesico'', to subdue this invasion.
* In the [[Looney Tunes]] short ''[[Jumpin' Jupiter]]'' (1955), Porky and Sylvester's desert campground is sliced away and towed into outer space by a green, bird-like Jovian searching for earthly animal life. But Porky remains blissfully unaware, leaving Sylvester to be terrorized by the alien. In another episode this bird creature appears to be from Mars.
* In ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'', specifically ''[[Victory Gundam]]'' and ''[[Crossbone Gundam]]'', the main enemies are from Jupiter and are known as the ''Jovian Fleet''.

==In video games==
* The character Xûr from [[Destiny (video game)|''Destiny'']] (2014) is a Jovian, but not necessarily from Jupiter. The game classifies Jovians as a race of transformed humans that live in the darkness beyond "The Reef".

==In philosophy==
* The Danish physicist and philosopher [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discussed the scientific, moral, and aesthetic convictions of the inhabitants of Jupiter in a [[thought experiment]] in the essay "All Existence a Dominion of Reason" of 1846.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ørsted|first=Hans Christian|title=The soul in nature: with supplementary contributions (p. 91-133) |publisher=Henry G. Bohn, London|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Du0AAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+soul+in+nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piketty top decile share national income en.png|thumb|319x319px|A measure of income inequality: top decile share in the US national income, 1910-2010.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Table TI.1 of the [http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/capital21c2 supplement] to Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Piketty|Piketty]] argues that Kuznets mistook the 1930-1950 decrease in inequality for the endpoint of its development. Since 1950, inequality has again reached pre-WW II levels. Similar trends are visible in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capital in the Twenty-First Century|last=Piketty|first=Thomas|publisher=Belknap|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[economics]], a '''Kuznets curve''' graphs the hypothesis that as an economy [[economic development|develops]], [[market forces]] first increase and then decrease [[economic inequality]]. The hypothesis was first advanced by  economist [[Simon Kuznets]] in the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/kuznets.htm Kuznets profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918075800/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/kuznets.htm |date=18 September 2009 }} at [[New School for Social Research]]: "...his discovery of the inverted U-shaped relation between income inequality and economic growth..."&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation of such a progression suggests that early in [[economic development|development]], investment opportunities for those who have money multiply, while an influx of cheap rural labor to the cities holds down wages.  Whereas in mature economies, [[human capital]] accrual (an estimate of cost that has been incurred but not yet paid) takes the place of physical capital accrual as the main source of growth; and inequality slows growth by lowering education levels because poorer, disadvantaged people lack finance for their education in imperfect credit-markets.

The Kuznets curve implies that as a [[nation]] undergoes [[industrialization]] – and especially the mechanization of agriculture – the center of the nation’s economy will shift to the cities. As [[internal migration]] by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase. Inequality is then expected to decrease when a certain level of average income is reached and the processes of industrialization – democratization and the rise of the welfare state – allow for the benefits from rapid [[Economic growth|growth]], and increase the per-capita income. Kuznets believed that inequality would follow an inverted “U” shape as it rises and then falls again with the increase of income per-capita.&lt;ref name="Galbraith 587–607"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=James|title=Global inequality and global macroeconomics|journal=Journal of Policy Modeling|date=2007|volume=29|issue=4|pages=587–607|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893807000452|accessdate=2 February 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jpolmod.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuznets curve diagrams show an inverted U curve, although variables along the axes are often mixed and matched, with inequality or the [[Gini coefficient]] on the Y axis and economic development, time or per-capita incomes on the X axis. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Since 1991 the '''environmental Kuznets curve''' ('''EKC''') has become a standard feature in the technical literature of [[environmental policy]],&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"/&gt; though its application there has been strongly contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Roberts, J.T.  |author2=Thanos, N.D. | title = Trouble in Paradise: Globalization and Environmental Crises in Latin America | page = xiv | year = 2003 | publisher = Routledge: London &amp; New York
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kuznets ratio==
The '''Kuznets ratio''' is a measurement of the ratio of income going to the highest-earning households (usually defined by the upper 20%) and the income going to the lowest-earning households,&lt;ref name="Kuznets, Simon 1955"&gt;Kuznets, Simon. 1955. Economic Growth and Income Inequality. ''American Economic Review'' 45 (March): 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly measured by either the lowest 20% or lowest 40% of income. Comparing 20% to 20%, perfect equality is expressed as 1; 20% to 40% changes this value to 0.5.

Kuznets had two similar explanations for this historical phenomenon:

==Criticisms==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Economics --&gt;

Critics of the Kuznets curve theory argue that its U-shape comes not from progression in the development of individual countries, but rather from historical differences between countries. For instance, many of the middle income countries used in Kuznets' data set were in Latin America, a region with historically high levels of inequality. When controlling for this variable, the U-shape of the curve tends to disappear (e.g. Deininger and Squire, 1998). Regarding the empirical evidence, based on large panels of countries or time series approaches, Fields (2001) considers the Kuznets hypothesis refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fields G |year=2001 |title=Distribution and Development, A New Look at the Developing World |publisher=Russel Sage Foundation, New York, and The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Asian miracle''' has been used to criticize the validity of the Kuznets curve theory. The rapid economic growth of eight East Asian countries—Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore ([[Four Asian Tigers]]), Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia—between 1965 and 1990, was called the East Asian miracle (EAM). Manufacturing and export grew quickly and powerfully. Yet simultaneously, life expectancy was found to increase and population levels living in absolute poverty decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=(course lectures)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development process was contrary to the Kuznets curve theory. Many studies have been done to identify how the EAM was able to ensure that the benefits of rapid economic growth were distributed broadly among the population, because Kuznets’ theory stated that rapid capital accumulation would lead to an initial increase in inequality.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1996 151–177"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|title=Some Lessons From The East Asian Miracle|journal=The World Bank Research Observer|date=August 1996|volume=11|issue=2|pages=151–177|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.2.151|url=http://wbro.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/151.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues the East Asian experience of an intensive and successful economic development process along with an immediate decrease in population inequality can be explained by the immediate re-investment of initial benefits into land reform (increasing rural productivity, income, and savings), universal education (providing greater equality and what Stiglitz calls an “intellectual infrastructure” for productivity&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1996 151–177"/&gt; ), and industrial policies that distributed income more equally through high and increasing wages and limited the price increases of commodities. These factors increased the average citizen’s ability to consume and invest within the economy, further contributing to economic growth. Stiglitz highlights that the high rates of growth provided the resources to promote equality, which acted as a positive-feedback loop to support the high rates of growth. The EAM defies the Kuznets curve, which insists growth produces inequality, and that inequality is a necessity for overall growth.&lt;ref name="Galbraith 587–607"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stiglitz 1996 151–177"/&gt;

[[Cambridge University]] Lecturer Gabriel Palma recently found no evidence for a ‘Kuznets curve’ in inequality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he statistical evidence for the ‘upwards’ side of the 'Inverted-U' between inequality and income per capita seems to have vanished, as many low and low-middle income countries now have a distribution of income similar to that of most middle-income countries (other than those of Latin America and Southern Africa). That is, half of Sub-Saharan Africa and many countries in Asian, including India, China and Vietnam, now have an income distribution similar to that found in North Africa, the Caribbean and the second-tier NICs. And this level is also similar to that of half of the first-tier NICs, the Mediterranean EU and the Anglophone OECD (excluding the US). As a result, about 80% of the world population now live in countries with a Gini around 40."&lt;ref name=Palma&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/p/cam/camdae/1111.html Palma, Gabriel. "Homogeneous middles vs. heterogeneous tails, and the end of the ‘Inverted-U’: the share of the rich is what it's all about."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Palma goes on to note that, among middle-income countries, only those in Latin America and Southern Africa live in an inequality league of their own. Instead of a Kuznets curve, he breaks income inequality into deciles which contain 10% of the population relating to income inequality. Palma then shows that there are two distributional trends taking place in inequality within a country:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One is ‘centrifugal’, and takes place at the two tails of the distribution—leading to an increased diversity across country in the shares appropriated by the top 10 percent and bottom forty percent. The other is ‘centripetal’, and takes place in the middle—leading to a remarkable uniformity across countries in the share of income going to the half of the population located between deciles 5 to 9."&lt;ref name=Palma /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, it is the share of the richest 10% of the population that affects the share of the poorest 40% of the population with the middle to upper-middle staying the same across all countries.

==Kuznets' own caveats==
In a biography about Simon Kuznets' scientific methods, economist [[Robert Fogel]] noted Kuznets' own reservations about the "fragility of the data" which underpinned the hypothesis. Fogel notes that most of Kuznets' paper was devoted to explicating the conflicting factors at play. Fogel emphasized Kuznets' opinion that "even if the data turned out to be valid, they pertained to an extremely limited period of time and to exceptional historical experiences." Fogel noted that despite these "repeated warnings", Kuznets' caveats were overlooked, and the Kuznets curve was "raised to the level of law" by other economists.&lt;ref name=Fogel-1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogel|first1=Robert W.|title=Some Notes on the Scientific Methods of Simon Kuznets|date=December 1987|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|pages=26–7|doi=10.3386/w2461|ref=Fogel-1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inequality and trade liberalization ==
Dobson and Ramlogan’s research looked to identify the relationship between inequality and trade liberalization. There have been mixed findings with this idea – some developing countries have experienced greater inequality, less inequality, or no difference at all, due to trade liberalization. Because of this, Dobson and Ramlogan suggest that perhaps trade openness can be related to inequality through a Kuznets curve framework.&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobson|first=Stephen|author2=Carlyn Ramlogan |title=Is There An Openness Kuznets Curve?|journal=Kyklos|date=April 2009|volume=62|issue=2|pages=226–238|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00433.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A trade liberalization-versus-inequality graph measures trade openness along the x-axis and inequality along the y-axis. Dobson and Ramlogan determine trade openness by the ratio of exports and imports (the total trade) and the average tariff rate; inequality is determined by gross primary school enrolment rates, the share of agriculture in total output, the rate of inflation, and cumulative privatization.&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"/&gt; By studying data from several Latin American countries that have implemented trade liberalization policies in the past 30 years, the Kuznets curve seems to apply to the relationship between trade liberalization and inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient).&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"/&gt; However, many of these nations saw a shift from low-skill labour production to natural resource intensive activities. This shift would not benefit low-skill workers as much. So although their evidence seems to support the Kuznets theory in relation to trade liberalization, Dobson and Ramlogan assert that policies for redistribution must be simultaneously implemented in order to mitigate the initial increase in inequality.&lt;ref name="Dobson 2009 226–238"/&gt;

== Environmental Kuznets curve ==
[[File:Environmental_Kuznets_Curve.png|thumb|Hypothetical environmental Kuznets curve: a translation of the Kuznets curve to the use of natural resources.|alt=]]
The environmental Kuznets curve is a hypothesized relationship between environmental quality and economic development: various indicators of environmental degradation tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point over the course of development.&lt;ref&gt;Shafik, Nemat. 1994. Economic development and environmental quality: an econometric analysis. ''Oxford Economic Papers'' 46 (October): 757–773&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Gene Grossman|Grossman]]|first=G. M. |first2=A. B. |last2=[[Alan B. Krueger|Krueger]]   |title= Environmental impacts of a North American Free Trade Agreement |journal= National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 3914, NBER |location=Cambridge MA. |volume= |issue= |year=1991 |pages= |doi=10.3386/w3914}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EKC suggests, in sum, that "the solution to pollution is economic growth." 

Although the subject of continuing debate, there is considerable evidence to support the application of environmental Kuznets curve for various environmental health indicators, such as [[Water pollution|water]] and air pollution, which show the inverted U-shaped curve as per capita income and/or GDP rise .&lt;ref name=RIG&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/the-richer-is-greener-curve/ |title=The Richer-Is-Greener Curve |author=[[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]] |work=New York Times |date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=As has been noted, this is a very controversial topic.

For example, between 1970 and 2006, the United States' inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 195%, the number of cars and trucks in the country more than doubled, and the total number of miles driven increased by 178%. However, during that same period certain regulatory changes and technological innovations led to decreases in annual emissions of carbon monoxide from 197 million tons to 89 million, nitrogen oxides emissions from 27 million tons to 19 million, sulfur dioxide emissions from 31 million tons to 15 million, particulate emissions by 80%, and lead emissions by more than 98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pdupont/?id=110008416 |title=Don't Be Very Worried |publisher=The Wall St. Journal |date=23 May 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615222424/http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pdupont/?id=110008416 |archivedate=15 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deforestation]] may follow a Kuznets curve (cf. [[forest transition]] curve). Among countries with a per capita GDP of at least $4,600, net deforestation has ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/103/46/17574.short Returning forests analyzed with the forest identity], 2006, by Pekka E.

===Criticisms===
However, the applicability of the EKC is debatable when it comes to other pollutants, some natural resource use, and biodiversity conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mills JH, Waite TA |year=2009 |title=Economic prosperity, biodiversity conservation, and the environmental Kuznets curve |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=2087–2095 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, energy, land and resource use (sometimes called the "[[ecological footprint]]") may not fall with rising income.&lt;ref name="US Energy Consumption 1960-2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Public Data US Energy|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=djha77o4u941j_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=consumption&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=state&amp;ifdim=state&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=-285267600000&amp;tend=1261033200000|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ratio of energy ''per [[real GDP]]'' has fallen, ''total'' energy use is still rising in most developed countries as are ''total'' emission of many [[greenhouse gases]]. Additionally, the status of many key "[[ecosystem services]]" provided by ecosystems, such as freshwater provision (Perman, ''et al''., 2003), soil fertility,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and fisheries,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} have continued to decline in developed countries. Proponents of the EKC argue that this varied relationship does not necessarily invalidate the hypothesis, but instead that the applicability of the Kuznets curves to various environmental indicators may differ when considering different ecosystems, economics, regulatory schemes, and technologies.

At least one critic argues that the US is still struggling to attain the income level necessary to prioritize certain environmental pollutants such as carbon emissions, which have yet to follow the EKC.&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Yandle B, Vijayaraghavan M, Bhattarai M |url=http://www.perc.org/articles/article688.php |title=The Environmental Kuznets Curve: A Primer |year=2002 |publisher=The Property and Environment Research Center |accessdate=16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yandle ''et al.'' argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a [[tragedy of the commons]] where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"/&gt; However, there seems to be little consensus about whether EKC is formed with regard to CO2 emissions, as CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; is a global pollutant that has yet to prove its validity within Kuznet's Curve.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-4-431-55921-4|title=Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis and Carbon Dioxide Emissions - Springer|last=Uchiyama|first=Katsuhisa|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55921-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, Yandle ''et al.'' also concluded that "policies that stimulate growth ([[trade liberalization]], [[economic restructuring]], and [[price reform]]) should be good for the environment".&lt;ref name="Yandle2002"/&gt;

Other critics points out that researchers also disagree about the shape of the curve when longer-term time scales are evaluated. For example, Millimet and Stengos regard the traditional "inverse U" shape as actually being an "N" shape, indicating that pollution increases as a country develops, decreases once the threshold GDP is reached, and then begins increasing as national income continues to increase.  While such findings are still being debated, it could prove to be important because it poses the concerning question of whether pollution actually begins to decline for good when an economic threshold is reached or whether the decrease is only in local pollutants and pollution is simply exported to poorer developing countries.  Levinson concludes that the environmental Kuznets curve is insufficient to support a pollution policy regardless whether it is [[laissez-faire]] or [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]], although the literature has been used this way by the press.&lt;ref name="Levinson2000"&gt;{{cite web |author=Arik Levinson |citeseerx = 10.1.1.92.2062 |title=The Ups and Downs of the Environmental Kuznets Curve |year=2000 |accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=[[Georgetown University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrow ''et al.'' argue pollution-income progression of agrarian communities (clean) to industrial economies (pollution intensive) to service economies (cleaner) would appear to be false if pollution increases again at the end due to higher levels of income and consumption of the population at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Arrow K, Bolin B, Costanza R, Dasgupta P, Folke C, Holling CS, etal |year=1995 |title=Economic growth, carrying capacity, and the environment |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=91–95 |doi=10.1016/0921-8009(95)00059-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty with this model is that it lacks predictive power because it is highly uncertain how the next phase of economic development will be characterized. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Suri and Chapman argue that the EKC is not applicable on the global scale, as a net pollution reduction may not actually be occurring globally. Wealthy nations have a trend of exporting the activities that create the most pollution, like manufacturing of clothing and furniture, to poorer nations that are still in the process of industrial development (Suri and Chapman, 1998). This could mean that as the world's poor nations develop, they will have nowhere to export their pollution. Thus, this progression of environmental clean-up occurring in conjunction with economic growth cannot be replicated indefinitely because there may be nowhere to export waste and pollution-intensive processes. However, [[Gene Grossman]] and [[Alan B. Krueger]], the authors who initially made the correlation between economic growth, environmental clean-up, and the Kuznets curve, conclude that there is "no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth."&lt;ref name="Levinson2000"/&gt; 

Stern warns "it is very easy to do bad [[econometrics]]", and says "the history of the EKC exemplifies what can go wrong". He finds that "little or no attention has been paid to the statistical properties of the data used such as serial dependence or stochastic trends in time series and few tests of model adequacy have been carried out or presented. However, one of the main purposes of doing econometrics is to test which [[Correlation does not imply causation|apparent relationships]] ... are valid and which are spurious [[correlation]]s". He states his unequivocal finding: "When we do take such statistics into account and use appropriate techniques we find that the EKC does not exist (Perman and Stern 2003). Instead, we get a more realistic view of the effect of economic growth and technological changes on environmental quality. It seems that most indicators of environmental degradation are monotonically rising in income though the '[[income elasticity]]' is less than one and is not a simple function of income alone. Time related effects reduce environmental impacts in countries at all levels of income. However, in rapidly growing middle income countries the scale effect, which increases pollution and other degradation, overwhelms the time effect. In wealthy countries, growth is slower, and pollution reduction efforts can overcome the scale effect. This is the origin of the apparent EKC effect".&lt;ref name = "Stern 2003"&gt;{{cite web |author=David I. Stern |title=The Environmental Kuznets Curve |publisher=International Society for Ecological Economics Internet Encyclopedia of Ecological Economics |url=http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/stern.pdf |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recommendation algorithm and the "Netflix Prize" ==
{{Main|Netflix Prize}}
In 2006, Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system, known as Cinematch, by at least 10%.

The winning team, called BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, used [[machine learning]] techniques to find that, for example, the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw. The mood of the day made a difference also; for example, Friday ratings were different from Monday morning ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/ |title=BelKor Home Page |publisher=AT&amp;T Labs, Inc. – Research |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company's recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns: under the terms of the competition, contestants were given access to customer rental data, which the company had purportedly anonymized. However, it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could, in fact, identify a user personally. Netflix was sued by KamberLaw L.L.C. and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the FTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html | title=Netflix Cancels Contest After Concerns Are Raised About Privacy | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=March 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Throttling of DVDs by mail ==
Netflix's DVD allocation policy – referred to by many as "[[DVD-by-mail#"Throttling"|throttling]]" – gives priority shipping and selection to customers who rent fewer discs per month. Higher volume renters may see some of their selections delayed, routed elsewhere, or sent out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215072830/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2006 |first=Michael |last=Liedtke |title='Throttling' angers Netflix heavy renters |agency=Associated Press (Internet Archive) |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=February 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix claims that "the large majority of our subscribers are able to receive their movies in about one business day following our shipment of the requested movie from their local distribution center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse#how|title=Terms of Use|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=January 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all shipments come from the subscriber's local distribution center, and shipments from distant centers are often delayed, as well.

In September 2004, a consumer [[class action lawsuit]], ''Frank Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 Class action suit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205730/http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was brought against Netflix in [[San Francisco Superior Court]]. The suit alleged [[false advertising]] in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery." In January 2005, Netflix changed its [[terms of use]] to acknowledge "throttling" (Mike Kaltschnee, owner of the Hacking Netflix blog, says Netflix calls this practice "smoothing" internally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2005/09/blockbuster_thr.html|title=Blockbuster Throttling|publisher=Hacking Netflix|accessdate=December 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with [[negative option billing|customers being charged accordingly]] unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Trial Lawyers for Public Justice|title=Court Urged To Strike Down Proposed Netflix Class Action Settlement in Deceptive Advertising Case|url=http://www.tlpj.org/pr/netflix_class_action_010506.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms, requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month. The final settlement hearing took place on March 22, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Netflix|title=Netflix Claim Form Process|url=http://www.netflix.com/Settlement?mqso=60178549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal in the California Appellate Courts.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;[http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=1&amp;doc_id=194535 California Appellate Courts] Chavez v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The summary notice and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial ... Using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case ... The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/04/23/attorneys-in-netflix-suit-take-home-2-million-in-fees/ |title=Court Orders Netflix to Deliver $2 million in Attorneys Fees |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Slater |first=Dan |date=April 23, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal Law Blog |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/130003/solutions_for_digital_annoyances.html |title=Solutions for Digital Annoyance |author=Spring, Tom |date=March 27, 2007 |work=PC World |accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Releasing this week ===
The Netflix website at one time featured a list of titles, "Releasing This Week" (RTW), that enabled customers to easily view new DVDs the company planned for rental release each week.&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.netflix.com/AllNewReleases?lnkctr=NavAllNewReleases| title=All DVDs Releasing This Week| publisher=Netflix| accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2007, the company removed the link to the page without notice and replaced it with a slider system showing only four previously released movies at a time. The new page, called "Popular New Releases", does not list newly released DVDs for rental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2007/12/netflix-removes.html| title=Netflix Removes New Releases Page – Customers Complain |publisher=Hacking Netflix |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing of new releases is still active,&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week" /&gt; although there is no menu option that links to the page.

On January 1, 2008, a Netflix employee unofficially stated on the Netflix Community Blog that customers used the RTW page to add newly released movies to the top of their queues, then complained about delays in receiving them after demand outstripped the supply of DVDs on hand. By removing the page, Netflix sought to quell complaints that these movies were not readily available. Critics, however, have suggested this was just another Netflix attempt at throttling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Happy New Year |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2008/01/happy-new-year.html |publisher=Netflix Community Blog |accessdate=March 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamic queue, subscription, and delivery methods ==
On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a [[patent infringement]] lawsuit in which it demanded a [[jury trial]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], alleging that Blockbuster's [[online DVD rental]] subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first [[cause of action]] alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=7024381|y=2006|m=04|d=04|inventor=Hastings; W. Reed (Santa Cruz, CA), Randolph; Marc B.

The company had already closed 290 stores in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2007/06/25/daily54.html Blockbuster to close 282 stores this year – San Francisco Business Times]. Bizjournals.com (June 29, 2007). Retrieved on December 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2006, Blockbuster signed a deal with The Weinstein Company that gave it the exclusive rental rights to the studio's films beginning on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |title=Blockbuster, Weinsteins sign exclusive deal |work= Video Business |publisher= Reed Business Information |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070103065726/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |archivedate= January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement forced Netflix to obtain copies from mass merchants or retailers, instead of directly from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |title=How The Weinstein Company ruined Home Entertainment |author=Sciretta, Peter |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109161945/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix has speculated that the effect of the Blockbuster-Weinstein agreement could result in higher rental costs and/or fewer copies of the studio's movies, which would limit the number of each movie's DVDs that would be available to subscribers at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Annual Report |url=http://ir.netflix.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-07-42689 |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|6}}, Netflix continues to make available Weinstein movies, including ''[[Unknown (2006 film)|Unknown]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School For Scoundrels]]'' and ''[[Harsh Times]]'', among others. The [[first-sale doctrine]] allows Netflix and other video rental businesses to offer movies released by The Weinstein Company.

=== Removal of social networking feature ===
Beginning in 2004, Netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members. This feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of [[social networking]]. With this feature, users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie's page; view what DVDs their friends were renting; and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1583922/netflix-offers-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-a-redesign |title= 5 Ways Netflix Could Have Avoided an Ugly User Backlash |first= Cliff |last= Kuang |date= March 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.betanews.com/article/Netflix-axes-friends-feature-due-to-unpopularity/1268941363 |title= Netflix axes 'friends' feature due to unpopularity |first= Tim |last= Conneally |date= March 18, 2010 |publisher=Betanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, as part of a redesign of its movie-details pages, the Friends feature began to be phased out. Users could no longer see their friends' ratings on movie pages, and what remained of the friends section was moved to a small link at the bottom of each page. The initial announcement about the redesign on Netflix's official blog made no reference to any changes to the Friends feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/new-movie-details-page-rolled-out.html |title= New Movie Details Page Rolled Out |date= March 4, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of angry users posted negative comments, and the feedback prompted Netflix's Vice President of [[Product Management]], Todd Yellin, to post a follow-up statement. While apologizing for poor communication about the changes, Yellin stated that the Friends feature would continue to be phased out, citing figures that only 2% of members used the feature and the company's limited resources to maintain the service.&lt;ref name="fastcompany" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html |title= Friends Update |date= March 17, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix users also began using the movie-reviews section of the website to post comments protesting against the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/03/unhappy-netflix-customers-using-netflix-movie-reviews-to-protest-friends-feature-removal.html |title= Unhappy Netflix Customers using Netflix Movie Reviews to Protest Friends Feature Removal |date= March 14, 2010 |publisher=Hacking Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linux support ==
Netflix formerly supported online streaming only on Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS and Android, relying on Microsoft Silverlight. Partly due to digital rights management issues, despite the open-source implementation of Silverlight known as Moonlight, this has created problems for users of fully [[open-source software|open source]] versions of [[Linux]] and similar operating systems.&lt;ref name=TechRepublic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/the-netflix-linux-conjecture-how-netflix-snubs-the-linux-community/1745|title=The Netflix Linux Conjecture: How Netflix snubs the Linux community |author=Wallen, Jack |date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Google's partially proprietary Android and [[Chrome OS]] platforms are essentially based upon Linux and other free software infrastructure, Netflix did not provide any crossover support for using its proprietary components to stream any of its content upon more free systems, such as Ubuntu and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], although this changed in October 2014.

On August 9, 2011, Netflix released a Google Chrome web store item for Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Windows; however, it did not initially enable Netflix streaming on Linux machines. On Linux systems running the Chrome browser, the extension simply redirects users to view Netflix.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deceagebecbceejblnlcjooeohmmeldh?hl=en-US&amp;hc=hp&amp;hcp=new|title= Netflix – Chrome Web Store}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Netflix chose to switch from Silverlight to HTML5 playback using [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] (EME), since then, the extensions were added to Microsoft's Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1 and Apple's Safari on OS X Yosemite.&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/html5-video-in-ie-11-on-windows-81.html|title=The Netflix Tech Blog: HTML5 Video in IE 11 on Windows 8.1|work=netflix.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com" /&gt; It was implemented in Google Chrome on all platforms shortly afterward.

As of October 10, 2014 multiple versions of Linux including Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS claim support for Netflix in Google Chrome version 37 or newer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://insights.ubuntu.com/2014/10/10/watch-netflix-in-ubuntu-today/ |title=Watch Netflix in Ubuntu today |publisher=Ubuntu |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pclinuxos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pclinuxos.com/netflix-streaming-comes-to-chrome-for-pclinuxos/|title=Netflix streaming comes to PCLinuxOS » PCLinuxOS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website for PCWorld also states that users of other Linux distributions such as version 17 of [[Linux Mint]] have been successfully using Netflix via Google Chrome without any special workarounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2824623/ubuntu-linux-gets-netflix-without-weird-workarounds.html|title=Netflix comes to Linux via Ubuntu and Chrome|author=Jared Newman|date=October 10, 2014|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party solutions ===
{{As of|2011|5|9|df=US}}, Google had initially released plans for a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for the Chrome browser and Chrome OS which would allow Netflix streaming, including traditional Linux users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechromesource.com/netflix-plug-in-for-chrome-and-chrome-os-is-on-the-way/|title= Netflix Plug-in for Chrome and Chrome OS is on the way |author=West, Jullian|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Netflix increased the number of programs that are closed captioned. Almost all Netflix-ready devices in distribution today (including AppleTV, BD players, the Roku set-top box, and all the [[game console]]s, phone apps, tablet apps, and TVs) are capable of rendering captions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Blog.Netflix.com |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2012/02/update-on-captioning-for-our-members.html |date=February 2012|title=An Update on Captioning for our Members|accessdate= March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Netflix formed an experimental project to [[crowdsourcing|crowdsource]] the closed-captioning effort using the Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) platform.&lt;ref name=amara1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/netflix-amara-closed-captions-crowdsourcing/|title=Netflix experiments with crowd-sourced captioning|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=[[GigaOM]]|last=Roettgers|first=Janko}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this proved problematic in the face of claims that crowdsourced subtitles, regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations, are [[derivative work]]s which [[copyright infringement|infringe copyright]] if created or distributed without consent from the film's copyright owner.&lt;ref name=amara2&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444592404578033301429532328| title=Lost in Translation, Found in Subtitles| last=Paletta| first=Anthony| date=October 3, 2012| accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amara operates under [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] safe-harbor provisions which indemnify it from secondary copyright infringement [[lawsuit]]s over user-uploaded content, and presumably Netflix would not publish any subtitles produced by this effort without authorization. Netflix was careful to say it is not committed to using any subtitles produced by the crowdsourcing project.&lt;ref name=amara1 /&gt;

In October 2012, Netflix was found to be offering the television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' to customers in [[Finland]] with unauthorized subtitles from the [[fansub]] scene.&lt;ref name=tfOct19&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-caught-using-pirated-subtitles-in-finland-121019/|title=Netflix Caught Using "Pirated" Subtitles in Finland|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such subtitles, and motion pictures incorporating them, have long been traded online, resulting in [[cease and desist]] notices, [[notice and take down|takedowns]], and copyright infringement lawsuits against traders, website operators, and search engines; even criminal prosecution happened in one Norwegian case involving the distribution of fan-created subtitles alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/student-fined-for-running-movie-tv-show-subtitle-download-site-120608/|title=Student Fined For Running Movie &amp; TV Show Subtitle Download Site|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|author=Enigmax|publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted, Netflix apologized and promised to remove the unauthorized translations but did not explain how the content came to be offered in the first place, or whether other potentially copyright-infringing subtitles exist in the company's repertoire.&lt;ref name=tfOct19 /&gt;

On January 20, 2014, Jon Christian published an article in ''The Week'', titled "How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions", which catalogues Netflix's various technical and legal issues regarding closed captioning, including the poor quality of the subtitles that are provided. For example, he states: "But for all the service's strengths, one aspect is still decidedly twentieth century: The bizarrely low standards for Netflix's closed captions, which continue to alienate subscribers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or simply have difficulty understanding dialogue." The article was updated the following day to publish Netflix's response: "Update: The day after this article was published, a representative from Netflix contacted the author of this piece with an additional comment: 'While we don't have the rights to make edits to subs/captions we do, in fact, request redelivery of subtitles or captions when we discover errors. The titles in your piece are now under investigation.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Week|title=How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions| date=January 20, 2014| url=http://theweek.com/article/index/255618/how-netflix-alienated-and-insulted-its-deaf-subscribers |author=Christian, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' in 2015, disability rights advocates pointed out that Netflix had not yet included content with [[described video|audio descriptions]] of visual content for those who are blind or visually impaired. One critic considered it "terribly laughable PR" for Netflix to not include audio descriptions on a series that focuses on a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|character]] who himself is blind. On April 14, 2015, director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix would begin to work with studios to add audio descriptions to its original content.&lt;ref name=wp-blindsuperhero&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix makes a blind superhero accessible to blind audiences|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/04/14/netflix-makes-a-blind-superhero-accessible-to-blind-viewers/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-descriptions&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Adding Audio Description Tracks for Visually Impaired, Starting with 'Marvel's Daredevil'|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-adding-audio-description-tracks-for-visually-impaired-starting-with-marvels-daredevil-1201472372/|website=Variety|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circumvention of geoblocking ==
More than 30 million Netflix subscribers use the service via a [[proxy server]] or [[virtual private network]] (VPN); doing so can make a user appear to be located in a country other than the one they are actually in, thus allowing them to use the service to access content that Netflix [[Geo-blocking|cannot offer in their region]], due to geographical licensing restrictions. It is unclear whether accessing geo-blocked content via VPN violates local copyright laws, but content providers and other broadcasters have asserted that it is illegal because it infringes local rights to content that may have been sold to a competitor.&lt;ref name=telcoreviewnz-globalblock&gt;{{cite web|title=Global mode spat: We've got the legal paperwork|url=http://telcoreview.co.nz/story/Global-mode-spat-weve-got-the-legal-paperwork/|website=TelcoReview|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode /&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-globalmodelegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Mode "completely legal" as CallPlus dismisses industry backlash|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/572164/global-mode-completely-legal-callplus-dismisses-industry-backlash/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-riftcourt&gt;{{cite web|title=Streaming TV rift heads to court in New Zealand|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/573022/streaming-tv-rift-heads-court-new-zealand/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobalWebIndex showed about 20 million of such VPN users came from China alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/09/why-netflix-wont-block-vpn-users |title=Why Netflix won't block VPN users – it has too many of them, Part II |last=Hern |first=Alex |publisher=The Guardian|date=24 June 2015 |website=The Guardian |access-date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn /&gt; As of November 2013, Canadian Netflix offered 3,600 titles compared to the U.S. service which had more than 10,000 which results in Canadians using VPNs so they can access the larger U.S. content selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/13/netflix-canada-vs-us_n_4435459.html|title=Netflix Canada vs. Netflix USA: Why Do We Get The Shaft?|first=Michael|last=Bolen|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2013-12-13|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a leaked e-mail revealed by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]] in 2014, [[Sony Pictures Television]]'s president of international distribution, Keith LeGoy, described VPN usage of Netflix as being "semi-sanctioned" [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and he criticized the company for not taking further steps to detect these users and restrict their access to content Netflix had not licensed for their region.&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand ISPs may be sued for letting users bypass geoblocks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/new-zealand-internet-service-providers-face-legal-action-over-copyright-breach|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Pictures mad at Netflix's failure to block overseas VPN users|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/sony-pictures-mad-at-netflixs-failure-to-block-overseas-vpn-users/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on January 14, 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to restrict access to unlicensed material, by viewers using VPNs or proxies.&lt;ref name=verge-netflixproxy&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix says it will do more to stop customers from bypassing country restrictions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/14/10767982/netflix-blocking-proxies-vpn-country-restrictions|website=The Verge|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other controversies ==
=== Price increase lawsuit ===
A lawsuit was filed agented Netflix in 2016 by George Keritsis. The suit alleged that Netflix broke the contract it made with millions of customers who have "grandfathered" subscription plans with price guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-user-lawsuit-class-action-rate-hike-1201807561/|title=Netflix User Sues Over Rate Hike, Claiming Breach of Contract|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-07-01|work=Variety|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8834">'''Logical truth''' is one of the most fundamental [[concept]]s in [[logic]], and there are different theories on its nature. A logical truth is a [[Statement (logic)|statement]] which is [[truth|true]], and remains true under all [[interpretation (logic)|reinterpretations]] of its components other than its [[logical constant]]s. It is a type of [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic statement]]. All of [[philosophical logic]] can be thought of as providing accounts of the nature of logical truth, as well as [[logical consequence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine, Willard Van Orman]], ''Philosophy of logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical truths (including [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]]) are truths which are considered to be '''necessarily true'''. This is to say that they are considered to be such that they could not be untrue and no situation could arise which would cause us to reject a logical truth.  It must be true in every sense of intuition, practices, and bodies of beliefs. However, it is not universally agreed that there are any statements which are ''necessarily'' true.

A logical truth is considered by some philosophers to be a statement which is true in all [[possible world]]s. This is contrasted with [[fact]]s (which may also be referred to as ''contingent claims'' or ''synthetic claims'') which are true in ''this'' world, as it has historically unfolded, but which is not true in at least one possible world, as it might have unfolded. The [[proposition]] "If p and q, then p" and the proposition "All married people are married" are logical truths because they are true due to their inherent structure and not because of any facts of the world. 
Later, with the rise of formal logic a logical truth was considered to be a statement which is true under all possible interpretations.

The existence of logical truths has been put forward by [[rationalist]] philosophers as an objection to [[empiricism]] because they hold that it is impossible to account for our [[knowledge]] of logical truths on empiricist grounds. Empiricists commonly respond to this objection by arguing that logical truths (which they usually deem to be mere tautologies), are analytic and thus do not purport to describe the world.

== Logical truths and analytic truths ==
{{Main|Analytic–synthetic distinction}}

Logical truths, being analytic statements, do not contain any information about any matters of [[fact]]. Other than logical truths, there is also a second class of analytic statements, typified by "no bachelor is married". The characteristic of such a statement is that it can be turned into a logical truth by substituting synonyms for synonyms ''[[salva veritate]]''. "No bachelor is married" can be turned into "no unmarried man is married" by substituting "unmarried man" for its synonym "bachelor".

In his essay [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]], the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] called into question the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. It was this second class of analytic statements that caused him to note that the concept of analyticity itself stands in need of clarification, because it seems to depend on the concept of [[synonym]]y, which stands in need of clarification. In his conclusion, Quine rejects that logical truths are necessary truths. Instead he posits that the truth-value of any statement can be changed, including logical truths, given a re-evaluation of the truth-values of every other statement in one's complete theory.

== Truth values and tautologies ==
{{Main|Tautology (logic)}}

Considering different [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] of the same statement leads to the notion of [[truth value]]. The simplest approach to truth values means that the statement may be "true" in one case, but [[false (logic)|"false"]]&lt;!-- not yet an article, but ought to be.  please, do not remove the link --&gt; in another. In one sense of the term "tautology", it is any type of [[well-formed formula|formula]] or [[proposition]] which turns out to be true under any possible interpretation of its terms (may also be called a [[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] or assignment depending upon the context). This is synonymous to logical truth.

However, the term "tautology" is also commonly used to refer to what could more specifically be called [[Truth function|truth-functional]] tautologies. Whereas a tautology or logical truth is true solely because of the logical terms it contains in general (e.g. "[[Universal quantification|every]]", "[[Existential quantification|some]]", and "is"), a truth-functional tautology is true because of the logical terms it contains which are [[logical connective]]s (e.g. "[[logical disjunction|or]]", "[[logical conjunction|and]]", and "[[joint denial|nor]]"). Not all logical truths are tautologies of such a kind.

== Logical truth and logical constants ==
{{Main|Logical constant}}

Logical constants, including [[logical connective]]s and [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], can all be reduced conceptually to logical truth. For instance, two statements or more are [[Logical NAND|logically incompatible]] ''[[if and only if|if, and only if]]'' their [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] is logically false. One statement [[Logical implication|logically implies]] another when it is logically incompatible with the [[negation]] of the other. A statement is logically true if, and only if its opposite is logically false.  The opposite statements must contradict one another.  In this way all logical connectives can be expressed in terms of preserving logical truth.  The logical form of a sentence is determined by its semantic or syntactic structure and by the placement of logical constants.  Logical constants determine whether a statement is a logical truth when they are combined with a language that limits its meaning.  Therefore, until it is determined how to make a distinction between all logical constants regardless of their language, it is impossible to know the complete truth of a statement or argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-constants/|title=Logical Constants|last=MacFarlane|first=J.|date=May 16, 2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical truth and rules of inference ==

The concept of logical truth is closely connected to the concept of a [[rule of inference]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. Ayer|Alfred Ayer]], ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical truth and logical positivism ==

[[Logical positivism]] was a movement in the 20th century and was followed to a great extent in Europe and the United States.  It is a structured method of determining how valid the knowledge is.  It introduced mathematics and the natural sciences into the field of philosophy.  It is also known as scientific empiricism.  Logical positivism considers philosophy as an analytical inquiry. Philosophy was deciphered as an activity rather than a theory.  Logical positivists worked to explain the language of science by showing that scientific theories could be broken down to logical truths along with the experience of the five senses.  The concepts created in this movement are very closely followed today in the West. Logical positivism was a way to decipher whether a statement was truly a logical truth by means of relating it to a scientific theory or mathematics.  It determined the validity of the statement as well as gave it the rank of a logical truth or a false truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=Logical Positivism|url=|journal=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-classical logics ==

{{Main|Non-classical logic}}

Non-classical logic is the name given to [[formal system]]s which differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as [[Propositional logic|propositional]] and [[predicate logic]]. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations. The aim of these departures is to make it possible to construct different models of [[logical consequence]] and logical truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Sider]], ''Logic for philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20964">'''Material flow analysis''' ('''MFA''') (also referred to as '''substance flow analysis''' ('''SFA''')) is an analytical method to quantify flows and stocks of materials or substances in a well-defined [[system]]. MFA is an important tool to study the bio-physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of [[industrial ecology]] or [[anthropogenic metabolism|anthropogenic]], [[urban metabolism|urban]], [[social metabolism|social]] and [[industrial metabolism]]. MFA is used to study material, substance, or product flows across different industrial sectors or within [[ecosystem]]s. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation, for example, for tracking [[nutrient]] flows through a [[waste water treatment plant]]. When combined with an assessment of the costs associated with material flows this business-oriented application of MFA is called [[material flow cost accounting]]. MFA is an important tool to study the [[circular economy]] and to devise [[material flow management]]. Since the 1990s, the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer-reviewed journals that publish MFA-related work include the ''[[Journal of Industrial Ecology]]'', ''[[Ecological Economics]]'', ''[[Environmental Science and Technology]]'', and ''Resources, Conservation, and Recycling''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/resources-conservation-and-recycling/|title=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Motivation===
[[Human need]]s such as shelter, food, transport, or communication require materials like wood, starch, sugar, iron and steel, copper, or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity [[Economic growth|expands]], material production, use, and disposal increase to a level where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be [[externality|neglected]] anymore, neither locally nor globally. Material flows are at the core of local environmental problems such as leaching from [[landfill]]s or [[oil spill]]s. Rising concern about [[global warming]] puts a previously unimportant waste flow, [[carbon dioxide]], on top of the political and scientific agenda. 
The gradual shift from primary material production to [[recycling|urban mining]] in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in-use and obsolete stocks of materials within human society.
Scientists, industries, government bodies, and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering, staying within, and leaving the different processes in the [[anthroposphere]]. Material flow analysis is such a method.

===Basic principles===
MFA is based on two fundamental and well-established scientific principles, the [[system]]s approach and [[mass balance]].&lt;ref&gt;Marina Fischer-Kowalski, The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part I, 1860-1970, Journal of Industrial Ecology 2(1), 1998, pp 61-78, {{doi|10.1162/jiec.1998.2.1.61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marina Fischer-Kowalski, The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part II, 1970-1998, Journal of Industrial Ecology 2(4), 1998, pp 107-136, {{doi|10.1162/jiec.1998.2.4.107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The system definition is the starting point of every MFA study.

====System definition====
[[File:MFASystem 1.png|thumb|Basic MFA system without quantification.]]
[[File:MFASystem 2.png|thumb|A more general MFA system without quantification.]]
An MFA system is a model of an industrial plant, an industrial sector or a region of concern. The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study. An MFA system always consists of the system boundary, one or more [[unit process|processes]], material flows between processes, and stocks of materials within processes. Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary. Contrary to the preconceived notion that a system represents a specific industrial installation, systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities as long as they are well-defined. The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system, either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes. An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes.

Next to specifying the arrangement of processes, stocks, and flows in the system definition, the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied.
The spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system. A system representing a certain industrial sector can be applied to the USA, China, certain world regions, or the world as a whole. 
The temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified. 
The indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds. As the name says, an indicator element is a certain [[chemical element]] such as cadmium or a substance such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it. Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars, materials like steel, or other physical quantities such as [[energy]].

MFA requires practitioners to make precise use of the terms 'material', 'substance', or 'good', as laid out, for example, in chapter 2.1 of Brunner and Rechberger,&lt;ref name="BR2004"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Brunner | first = P.H. | last2 = Rechberger | first2 = H. | title = Practical Handbook of Material Flow Analysis | publisher = Lewis Publishers, New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56670-604-1 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the main references for the MFA method.

* A [[chemical element]] is "a pure chemical substance consisting of one type of atom distinguished by its atomic number".&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC, Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book") (1997). Online corrected version:  (2006–) "chemical element".&lt;/ref&gt;
* A substance is "any (chemical) element or compound composed of uniform units. All substances are characterised by a unique and identical constitution and are thus homogeneous." From chapter 2.1.1 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* A good is defined as "economic entity of matter with a positive or negative economic value. Goods are made up of one or several substances". From chapter 2.1.2 in Brunner and Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* The term material in MFA "serves as an umbrella term for both substances and goods". From chapter 2.1.3 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger.&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
[[File:MFASystem 3.png|thumb|A typical MFA system with quantification.]]

====Process balance====

One of the main purposes of MFA is to quantify the [[social metabolism|metabolism]] of the elements of the system. Unlike economic accounting, MFA also covers non-economic waste flows, emissions to the environment, and non-market natural resources. 
[[File:MFAProcess1.png|thumb|Model of an industrial process in economic accounting (top) and in physical accounting (bottom).]]
The process balance is a first order physical principle that turns MFA into a powerful accounting and analysis tool. The nature of the processes in the system determine which balances apply. For a process '[[oil refinery]]', for example, one can establish a mass balance for each chemical element, while this is not possible for a nuclear power station. A car manufacturing plant respects the balance for steel, but a steel mill does not.

When quantifying MFA systems either by measurements or from statistical data, mass and other process balances have to be checked to ensure the correctness of the quantification and to reveal possible data inconsistencies or even misconceptions in the system such as the omission of a flow or a process. Conflicting information can be reconciled using [[data validation and reconciliation]], and the STAN-software offers basic reconciliation functionality that is suitable for many MFA application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stan2web.net/|title=Home|website=www.stan2web.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of MFA applications on different spatial and temporal scales==

MFA studies are conducted on various spatial and temporal scales and for a variety of elements, substances, and goods. They cover a wide range of process chains and material cycles. Several examples:

* ''MFA on a national or regional scale'' (also referred to as [[material flow accounting]]): In this type of study, the material exchanges between an economy and the natural environment are analyzed. Several indicators are calculated in order to assess the level of [[resource intensity]] of the system. &lt;ref name="ES2013"&gt;{{Cite report | last = Eurostat | title =  Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts (EW-MFA) | publisher = Eurostat | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KR2015"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krausmann | first = Fridolin | last2 = Weisz | first2 = Helga | last3 = Eisenmenger| first3 = Nina | last4 = Schütz | first4 = Helmut | last5 = Haas | first5 = Willi | last6 = Schaffartzik | first6 = Anke | title = Economy-wide Material Flow Accounting - Introduction and Guide. Social Ecology Working paper 151 | publisher = Institute of Social Ecology, Alpen-Adria University, Klagenfurt/Graz/Vienna | year = 2015 | issn = 1726-3808 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Corporate material flow analysis'', or MFA along an ''industrial supply chain'' involves a number of companies: The goal of material flow analysis within a company is to quantify and then optimize the production processes so that materials and energy are used more efficiently manner, e.g., by [[recycling]] and [[waste]] reduction. Companies can use the results obtained by [[Material Flow Cost Accounting]] to reduce their operational costs and improve environmental performance.
* In the ''life cycle of a product'': The life cycle inventory, whose compilation is at the core of [[life cycle assessment]], follows the MFA methodology as it is based on an explicit system definition and process balances.

== Historical development ==

* Mass balance or the conservation of matter has been postulated already in ancient Greece, and it was introduced into modern chemistry by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (cf. chapter 2.1.3 in Brunner&amp;Rechberger,&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;), from where it found its way to chemical engineering and finally to environmental science.
* Other seminal contributions were made by [[Sanctorius]] and [[Theodor Weyl]].
* Dennis Meadows made a wide audience aware of the physical foundation of the economy when he co-authored the bestseller ''[[Limits to Growth]]'' in 1971. Meadows et al. based their predictions on an analysis of resource stocks; see in the [[Glossary of environmental science#R|glossary of environmental science]].
* The methodology of MFA was developed during the 1980s and 1990s. Development happened simultaneously in different research groups. Central publications on the MFA methodology include Baccini and Bader (1996),&lt;ref&gt;Baccini and Bader 1996, 'Regionaler Stoffhaushalt' (Regional metabolism), Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Heidelberg (Germany), {{ISBN|3-86025-235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunner and Rechberger (2004),&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt; Baccini and Brunner (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Baccini P. &amp; Brunner P.H. (2012). Metabolism of the Anthroposphere, Analysis, Evaluation, Design. 2nd Edition, The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. {{ISBN|9780262016650}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van der Voet et al. (2002).&lt;ref&gt;'Predicting future emissions based on characteristics of stocks', Ecological Economics, 2002, 41(2), 223-234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, who worked at the Wuppertal Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wupperinst.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Wuppertal Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the MFA-related concept of Material Input Per Service unit (MIPS).&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Bleek {{citation |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-0348-5650-8_4 |date=1994 |title= MIPS: Ein neues ökologisches Maß}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[UNEP]] Resource Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=UNEP}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2007 by the United Nations Environment Program. In analogy to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[IPCC]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=IPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; it brings together experts from many disciplines and institutions to review the current state of research on societal metabolism and to communicate the latest findings to policymakers and stakeholders.

===Recent development===
* MFA concepts have been or are being incorporated in national accounts in several countries and regions such as the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Material_flow_accounts |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Accounting in the EU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/eco_business/pdf/mfca%20guide20070822.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=Accounting in Japan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927070822/http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/eco_business/pdf/mfca%20guide20070822.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MFA is also used in the [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].
* Several international conferences or other meetings provide a platform for researchers and policymakers to meet and exchange results and ideas, including the [[World Resources Forum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldresourcesforum.org/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=World Resources Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bi-annual international conference on material flow analysis and sustainable development.
* MFA-IO is an approach to establish an MFA system of the whole economy using monetary and physical Input-Output tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nakamura | first = S. | last2 = Kondo | first2 = Y. | title = Waste Input-Output Analysis. Concepts and Application to Industrial Ecology | publisher = Springer | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4020-9901-4 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Sustainable Europe Research Institute (SERI) in Vienna, Austria, has developed a database called materialflows.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.materialflows.net/ |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=materialflows.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamic MFA aims for long-term quantification of MFA systems and uses historic development patterns of physical stocks and flows to create robust scenarios for the years and decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel B. Müller, Stock dynamics for forecasting material flows--Case study for housing in The Netherlands, Ecological Economics 59(1), 2006, pp 142-156, {{doi|10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.09.025}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Japan has developed into a hotspot for MFA research. The country has scarce mineral resources and therefore depends on imports of energy carriers, ores, and other raw materials. The Japanese government fosters research on material cycles and also inaugurated the 3-R concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/recycle/3r/en/index.html |accessdate=3 July 2011 |title=3R in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting a state-of-the-art MFA==
A state-of-the-art MFA consists of the following steps:&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt;
* Establish an explicit system definition: Specify the system boundary with geographical and temporal scope, processes (can contain stocks), and flows. Specify the material for which the system is to be quantified (product, substance, or indicator element). Make sure that each stock is associated with a process and that each flow connects one process to another. Flows can also begin or end outside the system boundary.
* Define and name the system variables. The system variables include: All stocks within the processes, all flows between processes, and all flows coming from outside or going to outside the system boundaries. Sometimes, stocks are not considered and only the net stock changes are of interest. For each variable, it must be clear whether it is a stock or a flow, and this distinction needs to be reflected in the names and in the mathematical symbols chosen.
* Quantify the system variables by linking them to literature, measurement, or modelled data.
* Performe a mass balance check for all processes and the system as a whole.
* Optional: Visualise your system by using the box-and-arrow scheme shown above or by using [[Sankey diagram|Sankey diagrams]].
* Document the MFA by reporting the explicit system definition along with the list of quantified system variables and the mass balance checks.

===The difference between material and substance flow analysis===
While the term 'substance' in 'substance flow analysis (SFA) always refers to chemical substances, the term 'material' in 'material flow analysis (MFA)' has a much wider scope. According to Brunner and Rechberger&lt;ref name="BR2004" /&gt; the term 'material' comprises substances AND goods, and the reason for this wide scope is the wish to apply MFA not only to chemical elements or substances but also to materials like steel, timber, or products like cars or buildings. It is thus possible to conduct an MFA for the passenger vehicle fleet by recording the vehicles entering and leaving the use phase.

==Relation to other methods==

MFA is complementary to the other core [[industrial ecology]] methods [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) and [[input-output model|input-output (I/O) models]]. Some overlaps between the different methods exist as they all share the system approach and to some extent the mass balance principle. The methods mainly differ in purpose, scope, and data requirements.

MFA studies often cover the entire cycle (mining, production, manufacturing, use, waste handling) of a certain substance within a given geographical boundary and time frame. Material stocks are explicit in MFA, which makes this method suitable for studies involving resource scarcity and recycling from old scrap. The common use of time series (dynamic modelling) and lifetime models makes MFA a suitable tool for assessing long-term trends in material use.

* Compared to I/O analyses, the number of processes considered in MFA systems is usually much lower. On the other hand, mass balance ensures that flows of by-products or waste are not overlooked in MFA studies, whereas in I/O tables these flows are often not included due to their lack of economic value. Physical I/O models are much less common than economic tables. Material stocks are not covered by IO analysis, only the addition to stock can be included in form of capital accumulation.
* Life cycle inventories record the demand for many different materials associated with individual products, whereas MFA studies typically focus on a single material used in many different products.

'''The Mindset List''' is an annual compilation of the values that shape the worldview (or “mindset”) of students about 18 years old and entering college and, to a lesser extent, [[adulthood]]. It is co-authored by Ron Nief, Public Affairs Director Emeritus; Tom McBride, Professor of English and Keefer Professor of Humanities; and Charles Westerberg, Brannon-Ballard Professor of Sociology, all at [[Beloit College]] in [[Beloit, Wisconsin]]. It originated in 1997 as an e-mail forward, without author credits, passed on by then College Statistician Richard Miller to Ron Nief, who passed it on to peers at other schools.  The Mindset List began as a cute way of reminding colleagues on the faculty to "watch their references" with freshmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction: 2016 List|url=http://www.beloit.edu/mindset/2016/|work=August, 2012|publisher=Beloit College|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It reappeared in the fall of 1998 after requests from peers who mistook the forward as having originated with Ron Nief. Ever since, Nief and McBride have collaborated to create The List, and Westerberg joined them as a co-author starting with the Class of 2020 List released in 2016.

The List now appears every August as American first-year students enter college. It has been mentioned on the [[NBC Nightly News]] with [[Brian Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/#32467906&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[essay]] by [[Nancy Gibbs]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1921587,00.html ''What College Students Don't Know''] Time Magazine, September 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''Time'' declared "mindset list" a new phrase in the [[Americans|American]] [[lexicon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1917715,00.html ''Verbatim''] Time Magazine, August 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mindset List website has a daily quiz about growing up in the United States, a Mindset List Movie of the Month, “Mindset Moments” of reports about the generation gap, links to information about the current generation of young people, and an [[Irony|ironic]] advice column called Ask ROM. The List also appears on Twitter and Facebook.

==Book==
''The Mindset Lists of American History: From Typewriters to Text Messages, What Ten Generations of Americans Think Is Normal'' was released in 2011.

==Criticism==
The website Beloit Mindlessness calls the Mindset List “a poorly written compendium of trivia, stereotypes and lazy generalizations, insulting to both students and their professors, and based on nothing more than the uninformed speculation of its authors. It inspires lazy, inaccurate journalism and is an embarrassment to academia.” Beloit Mindlessness publishes posts critiquing specific items on the Mindset Lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beloitmindlessness.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siddha Shila.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Siddha Shila as per [[Jain cosmology]] which is abode of infinite Siddhas]]
{{Jainism}}
[[Sanskrit]] '''''{{IAST|moksha}}''''' or [[Prakrit]] '''''mokkha''''' refers to the liberation or salvation of a soul from ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'', the cycle of birth and death. It is a blissful state of existence of a soul, attained after the destruction of all [[Karma in Jainism|karmic bonds]]. A liberated soul is said to have attained its true and pristine nature of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge and infinite perception. Such a soul is called ''[[Siddha#Siddha in Jainism|siddha]]'' and is revered in Jainism.

In [[Jainism]], ''moksha'' is the highest and the noblest objective that a soul should strive to achieve. In fact, it is the only objective that a person should have; other objectives are contrary to the true nature of soul. With the right view, knowledge and efforts all souls can attain this state. That is why Jainism is also known as ''{{IAST|mokṣamārga}}'' or the "path to liberation".

According to the Sacred Jain Text, [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|Owing to the absence of the cause of bondage and with the functioning of the dissociation of karmas the annihilation of all karmas is liberation.|Tattvārthsūtra (10-2){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146}}}}

==Bhavyata==

From the point of view of potentiality of {{IAST|mokṣa}}, Jain texts bifurcates the souls in two categories–''bhavya'' and ''abhavya''. ''Bhavya'' souls are those souls who have faith in {{IAST|mokṣa}} and hence will make some efforts to achieve liberation.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=95}} This potentiality or quality is called ''bhavyata''.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=95}} However, ''bhavyata'' itself does not guarantee {{IAST|mokṣa}}, as the soul needs to expend necessary efforts to attain it. On the other hand, ''abhavya'' souls are those souls who cannot attain liberation as they do not have faith in {{IAST|mokṣa}} and hence never make any efforts to attain it.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=95}}

==The Path to Liberation==
According to Jainism, the ''[[Ratnatraya]]'' or "three Gems", ''samyagdarśana'' (correct perception), ''samyagjñāna'' (right knowledge) and ''samyakchāritra'' (right conduct), together constitute the ''mokṣamarga'' or the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Acharya [[KundaKunda]]'s [[Samayasara]]:{{quote|Belief in the nine substances as they are is right faith (samyagdarśana). Knowledge of these substances without doubt, delusion or misapprehension, is right knowledge (samyagjñāna). Being free from attachment etc. is right conduct (samyakcāritra). These three, together, constitute the path to liberation.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=165}}}}

''Samyak Darsana'' or rational perception is the rational faith in the true nature of every substance of the universe.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}{{pn|date=August 2017}}

''Samyak Caritra'' or rational conduct is the natural conduct of a (soul) living being. It consists in following austerities, engaging in right activities and observance of vows, carefulness and controls.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra | editor = Prof. Sagarmal Jain, Translated Justice T.K. Tukol and Dr. K.K. Dixit | title ={{IAST|Samaṇ Suttaṁ}} | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} Verse 262 - 4&lt;/ref&gt;
Once a soul secures ''samyaktva'', {{IAST|mokṣa}} is assured within a few lifetimes.
The fourteen stages on the path to liberation are called ''[[Gunasthana|Gunasthāna]]''. These are:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2014|p=14}}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Gunasthāna (Stages on the Path) !! Meaning
|-
|1. ''Mithyātva'' || The stage of wrong believer (Gross ignorance)
|-
|2. ''Sasādana'' || Downfall from right faith
|-
|3. ''Misradrsti''|| Mixed right and wrong belief
|-
|4. ''Avirata samyagdrsti'' || Vowless right belief
|-
|5. ''Deśavirata'' || The stage of partial self-control
|-
|6. ''Pramattasamyata'' || Slightly imperfect vows
|-
|7. ''Apramatta samyata''|| Perfect vows (''[[Mahavrata]]s'')
|-
|8. ''Apūrvakaraņa'' || New thought-activity
|-
|9. ''Anivāttibādara-sāmparāya''|| Advanced thought-activity (Passions are still occurring)
|-
|10.''Sukshma samparaya''|| Slightest delusion
|-
|11.''Upaśānta-kasāya''|| Subsided delusion
|-
|12.''Ksīna kasāya''|| Destroyed delusion
|-
|13.''Sayoga kevali''|| Omniscience with vibration (destruction of all inimical karmas)
|-
|14.''Ayoga kevali'' || The stage of omniscience without any activity
|}

Those who pass the last stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EscwAQAAMAAJ|title=The Practical Path|author=Champat Rai Jain|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|year=1917|publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{IAST|Nirvāna}}==
{{IAST|Nirvāna}} means final release from the karmic bondage. When an enlightened human, such as an Arihant or a [[Tirthankara]], extinguishes his remaining ''aghatiya karmas'' and thus ends his worldly existence, it is called {{IAST|nirvāna}}. Technically, the death of an Arhat is called their nirvāṇa, as he has ended his worldly existence and attained liberation. Moksha (liberation) follows nirvāṇa. However, the terms ''moksa'' and ''nirvana'' are often used interchangeably in the [[Jain texts]].{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=168}}&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) ''The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521365058}}: ''"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa."'' p.297&lt;/ref&gt; An Arhat becomes a siddha, the liberated one, after attaining nirvana.

In that night in which the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira, died, freed from all pains, the eighteen confederate kings of Kasi and Kosala, the nine Mallakis and nine Licchavis, on the day of new moon, instituted an illuminations on the Poshadha, which was a fasting day; for they said: 'Since the light of intelligence is gone, let us make an illumination of material matter!'(128)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann |author2=Ed. F. Max Müller | title =Kalpa Sutra, Jain Sutras Part I, Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 22 | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1884 | location =Oxford | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liberated soul ==
A liberated soul dwell in ''[[Siddhashila]]'' with infinite faith, infinite knowledge, infinite perception, and infinite perfection. According to the Jain text, ''Puruşārthasiddhyupāya'':
{{quote|Having achieved the ultimate goal, knowing everything that needs to be known, and enjoying eternal and supreme bliss, the Omniscient, Effulgent Soul, rests permanently in the Highest State (of liberation).|Puruşārthasiddhyupāya (224){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=178}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">{{about||the 1947 novel called "The Mooncalf"|Dennis Parry}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
A '''mooncalf''' (or '''moon-calf''', '''calvaluna''') is a [[monstrous birth]], the [[miscarriage|abortive]] [[fetus]] of a [[Cattle|cow]] or other [[livestock|farm animal]]. The term was occasionally applied to an abortive [[human]] fetus.

The term derives from the once widespread [[superstition]], present in many [[Europe]]an [[folk medicine|folk]] traditions, that such malformed creatures were the product of the sinister influence of the [[Moon]] on fetal development.

==Modern usage==
The term came to also refer to any monstrous or grotesque thing. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], for instance, used the term to describe [[Caliban]], the deformed servant of [[Prospero]], in ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]''.

In [[H. G. Wells]]' 1901 novel ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', large creatures domesticated by the Selenites are referred to as "mooncalves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The First Men in the Moon]] |last=Wells |first=H. G. |authorlink=H. G. Wells |year=1901 |chapter=Chapter 11: The Mooncalf Pastures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooncalf is used as a derogatory term indicating someone is a dullard, fool or otherwise not particularly bright or sharp. For example, [[W. C. Fields]] in ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940) advises his prospective son-in-law to avoid being a "mooncalf" by buying shares he has been conned into believing are worth much more than the proffered price.

Mooncalf is also the name of a species of magical creatures in the world of the [[Harry Potter]] series. It is described in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' as a shy, nocturnal creature with a smooth, pale grey body, bulging eyes and four spindly legs with large flat feet. Mooncalves perform dances in the moonlight, and are apparently responsible for [[crop circle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] |last=Rowling |first=J. K. |authorlink=J. K. Rowling |year=2001 |chapter=An A–Z of Fantastic Beasts }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film of the same name]], Newt Scamander's collection of creatures in his suitcase includes a herd of Mooncalves.

Wilfred Maxwell, narrator and protagonist of [[occult]]ist [[Dion Fortune]]’s 1938 novel, ''[[The Sea Priestess]]'', refers several times to a mentally handicapped character who falls into the sea and disappears as a "mooncalf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Sea Priestess]] |last=Fortune|first=Dion|authorlink=Dion Fortune|origyear=1938|year=1978 |at=Chapter X, p. 86, ''et infra''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7992">In children, '''narcissistic withdrawal''' may be described as 'a form of [[omnipotent]] [[narcissism]] characterised by the turning away from parental figures and by the fantasy that essential needs can be satisfied by the individual alone'.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Rustin, ''Psychotic States in Children'' (1997) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

For adults, 'in the contemporary literature the term narcissistic withdrawal is instead reserved for an ego defense in pathological personalities'.&lt;ref name=Myquel&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-withdrawal Martine Myquel, "Narcissistic Withdrawal"]&lt;/ref&gt; Such narcissists may feel obliged to withdraw from any relationship that threatens to be more than short-term.

==Psychoanalysis==

[[Freud]] used the term 'to describe the turning back of the individual's libido from the object onto themselves....as the equivalent of narcissistic [[Regression (psychology)|regression]]'.&lt;ref name=Myquel/&gt; [[On Narcissism]] saw him explore the idea through an examination of such everyday events as illness or sleep: 'the condition of sleep, too, resembles illness in implying a narcissistic withdrawal of the positions of the [[libido]] on to the subject's own self'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in '"Mourning and Melancholia"...Freud's most profound contribution to [[object relations theory]]',&lt;ref&gt;James Grotstein, in [[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; he examined how 'a withdrawal of the libido...on a narcissistic basis' in [[major depressive disorder|depression]] could allow both a freezing and a preservation of affection: 'by taking flight into the ego love escapes extinction'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'' p. 57-8 and p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Fenichel]] would extend his analysis to [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]] conditions, demonstrating how 'in a reactive withdrawal of libido...a regression to narcissism is also a regression to the primal narcissistic omnipotence which makes its reappearance in the form of [[megalomania]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 419-20&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Melanie Klein]], however, a more positive element came to the fore: 'frustration, which stimulates narcissistic withdrawal, is also...a fundamental factor in adaptation to reality'.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pearl King/Riccardo Steiner, ''The Freud-Klein Controversies'' (1992) p. 802&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, '[[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]] points out that there is an aspect of withdrawal that is healthy', considering that it might be '"helpful to think of withdrawal as a condition in which the person concerned (child or adult) holds a regressed part of the self and nurses it, at the expense of external relationships"'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Abram/K. Hjulmand, ''The Language of Winnicott'' (2007) p. 45 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the mid-20th century onwards, attention has increasingly focused on 'the case in which the subject appeals to narcissistic withdrawal as a defensive solution...a precarious refuge that comes into being as a defense against a disappointing or untrustworthy object. This is found in studies of narcissistic personalities or borderline pathologies by authors such as [[Heinz Kohut]] or [[Otto Kernberg]]'.&lt;ref name=Myquel/&gt;

Kohut considered that 'the narcissistically vulnerable individual responds to actual (or anticipated) [[narcissistic injury]] either with shamefaced withdrawal or with narcissistic rage'.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Shaffer, ''The Blinding Torch'' (1993) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Kernberg saw the difference between normal narcissism and ' ''[[pathological narcissism]]''...[as] withdrawal into "splendid isolation"'&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter instance; while [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] was concerned with 'states of withdrawal commonly seen in narcissistic patients in which death is idealised as superior to life', as well as with 'the alternation of states of narcissistic withdrawal and ego disintegration'.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Steiner]]/Herbert A. Rosenfeld, ''Rosenfeld in Retrospective'' (2008) p. 66 and p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizoid withdrawal===

Closely related to narcissistic withdrawal is '[[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid withdrawal]]: the escape from too great pressure by abolishing emotional relationships altogether'.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; All such 'fantastic refuges from need are forms of emotional starvation, [[megalomania]]s and distortions of reality born of fear'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''The Beast in the Nursery'' (London 1998) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==

'Narcissists will isolate themselves, leave their families, ignore others, do anything to preserve a special...sense of self'&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Lachkar]], ''The Narcissisitic/Borderline Couple'' (1992) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, however, all such 'narcissistic withdrawal is haunted by its ''alter ego'': the ghost of a full social presence'&lt;ref&gt;James Booth, ''New Larkins for Old'' (2000) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; - with people living their lives 'along a continuum which ranges from the maximal degree of social commitment...to a maximal degree of social withdrawal'.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as  Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 171-2&lt;/ref&gt;

If 'of all modes of narcissistic withdrawal, depression is the most crippling',&lt;ref&gt;Harold Barrett, ''Rhetoric and Civility'' (1991) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; a contributing factor may be that 'depressed persons come to appreciate consciously how much social effort is in fact required in the normal course of keeping one's usual place in undertakings'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erving Goffman]], ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 448n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==

[[Object relations theory]] would see the process of therapy as one whereby the therapist enabled his or her patient to have 'resituated the object ''from'' the purely schizoid usage ''to'' the shared schizoid usage (initially) until eventually...the object relation - discussing, arguing, idealizing, hating, etc. - emerged'.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bollas, ''Cracking Up'' (London 1995) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenichel considered that in patients where 'their narcissistic regression is a reaction to narcissistic injuries; if they are shown this fact
and given time to face the real injuries and to develop other types of reaction, they may be helped enormously'&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neville Symington]] however estimated that 'often a kind of war develops between analyst and patient, with the analyst trying to haul the patient out of the cocoon...his narcissistic envelope...and the patient pulling for all his worth in the other direction'.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==

* In [[I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (novel)|''I Never Promised You a Rose Garden'']], the therapist of the protagonist wonders '"if there is a pattern....You give up a secret to our view and then you get so scared that you run for cover into your panic or into your secret world. To live there."'.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Green, ''I Never Promised You a Rose Garden'' (London 1975) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;
* More generally, the 1920s have been described as a time of 'changes in which women were channelled toward narcissistic withdrawal rather than developing strong egos'.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Levinger/H. L. Raush, ''Close Relationships'' (1977) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9965">[[File:Parabolic cylindrical coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|Coordinate surfaces]] of parabolic cylindrical coordinates.  The red parabolic cylinder corresponds to σ=2, whereas the yellow parabolic cylinder corresponds to τ=1.  The blue plane corresponds to ''z''=2.  These surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere), which has [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (2, -1.5, 2).]]

In [[mathematics]], '''parabolic cylindrical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from projecting the two-dimensional [[parabolic coordinates|parabolic coordinate system]] in the
perpendicular &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  Hence, the [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] are [[confocal]] [[parabola|parabolic]] cylinders. Parabolic cylindrical coordinates have found many applications, e.g., the [[potential theory]] of edges.

==Basic definition==

[[File:Parabolic coords.svg|thumb|right|250px|Parabolic coordinate system showing curves of constant &amp;sigma; and &amp;tau; the horizontal and vertical axes are the x and y coordinates respectively. These coordinates are projected along the z-axis, and so this diagram will hold for any value of the z coordinate.]]

The parabolic cylindrical coordinates {{math|(''σ'', ''τ'', ''z'')}} are defined in terms of the [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

x &amp;= \sigma \tau \\
y &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left( \tau^2 - \sigma^2 \right) \\
z &amp;= z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The surfaces of constant {{math|''σ''}} form confocal parabolic cylinders

:&lt;math&gt;
2 y = \frac{x^2}{\sigma^2} - \sigma^2
&lt;/math&gt;

that open towards {{math|+''y''}}, whereas the surfaces of constant {{math|''τ''}} form confocal parabolic cylinders

:&lt;math&gt;
2 y = -\frac{x^2}{\tau^2} + \tau^2
&lt;/math&gt;

that open in the opposite direction, i.e., towards {{math|−''y''}}.  The foci of all these parabolic cylinders are located along the line defined by {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''y'' {{=}} 0}}.  The radius {{math|''r''}} has a simple formula as well

:&lt;math&gt;
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sigma^2 + \tau^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

that proves useful in solving the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] in parabolic coordinates for the [[inverse-square law|inverse-square]] [[central force]] problem of [[mechanics]]; for further details, see the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]] article.

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the parabolic cylindrical coordinates {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''τ''}} are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h_\sigma &amp;= h_\tau = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \\
h_z &amp;= 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Differential elements==

The infinitesimal element of volume is

:&lt;math&gt;dV = h_\sigma h_\tau h_z d\sigma d\tau dz = ( \sigma^2 + \tau^2 ) d\sigma \, d\tau \, dz 
&lt;/math&gt;

The differential displacement is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{l} = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \, d\sigma \, \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \, d\tau \, \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + dz \, \mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

The differential normal area is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{S} = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}       \, d\tau   \, dz  \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}       \, d\sigma \, dz    \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + \left(\sigma^2 + \tau^2\right) \, d\sigma \, d\tau \mathbf{\hat{z}}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Del==

Let {{math|''f''}} be a scalar field.  The [[gradient]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}} {\partial f \over \partial \sigma}\boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}} {\partial f \over \partial \tau}\boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + {\partial f \over \partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Laplacian]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}
\left(\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial \sigma^{2}} +
\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial \tau^{2}} \right) +
\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial z^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|'''A'''}} be a vector field of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A = A_\sigma \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + A_\tau \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + A_\varphi \mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf A = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}\left({\partial (\sqrt{\sigma^2+\tau^2} A_\sigma) \over \partial \sigma} + {\partial (\sqrt{\sigma^2+\tau^2} A_\tau) \over \partial \tau}\right) + {\partial A_z \over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf A =
  \left(
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}} \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial \tau}
  - \frac{\partial A_\tau}{\partial z}
  \right) \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}}
- \left(
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}} \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial \sigma}
  - \frac{\partial A_\sigma}{\partial z}
  \right) \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}}
+ \frac{1}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \left(
    \frac{\partial \left(\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} A_\sigma \right)}{\partial \tau}
  - \frac{\partial \left(\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} A_\tau \right)}{\partial \sigma}
  \right) \mathbf{\hat{z}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators can be expressed in the coordinates {{math|(''σ'', ''τ'')}} by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Relationship to other coordinate systems==

Relationship to [[cylindrical coordinate]]s {{math|(''ρ'', ''φ'', ''z'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho\cos\varphi &amp;= \sigma \tau\\
\rho\sin\varphi &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left( \tau^2 - \sigma^2 \right) \\
z &amp;= z \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Parabolic unit vectors expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} &amp;= \frac{\tau \hat{\mathbf x} - \sigma \hat{\mathbf y}}{\sqrt{\tau^2+\sigma^2}} \\
\boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} &amp;= \frac{\sigma \hat{\mathbf x} + \tau \hat{\mathbf y}}{\sqrt{\tau^2+\sigma^2}} \\
\mathbf{\hat{z}} &amp;= \mathbf{\hat{z}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Parabolic cylinder harmonics ==

Since all of the surfaces of constant {{math|''σ''}}, {{math|''τ''}} and {{math|''z''}} are [[conicoid]]s, Laplace's equation is separable in parabolic cylindrical coordinates. Using the technique of the [[separation of variables]], a separated solution to Laplace's equation may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;V = S(\sigma) T(\tau) Z(z)&lt;/math&gt;

and Laplace's equation, divided by {{math|''V''}}, is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \left[\frac{\ddot{S}}{S} + \frac{\ddot{T}}{T}\right] + \frac{\ddot{Z}}{Z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Since the {{math|''Z''}} equation is separate from the rest, we may write

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\ddot{Z}}{Z}=-m^2&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is constant. {{math|''Z''(''z'')}} has the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_m(z)=A_1\,e^{imz}+A_2\,e^{-imz}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting {{math|−''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for &lt;math&gt;\ddot{Z} / Z&lt;/math&gt;, Laplace's equation may now be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\ddot{S}}{S} + \frac{\ddot{T}}{T}\right] = m^2 (\sigma^2 + \tau^2)&lt;/math&gt;

We may now separate the {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''T''}} functions and introduce another constant {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{S} - (m^2\sigma^2 + n^2) S = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{T} - (m^2\tau^2 - n^2) T = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to these equations are the [[parabolic cylinder functions]]

:&lt;math&gt;S_{mn}(\sigma) = A_3 y_1(n^2 / 2m, \sigma \sqrt{2m}) + A_4 y_2(n^2 / 2m, \sigma \sqrt{2m})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{mn}(\tau)   = A_5 y_1(n^2 / 2m, i \tau \sqrt{2m}) + A_6 y_2(n^2 / 2m, i \tau \sqrt{2m})&lt;/math&gt;

The parabolic cylinder harmonics for {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} are now the product of the solutions. The combination will reduce the number of constants and the general solution to Laplace's equation may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\sigma, \tau, z) = \sum_{m, n} A_{mn} S_{mn} T_{mn} Z_m&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

The classic applications of parabolic cylindrical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which such coordinates allow a [[separation of variables]].  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding a flat semi-infinite conducting plate.

[[File:PatientCareProviderSad.jpg|thumb|Visual example of caregiver burnout, a common result of patient initiated violence.]]

'''Patient-initiated violence ''' is a specific form of [[workplace violence]] that affects [[Health professional|healthcare workers]] that is the result of verbal, physical, or emotional abuse from a patient or family members of whom they have assumed care. [[Nursing|Nurses]] represent the highest percentage of affected workers; however, other roles include physicians, therapists, technicians, home care workers, and social workers.&lt;ref name="NCAVC"&gt;National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (2003) Workplace Violence: issues in Response. National Criminal Justice Reference Service. (53-55) Received from https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204462&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] used 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics and reported that healthcare workplace violence requiring days absent from work from patients represented 80% of cases.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration (2015) Workplace Violence in Healthcare. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Received from https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hospitals/workplace_violence.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a survey by the [[American Nurses Association]] of 3,765 21% of nurses and nursing students reported physical abuse and over 50% reported verbal abuse within a 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;American Nurses Association. 2014. American Nurses Association Health Risk Appraisal

(2014, December 31). Epidemic of Violence against Health Care Workers Plagues Hospitals. Retrieved August 6, 2016, from http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/epidemic-of-violence-against-health-care-workers-plagues-hospitals/&lt;/ref&gt; or subject to a long wait time.&lt;ref name="JEN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2013.11.006 |pmid=24439244 |title=Nothing Changes, Nobody Cares: Understanding the Experience of Emergency Nurses Physically or Verbally Assaulted While Providing Care |journal=Journal of Emergency Nursing |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=305–10 |year=2014 |last1=Wolf |first1=Lisa A. |last2=Delao |first2=Altair M. |last3=Perhats |first3=Cydne }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain areas are more at risk for this kind of violence including healthcare workers in psychiatric settings, emergency or critical care, or long term care and dementia units.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt;

==Areas of high prevalence==

===Emergency departments===

The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] found that greater than 75% of emergency physicians were the victim of one or more violent incidents in the workplace, noting that the majority was by patients or their families.&lt;ref name="EPM"&gt;Emergency Physicians Monthly. (n.d.). Emergency Department Violence Fact Sheet. Retrieved July 30, 2016, from http://epmonthly.com/article/violence-against-ed-workers-a-growing-problem/&lt;/ref&gt; Causes for the increased presence of violence, especially in urban settings, are related to gang activity, lengthened waiting periods to see a doctor, a failure of community medical resources, and unavailable acute psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref name="EPM"/&gt; In 2011 the [[Emergency Nurses Association]] studies the occurrence of physical violence at 54.4% and verbal violence at 42.5% among emergency room nurses.&lt;ref name="ENA"&gt;Emergency Nurses Association. (2011). Emergency department violence surveillance study. Des Plaines, IL: Emergency Nurses Association&lt;/ref&gt; Within this study, 55.7% perpetrators of physical violence were under the influence of alcohol. 46.8% were under the influence of illegal or prescription drugs, and 45.2% were being treated for psychiatric reasons. A majority of the violent behavior that occurred was during the [[triage]] process at 40.2%.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

===Psychiatric and dementia units===
Workers in departments that specialize in [[mental health]] are particularly at risk for patient abuse due to the psychiatric disease states, high rates of [[substance abuse]], and previous violent patient behavior.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12912-015-0079-5 |pmid=25999795 |pmc=4440495 |title=Registered nurses' experiences of patient violence on acute care psychiatric inpatient units: An interpretive descriptive study |journal=BMC Nursing |volume=14 |pages=35 |year=2015 |last1=Stevenson |first1=Kelly N. |last2=Jack |first2=Susan M. |last3=o'Mara |first3=Linda |last4=Legris |first4=Jeannette }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of Canadian psychiatric nurses noted that [[social stigma]] of psychiatric disorders plays a significant role in how nurses perceive violence. Caregivers were uncomfortable with the notion that patient violence is part of the job but also that it is unfair to believe that those with [[mental illness]] should be seen as more violent in nature.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt; Osha reported that violent injuries in psychiatric aids was 10 times higher than any other healthcare worker at 590 injuries per 10,000 full-time employees.&lt;ref name="NCAVC"/&gt;

==Underreporting==
Underreporting of patient initiated violence is common with professionals claiming that assault is a part of the job. A report from the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] dedicates underreporting is likely due to a fear of [[retaliation]], or belief that it will not lead to any change. There is also a commonly held belief that violence is a part of the job.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt;&lt;ref name="MNA"&gt;Massachusetts Nurses Association, Congress on Health and Safety, Workplace Violence and Abuse Prevention Task Force, Luce, S. (2005). Violence is NOT Part of the Job. Massachusetts Nurses Association. Received from: https://massnurses.org/files/file/MNA%20Survey%20results%20FINAL%20on%20Workplace%20Violence%20Abuse%202016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Massachusetts Nurses Association followed up on this common belief through a survey of three [[New England]] hospitals, finding that only 39% of participants reported all incidences of violence. The same report found that 70% of those who reported an incident found that management was supportive, however a majority noted that nothing was done to solve the problem.&lt;ref name=MNA/&gt; A study of Canadian psychiatric nurses reported that not only was violence a part of the job, but its occurrence no longer warranted a reporting.&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt; The same report noted that underreporting drastically affects the ability of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to track these occurrences.&lt;ref name=NCAVC/&gt; Many qualitative studies done on nurses suggest that there is frequent discouragement by hospital officials and legal officers to not press charges against abusive patients or their families related to an understanding that violence is a part of the job.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt;

==Lasting effects of violence==
The effects of patient initiated violence has been found correlate to lasting symptoms of [[post traumatic stress disorder]], [[acute stress disorder]], and high rates of [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;  Nurses who experience a lack of support from public officials after the event reported feelings of anxiety and frustration.&lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt; OSHA sampled one hospital who paid for medical treatment of 30 staff members subject to patient initiated violence over a one-year period costing $94,146.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; It was also estimated that the costs of separation, recruitment, hiring, and training of new staff to be anywhere from 25,000 to 103,000.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

A study in Orebro Reginal Hospital in [[Sweden]] suggested a link between patient initiated violence, [[Occupational burnout|burnout]], and decreased care outcomes. It was reported that the highest indicator of care quality outcomes is a positive or negative association with an individuals work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00146-5 |pmid=11330776 |title=Violence towards health care staff and possible effects on the quality of patient care |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=417–27 |year=2001 |last1=Arnetz |first1=Judith E |last2=Arnetz |first2=Bengt B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media==
In November 2014 Charles Logan, a 68-year-old patient at St John's Hospital in Mapplewood Minnesota attacked nurses using a bar from his stretcher.&lt;ref&gt;(WGN) CNN WIRE. (2014, November 7). Surveillance video captures patient attacking nurses in Minnesota hospital. Retrieved August 6, 2016, from http://wgntv.com/2014/11/07/surveillance-video-captures-patient-attacking-nurses-in-minnesota-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Solutions to this issues range dependent on facility and location. A common suggestions from nursing staff is for additional trainings specifically on the de-escalation of high risk situations and health professional legal rights &lt;ref name="JEN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MNA"/&gt; 55% of participants of workers in New England Hospitals stated they were aware of their legal rights relating to workplace violence.&lt;ref name="MNA"/&gt; The national institute of occupational safety and health (NOSHA) created a free online [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/violence/training_nurses.html training module] that went live in 2013.  [[The Veterans Health Administration]] has reduced occurrences of assaults by flagging high risk based on previous documentation of attacks on caregivers.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt; The American Nurses Association has modeled a state bill for a “Violence Prevention in Health Care Facilities Act” that would call for the creation of violence prevention committees, annual violence prevention training, and sufficient record keeping of violence acts.&lt;ref&gt;American Nurses Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">A '''perceptual system''' is a computational system (biological or artificial) designed to make [[inference]]s about properties of a [[physical environment]] based on [[Scene (perception)|scenes]]. Other definitions may exist.

In this context, a scene is defined as [[information]] that can flow from a physical rectums into a computational system via [[Transduction (physiology)|sensory transduction]]. A [[sensory organ]] (biological or artificial) is used to capture this information. Therefore, any perceptual system must incorporate input from at least one [[sensory organ]].

Examples of perceptual systems include:
* The [[visual system]]
* The [[auditory system]]
* The [[olfactory system]]
* The [[somatosensory system]]
* A [[bat]]'s [[sonar]]/[[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] system
* A man-made [[light meter]]
* A man-made [[motion detector]]

Research in the field of perceptual systems focuses on computational aspects of [[perception]]. For this reason, there is significant overlap with [[neuroscience]], [[sensor]] design, [[natural scene statistics]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewicki, Michael S.

{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
[[File:Serbskij-institute.jpg|thumb|The Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, also briefly called the [[Serbsky Institute]] (the part of its building in [[Moscow]])]]

There was systematic [[political abuse of psychiatry]] in the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|Finckenauer|1995|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Gershman|1984}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=490}}; {{harvnb|Knapp|2007|p=406}}; {{harvnb|Kutchins|Kirk|1997|p=293}}; {{harvnb|Lisle|2010|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Merskey|1978}}; {{harvnb|Society for International Development|1984|p=19}}; {{harvs|txt|author=US GPO|year1=1972|year2=1975|year3=1976|year4=1984|year5=1988}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2002|year2=2010a|year3=2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the interpretation of political opposition or dissent as a psychiatric problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}; {{harvnb|UPA Herald|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "psychopathological mechanisms" of dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}}

During the leadership of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]], psychiatry was used to disable and remove from society political opponents ("dissidents") who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted the official dogma.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=17}}&lt;ref&gt;See Vladimir Bukovsky, ''Judgment in Moscow'' (forthcoming spring 2016), Chapter 3, Back to the Future: "Deportation or the Madhouse",&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosophical intoxication", for instance, was widely applied to the mental disorders diagnosed when people disagreed with the country's Communist leaders and, by referring to the writings of the Founding Fathers of Marxism–Leninism—[[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]]—made them the target of criticism.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=15}}

[[Article 58]]-10 of the Stalin-era Criminal Code, "[[Anti-Soviet agitation]]", was to a considerable degree preserved in the new 1958 RSFSR Criminal Code as [[anti-Soviet agitation|Article 70]] "Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda". In 1967, a weaker law, Article 190-1 "Dissemination of fabrications known to be false, which defame the Soviet political and social system", was added to the RSFSR Criminal Code. These laws were frequently applied in conjunction with the system of diagnosis for mental illness, developed by Academician [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]]. Together they established a framework within which non-standard beliefs could easily be defined as a criminal offence and the basis, subsequently, for a psychiatric diagnosis.{{sfn|Kovalyov|2007}}

== Applying the diagnosis ==
The "anti-Soviet" political behavior of some individuals — being outspoken in their opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, and writing critical books — were defined simultaneously as criminal acts (e.g., a violation of Articles 70 or 190-1), symptoms of mental illness (e.g., "delusion of reformism"), and susceptible to a ready-made diagnosis (e.g., "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=26}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report (Russian translation)|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

The psychiatric incarceration of certain individuals was prompted by their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities.{{sfn|Chodoff|1985}} The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, was considered to be a form of mental illness that required treatment.{{sfn|Pospielovsky|1988|pp=36, 140, 156, 178–181}} The [[KGB]] routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds.{{sfn|Murray|1983}} Highly classified government documents which have become available after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009a|year2=2013a}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2013a|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Fedenko|2009}}; see some documents in {{harvnb|Pozharov|1999}}; {{harvnb|Soviet Archives|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Commentary" to the post-Soviet ''Russian Federation Law on Psychiatric Care'', individuals forced to undergo treatment in Soviet psychiatric medical institutions were entitled to rehabilitation in accordance with the established procedure and could claim compensation. The [[Russian Federation]] acknowledged that before 1991 psychiatry had been used for political purposes and took responsibility for the victims of "political psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2002}}; {{harvnb|Pshizov|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[political abuse of psychiatry in Russia]] has continued, nevertheless, since the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2013a|pp=16–18}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights activists may still face the threat of a psychiatric diagnosis for their legitimate civic and political activities.{{sfn|NPZ|2005}}

Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entails the [[exculpation]] and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria.&lt;ref name=Gluzman&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009b|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms "Soviet political psychiatry"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abouelleil|Bingham|2014}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=189}}; {{harvnb|Kadarkay|1982|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=260}}; {{harvnb|Laqueur|1980|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Munro|2002a|p=179}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Rejali|2009|p=395}}; {{harvnb|Smythies|1973}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2010b|loc1=p. 95|year2=2013b}}; {{harvnb|Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "punitive psychiatry" to refer to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adler|Gluzman|1993}}; {{harvnb|Amnesty International|1991|pp=9, 64}}; {{harvnb|Ball|Farr|1984|p=258}};  {{harvnb|Bebtschuk|Smirnova|Khayretdinov|2012}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|pp=292, 293, 294}}; {{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2001|pp=84, 108}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}; {{harvnb|Fedor|2011|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Ghodse|2011|p=422}}; {{harvnb|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Gushansky|2005|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Horvath|2014}}; {{harvnb|Joffe|1984}}; {{harvnb|Kekelidze|2013b}}; {{harvnb|Khvorostianov|Elias|2015}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|pp=7, 47, 60, 67, 77, 259, 291}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Koryagin|year1=1988||year2=1989}}; {{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Leontev|2010}}; {{harvnb|Magalif|2010}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|1980|pp=10, 57, 136}}; {{harvnb|Pukhovsky|2001|pp=243, 252}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2005b}}; {{harvnb|Schmidt|Shchurko|2014}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=2004|year2=2006}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Vitaliev|1991|p=148}}; {{harvnb|Voren|Bloch|1989|pp=92, 95, 98}}; {{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Zile|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Punitive Medicine'' (1979) [[Alexander Podrabinek]] defined the term "punitive medicine", which is identified with "punitive psychiatry," as "a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means."{{sfn|Podrabinek|1980|p=63}} Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to serve the diktats of power.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Alexéyeff|1976}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] and [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote in their joint ''A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissenters'', "the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of dissent... as a psychiatric problem."{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}

=== An inherent capacity for abuse ===

Psychiatry possesses an inherent capacity for abuse that is greater than in other areas of medicine.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of the detainee and in the broader interests of society.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive.{{sfn|Malterud|Hunskaar|2002|p=94}} In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}}

In the period from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as [[Communist Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=66}} The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience.{{sfn|Semple|Smyth|2013|p=6}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} In many countries, political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.{{sfn|Noll|2007|p=3}}

In the Soviet Union, [[dissident]]s were often confined in the so-called ''[[psikhushka]]'', or psychiatric wards.{{sfn|Matvejević|2004|p=32}} ''Psikhushka'' is the [[Russian language|Russian]] ironic diminutive for "mental hospital".{{sfn|Hunt|1998|p=xii}} One of the first ''psikhushkas'' was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of [[Kazan]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 10, 31 October 1969 — 10.10 "The Kazan Special Psychiatric Hospital".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, it was transferred to the control of the [[NKVD]] (the secret police and precursor of the [[KGB]]) on the orders of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the head of the NKVD.{{sfn|Birstein|2004}} International [[human rights defenders]] such as [[Walter Reich]] have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in ''Psikhushka'' hospitals diagnosed [[schizophrenia]] in political dissenters.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=292}}

=== Under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev ===

As early as 1948, the Soviet secret service took an interest in this area of medicine.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} One of those with overall responsibility for the [[Soviet secret police]], pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=495}} Russian psychiatrist [[Pyotr Gannushkin]] also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasilenko|2004|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Chernosvitov|2002|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime.{{sfn|Keukens|Voren|2007}}

Punitive psychiatry was not simply an inheritance from the Stalin era, however, according to Alexander Etkind. The [[GULag]], or Chief Administration for Corrective Labor Camps, was an effective instrument of political repression. There was no compelling requirement to develop an alternative and more expensive psychiatric substitute.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}} The abuse of psychiatry was a natural product of the later Soviet era.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}} From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, the structure of the USSR mental health service conformed to the double standard in society, being represented by two distinct systems which co-existed peacefully for the most part, despite periodic conflicts between them:
# system one was that of punitive psychiatry. It directly served the authorities and those in power, and was headed by the [[Serbsky Institute|Moscow Institute for Forensic Psychiatry]] named in honour of [[Vladimir Serbsky]];
# system two was made up of elite, psychotherapeutically oriented clinics. It was headed by the [[Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute|Leningrad Psychoneurological Institute]] named in memory of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]].{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}
The hundreds of hospitals in the provinces combined elements of both systems.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}

If someone was mentally ill then, he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and confined there until his dying day.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} If his mental health was uncertain but he was not constantly unwell, he and his ''kharakteristika'' [testimonial from employers, the Party and other Soviet institutions] were sent to a labour camp or to be shot.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} When allusions to [[socialist legality]] started to be made, it was decided to prosecute such people.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} Soon it became apparent that putting people who gave anti-Soviet speeches on trial only made matters worse for the regime. Such individuals were no longer tried in court. Instead they were given a psychiatric examination and declared insane.{{sfn|Demina|2008}}

== The Joint Session, October 1951 ==
{{main|Pavlovian session}}
In the 1950s, the psychiatrists of the Soviet Union turned themselves into the medical arm of the Gulag State.{{sfn|Lakritz|2009}} A precursor of later abuses in psychiatry in the Soviet Union, the "Joint Session" of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]] and the Board of the All-Union Neurological and Psychiatric Association took place from 10 to 15 October 1951. The event was dedicated, supposedly, to the great Russian physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] and alleged that several of the USSR's leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists of the time (among them [[Grunya Sukhareva]], [[Vasily Gilyarovsky]], [[Raisa Golant]], [[Aleksandr Shmaryan]], and [[Mikhail Gurevich (psychiatrist)|Mikhail Gurevich]]) were guilty of practicing "anti-Pavlovian, anti-Marxist, idealistic [and] reactionary" science, and this was damaging to Soviet psychiatry.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

During the Joint Session, these eminent psychiatrists, motivated by fear, had to publicly admit that their scientific positions were erroneous and they also had to promise to conform to "Pavlovian" doctrines.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} These public declarations of obedience proved insufficient. In the closing speech [[Snezhnevsky]], the lead author of the Session's policy report, stated that the accused psychiatrists "have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in the old anti-Pavlovian positions", thereby causing "grave damage to the Soviet psychiatric research and practice". The vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them of "diligently worshipping the dirty source of American pseudo-science".{{sfn|Savenko|2009a}} Those who articulated these accusations at the Joint Session — among them [[Irina Strelchuk]], [[Vasily Banshchikov]], [[Oleg Kerbikov]], and Snezhnevsky — were distinguished by their careerist ambition and fear for their own positions.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} Not surprisingly, many of them were promoted and appointed to leadership posts shortly after the session.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

The Joint Session also had a negative impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as [[Pyotr Anokhin]], [[Aleksey Speransky]], [[Lina Stern]], [[Ivan Beritashvili]], and [[Leon Orbeli]]. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} Pseudo-science took control.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

Following a previous joint session of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (28 June–4 July 1950) and the 10-15 October 1951 joint session of the Presidium of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Board of the All-Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists, Snezhnevky's schoolthe was given the leading role.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=101}} The 1950 decision to give monopoly over psychiatry to the Pavlovian school of Snezhnevsky was one of the crucial factors in the rise of political psychiatry.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=494}} The Soviet doctors, under the incentive of Snezhnevsky, devised a "Pavlovian theory of schizophrenia" and increasingly applied this diagnostic category to political dissidents.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=30}}

== "Sluggish schizophrenia" ==
{{main|Sluggish schizophrenia}}
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"The incarceration of free thinking healthy people in madhouses is spiritual murder, it is a variation of the gas chamber, even more cruel; the torture of the people being killed is more malicious and more prolonged. Like the gas chambers, these crimes will never be forgotten and those involved in them will be condemned for all time during their life and after their death."{{sfn|Sagan|Jonsen|1976}} &lt;small&gt;([[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]" in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes.{{sfn|Katona|Robertson|2005|p=77}} It was the diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia" that was most prominently used in cases of dissidents.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} Sluggish schizophrenia as one of the new diagnostic categories was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression in the name of a political system.{{sfn|Tobin|2013}} According to the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]] chief executive [[Robert van Voren]], the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the conception that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally sick since there was no other logical rationale why one would oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The diagnosis "sluggish schizophrenia," a longstanding concept further developed by the Moscow School of Psychiatry and particularly by its chief Snezhnevsky, furnished a very handy framework for explaining this behavior.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}}

The weight of scholarly opinion holds that the psychiatrists who played the primary role in the development of this diagnostic concept were following directives from the [[Communist Party]] and the Soviet secret service, or [[KGB]], and were well aware of the political uses to which it would be put. Nevertheless, for many Soviet psychiatrists "sluggish schizophrenia" appeared to be a logical explanation to apply to the behavior of critics of the regime who, in their opposition, seemed willing to jeopardize their happiness, family, and career for a reformist conviction or ideal that was so apparently divergent from the prevailing social and political orthodoxy.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}}

Snezhnevsky, the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel [[classification of mental disorders]] postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of [[psychopathy]], [[hypochondria]], [[depersonalization]] or [[anxiety]] were central to it.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Symptoms referred to as part of the "negative axis" included [[pessimism]], poor [[social adaptation]], and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to the untrained eye.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Thereby patients with non-psychotic mental disorders, or even persons who were not mentally sick, could be easily labelled with the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Along with [[paranoia]], sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} As per the theories of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, schizophrenia was much more prevalent than previously considered since the illness could be presented with comparatively slight symptoms and only progress afterwards.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} As a consequence, schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in Moscow than in cities of other countries, as ''the World Health Organization Pilot Study on Schizophrenia'' reported in 1973.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The city with the highest prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow.{{sfn|Park|Park|Jun|Kim|2014}} In particular, the scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in the social sense.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} Their symptoms could be like those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} Thereby, sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as "reform delusions," "perseverance," and "struggle for the truth."{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} As [[Viktor Styazhkin]] reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient "develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an academy of human happiness, and many other projects for the benefit of mankind."{{sfn|Styazhkin|1992|p=66}}

In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which contained ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred critique of the political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=19}} Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European countries]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=18}}

On the covert orders of the [[KGB]], thousands of social and political reformers—Soviet "dissidents"—were incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of "sluggish schizophrenia", a disease fabricated by Snezhnevsky and "Moscow school" of psychiatry.{{sfn|Healey|2011}} American psychiatrist [[Alan A. Stone]] stated that Western criticism of Soviet psychiatry aimed at Snezhnevsky personally, because he was essentially responsible for the Soviet concept of schizophrenia with a "sluggish type" manifestation by "reformerism" including other symptoms.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=8}} One can readily apply this diagnostic scheme to dissenters.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=8}} Snezhnevsky was long attacked in the West as an exemplar of psychiatric abuse in the USSR.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} The leading critics implied that Snezhnevsky had designed the Soviet model of schizophrenia and this diagnosis to make political dissent into a mental disease.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis which could be bent for political purposes, and he himself diagnosed or was involved in a series of famous dissident cases,{{sfn|Reich|1983}} and, in dozens of cases, he personally signed a commission decision on legal insanity of mentally healthy dissidents including [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Leonid Plyushch]], [[:uk:Плахотнюк Микола Григорович|Mikola Plakhotnyuk]],{{sfn|Gluzman|2013c}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]].{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}}

== Beginning of the trend toward mass abuse ==

=== From Khrushchev to Andropov ===
The campaign to declare political opponents mentally sick and to commit dissenters to mental hospitals began in the late 1950s and early 1960s.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] commented on the emergence of the political abuse of psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Boukovsky, ''Jugement a Moscou'', Robert Laffont: Paris, 1996, "Le Goulag psychiatrique", p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reckoned that it was impossible for people in a socialist society to have an anti-socialist consciousness. Whenever manifestations of dissidence could not be justified as a provocation of world imperialism or a legacy of the past, they were self-evidently the product of mental disease.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} In a speech published in the  ''[[Pravda]]'' daily newspaper on 24 May 1959, Khrushchev said:
{{quote|A crime is a deviation from generally recognized standards of behavior frequently caused by mental disorder. Can there be diseases, nervous disorders among certain people in a Communist society? Evidently yes. If that is so, then there will also be offences, which are characteristic of people with abnormal minds. Of those who might start calling for opposition to Communism on this basis, we can say that clearly their mental state is not normal.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}}}}

[[File:RIAN archive 101740 Yury Andropov, Chairman of KGB.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yuri Andropov]] (1914–1984), a [[KGB Chairman]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the CPSU]]]]
The now available evidence supports the conclusion that the system of political abuse of psychiatry was carefully designed by the KGB to rid the USSR of undesirable elements.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=4}} According to several available documents and a message by a former general of the Fifth (dissident) Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB to Robert van Voren, political abuse of psychiatry as a systematic method of repression was developed by Yuri Andropov along with a selected group of associates.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=8}}

Andropov was in charge of the wide-ranging deployment of psychiatric repression from the moment he was appointed to head the KGB.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|pp=187–188}} He became [[KGB Chairman]] on 18 May 1967.{{sfn|Rhoer|1983|p=52}} On 3 July 1967, he made a proposal to establish a Fifth Directorate (ideological counterintelligence) within the KGB to deal with internal political opposition to the Soviet regime.{{sfn|Nuti|2009|p=29}}{{sfn|Albats|1995|p=177}} The Directorate was set up at the end of July and took charge of KGB files on all Soviet dissidents, including [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]].{{sfn|Nuti|2009|p=29}} In 1968, KGB Chairman Andropov issued a departmental order "On the tasks of State security agencies in combating the ideological sabotage by the adversary", calling for the KGB to struggle against dissidents and their imperialist masters.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|1999|p=7}} His aim was "the destruction of dissent in all its forms" and he insisted that the positions of the capitalist countries on human rights, and their criticisms of the Soviet Union and its own politics of human rights from these positions, was just one part of a wide-ranging imperialist plot to undermine the Soviet state's foundation.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|1999|p=7}} Similar ideas can be found in the 1983 book ''Speeches and Writings'' by Andropov published when he had become General Secretary of the CPSU:{{sfn|Lambelet|1989}}
{{quote|[w]hen analyzing the main trend in present-day bourgeois criticism of [Soviet] human rights policies one is bound to draw the conclusion that although this criticism is camouflaged with "concern" for freedom, democracy, and human rights, it is directed in fact against the socialist essence of Soviet society...}}

=== Implementation and the legal framework ===
On 29 April 1969, Andropov submitted an elaborate plan to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]  to set up a network of mental hospitals that would defend the "Soviet Government and the socialist order" from dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albats|1995|p=177}}{{harvnb|Luty|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To persuade his fellow Politburo members of the risk posed by the mentally ill, Andropov circulated a report from the Krasnodar Region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/22-january-1970-pb-151xiii/ The Bukovsky Archives, 22 January 1970 (Pb 151/XIII).]&lt;/ref&gt; A secret resolution of the [[USSR Council of Ministers]] was adopted.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=176}} Andropov's proposal to use psychiatry for struggle against dissenters was adopted and implemented.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=42}}

In 1929, the USSR had 70 psychiatric hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935, this had increased to 102 psychiatric hospitals and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric beds in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tiganov|1999|p=333}} The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974, the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/22-february-1972-st-3119/ The Bukovsky Archives, 22 February 1972 (St 31/19).]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an expansion in the number of psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=47}} Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=47}}

On 15 May 1969, a Soviet Government decree (No. 345–209) was issued "On measures for preventing dangerous behavior (acts) on the part of mentally ill persons."{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} This decree confirmed the practice of having undesirables hauled into detention by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} Soviet psychiatrists were told whom they should examine and were assured that they might detain these individuals with the help of the police or entrap them into coming to the hospital.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} The psychiatrists thereby doubled as interrogators and as arresting officers.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} Doctors fabricated a diagnosis requiring detention and no court decision was required for subjecting the individual to indefinite confinement in a psychiatric institution.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}}

By the end of the 1950s, confinement to a psychiatric institution had become the most commonly used method of punishing leaders of the political opposition.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} In the 1960s and 1970s, the trials of dissenters and their referral for "treatment" to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals under MVD control and oversight&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 12, 28 February 1970 — 12.2 "The trial of P.G. Grigorenko", CCE No 13, 28 April 1970 — 13.8 "The trial of Ivan Yakhimovich and other trials", CCE No 15, 31 August 1970 — 15.1 "The trial of Natalya Gorbanevskaya".&lt;/ref&gt; came out into the open, and the world learned of a wave of "psychiatric terror" which was flatly denied by those in charge of the [[Serbsky Institute]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=41}} The bulk of psychiatric repression spans the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}} As CPSU General Secretary, from November 1982 to February 1984, Yury Andropov demonstrated little patience with domestic dissafection and continued the Brezhnev Era policy of confining dissenters in mental hospitals.{{sfn|Schultz|2011|p=19}}

== Examination and hospitalization ==
Political dissidents were usually charged under Articles 70 (agitation and propaganda against the Soviet state) and 190-1 (dissemination of false fabrications defaming the Soviet state and social system) of the RSFSR Criminal Code.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Forensic psychiatrists were asked to examine offenders whose mental state was considered abnormal by the investigating officers.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

In almost every case, dissidents were examined at the Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=78}} in Moscow, where persons being prosecuted in court for committing political crimes were subjected to a forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}} Once certified, the accused and convicted were sent for [[involuntary treatment]] to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals controlled by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}}

The accused had no right of appeal.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} The right was given to their relatives or other interested persons but they were not allowed to nominate psychiatrists to take part in the evaluation, because all psychiatrists were considered fully independent and equally credible before the law.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

According to dissident poet [[Naum Korzhavin]], the atmosphere at the Serbsky Institute in [[Moscow]] altered almost overnight when [[Daniil Lunts]] took over as head of the Fourth Department (otherwise known as the Political Department).{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Previously, psychiatric departments were regarded as a 'refuge' against being dispatched to the [[Gulag]]. Now that policy altered.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} The first reports of dissenters being hospitalized on non-medical grounds date from the early 1960s, not long after Georgy Morozov was appointed director of the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Both Morozov and Lunts were personally involved in numerous well-known cases and were notorious abusers of psychiatry for political purposes.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Most prisoners, in [[Viktor Nekipelov]]'s words, characterized Daniil Lunts as "no better than the criminal doctors who performed inhuman experiments on the prisoners in [[Nazi concentration camp]]s."{{sfn|Applebaum|2003|p=549}} Indeed, experimentation took place on patients, including sleep deprivation and exposure to electromagnetic radiation for the inducement of auditory hallucinations.

A well-documented practice was the use of psychiatric hospitals as temporary prisons during the two or three weeks around the 7 November ([[October Revolution]]) Day and [[May Day]] celebrations, to isolate "socially dangerous" persons who otherwise might protest in public or manifest other deviant behavior.{{sfn|Bloch|1978}}

== Struggle against abuse ==
{{main|Struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}
In the 1960s, a vigorous movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.{{sfn|Fernando|2003|p=160}} Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced in the course of the Congresses of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] in [[Mexico City]] (1971), [[Hawaii]] (1977), [[Vienna]] (1983) and [[Athens]] (1989).{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the [[Cold War]], inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Healey|2011}}

== Classification of the victims ==
{{main|Cases of political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}

Upon analysis of over 200 well-authenticated cases covering the period 1962–1976, Sidney Bloch and Peter Reddaway developed a classification of the victims of Soviet psychiatric abuse. They were classified as:{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=30}}
# advocates of human rights or democratization;
# nationalists;
# would-be emigrants;
# religious believers;
# citizens inconvenient to the authorities.
The advocates of human rights and democratization, according to Bloch and Reddaway, made up about half the dissidents repressed by means of psychiatry.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=30}} Nationalists made up about one-tenth of the dissident population dealt with psychiatrically.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=31}} Would-be emigrants constituted about one-fifth of dissidents victimized by means of psychiatry.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=32}} People detained only because of their religious activity made up about fifteen per cent of dissident-patients.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=32}} Citizens inconvenient to the authorities because of their "obdurate" complaints about bureaucratic excesses and abuses accounted for about five per cent of dissidents subject to psychiatric abuse.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=33}}

== Incomplete figures ==
In 1985, Peter Reddaway and Sidney Bloch provided documented data on some five hundred cases in their book ''Soviet Psychiatric Abuse''.{{sfn|Finlayson|1987}}

=== True scale of repression ===

On basis of the available data and materials accumulated in the archives of the [[International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry]], one can confidently conclude that thousands of dissenters were hospitalized for political reasons.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} From 1994 to 1995, an investigative commission of Moscow psychiatrists explored the records of five prison psychiatric hospitals in Russia and discovered about two thousand cases of political abuse of psychiatry in these hospitals alone.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} In 2004, [[Anatoly Prokopenko]] said he was surprised at the facts obtained by him from the official classified top secret documents by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]], by the KGB, and MVD.{{sfn|Baburin|2004}} According to his calculations based on what he found in the documents, about 15,000 people were confined for political crimes in the psychiatric prison hospitals under the control of the MVD.{{sfn|Baburin|2004}} In 2005, referring to the Archives of the CPSU Central Committee and the records of the three Special Psychiatrial Hospitals&amp;nbsp;— Sychyovskaya, Leningrad and Chernyakhovsk hospitals&amp;nbsp;— to which human rights activists gained access in 1991, Prokopenko concluded that psychiatry had been used as punitive measure against about 20,000 people for purely political reasons.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} This was only a small part of the total picture, Prokopenko said. The data on the total number of people who had been held in all sixteen prison hospitals and in the 1,500 "open" psychiatric hospitals remains unknown because parts of the archives of the prison psychiatric hospitals and hospitals in general are classified and inaccessible.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} The figure of fifteen or twenty thousand political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals run by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was first put forward by Prokopenko in the 1997 book ''Mad Psychiatry'' ("Безумная психиатрия"),{{sfn|Prokopenko|1997|p=154}} which was republished in 2005.{{sfn|Prokopenko|2005|p=187}}

An indication of the extent of the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR is provided by [[Semyon Gluzman]]'s calculation that the percentage of "the mentally ill" among those accused of so-called anti-Soviet activities proved many times higher than among criminal offenders.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; The attention paid to political prisoners by Soviet psychiatrists was more than 40 times greater than their attention to ordinary criminal offenders.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}} This derives from the following comparison: 1–2 % of all the forensic psychiatric examinations carried out by the Serbsky Institute targeted those accused of anti-Soviet activities;{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; convicted dissidents in penal institutions made up 0.05% of the total number of convicts;{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; 1–2 % is 40 times greater than 0.05%.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt;

According to Viktor Luneyev, the struggle against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We do not know how many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=373}} No objective assessment of the total number of repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}} The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}} They are scattered between the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]], the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee ([[Goskomstat]]), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs ([[MVD (Russia)|MVD of Russia]]), the [[FSB (Russia)|FSB of Russia]], the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former [[Soviet Republics]], now the 11 independent countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] or the three Baltic States ([[Baltics]]).{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}}

=== Concealment of the data ===

According to Russian psychiatrist [[Emmanuil Gushansky]], the scale of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed.&lt;ref name=Gushansky&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gushansky|year1=1999|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs ([[MVD]]) and Health ([[USSR Health Ministry]]), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; [[Dan Healey]] shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: the contents of the main archives are still classified and inaccessible.{{sfn|Healey|2014}} Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} where Gluzman saw them in 1989.{{sfn|Gluzman|2009a}} All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.{{sfn|Gluzman|2009a}}

[[Anatoly Sobchak]], the former [[Mayor of Saint Petersburg]], wrote:
{{quote|The scale of the application of methods of repressive psychiatry in the USSR is testified by inexorable figures and facts. A commission of the top Party leadership headed by [[Alexei Kosygin]] reached a decision in 1978 to build 80 psychiatric hospitals and 8 special psychiatric institutions in addition to those already in existence. Their construction was to be completed by 1990. They were to be built in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Kemerovo]], [[Samara, Russia|Kuibyshev]], [[Novosibirsk]], and other parts of the Soviet Union. In the course of the changes that the country underwent in 1988, five prison hospitals were transferred from the MVD to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, while another five were closed down. There was a hurried covering of tracks through the mass rehabilitation of patients, some of whom were mentally disabled (in one and the same year no less than 800,000 patients were removed from the psychiatric registry). In Leningrad alone 60,000 people with a diagnosis of mental illness were released and rehabilitated in 1991 and 1992. In 1978, 4.5 million people throughout the USSR were registered as psychiatric patients. This was equivalent to the population of many civilized countries.{{sfn|Sobchak|2005|pp=6–7}}}}

In Ukraine, a study of the origins of the political abuse of psychiatry was conducted for five years on the basis of the State archives.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}} A total of 60 people were again examined.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}} All were citizens of Ukraine, convicted of political crimes and hospitalized on the territory of Ukraine. Not one of them, it turned out, was in need of any psychiatric treatment.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}}

From 1993 to 1995, a presidential decree on measures to prevent future abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, at the request of Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]], to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control).{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]].{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}}

The report on political abuse of psychiatry prepared at the request of the Commission by Gushansky with the aid of Prokopenko lay unclaimed and even the ''Independent Psychiatric Journal'' ([[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]])&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; would not publish it. The [[Moscow Research Center for Human Rights]] headed by [[Boris Altshuler]] and [[Alexei Yuryevich Smirnov|Alexei Smirnov]] and the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia whose president is [[Yuri Savenko]] were asked by Gushansky to publish the materials and archival documents on punitive psychiatry but showed no interest in doing so.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=34}} Publishing such documents is dictated by present-day needs and by how far it is feared that psychiatry could again be abused for non-medical purposes.{{sfn|Gushansky|2005|p=33}}

In its 2000 report, the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression included only the following four phrases about the political abuse of psychiatry:{{sfn|Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims|2000}}
{{quote|The Commission has also considered such a complex, socially relevant issue, as the use of psychiatry for political purposes. The collected documents and materials allow us to say that the extrajudicial procedure of admission to psychiatric hospitals was used for compulsory hospitalization of persons whose behavior was viewed by the authorities as "suspicious" from the political point of view. According to the incomplete data, hundreds of thousands of people have been illegally placed to psychiatric institutions of the country over the years of Soviet power. The rehabilitation of these people was limited, at best, to their removal from the registry of psychiatric patients and usually remains so today, due to gaps in the legislation.}}

In the 1988 and 1989, about two million people were removed from the psychiatric registry at the request of Western psychiatrists.

== Theoretical analysis ==
In 1990, ''Psychiatric Bulletin of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]'' published the article "Compulsion in psychiatry: blessing or curse?" by Russian psychiatrist [[Anatoly Koryagin]]. It contains analysis of the abuse of psychiatry and eight arguments by which the existence of a system of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR can easily be demonstrated. As Koryagin wrote, in a dictatorial State with a totalitarian regime, such as the USSR, the laws have at all times served not the purpose of self-regulation of the life of society but have been one of the major levers by which to manipulate the behavior of subjects. Every Soviet citizen has constantly been straight considered state property and been regarded not as the aim, but as a means to achieve the rulers' objectives. From the perspective of state pragmatism, a mentally sick person was regarded as a burden to society, using up the state's material means without recompense and not producing anything, and even potentially capable of inflicting harm. Therefore, the Soviet State never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients' life. It was only instructions of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them. A person with a mental disorder was automatically divested of all rights and depended entirely on the psychiatrists' will. Practically anybody could undergo psychiatric examination on the most senseless grounds and the issued diagnosis turned him into a person without rights. It was this lack of legal rights and guarantees that advantaged a system of repressive psychiatry in the country.{{sfn|Koryagin|1990}}

According to American psychiatrist Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did not have any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the [[USSR Ministry of Health]]. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered not. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.{{sfn|Lapshin|2003}}

According to Yuri Savenko, the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia (the IPA), punitive psychiatry arises on the basis of the interference of three main factors:&lt;ref name=Savenko&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ideologizing of science, its breakaway from the achievements of world psychiatry, the party orientation of Soviet forensic psychiatry.
# The lack of legal basis.
# The total nationalization of mental health service.
Their interaction system is principally sociological: the presence of the Penal Code article on slandering the state system inevitably results in sending a certain percentage of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Thus, it is not psychiatry itself that is punitive, but the totalitarian state uses psychiatry for punitive purposes with ease.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}}

According to [[Larry Gostin]], the root cause of the problem was the State itself.{{sfn|Gostin|1986}} The definition of danger was radically extended by the Soviet criminal system to cover "political" as well as customary physical types of "danger".{{sfn|Gostin|1986}} As Bloch and Reddaway note, there are no objective reliable criteria to determine whether the person's behavior will be dangerous, and approaches to the definition of dangerousness greatly differ among psychiatrists.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=29}}

[[Richard Bonnie]], a professor of law and medicine at the [[University of Virginia School of Law]], mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward the repressive objectives of the state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state as one of the most substantial lessons from the period.{{sfn|Moran|2010}}

According to [[Norman Sartorius]], a former president of the [[World Psychiatric Association]], political abuse of psychiatry in the former Soviet Union was facilitated by the fact that the national classification included categories that could be employed to label dissenters, who could then be forcibly incarcerated and kept in psychiatric hospitals for "treatment".{{sfn|Sartorius|2010}} Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the [[DSM-5]] task force, has a similar opinion that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was sustained by the existence of a classification developed in the Soviet Union and used to organize psychiatric treatment and care.{{sfn|Regier|2011|p=75}} In this classification, there were categories with diagnoses that could be given to political dissenters and led to the harmful involuntary medication.{{sfn|Regier|2011|p=75}}

According to Moscow psychiatrist [[Alexander Danilin]], the so-called "nosological" approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Snezhnevsky boiles down to the ability to make the only diagnosis, schizophrenia; psychiatry is not science but such a system of opinions and people by the thousands are falling victims to these opinions—millions of lives were crippled by virtue of the concept "sluggish schizophrenia" introduced some time once by an academician Snezhnevsky, whom Danilin called a state criminal.{{sfn|Danilin|2008}}

[[St Petersburg]] academic psychiatrist professor [[Yuri Nuller]] notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} However, Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}}

According to American psychiatrist Walter Reich, the misdiagnoses of dissidents resulted from some characteristics of Soviet psychiatry that were distortions of standard psychiatric logic, theory, and practice.{{sfn|Reich|1983}}

According to [[Semyon Gluzman]], abuse of psychiatry to suppress dissent is based on condition of psychiatry in a totalitarian state.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Psychiatric paradigm of a totalitarian state is culpable for its expansion into spheres which are not initially those of psychiatric competence.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Psychiatry as a social institution, formed and functioning in the totalitarian state, is incapable of not being totalitarian.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Such psychiatry is forced to serve the two differently directed principles: care and treatment of mentally ill citizens, on the one hand, and psychiatric repression of people showing political or ideological dissent, on the other hand.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; In the conditions of the totalitarian state, independent-minded psychiatrists appeared and may again appear, but these few people cannot change the situation in which thousands of others, who were brought up on incorrect pseudoscientific concepts and fear of the state, will sincerely believe that the uninhibited, free thinking of a citizen is a symptom of madness.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Gluzman specifies the following six premises for the unintentional participation of doctors in abuses:&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt;
# The specificity, in the totalitarian state, of the psychiatric paradigm tightly sealed from foreign influences.
# The lack of legal conscience in most citizens including doctors.
# Disregard for fundamental human rights on the part of the lawmaker and law enforcement agencies.
# Declaratory nature or the absence of legislative acts that regulate providing psychiatric care in the country. The USSR, for example, adopted such an act only in 1988.
# The absolute state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally gives rise to the dominance of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice. Professional consciousness of the doctor is based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient's consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).
# The fact, in psychiatric hospitals, of frustratingly bad conditions, which refer primarily to the poverty of health care and inevitably lead to the dehumanization of the personnel including doctors.
Gluzman says that there, of course, may be a different approach to the issue expressed by [[Michel Foucault]].{{sfn|Gluzman|2012|p=xxvii}}
According to [[Michael L. Perlin|Michael Perlin]], Foucault in his book ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' documented the history of using institutional psychiatry as a political tool, researched the expanded use of the public hospitals in the 17th century in France and came to the conclusion that "confinement [was an] answer to an economic crisis... reduction of wages, unemployment, scarcity of coin" and, by the 18th century, the psychiatric hospitals satisfied "the indissociably economic and moral demand for confinement."{{sfn|Perlin|2006}}

In 1977, British psychiatrist [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] asked Foucault the same question which [[Claude Bourdet]] had formerly asked [[Viktor Fainberg]] during a press conference given by Fainberg and [[Leonid Plyushch]]: when the USSR has the whole penitentiary and police apparatus, which could take charge of anybody, and which is perfect in itself, why do they use psychiatry? Foucault answered it was not a question of a ''distortion'' of the use of psychiatry but that was its fundamental project.{{sfn|Foucault|Kritzman|1990|p=182}} In the discussion ''Confinement, Psychiatry, Prison'', Foucault states the cooperation of psychiatrists with the KGB in the Soviet Union was not abuse of medicine, but an evident case and "condensation" of psychiatry's "inheritance", an "intensification, the ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function."{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=129}} Foucault believed that the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR of the 1960s was a logical extension of the invasion of psychiatry into the legal system.{{sfn|Fernando|Ndegwa|Wilson|1998|p=37}} In the discussion with [[Jean Laplanche]] and [[Robert Badinter]], Foucault says that criminologists of the 1880—1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language: "The crime cannot be, for the criminal, but an abnormal, disturbed behavior. If he upsets society, it's because he himself is upset".&lt;ref name=Foucault1&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Foucault, Laplanche &amp; Badinter|year1=1977|year2=1989|loc2=p. 168|year3=2006|loc3=pp. 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the twofold conclusions.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; First, "the judicial apparatus is no longer useful." The judges, as men of law, understand such complex, alien legal issues, purely psychological matters no better than the criminal. So commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for the judicial apparatus.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; And in this vein, concrete projects were proposed.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; Second, "We must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick. But, at the same time, we must protect society against him."&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; Hence comes the idea of mental isolation with a mixed function: therapeutic and prophylactic.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; In the 1900s, these projects have given rise to very lively responses from European judicial and political bodies.&lt;ref name=Foucault2&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Foucault, Laplanche &amp; Badinter|year1=1977|year2=1989|loc2=p. 169|year3=2006|loc3=pp. 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they found a wide field of applications when the Soviet Union became one of the most common but by no means exceptional cases.&lt;ref name=Foucault2/&gt;

According to American psychiatrist Jonas Robitscher, psychiatry has been playing a part in controlling deviant behavior for three hundred years.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}} Vagrants, "originals," eccentrics, and homeless wanderers who did little harm but were vexatious to the society they lived in were, and sometimes still are, confined to psychiatric hospitals or deprived of their legal rights.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}} Some critics of psychiatry consider the practice as a political use of psychiatry and regard psychiatry as promoting timeserving.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}}

As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is difficult for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=40}} This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=40}}

An example of the low threshold is a point of [[Donetsk]] psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The dissidents regard the cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The more such cases, the easier it is to present their personal ill-being as public one.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding "public well-being" as personal one.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} After reading the book ''Institute of Fools'' by [[Viktor Nekipelov]], Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}}

According to the response by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev in his article condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were in a certain sense "on holiday" in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the "gates of hell" from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in [[Chernyakhovsk]], [[Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Kazan]], [[Blagoveshchensk]], and that is not all.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the "treatment" (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin).{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the [[action T4|Nazi euthanasia programs]].&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"&gt;{{harvnb|Trehub|2013}}; {{harvnb|Zakal|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt; The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt; The issue remains highly relevant.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt;

According to Fedor Kondratev, an expert of the Serbsky Center and supporter of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s,{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=46}} those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 ("anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda"), 190-1 ("dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system") made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=178}} It was they who began to be searched for "psychopathological mechanisms" and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=178}} The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization as a result of the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the "exclusively scientific" concept of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating the inner life of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave "in a different way than others do" not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for "psychopathological mechanisms" of his dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all the more, that one needed to administer compulsory treatment "for it" in special psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their "psychopathological mechanisms", but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=180}} Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=182}}

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, with regard to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not to take into account an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}} Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}} While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric [[nomenklatura]] retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}}

As Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko notes, the use of punitive psychiatry allowed of avoiding the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=77}} Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can be based on a preconception.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}}

German psychiattist Hanfried Helmchen says the uncertainty of diagnosis is prone to other than medical influence, e.g., political influence, as was the case with Soviet dissenters who were stifled by a psychiatric diagnosis, especially that of "sluggish schizophrenia," in order to take them away from society in special psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Helmchen|2013}}

According to Russian psychologist Dmitry Leontev, punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union was based on the assumption that only a madman can go against public dogma and seek for truth and justice.{{sfn|Leontev|2010}}

K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: "An important vulnerability factor, therefore, for the abuse of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends."{{sfn|Fulford|Smirnov|Snow|1993}} The concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by American psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adshead|2003}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=1965|year2=1971|year3=1977|year4=1978a|year5=1978b|year6=1987|year7=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he mentioned that these authors, who correctly emphasized the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, failed to accept the role of psychiatric power.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone's being deprived of property, liberty, or life.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} For instance, plastic surgeon's classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient's consent, therefore, there ''cannot'' be any political abuse of plastic surgery.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment.{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} What transforms coercion into therapy are physicians ''diagnosing'' the person's condition a "illness," ''declaring'' the intervention they impose on the victim a "treatment," and legislators and judges ''legitimating'' these categorizations as "illnesses" and "treatments."{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} In the same way, physician-[[eugenicists]] advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons as a form of treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power.{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy.&lt;ref name="Szasz 1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Gosden|2001|p=220}}; {{harvnb|Szasz|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike.&lt;ref name="Szasz 1994"/&gt; Psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been "dissidents."{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} It is the contents and contours of dissent that has changed.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} Before the [[American Civil War]], dissent was constituted by being a Negro and wanting to escape from slavery.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} In Soviet Russia, dissent was constituted by wanting to "reform" [[Marxism]] or emigrate to escape from it.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} As Szasz put it, "the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the "abuse" of such racial classification, because (what we call) its abuse was, in fact, its use."{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the "[[Therapeutic State]]", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed ("cured") through pseudomedical interventions.{{sfn|Costigan|2004|p=17}} Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.{{sfn|Costigan|2004|p=17}}

As Michael Robertson and Garry Walter suppose, psychiatric power in practically all societies expands on the grounds of public safety, which, in the view of the leaders of the USSR, was best maintained by the repression of dissidence.{{sfn|Robertson|Walter|2013|p=86}} According to [[Gwen Adshead]], a British forensic psychotherapist at the [[Broadmoor Hospital]], the question is what is meant by the word "abnormal."{{sfn|Adshead|2003}} Evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as "socially inappropriate."{{sfn|Adshead|2003}} If that is the case, social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by the medical terminology, and thereby becomes an individual's personal problem, not a social matter.{{sfn|Adshead|2003}}

According to Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is the only medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence for the benefit of the patient.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; In Russia, all that goes by opposites.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt;

[[Vladimir Bukovsky]], well known for his [[struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]], explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to the KGB because hospitalization did not have an end date, and, as a result, there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years.{{sfn|Davidoff|2013}} "Once they pump you with drugs, they can forget about you", he said and added, "I saw people who basically were asleep for years."{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007}}

US President [[Ronald Reagan]] attributed the view that the "brutal treatment of Soviet dissidents was due to bureaucratic inertia."{{sfn|Altshuler|2005|p=61}}

== Residual problems ==
In the opinion of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] chairwoman [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]], the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s.{{sfn|NPZ|2004}} The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} When psychiatric profession is discredited in one part of the world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world.{{sfn|Voren|Bloch|1989|p=13}} Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Bloch|1997}} There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.{{sfn|NPZ|2004}}

As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today subjective position of a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence is related to the primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt;

The psychiatrist became a scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; He is feared, is not confided, is not taken into confidence in the secrets of one's soul and is asked to provide only medications.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Psychiatric labels, or [[social stigma|stigmas]], have spread so widely that there is no such thing as the media that does not call a disliked person ''[[schizo]]'' and does not generalize [[psychiatric assessment]]s to phenomena of public life.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The word ''[[psikhushka]]'' entered everyday vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; All persons who deviate from the usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill, with an approving giggling of public.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Not surprisingly, during such a stigmatization, people with real mental disorders fear publicity like the plague.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; [[Vilnius]] psychologist Oleg Lapin has the same point that politicians and the press attach psychological, psychiatric and medical labels; he adds that psychiatry has acquired the new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion.{{sfn|Peters|2014}} Formerly, one could say: you are going against God or God is with us; now one can say: I behave reasonably, adequately, and you do not behave in that way.{{sfn|Peters|2014}} In 2007, [[Alexander Dugin]], a professor at the [[Moscow State University]] and adviser to [[Chairman of the State Duma|State Duma speaker]] [[Sergei Naryshkin]], presented opponents of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s policy as mentally ill by saying, "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sokolov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Pasko|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Moscow Regional Psychiatric Newspaper'' of 2012, psychiatrist Dilya Enikeyeva in violation of [[medical privacy]] and ethics publicized the diagnosis of [[histrionic personality disorder]], which she in absentia gave [[Kseniya Sobchak]], a Russian TV anchor and a member of political opposition, and stated that Sobchak was harmful to society.{{sfn|Savenko|2012}}

Robert van Voren noted that after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], it became apparent that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).{{sfn|Ivanova|1992}}

According to Robert van Voren, although for several years, especially after the implosion of the USSR and during the first years of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} Even the reform efforts made in such places as [[St. Petersburg]], [[Tomsk]], and [[Kaliningrad]] have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}}

Throughout the post-communist period, the pharmaceutical industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=24}} Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=24}}

At the turn of the century, the [[psychiatric reform in Italy|psychiatric reform]] that had been implemented by [[Franco Basaglia]] in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} But when it became clear that even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole.{{sfn|Clark|2014}} As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community.{{sfn|Clark|2014}} Despite the 1992 [[Russian Mental Health Law]], coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period.{{sfn|Bonnie|2002}} In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.{{sfn|Mundt|Frančišković|Gurovich|2012}}

In 2005, the Russian Federation had one of the highest levels of psychiatric beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013.{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation]].{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|NPZ|2008}} Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}} Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need to increase the number of places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}}
[[File:Kiev - hospital2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|One of the buildings of the Pavlov Psychiatric Hospital in [[Kiev]]]]
At his press conference in 2008, [[Semyon Gluzman]] said that the surplus in [[Ukraine]] of hospitals for inpatient treatment of the mentally ill was a relic of the totalitarian communist regime and that Ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow Ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including the Pavlov Hospital where beds in its children's unit alone were more than in the whole of [[Great Britain]].{{sfn|Gluzman press conference|2008}} In Ukraine, public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} They wrote to newspapers, yelled in busy places and around them, behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20-30 people standing by a window of the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] with red flags, portraits of [[Lenin]] and [[Stalin]] and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard: "Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine!"{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the mental health system.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} But in general, it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units: hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat-hospice for helpless "chronic patients" unable to live on their own.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} And between hospital and internat-hospice is desert.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so-called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} A similar pattern is in internats.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms, nursing homes, "halfway houses".{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} Ukraine does not have anything like that.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}}

In the Soviet times, mental hospitals were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Sofia Dorinskaya, a human rights activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who have been living in a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home.{{sfn|Dorinskaya|2014|p=37}} [[Deinstitutionalization]] has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of [[xenophobia]].{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}}

Traditional values have endured the attempt by western institutions to impose a positive image of deviant behavior.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} For instance, in spite of the removal of [[homosexuality]] from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the [[Rostov Region]] view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The psychiatrists sustain the ban on [[Pride parade|gay parade]]s and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to [[Dozhd]] says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the [[World Health Organization]] removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true.{{sfn|Kekelidze|2013a}} Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to [[antipsychiatry|antipsychiatric actions]], and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one.{{sfn|Savenko|Vinogradova|2005}} In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}}

In 1994, there was organized a conference concerned with the theme of political abuse of psychiatry and attended by representatives from different former [[Soviet Republics]]&amp;nbsp;— from Russia, [[Belarus]], [[the Baltics]], [[the Caucasus]], and some of the [[Central Asian Republics]].{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} [[Dainius Puras]] made a report on the situation within the [[Lithuanian Psychiatric Association]], where discussion had been held but no resolution had been passed.{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} [[Yuri Nuller]] talked over how in Russia the wind direction was gradually changing and the systematic political abuse of psychiatry was again being denied and degraded as an issue of "hyperdiagnosis" or "scientific disagreement."{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} It was particularly noteworthy that [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]], the then Director of the [[Serbsky Institute]], was a proponent of such belittlement.{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} This was not so queer, because she was a close friend of the key architects of "political psychiatry."{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}}

In the early 1990s, she spoke the required words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry{{sfn|Svetova|2007}} which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and suppression of the human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution.{{sfn|Savenko|2004b}} Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper ''[[Chas Pik]]'' within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Savenko|2004b}}; {{harvnb|Svetova|2007|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in her 2001 book ''Aliyans Prava i Milosediya'' (''The Alliance of Law and Mercy''), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries.{{sfn|Savenko|2004b}} Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor [[Vladimir Serbsky]] and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the [[police department]] in preventing [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]] and bloodsheds and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorelik|2003}}; {{harvnb|Savenko|2004b}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of "punitive psychiatry" had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Blomfield|2007b}} After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared "patient" [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly "psychopathic".{{sfn|Blomfield|2007b}}

While speaking of the Serbsky Center, Yuri Savenko alleges that "practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in the past." Attorney [[Karen Nersisyan]] agrees: "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power."{{sfn|Glasser|2002}} According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} She says we have a situation like after the defeat of [[fascism]] in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}}

In his article of 2002, [[Alan A. Stone]], who as a member of team had examined [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] and found him mentally healthy in 1979,{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=74}} disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR.{{sfn|Munro|2002b}} He asserted that it was time for psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} In Stone's words, he believes that [[Snezhnevsky]] was wrongly condemned by critics.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Stone|year1=1984|year2=1985|loc2=p. 72|year3=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, a disastrous factor for domestic psychiatry is that those who had committed the [[crime against humanity]] were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public has been reduced to making a business of [[psychopharmacologic]] drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the [[CPSU]] [[nomenklatura]], which they remained so far.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg.&lt;ref&gt;abbreviation expansion: organizer of a party group&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his [[dissertation]].{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}}

Robert van Voren also says Russian psychiatry is now being headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry that was in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Russian psychiatrists do not have access to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]] has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years.{{sfn|Voren|2012}} Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.{{sfn|Voren|2012}}

Many of the current leaders of Russian psychiatry, especially those who were related to the establishment in Soviet period, have resiled from their avowal read at the 1989 General Assembly of the WPA that Soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes.{{sfn|Dudley|Silove|Gale|2012|p=237}} Among such leaders who did so is [[Aleksandr Tiganov]], a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, the director of its Mental Health Research Center, and the chief psychiatrist of the [[Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation]]. In 2011, when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority, Tiganov answered, "These people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on the psychiatric registry."{{sfn|Vyzhutovich|2011}} According to Tiganov, it was rumored that Snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a special hospital to save them from a prison, but it is not true, he honestly did his medical duty.{{sfn|Vyzhutovich|2011}} The same ideas are voiced in the 2014 interview by Anatoly Smulevich, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; he says what was attributed to Snesnevsky was that he recognized the healthy as the ill, it did not happen and is pure slander, it is completely ruled out for him to give a diagnosis to a healthy person.{{sfn|Smulevich|Morozov|2014}}

In 2007, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of the leading staff members of the Serbsky Center, strongly degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} In his opinion, "now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people."{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} In 2012, Vinogradov said the same, "Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, I talked with them. As for the dissident General Grigorenko, I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, as you know... Who? Bukovsky? I talked with him, and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so."{{sfn|Mishina|2012}} In the same year, he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it "has never been used for political persecution." Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov's words, "are not very mentally healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|RSN|2012}}; {{harvnb|NG|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian psychiatrist Fedor Kondratev not only denied accusations that he was ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that the very conception of the existence of Soviet-era "punitive psychiatry" was nothing more than: "the fantasy [vymysel] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [previously] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends."{{sfn|Fedor|2011|p=177}} He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror, he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} As [[Alexander Podrabinek]] writes, psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public's indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now, they do not notice this public, allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion.{{sfn|Podrabinek|2014}} In response to the article by Podrabinek, Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under [[Russian Civil Code]] Article 152 on protecting one's honor, dignity and business reputation.{{sfn|Kondratev|2014}} According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich, official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the groundlessness of their diagnostics and actions.{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|2012}} The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and, especially, in Russia.{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|2012}} As Russian-American historian Georgi Chernyavsky writes, after the fall of the communist regime, no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards, foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered, that they did not give dissidents diagnoses-sentences, or that, at least, these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities, no matter how the doctors, if one may call them so, try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts, it is undoable.{{sfn|Chernyavsky|2005|p=9–10}}

In 2004, Savenko stated that the passed law on the state expert activity and the introduction of the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is the only one in the country and is located in her Center.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} No one had ever had such a monopoly.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}}

According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center has long labored to legalize its monopolistic position of the Main expert institution of the country.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center to get in touch over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have turned out to be a considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.{{sfn|Clark|2014}}

On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko wrote to the then [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] an [[open letter]], in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the [[State Duma]] a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}} The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped to such an extent that it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}} According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}}

On 15 June 2009, the working group chaired by the Director of the Serbsky Center Tatyana Dmitrieva sent the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]] a joint application whose purport was to declare appealing against the forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against the reports.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} The reason put forward for the proposal was that the appeals against the expert reports were allegedly filed "without regard for the scope of the case" and that one must appeal against the expert report "only together with the sentence."{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} In other words, according to Yuri Savenko, all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue of the fact that they were infiltrated into the sentence.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} That is cynicism of administrative resources, cynicism of power, he says.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}}

The draft of the application to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper "Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation" by [[Elena Shchukina]] and [[Sergei Shishkov]]{{sfn|Shchukina|Shishkov|2009|p=24–28}} focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against the expert report without regard for the scope of the evaluated case.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} While talking about appealing against "the reports", the authors of the paper, according to lawyer [[Dmitry Bartenev]], mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the "parallel" examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}}

According to the warning made in 2010 by Yuri Savenko at the same Congress, prof. [[Anatoly Smulevich]], author of the monographs ''Problema Paranoyi'' (''The Problem of Paranoia'') (1972) and ''Maloprogredientnaya Shizofreniya'' (''Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia'') (1987), which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia", again began to play the same role he played before.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Recently, under his influence therapists began to widely use [[antidepressants]] and [[antipsychotics]] but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses, without consulting psychiatrists.{{sfn|Savenko|2010|pp=13–17}} This situation has opened up a huge new market for [[pharmaceutical firms]], with their unlimited capabilities, and the flow of the mentally ill to internists.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one's appearance and entire lifestyle.{{sfn|Smulevich|2009}}

According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky's school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment.{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} In 2012, delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in ''Psychiatry. National Manual'' edited by Tatyana Dmitrieva, Valery Krasnov, Nikolai Neznanov, Valentin Semke, and Alexander Tiganov.{{sfn|Dmitrieva|Krasnov|Neznanov|2012|p=322}} In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform.{{sfn|Pashkovsky|2012}} As Russian sociologist [[Alexander Tarasov]] notes, you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as [[Anatoly Chubais]] or [[German Gref]] can be occupied with reforming in our country; and you are suffering from "syndrome of litigiousness" if in addition you wrote to the capital city complaints, which can be written only by a reviewing authority or lawyer.{{sfn|Tarasov|2006|p=159}}

According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Ovchinsky, regional differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} For example, in some regions of Russia, 8 or 9 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}}

In April 1995, the State Duma considered the first draft of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions.{{sfn|Bonnie|Polubinskaya|1999}} In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=85}} Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections?{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=85}} In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by [[Alexander Podrabinek]], author of the book ''Punitive Medicine'',{{sfn|Luty|2014}} a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Scarnati|1980}} He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior.{{sfn|Gorelik|2003}} Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the [[Russian Mental Health Law]] should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with [[parliamentary immunity|parliamentary]] or [[judicial immunity]].{{sfn|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}} A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}}; {{harvnb|NPZ|2007a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.{{sfn|Mishina|2011}}

== Documents and memoirs ==
The evidence for the misuse of psychiatry for political purposes in the Soviet Union was documented in a number of articles and books.{{sfn|Bloch|1980}} Several national psychiatric associations examined and acted upon this documentation.{{sfn|Bloch|1980}}

The widely known sources including published and written memoirs by victims of psychiatric arbitrariness convey moral and physical sufferings experienced by the victims in special psychiatric hospitals of the USSR.{{sfn|Gluzman|1991}}

=== Samizdat documentation ===
In August 1969, [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] completed ''Noon'' ("Полдень"), her book about the case of the 25 August 1968 Demonstration on Red Square{{sfn|Gorbanevskaya|1970a}} and began circulating it in [[samizdat]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 9, 31 August 1969 — 9.1 "First Anniversary of the invasion of Czechoslovakia".&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into English and published under the title ''Red Square at Noon''.{{sfn|Gorbanevskaya|1970b}} Parts of the book describe Special Psychiatric Hospitals and psychiatric examinations of dissidents.

In 1971, twin brothers [[Zhores Medvedev]] and [[Roy Medvedev]] published in London their joint account of Zhores' incarceration in a psychiatric hospital and the Soviet practice of diagnosing political oppositionists as the mentally ill in London, in both English ''A Question of Madness: Repression by Psychiatry in the Soviet Union'' and Russian (''Who is Mad?'' "Кто сумасшедший") editions.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1971}}

Yury Maltsev's ''Report from a Madhouse'', his memoirs in Russian ("Репортаж и сумасшедшего дома"), were issued by the New York-based ''Novy zhurnal'' publishing house in 1974.{{sfn|Maltsev|1974}}

1975 saw the article "My Five Years in Mental Hospitals" by [[Viktor Fainberg]], who had emigrated to France the previous year after four years in the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital.{{sfn|Fainberg|1975}}

In 1976, [[Viktor Nekipelov]] published in [[samizdat]] his book ''Institute of Fools: Notes on the Serbsky Institute''{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p = 147}} documenting his personal experiences during two months' examination at the Serbsky Institute in Moscow.{{sfn|Jena|2008|p = 86}} In 1980, the book was translated and published in English.{{sfn|Nekipelov|1980}} The book was first published in Russia in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Savenko|2005b}}; {{harvnb|Nekipelov|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4755">'''Rafael Yossef Herman''' (born 1974 in [[Be'er Sheva]] רפאל י. הרמן) is an artist best known for his breakthrough photography project '''''Bereshit - Genesis'''''. Recalling the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] Creation story, this photography research project, of Israeli desert [[Negev]] trees, marked for the first time in photography history, a ''nocturnes photos'' that looks like taken in day light, using just the '''"moon-light"''', with no electronic or digital manipulation. The night, like never seen before, with monochromatic but full colored of its '''"colors of the night"'''. This lighted night, nearly divined, without [[shadow]], creates a new [[surrealism|surreal]] reality, one that our eye can not see and does not know.
 
The Bereshit project was exposed for the first time to public in Dec. 2006, in [[Milano]] [[Italy]], in the prestigious "Sala delle Cariatidi" &lt;ref&gt;Corriere Della Sera, [http://www.corriere.it/dynvm/dyn/vivimilano/edicola/dorsi/2006/12/20/vetrinatempolib/15_NOTIZD.shtml Curriere Della Sera Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404034505/http://www.corriere.it/dynvm/dyn/vivimilano/edicola/dorsi/2006/12/20/vetrinatempolib/15_NOTIZD.shtml |date=2011-04-04 }},  November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; of Palazzo Reale's museum of art. Bereshit photos, were one out of four fragments of [[Israel]],  that Rafael showed, under the title ''Magà''. The exhibition attracted the attention of the public and media, and above all, of the Milan's assessor of culture, [[Vittorio Sgarbi]], that wrote: "...His images are mirror of Creation, beyond which there is no more to say, revelation that only conceives the contemplative dimension, mixing spirit, mystery and material. Like this Herman wins the darkness." This occasion brought to Herman the invitation present the project to [[Pompidou Center]], [[Paris]]. In November 2007, in a personal exhibition titled Bereshit, in Studio Guastalla, Rafael Y. Herman discovered by the prestigious [[art historian]], [[writer]] and collector [[Arturo Schwarz]] that wrote on Herman's project&lt;ref&gt;Conference - The Light of the Creation [http://maurizioturchet.blogspot.com/2008_02_01_archive.html Images from Arturo Schwarz conference]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} February 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "...this black light, is the responsible of the intense poetical aura, of this photos serial...". Newspaper and Magazine titled the exhibition like; The Voice Of The Moon (Arte), Symbolic Research (Elle), The Trees Of Herman (TG), The Beginning Of All (Bolletino). During this exhibition period, Rafael lost his father Maxim (b. 1937 [[Bucharest]] d. 2007 [[19 Kislev]] ) just before finishing to write a documentary/romance book on his father's family story during the second world war.

Rafael Y. Herman showed his works in South America, Europe, and Asia in collective and personal exhibitions. He was collaborating with [[Amnesty International]] and Behia's government at [[Bahian Carnival]] 2002. Herman was graduate in Economy and Management from [[Tel Aviv University]], and as a child had musical education for 13 years. Today he lives in Italy and spend his life between Europe, America, and Israel. Currently his multiform photographic projects roam from fashion to reportage, from editorial and movie set photography to experimental photo research.

[[File:Ring species diagram.svg|thumb|300px|The coloured bars show natural populations (colours), varying along a [[Cline (biology)|cline]]. Such variation may occur in a line (e.g. up a mountain slope) as in ''A'', or may wrap around as in ''B''.
{{pb}}
Where the cline bends around, populations next to each other on the cline can interbreed, but at the point that the beginning meets the end again, as at ''C'', the differences along the cline prevent interbreeding (gap between pink and green). The [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]] populations are then called a ring species.]]
In [[biology]], a '''ring species''' is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which can interbreed with closely sited related populations, but for which there exist at least two "end" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential [[gene flow]] between each "linked" population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1013319217703 |author1=Irwin, Darren E. |author1link=Darren Irwin|author2=Irwin, J. H. |author3=Price, T. D. |title=Ring species as bridges between microevolution and speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=112–113 |pages=223–43 |year=2001 |pmid=11838767 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0016-6707&amp;volume=112-113&amp;page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, "end" populations may co-exist in the same region ([[sympatry]]) thus closing a "ring". The German term '''Rassenkreis''', meaning a ring of populations, is also used.

Ring species represent [[speciation]] and have been cited as [[Evidence of common descent|evidence of evolution]]. They illustrate what happens over time as populations genetically diverge, specifically because they represent, in living populations, what normally happens over time between long deceased ancestor populations and living populations, in which the intermediates have become [[extinct]]. The evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] remarks that ring species "are only showing us in the spatial dimension something that must always happen in the time dimension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Ancestor's Tale |date=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-618-00583-8| page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, the issue is that ''[[interfertility]]'' (ability to interbreed) is not a [[transitive relation]]–if A can breed with B, and B can breed with C, it does not follow that A can breed with C–and thus does not define an [[equivalence relation]]. A ring species is a species with a counterexample to the transitivity of interbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karmatics.com/docs/evolution-species-confusion.html |title='Same Species' vs. 'Interfertile: concise wording can avoid confusion when discussing evolution |first=Rob |last=Brown }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether any of the examples of ring species cited by scientists actually permit gene flow from end to end, with many being debated and contested.

The classic ring species is the ''[[Larus]]'' gull. In 1925 [[Jonathan Dwight]] found the genus to form a chain of varieties around the Arctic Circle. However, doubts have arisen as to whether this represents an actual ring species.&lt;ref name=Liebers2004&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Liebers | first1=D. | last2=De Knijff | first2=P. | last3=Helbig | first3=A.

Also in the 1940s, [[Robert C. Stebbins]] described the ''[[Ensatina]]'' salamanders around the Californian Central Valley as a ring species;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/devitt_01 A closer look at a classic ring species: The work of Tom Devitt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This species ring forms the subject of "The Salamander's tale" in [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''The Ancestor's Tale'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but again, some authors such as [[Jerry Coyne]] consider this classification incorrect.&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Speciation |author=Coyne, Jerry A.; Orr, H. Allen |date=2004 |pages=102–105| publisher=Sinauer Associates| isbn=0-87893-091-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in 2012, the first example of a ring species in plants was found in a [[spurge]], forming a ring around the Caribbean Sea.&lt;ref name="Cachoetal2012"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Caribbean slipper spurge Euphorbia tithymaloides: the first example of a ring species in plants|author1=Ivalú Cacho, N. |author2=Baum, David A.| journal=Proc.

== Speciation ==
The biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] championed the concept of ring species, claiming that it unequivocally demonstrated the process of speciation.&lt;ref name="RicardoJP"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ring species as demonstrations of the continuum of species formation|author1=Pereira, Ricardo J. |author2=Wake, David B.| journal=Molecular Ecology| year=2015| volume=24| issue=| pages=5312–5314| doi= 10.1111/mec.13412}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ring species is an alternative model to [[allopatric speciation]], "illustrating how new species can arise through 'circular overlap', without interruption of gene flow through intervening populations…"&lt;ref name="ajhelbig"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A ring of species| author=Helbig, A. J. | journal=Heredity | year=2005 | volume=95 | pages=113–114| doi= 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800679}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jerry Coyne and [[H. Allen Orr]] point out that rings species more closely model [[parapatric speciation]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;

Ring species often attract the interests of evolutionary biologists, systematists, and researchers of speciation leading to both thought provoking ideas and confusion concerning their definition.&lt;ref name="Irwinetal2001"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ring species as bridges between microevolution and speciation |author1=Irwin, Darren E. |author2=Irwin, Jessica H.  |author3=Price, Trevor D. | journal=Genetica| year=2001| volume=112–113| pages=223–243| doi=10.1023/A:1013319217703 | pmid=11838767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary scholars recognize that examples in nature have proved rare due to various factors such as limitations in taxonomic delineation&lt;ref name="Irwin2012"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A novel approach for finding ring species: look for barriers rather than rings | author=Irwin, Darren E. | journal=BMC Biology| year=2012| volume=10| issue=21| pages=| doi= 10.1186/1741-7007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, "taxonomic zeal"&lt;ref name="RicardoJP"/&gt;—explained by the fact that taxonomists classify organisms into "species", while ring species often cannot fit this definition.&lt;ref name="Irwinetal2001"/&gt; Other reasons such as gene flow interruption from "vicariate divergence" and fragmented populations due to climate instability have also been cited.&lt;ref name="RicardoJP"/&gt;

Ring species also present an interesting case of the [[species problem]] for those seeking to divide the living world into discrete [[species]]. All that distinguishes a ring species from two separate species is the existence of the connecting populations; if enough of the connecting populations within the ring perish to sever the breeding connection then the ring species' distal populations will be recognized as two distinct species. The problem is whether to quantify the whole ring as a single species (despite the fact that not all individuals can interbreed) or to classify each population as a distinct species (despite the fact that it can interbreed with its near neighbours). Ring species illustrate that species boundaries arise gradually and often exist on a continuum.&lt;ref name="RicardoJP"/&gt;

Many examples have been documented in nature.

Many examples have been disputed by researchers, and equally "many of the [proposed] cases have received very little attention from researchers, making it difficult to assess whether they display the characteristics of ideal ring species."&lt;ref name="Irwinetal2001"/&gt;

*''[[Larus]]'' gulls form a circumpolar "ring" around the [[North Pole]]. The [[European herring gull]] (''L. argentatus argenteus''), which lives primarily in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], can [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with the [[American herring gull]] (''L. smithsonianus''), (living in [[North America]]), which can also hybridize with the Vega or [[East Siberian herring gull]] (''L. vegae''), the western subspecies of which, [[Birula's gull]] (''L. vegae birulai''), can hybridize with [[Heuglin's gull]] (''L. heuglini''), which in turn can hybridize with the Siberian [[lesser black-backed gull]] (''L. fuscus''). All four of these live across the north of [[Siberia]]. The last is the eastern representative of the lesser black-backed gulls back in north-western [[Europe]], including Great Britain. The lesser black-backed gulls and herring gulls are sufficiently different that they do not normally hybridize; thus the group of gulls forms a continuum except where the two lineages meet in Europe. However, a 2004 genetic study entitled "The herring gull complex is not a ring species" has shown that this example is far more complicated than presented here (Liebers et al., 2004):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liebers, Dorit |author2=de Knijff, Peter |author3=Helbig, Andreas J. |title=The herring gull complex is not a ring species |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=271 |issue=1542 |pages=893–901 |year=2004 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2679 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/271/1542/893.full.pdf+html |pmid=15255043 |pmc=1691675 }} [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/public/contributionsupplementalmaterials/v/y/h/e/vyhea7ddp48gn5a1/archive1.pdf Electronic Appendix]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; this example only speaks to the complex of species from the classical herring gull through lesser black-backed gull.

A '''routing diagram''' or '''route diagram''' in the field of [[management engineering]] is a type of [[diagram]], that shows a route through an accessible physical space.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bøgh Andersen, "Pervasive computing and space." ''Organizational Semiotics.'' Springer US, 2002. 133-152. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Routing diagrams are used in [[plant layout study]], and manufacturing plant design.  

== Overview ==
A routing diagrams shows a route through a physical space. They are often considered a type of flow diagram, but they differ from flowcharts, that a routing is pictured in a physical layout. There is a similarity with design of [[Electrical equipment]], where routing diagrams also in show "the physical layout of the facility and equipment and how the circuit how the circuit to the various equipment is run." &lt;ref&gt;Paul Gill (1997), ''Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing.'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

A picture with a routing in geographical space is often called a route map. While the [[road map]] and [[transit map]] (such as the railway map, metro map, bus map, etc.) show all the roads or lines, the route map regularly shows one rad for a particular occasion. Likewise a ground plan or site map show all the space, buildings and/or rooms, the routing map shows one specific route on site.    

Routing diagrams are used in [[plant layout study]]. The routing diagram can consist of a [[floor plan]] with a trace attached, or a 3d [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross section]] of a building with a trace. The routing diagram transforms into a [[flow diagram]] when the physical dimensions are taken out of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Albert Herrmann (1950, ''Office Methods, Systems, and Procedures.'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bullock was lead co-counsel in the 2005 Supreme Court case ''[[Kelo v.

'''Self-love''' has often been seen as a moral flaw, akin to vanity and [[selfishness]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Kirkpatrick ed., ''Roget's Thesaurus'' (1998) p. 592 and p. 639&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Merriam-Webster dictionary]] later describes self-love as to "love of self" or "regard for one's own happiness or advantage". Synonyms of this concept are: [[amour propre]], conceit, conceitedness, [[egotism]], and many more. However, throughout the centuries this definition has adopted a more positive connotation through self-love protests, the [[Hippie]] era, the [[new age]] [[feminist movement]] as well as the increase in [[mental health]] awareness that promotes self-love.

==Traditional views==
[[Cicero]] considered those who were ''sui amantes sine rivali'' (lovers of themselves without rivals) were doomed to end in failure – a theme adopted by [[Francis Bacon]] in his condemnation of extreme self-lovers, who would burn down their own home, only to roast themselves an egg.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''The Essays'' (1985) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-love was first recognized in 1563 but was only later studied by philosophers [[William James]] and [[Erich Fromm]], who studied emotional human behaviour, such as [[self-esteem]] and self-worth.
However, it was later defined in 1956 by [[psychologist]] and [[social philosopher]] [[Erich Fromm]], who proposed that loving oneself is different from being [[:wikt:arrogant|arrogant]], conceited or [[egocentric]], meaning that instead caring about oneself and taking responsibility for oneself.

However, [[Augustine]] – with his theology of evil as a mere distortion of the good – considered that the sin of pride was only a perversion of a normal, more modest degree of self-love.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sayers, Dante: Purgatory'' (1971) p. 66-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century re-interpretations==
Eric Fromm proposed a re-evaluation of self-love in more positive sense, arguing that in order to be able to truly love another person, a person first needs to love oneself in the way of respecting oneself and knowing oneself (e.g. being realistic and honest about one's strengths and weaknesses).&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Loving'' (1956) by Erich Fromm.  [[Harper &amp; Row]]. {{ISBN|978-0-06-091594-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buildthefire.com/loving-yourself-more/|title=How to Stop Beating Yourself Up and Start Loving Yourself More {{!}} Build The Fire|website=Build The Fire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik H. Erikson]] similarly wrote of a post-narcissistic appreciation of the value of the ego,&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1964) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Carl Rogers]] saw one result of successful therapy as the regaining of a quiet sense of pleasure in being one's own self.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-love or self-worth was later defined by A.P. Gregg and C. Sedikides in 2003 as "referring to a person's subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or negative". Robert H. Wozniak described William James's theory of self-esteem and claimed that self-love was measured in "... three different but interrelated aspects of self: the material self (all those aspects of material existence in which we feel a strong sense of ownership, our bodies, our families, our possessions), the social self (our felt social relations), and the spiritual self (our feelings of our own subjectivity)".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wozniak, R. H. (1999) Introduction to The Principles of Psychology. Classics in Psychology, 1855-1914: Historical Essays.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
[[Mental health]] was first described by William Sweetser (1797–1875) as the maintenance of "mental hygiene". His analysis was demonstrated in his essay "Temperance Society" published August 26, 1830, which claimed that regular maintenance of [[mental hygiene]] created a positive impact on the well-being of individuals and the community as well.

According to the [[American Association of Suicidology]], there have been 44,193 [[suicides]] in 2015 alone, 5,491 of them being youth aged between 15–24 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Drapeau, C. W., &amp; McIntosh, J. L. (for the American Association of Suicidology). (2016). U.S.A. suicide 2015: Official final data.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of teenager and young adult suicides are escalating at an alarming rate every year, further demonstrating that the social environment has an impact on mental health conditions. The association conducted a study in 2008 which researched the impact of low self-esteem and lack of self-love and its relation to suicidal tendencies and attempts. They defined self-love as being "beliefs about oneself (self-based self-esteem)&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Beck, Bhar, Brown &amp; Ghahramanlou‐Holloway (2008). "Self-Esteem and Suicide Ideation in Psychiatric Outpatients". Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and beliefs about how other people regard oneself (other-based self-esteem)".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; It concluded that "[[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[hopelessness]], and low self-esteem are implications of vulnerability factors for [[suicide ideation]]" and that "these findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation".

==Promotion==
===History===
Self-love was first promoted in the early years of the [[Hippie]] era (also known as [[the Beat Generation]] of the 1960s). After witnessing the devastating consequences of [[World War II]] and having troops still fighting in the [[Vietnam War]], western (especially North American) societies began promoting "peace and love" to help generate positive energy and to promote the preservation of dissipating environmental factors, such as the emergence of [[oil pipeline]]s and the recognition of [[pollution]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]].

These deteriorating living conditions caused worldwide protests that primarily focused on ending the war, but secondarily promoted a positive environment aided by the fundamental concept of [[crowd psychology]]. This post-war community was left very vulnerable to persuasion but began encouraging freedom, harmony and the possibility of a brighter, non-violent future. These protests took place on almost all continents and included countries such as the United States (primarily New York City and California), England and Australia. Their dedication, perseverance and empathy towards human life defined this generation as being peace advocates and carefree souls.

The emergence of the [[feminist movement]] began as early as the 19th century, but only began having major influence during the [[second-wave feminism|second wave]] movement, which included [[women's rights]] protests that inevitably led to women gaining the [[right to vote]]. These protests not only promoted equality but also suggested that women should recognize their self-worth through the knowledge and acceptance of self-love. Elizabeth Cady Stanton used the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as a guideline to demonstrate that women have been harshly treated throughout the centuries in her feminist essay titled "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]". In the essay she claims that "all men and women are created equal; ... that among these [rights] are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness";&lt;ref&gt;Anthony S.B., M.J. Cage &amp; Stanton, E.C. (1889). A History of Woman Suffrage, vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that without these rights, the capacity to feel self-worth and self-love is scarce. This historical essay suggests that a lack of self-esteem and fear of self-love affects modern women due to lingering post-industrial gender conditions.

Self-love has also been used as a radical tool in communities of Color in the United States. In the 1970s Black-Power movement, the slogan "Black is beautiful!" became a way for African-Americans to throw off the mantle of predominately White beauty norms. The dominant cultural aesthetic pre-1970s was to straighten Black hair with a perm or hot comb. During the Black Power movement, the "afro" or "fro" became the popular hairstyle. It involved letting Black Hair grow naturally, without chemical treatment, so as to embrace and flaunt the  extremely curly hair texture of Black people. Hair was teased out the hair using a pick. The goal was to cause the hair to form a halo around the head, flaunting the Blackness of its wearer. This form of self-love and empowerment during the 70s was a way for African-Americans to combat the stigma against their natural hair texture, which was, and still is, largely seen as unprofessional in the modern workplace.

===Modern platforms===
The emergence of new technology has given society an easier way to communicate with one another and research faster. [[Social media]] has created a platform for self-love promotion and mental health awareness in order to end the [[social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental health and to address self-love positively rather than negatively.

A few modern examples of self-love promotion platforms include:
* [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]]
* [[Slut Walk]]
* [[To Write Love on Her Arms]]

[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|frame|right|Map of Königsberg in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the seven bridges, highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges]]
The '''Seven Bridges of Königsberg''' is a historically notable problem in mathematics. Its negative resolution by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1736&lt;ref&gt;Euler, Leonhard (1736). "Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis". ''Comment. Acad. Sci. U. Petrop'' 8, 128–40.&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundations of [[graph theory]] and prefigured the idea of [[topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shields |first=Rob |date=December 2012 |title=Cultural Topology: The Seven Bridges of Königsburg 1736 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0263276412451161 |work=Theory Culture and Society |volume=29 |issue=4-5 |pages=43–57 |doi=10.1177/0263276412451161}} Shields provides a discussion of the social significance of Euler's engagement with this popular problem and its significance as an example of (proto-)topological understanding applied to everyday life. &lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Königsberg]] in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]) was set on both sides of the [[Pregolya|Pregel River]], and included two large islands - [[Kneiphof]] and [[Oktyabrsky Island|Lomse]] - which were connected to each other, or to the two mainland portions of the city, by seven bridges. The problem was to devise a walk through the city that would cross each of those bridges once and only once. 

By way of specifying the logical task unambiguously, solutions involving either
# reaching an island or mainland bank other than via one of the bridges, or
# accessing any bridge without crossing to its other end 
are explicitly unacceptable.

Euler proved that the problem has no solution. The difficulty he faced was the development of a suitable technique of analysis, and of subsequent tests that established this assertion with mathematical rigor.

==Euler's analysis==
First, Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass is irrelevant. The only important feature of a route is the sequence of bridges crossed. This allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms (laying the foundations of [[graph theory]]), eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them. In modern terms, one replaces each land mass with an abstract "[[:vertex (graph theory)|vertex]]" or node, and each bridge with an abstract connection, an "[[:edge (graph theory)|edge]]", which only serves to record which pair of vertices (land masses) is connected by that bridge. The resulting mathematical structure is called a [[:graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].

&lt;span style="font-size: 300%;"&gt;
[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|180px]] →
[[File:7 bridges.svg|179px]] →
[[File:Königsberg graph.svg|180px]]
&lt;/span&gt;

Since only the connection information is relevant, the shape of pictorial representations of a graph may be distorted in any way, without changing the graph itself. Only the existence (or absence) of an edge between each pair of nodes is significant. For example, it does not matter whether the edges drawn are straight or curved, or whether one node is to the left or right of another.

Next, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In other words, during any walk in the graph, the number of times one enters a non-terminal vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. Now, if every bridge has been traversed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be ''[[Parity (mathematics)|even]]'' (half of them, in the particular traversal, will be traversed "toward" the landmass; the other half, "away" from it). However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an ''[[Parity (mathematics)|odd]]'' number of bridges (one is touched by 5 bridges, and each of the other three is touched by 3). Since, at most, two land masses can serve as the endpoints of a walk, the proposition of a walk traversing each bridge once leads to a contradiction.

In modern language, Euler shows that the possibility of a walk through a graph, traversing each edge exactly once, depends on the [[:degree (graph theory)|degree]]s of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This condition turns out also to be sufficient—a result stated by Euler and later proved by [[Carl Hierholzer]]. Such a walk is now called an ''[[Eulerian path]]'' or ''Euler walk'' in his honor. Further, if there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph corresponding to historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path.

An alternative form of the problem asks for a path that traverses all bridges and also has the same starting and ending point. Such a walk is called an ''[[Eulerian path#Definition|Eulerian circuit]]'' or an ''Euler tour''. Such a circuit exists if, and only if, the graph is connected, and there are no nodes of odd degree at all. All Eulerian circuits are also Eulerian paths, but not all Eulerian paths are Eulerian circuits.

Euler's work was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on 26 August 1735, and published as ''Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis'' (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal ''Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae'' in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E053.html The Euler Archive], commentary on publication, and original text, in Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in English in [[The World of Mathematics]].

==Significance in the history and philosophy of mathematics==
In the [[history of mathematics]], Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]] and the first true proof in the theory of networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=M. E. J.|title=The structure and function of complex networks|publisher=Department of Physics, University of Michigan|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/courses/2004/cscs535/review.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subject now generally regarded as a branch of [[combinatorics]]. Combinatorial problems of other types had been considered since antiquity.

In addition, Euler's recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of [[topology]]. The difference between the actual layout and the graph schematic is a good example of the idea that topology is not concerned with the rigid shape of objects.

Hence, as Euler recognized, the "geometry of position" is not about "measurements and calculations" but about something more general. That called in question the traditional [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] view that mathematics is the "science of [[quantity]]". Though that view fits arithmetic and Euclidean geometry, it did not fit topology and the more abstract structural features studied in modern mathematics.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Philosophers have noted that Euler's proof is not about an abstraction or a model of reality, but directly about the real arrangement of bridges. Hence the certainty of mathematical proof can apply directly to reality.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics'', Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–9, 96, 215, 225; J. Franklin, [http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/philosophersstone.pdf The formal sciences discover the philosophers' stone], ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' 25 (4) (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;513–533.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
The classic statement of the problem, given above, uses '''unidentified''' nodes—that is, they are all alike except for the way in which they are connected. There is a variation in which the nodes are '''identified'''—each node is given a unique name or color.

[[File:7 bridgesID.png|300px|thumb|left|A variant with red and blue castles, a church and an inn.]]
The northern bank of the river is occupied by the ''Schloß'', or castle, of the ''Blue Prince''; the southern by that of the Red Prince. The east [[bank]] is home to the Bridge's ''Ritcher'', or church; and on the small island in the center is a ''[[Gasthaus]]'', or inn.

It is understood that the problems to follow should be taken in order, and begin with a statement of the original problem:

It being customary among the townsmen, after some hours in the ''Gasthaus'', to attempt to '''walk the bridges''', many have returned for more refreshment claiming success. However, none have been able to repeat the feat by the light of day.

'''Bridge 8:''' ''The Blue Prince'', having analyzed the town's bridge system by means of graph theory, concludes that the bridges cannot be walked. He contrives a stealthy plan to build an eighth bridge so that he can begin in the evening at his ''Schloß'', walk the bridges, and end at the ''Gasthaus'' to brag of his victory. Of course, he wants the ''Red Prince'' to be unable to recur the triumph from the ''Red Castle''. ''Where does the Blue Prince build the eighth bridge?''

'''Bridge 9:''' ''The Red Prince'', infuriated by his brother's [[Gordian Knot|Gordian]] solution to the problem, wants to build a ninth bridge, enabling ''him'' to begin at his ''Schloß'', walk the bridges, and end at the ''Gasthaus'' to rub dirt in his brother's face. As an extra bit of revenge, his brother should then no longer be able to walk the bridges starting at his ''Schloß'' and ending at the ''Gasthaus'' as before. ''Where does the Red Prince build the ninth bridge?''

'''Bridge 10:''' ''The Bishop'' has watched this furious bridge-building with dismay. It upsets the town's ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]'' and, worse, contributes to excessive drunkenness. He wants to build a tenth bridge that allows ''all'' the inhabitants to walk the bridges and return to their own beds. ''Where does the Bishop build the tenth bridge?''

=== Solutions ===
[[File:Koenigsberg Bridges Variations Graph7.png|thumb|150px|left|The colored graph.]]
[[File:Koenigsberg Bridges Variations Graph8.png|thumb|150px|right|The 8th edge.]]
Reduce the city, as before, to a graph. Color each node. As in the classic problem, no Euler walk is possible; coloring does not affect this. All four nodes have an odd number of edges.

'''Bridge 8:''' Euler walks are possible if exactly zero or two nodes have an odd number of edges. If we have 2 nodes with an odd number of edges, the walk must begin at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple. The walk desired must begin at the blue node and end at the orange node. Thus, a new edge is drawn between the other two nodes. Since they each formerly had an odd number of edges, they must now have an even number of edges, fulfilling all conditions. This is a change in [[Even and odd numbers|parity]] from an odd to even degree.

[[File:7b-graph09.png|thumb|150px|left|The 9th edge]]
[[File:Koenigsberg Bridges Variations Graph10.png|thumb|150px|right|The 10th edge]]

'''Bridge 9:''' The 9th bridge is easy once the 8th is solved. The desire is to enable the red castle and forbid the blue castle as a starting point; the orange node remains the end of the walk and the white node is unaffected. To change the parity of both red and blue nodes, draw a new edge between them.

'''Bridge 10:''' The 10th bridge takes us in a slightly different direction. The Bishop wishes every citizen to return to his starting point. This is an [[Euler circuit]] and requires that all nodes be of even degree. After the solution of the 9th bridge, the red and the orange nodes have odd degree, so their parity must be changed by adding a new edge between them.

==Present state of the bridges==
[[File:Present state of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg.png|thumb|Modern map of Kaliningrad. Locations of the remaining bridges are highlighted in green, while those destroyed are highlighted in red.]]

Two of the seven original bridges did not survive the [[bombing of Königsberg in World War II]]. Two others were later demolished and replaced by a modern highway. The three other bridges remain, although only two of them are from Euler's time (one was rebuilt in 1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amt.canberra.edu.au/koenigs.html |title=What ''Ever'' Happened to Those Bridges? |accessdate=11 November 2006 |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=December 2000 |publisher=Australian Mathematics Trust |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319074335/http://www.amt.canberra.edu.au/koenigs.html |archivedate=19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, {{as of|2000|lc=y}}, there are five bridges remaining that were involved in Euler's problem.

In terms of graph theory, two of the nodes now have degree 2, and the other two have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but it must begin on one island and end on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/stallmann/SevenBridges/ |title=The 7/5 Bridges of Koenigsberg/Kaliningrad |accessdate=11 November 2006 |last=Stallmann |first=Matthias |date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Canterbury]] in [[Christchurch]] has incorporated a model of the bridges into a grass area between the old Physical Sciences Library and the Erskine Building, housing the Departments of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/php/about/|title=About – Mathematics and Statistics – University of Canterbury|work=math.canterbury.ac.nz|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers are replaced with short bushes and the central island sports a stone [[tōrō]]. [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] has incorporated the puzzle into the pavement in front of the [[Gene Polisseni Center]], an ice hockey arena that opened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=RITWHKY|author=RIT Womens Hockey|number=501529429185945600|date=19 August 2014|title=@OnlyAtRIT do we put the 7 bridge math problem in the cement out front of the new hockey arena @PolisseniCenter #ROC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was republished by [[Verso Books]] in a new expanded edition in November 2012.&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_I" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_II" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Theodore William Allen was born into a [[middle-class]] family in Indianapolis, Indiana. He had a sister Eula May and brother Tom; their parents were Thomas E.  Allen, a sales manager, and Almeda Earl Allen, a housewife. The family moved when he was a child to [[Paintsville, Kentucky]], and then to [[Huntington, West Virginia]], where he lived and, in his words, "was proletarianized" during the [[Great Depression]]. When Allen started working soon after high school (deciding that college did not do enough for independent thought), he quickly joined labor unions.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

==Career==
Allen became an early activist and organizer in the labor movement. At age 17, he joined the [[American Federation of Musicians]] Local 362 and the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haywood | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Haywood | chapter = Introduction | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bHc44CrYKccC&amp;pg=PR21 | editor-first = Gwendolyn | editor-last = Midlo Hall | editorlink = Gwendolyn Midlo Hall | title = A Black Communist in the Freedom Struggle: The Life of Harry Haywood | page = xxi | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2012 |origyear=1978 | isbn = 9780816679058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Staudenmaier | first = Michael | chapter = "A Science of Navigation" | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uQSmXBV5R9YC&amp;pg=PA84 | title = Truth and Revolution: A History of the Sojourner Truth Organization 1968 - 1986 | page = 84 | publisher = AK Press | location = Oakland, California, Edinburgh, and Baltimore | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781849350976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon was elected as a delegate to the Huntington Central Labor Union, AFL. He subsequently worked as a coal miner in West Virginia as a member of the United Mine Workers, serving as an organizer and president of one Local and later member of another. He also co-developed a trade union organizing program for the Marion County, West Virginia Industrial Union Council, [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]].&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

In the 1940s Allen moved to New York City, a center for labor activism and intellectual work. He did industrial economic research at the [[Labor Research Association]], based in the city. He taught economics at the [[Jefferson School of Social Science]], founded in New York by the Communist Party in 1944. Allen taught there into the 1950s, when the school closed, due to declining membership in the party and pressure from scrutiny by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) of Congress, which was conducting hearings during the [[McCarthy era]].

Allen also taught math at the Crown Heights Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], where he lived, and the Grace Church School in New York.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt; During his more than six decades in New York, Allen had a variety of jobs, from factory worker to retail clerk, mechanical design draftsman, postal mail handler (and member of the Local of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union), and librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

Beginning in 1965, he was published as an independent scholar. He conducted decades of research to develop his ideas about the labor, class and racial history of the United States.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

==Writings==
In 1965 Allen published articles on the concept of [[white skin privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;Allen urged, in a 1965 John Brown Commemoration Committee "Call," that "[[White Americans]] who want government of the people, by the people, must begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges and the white 'gentleman's agreement' against the [[Negro]]."

After beginning his research on "white skin privilege" in 1965, Allen worked for the next decade to develop more research and writing on this topic. He published ''Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race'' (1975). During this time, he also taught as an adjunct history instructor for one semester at Essex County Community College in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He was described by historian Jeffrey B. Perry as working "throughout his entire adult life ... for the emancipation of the working class and for socialism."&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

His work since the 1960s was intended to overturn explanations for [[white supremacy]] that relied on biology or attributed it to benefits gained by the working class. Allen emphasized that the "invention of the white race" was related to class struggle and to ruling class efforts to maintain social control.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

Allen published outside the academic press and his work was highly influential, at a time of the [[civil rights movement]], when issues of race, ethnicity and culture were being studied and overturned. He also documented how later Irish immigrants to the U.S. became "white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = The Invention of the White Race: Volume 1, Racial Oppression and Social Control | url = http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 |publisher=Verso Books | location = London |origyear=1994 |year=2012| isbn = 9781844677696}} Chapters 6 through 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "race" was also being overturned by work in anthropology, genetics, biology, history and other disciplines. By 1997, historian [[George M. Fredrickson]] of [[Stanford University]] wrote that "the proposition that race is 'a social and cultural construction,' has become an academic cliché,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frederickson | first = George M. | title = America's Caste System: Will It Change? | journal = [[New York Review of Books]] | page = 68 | publisher =  | date = 23 October 1997 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/oct/23/americas-caste-system-will-it-change/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Allen was not satisfied with that proposition and he emphasized that "the 'white race' must be understood, not simply as a social construct (rather than an genetic phenomenon), but as a ruling class social control formation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = Summary of the Argument of "''The Invention of the White Race''" (Part One) | journal = Cultural Logic: Marxist Theory and Practice | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | publisher = Theodore W.

'''Vajrayāna''', '''Mantrayāna''', '''Tantrayāna''', '''Tantric Buddhism''' and '''Esoteric Buddhism''' are the various Buddhist traditions of [[Tantra]] and "Secret [[Mantra]]", which developed in [[Medieval India|medieval India]] and spread to [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], and [[East Asia]]. In [[Tibet]], Buddhist Tantra is termed ''Vajrayāna'', while in [[China]] it is generally known as [[Tangmi|Tángmì]] (唐密, "Chinese Tantrayāna") or ''Mìzōng ''(密宗, "church of Tantrayāna"), in [[Pali]] it is known as ''Pyitsayãna '' (ပစ္စယာန) , and in [[Japan]] it is known as [[Mikkyō]] (密教, "secret teachings").

Vajrayāna is usually translated as '''Diamond Vehicle''' or '''Thunderbolt Vehicle''', referring to the [[Vajra]], a mythical weapon which is also used as a ritual implement.

Founded by [[Medieval India|medieval India]]n [[mahasiddha|Mahāsiddha]]s, Vajrayāna subscribes to the literature known as the [[Buddhist Tantras]].{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875-876}} It includes practices that make use of [[mantras]], [[dharani]]s, [[mudras]], [[mandalas]] and the visualization of deities and Buddhas. According to Vajrayāna scriptures, the term ''Vajrayāna'' refers to one of three vehicles or [[Yana (Buddhism)|routes to enlightenment]], the other two being the [[Śrāvakayāna]] (also known as the [[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]) and [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]].

== History of Vajrayāna ==

Note the figure of the great adept Putalipa at top center, seated in a cave and gazing at an image of the meditational deity Samvara and the figure at the bottom left holding a skull-staff ([[Khaṭvāṅga]]).]]

===Mahasiddha movement===
Tantric Buddhism can be traced back to groups of wandering yogis called [[Mahasiddha]]s (great adepts).&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A.; Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reynolds (2007), the mahasiddhas date to the medieval period in the Northern [[Indian Subcontinent]] (3–13 cen. CE), and used methods that were radically different than those used in Buddhist monasteries including living in forests and caves and practiced meditation in [[charnel ground]]s similar to those practiced by Shaiva [[Kapalika]] ascetics.&lt;ref name=MTT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=John Myrdhin|title=The Mahasiddha Tradition in Tibet|url=http://www.vajranatha.com/teaching/MahasiddhaTradition.htm|website=Vajranatha|publisher=Vajranatha|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These yogic circles came together in tantric feasts ([[ganachakra]]) often in sacred sites (''pitha'') and places (''ksetra'') which included dancing, singing, sex rites and the ingestion of taboo substances like alcohol, urine, meat, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 168.&lt;/ref&gt; At least two of the Mahasiddhas given in the Buddhist literature are actually names for Shaiva [[Nath]] saints ([[Gorakshanath]] and [[Matsyendranath]]) who practiced [[Hatha Yoga]].

According to Schumann, a movement called ''Sahaja-siddhi'' developed in the 8th century in [[Bengal]].{{sfn|Schumann|1974|p=163}} It was dominated by long-haired, wandering Mahasiddhas who openly challenged and ridiculed the Buddhist establishment.{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}} The Mahasiddhas pursued [[siddhis]], magical powers such as flight and [[extrasensory perception]] as well as liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, The Eighty-four Mahasiddhas and the Path of Tantra - Introduction to Masters of Mahamudra, 1984. http://keithdowman.net/essays/introduction-mahasiddhas-and-tantra.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald M. Davidson states that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Buddhist siddhas demonstrated the appropriation of an older sociological form—the independent sage/magician, who lived in a liminal zone on the borders between fields and forests. Their rites involved the conjunction of sexual practices and Buddhist mandala visualization with ritual accouterments made from parts of the human body, so that control may be exercised over the forces hindering the natural abilities of the siddha to manipulate the cosmos at will. At their most extreme, siddhas also represented a defensive position within the Buddhist tradition, adopted and sustained for the purpose of aggressive engagement with the medieval culture of public violence. They reinforced their reputations for personal sanctity with rumors of the magical manipulation of various flavors of demonic females (dakini, yaksi, yogini), cemetery ghouls (vetala), and other things that go bump in the night. Operating on the margins of both monasteries and polite society, some adopted the behaviors associated with ghosts (preta, pisaca), not only as a religious praxis but also as an extension of their implied threats."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 228, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tantras===
{{main article|Buddhist Tantras}}
[[File:Kongokai.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Diamond Realm]] [[Mandala]], based on the tantric [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]], and symbolizing the final realization of [[Vairocana]] Buddha in [[Shingon]].]]
Earlier [[Mahayana sutras]] already contained some elements which are emphasized in the Tantras, such as [[mantras]] and [[dharani]].&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of mantras and protective verses actually dates back to the Vedic period and the early Buddhist texts like the [[Pali canon]]. The practice of [[Buddhanusmrti|visualization of Buddhas]] such as [[Amitābha]] is also seen in pre-tantra texts like the [[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other Mahayana sutras which contain "proto-tantric" material such as the [[Gandavyuha]] sutra and the [[Ten Stages Sutra|Dasabhumika]] which might have served as a central source of visual imagery for Tantric texts.&lt;ref&gt;Osto, Douglas. “Proto–Tantric” Elements in The Gandavyuha sutra. Journal of Religious History
Vol. 33, No. 2, June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vajrayana developed a large corpus of texts called the [[Buddhist Tantras]], some of which can be traced to at least the 7th century CE but might be older. The dating of the tantras is "a difficult, indeed an impossible task" according to David Snellgrove.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest of these texts, kriya tantras such as the [[Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa]] (6th century), focus on the use of mantras and dharanis for mostly worldly ends including curing illness, controlling the weather and generating wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra]], classed as a "Yoga tantra", is one of the first Buddhist tantras which focuses on liberation as opposed to worldly goals and in the [[Vajrasekhara Sutra|Vajrasekhara Tantra]] the concept of the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas|five Buddha families]] is developed.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early tantras include the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]] and the [[Guhyasamāja Tantra]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, Routledge, (2008), page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guhyasamāja is a Mahayoga class of Tantra, which features new forms of ritual practice considered "left-hand" ([[vamachara]]) such as the use of taboo substances like alcohol, [[sexual yoga]], and [[charnel ground]] practices which evoke [[wrathful deities]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Ryujun Tajima divides the tantras into those which were "a development of Mahayanist thought" and those "formed in a rather popular mould toward the end of the eighth century and declining into the esoterism of the left",&lt;ref&gt;Tajima, R. ''Étude sur le Mahàvairocana-Sùtra''&lt;/ref&gt;  mainly, the Yogini tantras and later works associated with wandering antinomian yogis. Later monastic Vajrayana Buddhists reinterpreted and internalized these radically transgressive and taboo practices as metaphors and visualization exercises.

Later tantras such as the [[Hevajra Tantra]] and the [[Chakrasamvara]] are classed as "Yogini tantras" and represent the final form of development of Indian Buddhist tantras in the ninth and tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Kalachakra tantra]] developed in the 10th century.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} It is farthest removed from the earlier Buddhist traditions, and incorporates concepts of [[messianism]] and [[astrology]] not present elsewhere in Buddhist literature.{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}}

According to Ronald M. Davidson, the rise of Tantric Buddhism was a response to the feudal structure of Indian society in the early medieval period (ca. 500-1200 CE) which saw kings being divinized as manifestations of gods. Likewise, tantric yogis reconfigured their practice through the metaphor of being consecrated (''abhiśeka'') as the overlord (''rājādhirāja'') of a [[mandala]] palace of divine vassals, an imperial metaphor symbolizing kingly fortresses and their political power.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon White, David; Review of "Indian Esoteric Buddhism", by Ronald M. Davidson, University of California, Santa Barbara
JIATS, no. 1 (October 2005), THL #T1223, 11 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Saivism===
[[Image:1 Yamantaka riding buffalo Shinjeshe gshin rje gshed rdo rje jigs byed, a Mahayana Yidam.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Vajrayana adopted deities such as [[Bhairava]], known as [[Yamantaka]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].]] 
The question of the origins of early Vajrayana has been taken up by various scholars. David Seyfort Ruegg has suggested by Buddhist tantra employed various elements of a “pan-Indian religious substrate” which is not specifically Buddhist, Shaiva or Vaishnava.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Alexis Sanderson]], various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and [[Shaivism|Saivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis.

Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the two systems can be seen in texts like the [[Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa|Mañjusrimulakalpa]], which later came to be classified under [[Outer Tantras#Kriyatantra|Kriyatantra]], and states that mantras taught in the Shaiva, Garuda and Vaishnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by [[Manjushri]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. "The Śaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period." In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo.

[[Alexis Sanderson]] notes that the Vajrayana ''yogini tantras'' draw extensively from Shaiva [[Bhairava]] tantras classified as ''Vidyapitha''. Sanderson's comparison of them shows similarity in "ritual procedures, style of observance, deities, mantras, mandalas, ritual dress, [[Kapalika]] accoutrements, specialized terminology, secret gestures, and secret jargons. There is even direct borrowing of passages from Saiva texts."&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis; Vajrayana:, Origin and Function, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Sanderson gives numerous examples such as the ''Guhyasiddhi'' of Padmavajra, a work associated with the [[Guhyasamāja tantra|Guhyasamaja tradition]], which prescribes acting as a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] guru and initiating members into [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Saiva Siddhanta]] scriptures and mandalas.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. "The Śaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period." In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra|Samvara tantra]] texts adopted the [[Hindu pilgrimage sites|pitha]] list from the Shaiva text ''Tantrasadbhava'', introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huber|first1=Toni|title=The holy land reborn : pilgrimage &amp; the Tibetan reinvention of Buddhist India|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-35648-8|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald M. Davidson meanwhile, argues that Sanderson's claims for direct influence from Shaiva ''Vidyapitha'' texts are problematic because "the chronology of the ''Vidyapitha'' tantras is by no means so well established" &lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the available evidence suggests that received Saiva tantras come into evidence sometime in the ninth to tenth centuries with their affirmation by scholars like [[Abhinavagupta]] (c. 1000 c.e.)"&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson also notes that the list of pithas or sacred places "are certainly not particularly Buddhist, nor are they uniquely [[Kapalika]] venues, despite their presence in lists employed by both traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson further adds that like the Buddhists, the Shaiva tradition was also involved in the appropriation of Hindu and non-Hindu deities, texts and traditions, an example being "village or tribal divinities like Tumburu".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson adds that Buddhists and [[Kapalika|Kapalikas]] as well as other ascetics (possibly [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pasupatas]]) mingled and discussed their paths at various pilgrimage places and that there were conversions between the different groups. Thus he concludes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Buddhist-Kapalika connection is more complex than a simple process of religious imitation and textual appropriation. There can be no question that the Buddhist tantras were heavily influenced by [[Kapalika]] and other Saiva movements, but the influence was apparently mutual. Perhaps a more nuanced model would be that the various lines of transmission were locally flourishing and that in some areas they interacted, while in others they maintained concerted hostility. Thus the influence was both sustained and reciprocal, even in those places where Buddhist and Kapalika siddhas were in extreme antagonism.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Davidson also argues for the influence of non-brahmanical and outcaste [[Tribal religions in India|tribal religions]] and their feminine deities ([[Paranasabari|Parnasabari]] and Janguli).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 228, 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Philosophical background==
According to [[Louis de La Vallée-Poussin]] and [[Alex Wayman]], the view of the Vajrayana is based on Mahayana [[Buddhist philosophy]], mainly the [[Madhyamaka]] and [[Yogacara]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, 2013, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. de la Vallée Poussin, Bouddhisme, études et matériaux, pp. 174-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference seen by Vajrayana thinkers is Tantra's superiority due to being a faster vehicle to liberation containing many skillful methods ([[upaya]]) of tantric ritual.

The importance of the theory of [[shunyata|emptiness]] is central to the Tantric view and practice. Buddhist emptiness sees the world as being fluid, without an ontological foundation or inherent existence but ultimately a fabric of constructions. Because of this, tantric practice such as self-visualization as the deity is seen as being no less real than everyday reality, but a process of transforming reality itself, including the practitioner's identity as the deity. As Stephan Beyer notes, "In a universe where all events dissolve ontologically into Emptiness, the touching of Emptiness in the ritual is the re-creation of the world in actuality".&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Stephan; The Cult of Tārā: Magic and Ritual in Tibet, 1978, page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of [[Buddha-nature]], as outlined in the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] of [[Asanga]], was also an important theory which became the basis for Tantric views.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125.&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by the Tantric commentator Lilavajra, this "intrinsic secret (behind) diverse manifestation" is the utmost secret and aim of Tantra. According to Alex Wayman this "Buddha embryo" (''tathāgatagarbha'') is a "non-dual, self-originated Wisdom ([[jnana]]), an effortless fount of good qualities" that resides in the mindstream but is "obscured by discursive thought."&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine is often associated with the idea of the [[Luminous mind|inherent or natural luminosity]] ([[Sanskrit|Skt:]] ''prakṛti-prabhāsvara-citta'', [[Tibetic languages|T.]] ''’od gsal gyi sems'') or purity of the mind (''prakrti-parisuddha''). 

Another fundamental theory of [[Tantric practice]] is that of transformation. Negative mental factors such as desire, hatred, greed, pride are not rejected as in non Tantric Buddhism, but are used as part of the path. As noted by French Indologist Madeleine Biardeau, tantric doctrine is "an attempt to place kama, desire, in every meaning of the word, in the service of liberation."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 202.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is outlined in the following quote from the [[Hevajra tantra]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Hevajra further states that "One knowing the nature of poison may dispel poison with poison."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 202.&lt;/ref&gt; As Snellgrove notes, this idea is already present in Asanga's [[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika]] and therefore it is possible that he was aware of Tantric techniques, including sexual yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Buddhist Tantra there is no strict separation of the profane or [[samsara]] and the sacred or [[nirvana]], rather they exist in a continuum. All individuals are seen as containing the seed of enlightenment within, which is covered over by defilements. Douglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayana sees [[Buddhahood]] not as something outside or an event in the future, but as immanently present.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in "A companion to Buddhist philosophy", page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as [[Buddhaguhya]], [[Vimalamitra]],
[[Ratnākaraśānti]] and [[Abhayakaragupta]] continued the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and adapted it to their commentaries on the major Tantras. Abhayakaragupta’s ''Vajravali'' is a key source in the theory and practice of tantric rituals. After monks such as [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Śubhakarasiṃha]] brought Tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as [[Yi Xing]] and [[Kūkai]].

Likewise in [[Tibet]], [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-28 - 1251), as well as later thinkers like [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364) expanded on these philosophies in their Tantric commentaries and treatises. The status of the tantric view continued to be debated in medieval Tibet. Tibetan Buddhist [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]] (1012–1088) held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra, as Koppl notes:

{{quote|By now we have seen that Rongzom regards the views of the Sutrayana as inferior to those of Mantra, and he underscores his commitment to the purity of all phenomena by criticizing the Madhyamaka objectification of the authentic relative truth.&lt;ref&gt;Koppl, Heidi. ''Establishing Appearances as Divine.'' Snow Lion Publications 2008, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419) on the other hand, held that there is no difference between Vajrayana and other forms of Mahayana in terms of [[prajnaparamita]] (perfection of insight) itself, only that Vajrayana is a method which works faster.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, 2013, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Place within Buddhist tradition==
[[File:Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tangut people|Tangut]] ''Auspicious [[Tantras|Tantra]] of All-Reaching Union''.]]

Various classifications are possible when distinguishing Vajrayana from the other Buddhist traditions. Vajrayana can be seen as a third ''yana'', next to [[Hinayana]] and [[Mahayana]].{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}} Vajrayana can be distinguished from the [[Sutrayana]]. The ''Sutrayana'' is the method of perfecting good qualities, where the ''Vajrayāna'' is the method of taking the intended outcome of [[Buddhahood]] as the path. Vajrayana, belonging to the mantrayana,  can also be distinguished from the paramitayana. According to this schema, Indian Mahayana revealed two vehicles (''yana'') or methods for attaining enlightenment: the method
of the perfections (''Paramitayana'') and the method of mantra (''Mantrayana'').{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} The ''Paramitayana'' consists of the six or ten ''[[paramita]]s'', of which the scriptures say that it takes three incalculable [[aeon]]s to lead one to Buddhahood. The tantra literature, however, claims that the ''Mantrayana'' leads one to Buddhahood in a single lifetime.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} According to the literature, the mantra is an easy path without the difficulties innate to the ''Paramitayana''.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} ''Mantrayana'' is sometimes portrayed as a method for those of inferior abilities.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} However the practitioner of the mantra still has to adhere to the vows of the [[Bodhisattva]].{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}}

==Characteristics of Vajrayana==
[[File:Manjushri from Rig Sum Gonpo (Lords of the Three Families), view 2, collected by Sven Hedin in 1930, Efi Khalkha temple, Chahar, Inner Mongolia - Östasiatiska museet, Stockholm - DSC09315.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Manjushri]], the [[bodhisattva]] associated with [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]].]]

===Goal===
The goal of spiritual practice within the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions is to become a ''Sammāsambuddha'' (fully awakened [[Buddha]]), those on this path are termed [[Bodhisattvas]]. As with the [[Mahayana]], motivation is a vital component of Vajrayana practice. The [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva-path]] is an integral part of the Vajrayana, which teaches that all practices are to be undertaken with the motivation to achieve [[Buddhahood]] for the benefit of all sentient beings.

In the Sutrayana practice, a path of [[Mahayana]], the "path of the cause" is taken, whereby a practitioner starts with his or her potential [[Buddha-nature]] and nurtures it to produce the fruit of [[Buddhahood]]. In the Vajrayana the "path of the fruit" is taken whereby the practitioner takes his or her innate Buddha-nature as the means of practice. The premise is that since we innately have an enlightened mind, practicing seeing the world in terms of ultimate truth can help us to attain our full Buddha-nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmo|first=Tenzin|title=''Reflections on a Mountain Lake:Teachings on Practical Buddhism''|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=2002|pages=224–5|isbn=1-55939-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing ultimate truth is said to be the purpose of all the various [[tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric techniques]] practiced in the Vajrayana.

=== Esoteric transmission ===
[[Image:Kalachakra0045 tiny.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Monks attending the 2003 [[Kalachakra]] empowerment in [[Bodhgaya]], India. Some empowerment ceremonies can include large numbers of initiates.]]
{{See also|Pointing-out instruction}}
Vajrayana Buddhism is esoteric in the sense that the transmission of certain teachings only occurs directly from teacher to student during an [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] (''abhiṣeka'') and their practice requires initiation in a ritual space containing the mandala of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pages 198, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that secrecy itself is not important and only a side-effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Dhammasaavaka. ''The Buddhism Primer: An Introduction to Buddhism'', p. 79. {{ISBN|1-4116-6334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to engage in Vajrayana practice, a student should have received such an initiation or permission:
{{quote|If these techniques are not practiced properly, practitioners may harm themselves physically and mentally. In order to avoid these dangers, the practice is kept "secret" outside the teacher/student relationship. Secrecy and the commitment of the student to the vajra guru are aspects of the ''[[samaya]]'' (Tib. ''damtsig''), or "sacred bond", that protects both the practitioner and the integrity of the teachings."{{sfn|Ray|2001}}}}

The secrecy of teachings was often protected through the use of allusive, indirect, symbolic and metaphorical language ([[twilight language]]) which required interpretation and guidance from a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings may also be considered "self-secret", meaning that even if they were to be told directly to a person, that person would not necessarily understand the teachings without proper context. In this way the teachings are "secret" to the minds of those who are not following the path with more than a simple sense of curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;Morreale, Don (1998) ''The Complete Guide to Buddhist America'' {{ISBN|1-57062-270-1}} p.215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam and Chödzin, Sherab (1992) ''The Lion's Roar: An Introduction to Tantra'' {{ISBN|0-87773-654-5}} p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their role in giving access to the practices and guiding the student through them, the role of the [[Guru]], [[Lama]] or [[Vajracharya]] is indispensable in Vajrayana.

=== Affirmation of the feminine, antinomian and taboo ===
[[File:Chakrasamvara_01.jpg|thumb|200px|Tibetan [[Chakrasamvara]] statue in [[Yab-Yum]] union with his consort [[Vajravārāhī]]]]
Some Vajrayana rituals include use of certain taboo substances, such as blood, semen, alcohol and urine, as ritual offerings and sacraments, though these are often replaced with less taboo substances in their place such as yogurt. Tantric feasts and initiations sometimes employed substances like human flesh as noted by Kahha’s ''Yogaratnamala''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these substances is related to the [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') nature of Buddhahood. Since the ultimate state is in some sense non-dual, a practitioner can approach that state by "transcending attachment to dual categories such as pure and impure, permitted and forbidden". As the Guhyasamaja Tantra states "the wise man who does not discriminate achieves buddhahood".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vajrayana rituals also include [[karmamudra|sexual yoga]], union with a physical consort as part of advanced practices. Some tantras go further, the
[[Hevajra Tantra]] states ‘You should kill living beings, speak lying words, take what is not given, consort with the women of others’.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt;  While some of these statements were taken literally as part of ritual practice, others such as killing was interpreted in a metaphorical sense. In the Hevajra, "killing" is defined as developing concentration by killing the life-breath of discursive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, while actual sexual union with a physical consort is practiced, it is also common to use a visualized mental consort.

Alex Wayman points out that the symbolic meaning of tantric sexuality is ultimately rooted in [[bodhicitta]] and the bodhisattva's quest for enlightenment is likened to a lover seeking union with the mind of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan esotericism, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Simmer-Brown notes the importance of the psycho-physical experiences arising in sexual yoga, termed "great bliss" ([[Mahasukha]]): "Bliss melts the conceptual mind, heightens sensory awareness, and opens the practitioner to the naked experience of the nature of mind."&lt;ref&gt;Simmer-Brown, Judith; Dakini's Warm Breath: The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; This tantric experience is not the same as ordinary self gratifying sexual passion since it relies on tantric meditative methods using the subtle body and visualizations as well as the motivation for enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Simmer-Brown, Judith; Dakini's Warm Breath: The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, page 217-219&lt;/ref&gt; As the Hevajra tantra says:

"This practice [of sexual union with a consort] is not taught for the sake of enjoyment, but for the examination of one's own thought, whether the mind is steady or waving."&lt;ref&gt;Simmer-Brown, Judith; Dakini's Warm Breath: The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, page 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminine deities and forces are also increasingly prominent in Vajrayana. In the Yogini tantras in particular, women and female figures are given high status as the embodiment of female deities such as the wild and nude [[Vajrayogini]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pages 198, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Candamaharosana Tantra'' states:

:Women are heaven, women are the teaching (dharma)
:Women indeed are the highest austerity (tapas)
:Women are the Buddha, women are the Sangha
:Women are the Perfection of Wisdom.
:''Candamaharosana Tantra viii:29–30''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pages 198, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, there is evidence to show that women participated in tantric practice alongside men and were also teachers, adepts and authors of tantric texts.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, pages 198, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vows and behaviour ===
{{main article|Samaya}}
Practitioners of the Vajrayana need to abide by various tantric vows or ''[[samaya]]'' of behaviour. These are extensions of the rules of the [[Prātimokṣa]] and [[Bodhisattva vow]]s for the lower levels of tantra, and are taken during initiations into the empowerment for a particular [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]. The special tantric vows vary depending on the specific [[mandala]] practice for which the initiation is received, and also depending on the level of initiation. [[Ngagpa]]s of the [[Nyingma]] school keep a special non-celibate ordination.

A tantric [[guru]], or teacher, is expected to keep his or her ''samaya'' vows in the same way as his students.  Proper conduct is considered especially necessary for a qualified Vajrayana guru. For example, the ''Ornament for the Essence'' of Manjushrikirti states:&lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa, ''Tantric Ethics: An Explanation of the Precepts for Buddhist Vajrayana Practice'' {{ISBN|0-86171-290-0}}, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Distance yourself from Vajra Masters who are not keeping the three vows&lt;br /&gt;
who keep on with a root downfall, who are miserly with the Dharma,&lt;br /&gt;
and who engage in actions that should be forsaken.&lt;br /&gt;
Those who worship them go to hell and so on as a result.}}

== Tantra techniques ==
[[File:Buddhist_spiritual_dance_Bomdila.webm|thumb|A video of the [[Cham dance]], a traditional practice in some sects of Tibetan Buddhism.]]
[[File:Prayer wheels, surrounding the Tsuglagkhang Temple in McLeod Ganj.jpg|thumb|right|"[[om mani padme hum]]" prayer wheels]]
{{main article|Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)}}
While Vajrayana includes all of the traditional practices used in [[Mahayana Buddhism]] such as [[samatha]] and [[vipassana]] [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and the [[paramitas]], it also includes a number of unique practices or "skillful means" (Sanskrit: ''[[upaya]]'') which are seen as more advanced and effective. Vajrayana is a system of [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineages]], whereby those who successfully receive an [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] or sometimes called initiation (permission to practice) are seen to share in the [[mindstream]] of the realisation of a particular skillful means of the ''vajra'' Master. Vajrayana teaches that the Vajrayana techniques provide an accelerated path to [[bodhi|enlightenment]] which is faster than other paths.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey; Tantric Techniques, 2008, pp 220, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

A central feature of tantric practice is the use of [[mantras]], syllables, words or a collection of syllables understood to have special powers and hence is a 'performative utterance' used for a variety of ritual ends. In tantric meditation, mantric seed syllables are used during the ritual evocation of deities which are said to arise out of the uttered and visualized mantric syllables. After the deity has been established, heart mantras are visualized as part of the contemplation in different points of the deity's body.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alex Wayman, Buddhist esotericism is centered on what is known as "the three mysteries" or "secrets": the tantric adept affiliates his body, speech, and mind with the body, speech, and mind of the Buddha through [[mudra]], [[mantras]] and [[samadhi]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Padmavajra (c 7th century) explains in his ''Tantrarthavatara'' Commentary, the secret Body, Speech, and Mind of the Tathagatas are:&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan esotericism, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Secret of Body: Whatever form is necessary to tame the living beings.
:Secret of Speech: Speech exactly appropriate to the lineage of the creature, as in the language of the yaksas, etc.
:Secret of Mind: Knowing all things as they really are.

===Deity yoga===
[[File:Amitayus Mandala.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Amitayus]] Mandala]]
The fundamental, defining practice of Buddhist Tantra is “[[deity yoga]]” (''devatayoga''), meditation on a [[yidam]], or personal deity, which involves the recitation of mantras, prayers and visualization of the deity along with the associated [[mandala]] of the deity's [[Pure Land]], with consorts and attendants.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tsongkhapa]], deity yoga is what separates Tantra from sutra practice.&lt;ref&gt;Power, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 271&lt;/ref&gt;

A key element of this practice involves the dissolution of the profane world and identification with a sacred reality.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Because Tantra makes use of a "similitude" of the resultant state of [[Buddhahood]] as the path, it is known as the effect vehicle or result vehicle (''phalayana'') which "brings the effect to the path".&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Highest Yoga Tantras and in the Inner Tantras this is usually done in two stages, the [[generation stage]] (''utpattikrama'') and the [[completion stage]] (''nispannakrama''). In the generation stage, one dissolves oneself in emptiness and meditates on the [[yidam]], resulting in identification with this yidam. In the completion stage, the visualization of and identification with the yidam is dissolved in the realization of [[Luminous mind|luminous]] [[sunyata|emptiness]]. [[Ratnakarasanti]] describes the generation stage cultivation practice thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]ll phenomenal appearance having arisen as mind, this very mind is [understood to be] produced by a mistake (''bhrāntyā''), i.e. the appearance of an object where there is no object to be grasped; ascertaining that this is like a dream, in order to abandon this mistake, all appearances of objects that are blue and yellow and so on are abandoned or destroyed (''parihṛ-''); then, the appearance of the world (''viśvapratibhāsa'') that is ascertained to be oneself (''ātmaniścitta'') is seen to be like the stainless sky on an autumn day at noon: appearanceless, unending sheer luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Davey K; The tantric context of Ratnākaraśānti’s theory of consciousness&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This dissolution into emptiness is then followed by the visualization of the deity and re-emergence of the yogi as the deity. During the process of deity visualization, the deity is to be imaged as not solid or tangible, as "empty yet apparent", with the character of a [[mirage]] or a [[rainbow]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; This visualization is to be combined with "divine pride", which is "the thought that one is oneself the deity being visualized."&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel; Highest Yoga Tantra, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Divine pride is different from common pride because it is based on compassion for others and on an understanding of emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Power, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practices associated with the completion stage make use of an energetic system of human psycho-physiology composed of what is termed as energy channels (rtsa), winds or currents (rlung), and drops or charged particles (thig le). These [[subtle body]] energies as seen as "mounts" for consciousness, the physical component of awareness. They are said to converge at certain points along the spinal column called [[chakras]].&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Some practices which make use of this system include [[Trul khor]] and [[Tummo]].

===Other practices===
Another form of Vajrayana practice are certain meditative techniques associated with [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]] often termed "formless practices". These techniques do not rely on yidam visualization but on direct [[Pointing-out instruction]] from a master and are seen as the most advanced forms.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], advanced practices like deity yoga and the formless practices are usually preceded by or coupled with "preliminary practices" called [[ngondro]] which includes [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostrations]] and recitations of the [[Vajrasattva#Hundred Syllable Mantra|100 syllable mantra]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinctive feature of Tantric Buddhism is its unique [[ritual]]s, which are used as a substitute or alternative for the earlier abstract meditations.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=466}}{{itation not found|date=September 2018}}{{sfn|Hawkins|1999|p=24}} They include death rituals (see ''[[phowa]]''), tantric feasts ([[ganachakra]]) and [[Homa (ritual)#Buddhism|Homa fire ritual]], common in East Asian Tantric Buddhism.

Other unique practices in Tantric Buddhism include [[Dream yoga]], the yoga of the intermediate state (at death) or [[Bardo]] and [[Chöd]], in which the yogi ceremonially offers their body to be eaten by tantric deities.

==Symbols and imagery==
[[File:Hevajra Mandala.jpg|thumb|[[Dagchen Rinpoche]]'s hand holds a [[vajra]] drawing lines that close the [[Hevajra]] [[Mandala]], after the empowerment, Tharlam Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism, Boudha, [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]].]]
The Vajrayana uses a rich variety of symbols, terms and images which have multiple meanings according to a complex system of [[analogical]] thinking. In Vajrayana, symbols and terms are multi-valent, reflecting the microcosm and the macrocosm as in the phrase "As without, so within" (''yatha bahyam tatha ’dhyatmam iti'') from [[Abhayakaragupta]]’s ''Nispannayogavali''.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tibetan Mask.jpg|thumb|Tibetan [[Citipati (Buddhism)|Citipati]] mask depicting [[Mahākāla]]]]
===The Vajra===
The [[Sanskrit]] term "[[vajra]]" denoted the [[thunderbolt]], a legendary weapon and divine attribute that was made from an [[adamant]]ine, or indestructible, substance and which could therefore pierce and penetrate any obstacle or [[obfuscation]]. It is the weapon of choice of [[Indra]], the King of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]. As a secondary meaning, "vajra" symbolizes the ultimate nature of things which is described in the tantras as translucent, pure and radiant, but also indestructible and indivisible. It is also symbolic of the power of tantric methods to achieve its goals.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

A vajra is also a scepter-like ritual object ({{lang-bo|རྡོ་རྗེ་}} ''dorje''), which has a sphere (and sometimes a [[gankyil]]) at its centre, and a variable number of spokes, 3, 5 or 9 at each end (depending on the [[sadhana]]), enfolding either end of the rod. The vajra is often traditionally employed in tantric rituals in combination with the [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] or [[ghanta]]; symbolically, the vajra may represent [[upaya|method]] as well as great bliss and the bell stands for [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]], specifically the [[Śūnyatā|wisdom realizing emptiness]]. The union of the two sets of spokes at the center of the wheel is said to symbolize the unity of wisdom (prajña) and
compassion (karuna) as well as the sexual union of male and female deities.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Wynne, Tribe; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagery and ritual in deity yoga===
[[File:Chöd practitioners at Boudhanath stupa.jpg|thumb|[[Chöd]] ritual, note the use of [[Damaru]] drum and hand-bell, as well as the [[Kangling]] (thighbone trumpet).]]
Representations of the deity, such as statues (''[[murti]]''), paintings (''[[thangka]]''), or [[mandala]], are often employed as an aid to [[Mental image|visualization]], in Deity yoga. The use of visual aids, particularly  microcosmic/macrocosmic diagrams, known as "[[mandalas]]", is another unique feature of Buddhist Tantra. Mandalas are symbolic depictions of the sacred space of the awakened Buddhas and [[Bodhisattvas]] as well as of the inner workings of the human person.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The macrocosmic symbolism of the mandala then, also represents the forces of the human body. The explanatory tantra of the Guhyasamaja tantra, the ''Vajramala'', states: "The body becomes a palace, the hallowed basis of all the Buddhas."&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan esotericism, page 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandalas are also sacred enclosures, [[sacred architecture]] that house and contain the uncontainable essence of a central deity or ''yidam'' and their retinue. In the book ''The World of Tibetan Buddhism'', the Dalai Lama describes mandalas thus: "This is the celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity." The [[Five Tathagatas]] or 'Five Buddhas', along with the figure of the [[Adi-Buddha]], are central to many Vajrayana mandalas as they represent the "five wisdoms", which are the five primary aspects of primordial wisdom or [[Buddha-nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

All ritual in Vajrayana practice can be seen as aiding in this process of visualization and identification. The practitioner can use various hand implements such as a ''vajra'', bell, hand-drum (''[[damaru]]'') or a ritual dagger (''[[phurba]]''), but also ritual hand gestures (''[[mudra]]s'') can be made, special chanting techniques can be used, and in elaborate offering rituals or initiations, many more ritual implements and tools are used, each with an elaborate symbolic meaning to create a special environment for practice. Vajrayana has thus become a major inspiration in traditional [[Tibetan art]].

==Vajrayana textual tradition==
{{see also|Tibetan Buddhist canon}}
The Vajrayana tradition has developed an extended body of texts:
{{quote|''Though we do not know precisely at present just how many Indian tantric Buddhist texts survive today in the language in which they were written, their number is certainly over one thousand five hundred; I suspect indeed over two thousand. A large part of this body of texts has also been translated into Tibetan, and a smaller part into Chinese. Aside from these, there are perhaps another two thousand or more works that are known today only from such translations. We can be certain as well that many others are lost to us forever, in whatever form. Of the texts that survive a very small proportion has been published; an almost insignificant percentage has been edited or translated reliably.''&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Harunaga (1998). Tantric Buddhism in India (from c. 800 to c. 1200). In: Buddhismus in Geschichte und Gegenwart. Band II. Hamburg. pp.23–49. (Internal publication of Hamburg University.) pg 3 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120307044139/http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/digitale_texte/Bd2-K02Isaacson.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Literary characteristics===
Vajrayana texts exhibit a wide range of literary characteristics—usually a mix of verse and prose, almost always in a Sanskrit that "transgresses frequently against classical norms of grammar and usage," although also occasionally in various Middle Indic dialects or elegant classical Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dunhuang manuscripts===
The [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] also contain Tibetan Tantric manuscripts. Dalton and Schaik (2007, revised) provide an excellent online catalogue listing 350 Tibetan Tantric Manuscripts] from [[Dunhuang]] in the Stein Collection of the [[British Library]] which is currently fully accessible online in discrete digitized manuscripts.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_cat.a4d?shortref=Dalton_vanSchaik_2005 Catalogue of the Tibetan Tantric Manuscripts from Dunhuang in the Stein Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; With the Wylie transcription of the manuscripts they are to be made discoverable online in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Jacob &amp; [[Sam van Schaik|van Schaik, Sam]] (2007).

Source: [http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_cat.a4d?shortref=Dalton_vanSchaik_2005] (accessed: Tuesday February 2, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; These 350 texts are just a small portion of the vast cache of the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]].

==Schools of Vajrayana==
Although there is historical evidence for [[Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia]] and elsewhere (see [[Vajrayana#History of Vajrayāna|History of Vajrayana]] above), today the Vajrayana exists primarily in the form of the two major traditions of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Japanese Esoteric Buddhism]] in [[Japan]] known as ''[[Shingon]]'' (literally "True Speech", i.e. ''[[mantra]]''), with a handful of minor subschools utilising lesser amounts of esoteric or tantric materials.

The distinction between traditions is not always rigid. For example, the [[tantra]] sections of the [[Kangyur|Tibetan Buddhist canon of texts]] sometimes include material not usually thought of as tantric outside the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition, such as the ''[[Heart Sutra]]''&lt;ref&gt;Conze, ''The Prajnaparamita Literature''&lt;/ref&gt; and even versions of some material found in the ''[[Pali Canon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Skilling, ''Mahasutras'', volume I, 1994, [[Pali Text Society]][http://www.palitext.com/], Lancaster, page xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Skilling, ''Mahasutras'', volume I, parts I &amp; II, 1997, Pali Text Society, page 78, speaks of the tantra divisions of some editions of the [[Kangyur]] as including Sravakayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana texts}}

=== Tibetan Buddhism ===
[[File:Larung Gar Five Sciences Buddhist Academy 2014 (14660043083).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Larung Gar Buddhist Academy]], in [[Sêrtar County]], [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Garzê]], [[Sichuan]], [[China]]. It is the largest Tibetan Buddhist community in the world.]]
{{main article|Tibetan Buddhism}}
Vajrayana Buddhism was established in Tibet in the 8th century when [[Śāntarakṣita]] was brought to [[Tibet]] from [[India]] at the instigation of the Dharma King [[Trisong Detsen]], some time before 767. Tibetan Buddhism reflects the later stages of Indian tantric Buddhist developments, including the Yogini tantras, translated into the Tibetan language. It also includes native Tibetan developments, such as the [[tulku]] system, new [[sadhana]] texts, Tibetan scholastic works, [[Dzogchen]] literature and [[Terma (religion)|Terma]] literature.

The Tibetan Buddhist schools, based on the lineages and textual traditions of the [[Kangyur]] and [[Tengyur]] of [[Tibet]], are found in [[Tibet]], [[Buddhism in Bhutan|Bhutan]], northern [[Buddhism in India|India]], [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]], southwestern and northern [[Buddhism in China|China]], [[Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolia]] and various constituent [[republics]] of [[Buddhism in Russia|Russia]] that are adjacent to the area, such as [[Amur Oblast]], [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]], [[Chita Oblast]], the [[Tuva Republic]] and [[Khabarovsk Krai]]. Tibetan Buddhism is also the main religion in [[Kalmykia]].

===Nepalese Newar Buddhism===
{{main article|Newar Buddhism}}
Newar Buddhism is practiced by [[Newars]] in [[Nepal]]. It is the only form of Vajrayana Buddhism in which the scriptures are written in [[Sanskrit]] and this tradition has preserved many Vajrayana texts in this language. Its priests do not follow celibacy and are called ''[[vajracharya]]'' (literally "[[vajra|diamond-thunderbolt]] carriers").

===Tantric Theravada===
{{Main article|Tantric Theravada}}
Tantric Theravada or "Esoteric Southern Buddhism" is a term for esoteric forms of Buddhism from [[Southeast Asia]], where [[Theravada Buddhism]] is dominant. The monks of the Sri Lankan, [[Abhayagiri vihara]] once practiced forms of tantra which were popular in the island.&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, L.S. (1997), "Aspects of Southern Esoteric Buddhism", in Peter Connolly and Sue Hamilton (eds.), Indian Insights: Buddhism, Brahmanism and Bhakd Papers from the Annual Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, Luzac Oriental, London: 185-207, 410. {{ISBN|1-898942-153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition of this type was [[Ari Buddhism]], which was common in [[Burma]]. The Tantric Buddhist 'Yogāvacara' tradition was a major Buddhist tradition in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]] well into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Crosby, Traditional Theravada Meditation and its Modern-Era Suppression Hong Kong: Buddha Dharma Centre of Hong Kong, 2013, {{ISBN|978-9881682024}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of Buddhism declined after the rise of Southeast Asian [[Buddhist modernism]].

===Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism===

Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism refers to the traditions of Esoteric Buddhism found in the Indonesian islands of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]] before the rise and dominance of [[Islam]] in the region (13-16th centuries). The Buddhist empire of [[Srivijaya]] (650 CE–1377 CE) was a major center of Esoteric Buddhist learning which drew Chinese monks such as [[Yijing]] and Indian scholars like [[Atiśa]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Philippine Esoteric Buddhism===
{{Main|Philippine Esoteric  Buddhism |Buddhism in the Philippines}}
[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The [[Golden Tara]] at the collections  one of the significant examples of buddhist iconography in the [[Philippines]].]]
Although no written record exists about early [[Buddhism]] in the [[Philippines]], the recent archaeological discoveries and the few scant references in the other nations historical records can tell, however, about the existence of Buddhism from the 9th century onward in the islands. The Philippines’s archaeological finds include a few of Buddhist artifacts, most of them dated to the 9th century. The artifacts reflect the iconography of the [[Srivijaya]]’s Vajrayana Buddhism &lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Legeza, "Tantric Elements in Pre-Hispanic Gold Art," Arts of Asia, 1988, 4:129-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="camperspoint"&gt;[http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=239 Camperspoint: History of Palawan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115190428/http://www.camperspoint.com/article.php3?id_article=239 |date=2009-01-15 }}. Accessed 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and its influences on the Philippines’s early states. The artifacts distinct features point to their production in the islands and hint at the artisans or goldsmiths knowledge of Buddhist culture and Buddhist literature because the artisans have made these unique works of Buddhist art. The artifacts imply also the presence of Buddhist believers in the places where these artifacts turned up. These places extended from the Agusan-Surigao area in Mindanao island to [[Cebu]], [[Palawan]], and [[Luzon]] islands.

Hence, Vajrayana Buddhism must have spread far and wide throughout the archipelago. And Vajrayana Buddhism must have become the religion of the majority of the inhabitants in the islands. The early states trade contacts with the neighboring empires and polities like in Sumatra, Srivijaya and Majapahit empire in Java long before or in the 9th century must have served as the conduit for introducing Vajrayana Buddhism to the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philippinebuddhism.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/early-buddhism-in-the-philippines/|title=Early Buddhism in the Philippines|first=|last=filipinobuddhism|date=8 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese Esoteric Buddhism ===
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|The [[Womb Realm]] [[mandala|maṇḍala]] used in [[Śubhakarasiṃha]]'s teachings from the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra]]''. [[Vairocana]] is located in the center.]]
{{Main article|Chinese Esoteric Buddhism}}

Esoteric and Tantric teachings followed the same route into northern [[China]] as [[Buddhism]] itself, arriving via the [[Silk Road]] and Southeast Asian Maritime trade routes sometime during the first half of the 7th century, during the [[Tang dynasty]] and received sanction from the emperors of the Tang dynasty. During this time, three great masters came from India to China: [[Subhakarasimha|Śubhakarasiṃha]], [[Vajrabodhi]], and [[Amoghavajra]] who translated key texts and founded the ''Zhenyan'' (真言, "true word", "[[mantra]]") tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibbhuti (2008) ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism'': p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zhenyan'' was also brought to [[Japan]] as [[Shingon]] during this period. This tradition focused on tantras like the [[Mahavairocana tantra]], and unlike Tibetan Buddhism, does not employ the antinomian and radical tantrism of the [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]s.

The prestige of this tradition influenced other schools of [[Chinese Buddhism]] such as Chan and [[Tiantai]] to adopt esoteric practices.&lt;ref&gt;Orzech, Charles D. (general editor) (2011). Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia, Brill, Page 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, Robert (2001) ''Coming to Terms With Chinese Buddhism: A Reading of the Treasure Store Treatise'': p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faure, Bernard (1997) ''The Will to Orthodoxy: A Critical Genealogy of Northern Chan Buddhism'': p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[Mongol]] emperors made [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the official religion of China, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court.&lt;ref name="Nan Huaijin 1997. p. 99"&gt;Nan Huaijin. ''Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen.'' York Beach: Samuel Weiser. 1997. p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial support of Tibetan Vajrayana continued into the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Another form of esoteric Buddhism in China is [[Azhaliism]], which is practiced among the [[Bai people]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Huang | first1 = Zhengliang | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Xilu | title = Research Review of Bai Esoteric Buddhist Azhali Religion Since the 20th Century | journal = Journal of Dali University | volume = | number = | date = 2013 | url = http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-DLSZ201307000.htm | doi = | ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wu | first = Jiang | year = 2011 | title = Enlightenment in Dispute: The Reinvention of Chan Buddhism in Seventeenth-Century China | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = USA | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d7Dg5N4tSWgC | ISBN = 0199895562 | ref = harv}} p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean ''milgyo''===
Esoteric Buddhist practices (known as ''milgyo'', 密教) and texts arrived in [[Korea]] during the initial introduction of Buddhism to the region in 372 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://congress.aks.ac.kr/korean/files/2_1358319390.pdf Georgieva-Russ, Nelly. Esoteric Buddhist Ritual Objects of the Koryŏ Dynasty (936-1392)]&lt;/ref&gt; Esoteric Buddhism was supported by the royalty of both [[Unified Silla]] (668-935) and [[Goryeo Dynasty]] (918-1392).&lt;ref&gt;[http://congress.aks.ac.kr/korean/files/2_1358319390.pdf Georgieva-Russ, Nelly. Esoteric Buddhist Ritual Objects of the Koryŏ Dynasty (936-1392)]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Goryeo Dynasty esoteric practices were common within large sects like the [[Korean Seon|Seon school]], and the [[Hwaeom]] school as well as smaller esoteric sects like the Sinin (''mudra'') and Ch'ongji (''Dharani'') schools. During the era of the Mongol occupation (1251-1350s), Tibetan Buddhism also existed in Korea though it never gained a foothold there.&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen. Esoteric Buddhism under the Koryŏ in the Light of the Greater East Asian Tradition. International Journal of Buddhist Thought &amp; Culture September 2006, Vol.7, pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Joseon dynasty]], Esoteric Buddhist schools were forced to merge with the Son and Kyo schools, becoming the ritual specialists. With the decline of Buddhism in Korea, Esoteric Buddhism mostly died out, save for a few traces in the rituals of the [[Jogye Order]] and [[Taego Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen. Esoteric Buddhism under the Koryŏ in the Light of the Greater East Asian Tradition. International Journal of Buddhist Thought &amp; Culture September 2006, Vol.7, pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two Esoteric Buddhist schools in modern Korea: the Chinŏn (眞言) and the [[Jingak Order]] (眞
覺). According to Henrik H. Sørensen, "they have absolutely no historical link with the Korean Buddhist tradition per se but are late constructs based in large measures on Japanese Shingon Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen. Esoteric Buddhism under the Koryŏ in the Light of the Greater East Asian Tradition. International Journal of Buddhist Thought &amp; Culture September 2006, Vol.7, pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Syouhouji5838.jpg|thumb|200px|''Iwama-dera'' or ''Shōhō-ji'', a Shingon Buddhist temple in [[Ōtsu]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Japan]].]]

====Shingon Buddhism====
{{main article|Shingon Buddhism}}
The Shingon school is found in [[Japan]] and includes practices, known in Japan as ''[[Mikkyō]]'' ("Esoteric (or Mystery) Teaching"), which are similar in concept to those in Vajrayana Buddhism. The lineage for Shingon Buddhism differs from that of Tibetan Vajrayana, having emerged from [[India]] during the 9th-11th centuries in the [[Pala Dynasty]] and [[Central Asia]] (via [[China]]) and is based on earlier versions of the Indian texts than the Tibetan lineage. Shingon shares material with [[Tibetan Buddhism]]–-such as the esoteric sutras (called [[Tantras]] in Tibetan Buddhism) and [[mandala]]s – but the actual practices are not related.  The primary texts of Shingon Buddhism are the ''[[Mahavairocana Sutra]]'' and ''[[Vajrasekhara Sutra]]''.  The founder of Shingon Buddhism was [[Kukai]], a Japanese monk who studied in China in the 9th century during the Tang dynasty and brought back Vajrayana scriptures, techniques and mandalas then popular in China. The school mostly died out or was merged into other schools in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty but flourished in Japan. Shingon is one of the few remaining branches of Buddhism in the world that continues to use the ''[[Siddhaṃ script|siddham]]'' script of the [[Sanskrit]] language.

====Tendai Buddhism====
{{Main article|Tendai}}
Although the Tendai school in China and Japan does employ some esoteric practices, these rituals came to be considered of equal importance with the exoteric teachings of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''.  By chanting [[mantras]], maintaining [[mudras]], or practicing certain forms of meditation, [[Tendai]] maintains that one is able to understand sense experiences as taught by the Buddha, have [[faith in Buddhism|faith]] that one is innately an enlightened being, and that one can attain enlightenment within the current lifetime.

====Shugendō====
{{Main article|Shugendō}}
Shugendō was founded in 7th-century Japan by the ascetic [[En no Gyōja]], based on the ''Queen's Peacocks Sutra''. With its origins in the solitary ''hijiri'' back in the 7th century, Shugendō evolved as a sort of amalgamation between Esoteric Buddhism, Shinto and several other religious influences including [[Taoism]]. Buddhism and Shinto were amalgamated in the ''shinbutsu shūgō'', and Kūkai's syncretic religion held wide sway up until the end of the [[Edo period]], coexisting with Shinto elements within Shugendō&lt;ref&gt;Miyake, Hitoshi. ''Shugendo in History''. pp45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1613 during the [[Edo period]], the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] issued a regulation obliging Shugendō temples to belong to either Shingon or Tendai temples. During the [[Meiji Restoration]], when Shinto was declared an independent state religion separate from Buddhism, Shugendō was banned as a superstition not fit for a new, enlightened Japan. Some Shugendō temples converted themselves into various officially approved Shintō denominations. In modern times, Shugendō is practiced mainly by Tendai and Shingon sects, retaining an influence on modern [[Japanese religion]] and [[Culture of Japan|culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet-ga.ne.jp/kenta/mitsu/mitsu.html 密教と修験道] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102508/http://www.cnet-ga.ne.jp/kenta/mitsu/mitsu.html |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study difficulties==
Serious Vajrayana academic study in the Western world is in early stages due to the following obstacles:{{sfn|Akira|1993|p=9}}
# Although a large number of Tantric scriptures are extant, they have not been formally ordered or systematized.
# Due to the esoteric initiatory nature of the tradition, many practitioners will not divulge information or sources of their information.
# As with many different subjects, it must be studied in context and with a long history spanning many different cultures.
# Ritual as well as doctrine need to be investigated.

Buddhist tantric practice are categorized as secret practice; this is to avoid misinformed people from harmfully misusing the practices. A method to keep this secrecy is that tantric initiation is required from a master before any instructions can be received about the actual practice. During the initiation procedure in the highest class of tantra (such as the Kalachakra), students must take the tantric vows which commit them to such secrecy.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://kalachakranet.org/kalachakra_tantra_taking_initiation.html Kalachakra Tantra taking initiation (accessed June 26, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; "Explaining general tantra theory in a scholarly manner, not sufficient for practice, is likewise not a root downfall. Nevertheless, it weakens the effectiveness of our tantric practice." &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/prayers-rituals/vows/common-root-tantric-vows Dr Alex Berzin on Tantric Vows accessed June 20, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology ===
The terminology associated with Vajrayana Buddhism can be confusing. Most of the terms originated in the [[Sanskrit]] language of tantric [[Indian Buddhism]] and may have passed through other cultures, notably those of Japan and Tibet, before translation for the modern reader. Further complications arise as seemingly equivalent terms can have subtle variations in use and meaning according to context, the time and place of use. A third problem is that the Vajrayana texts employ the tantric tradition of [[Twilight language (tantra)|twilight language]], a means of instruction that is deliberately coded. These obscure teaching methods relying on [[religious symbolism|symbolism]] as well as [[synonym]], [[metaphor]] and [[word association]] add to the difficulties faced by those attempting to understand Vajrayana Buddhism:
{{quote|In the Vajrayana tradition, now preserved mainly in Tibetan lineages, it has long been recognized that certain important teachings are expressed in a form of secret symbolic language known as {{IAST|saṃdhyā-bhāṣā}}, 'Twilight Language'. ''[[Mudrā]]s'' and ''[[mantra]]s'', {{IAST|[[maṇḍala]]s}} and ''[[cakra]]s'', those mysterious devices and diagrams that were so much in vogue in the pseudo-Buddhist [[hippie]] culture of the 1960s, were all examples of Twilight Language [...] &lt;ref&gt;Bucknell, Roderick &amp; Stuart-Fox, Martin (1986). ''The Twilight Language: Explorations in Buddhist Meditation and Symbolism''. Curzon Press: London. {{ISBN|0-312-82540-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term Tantric Buddhism was not one originally used by those who practiced it. As scholar Isabelle Onians explains:

{{quote|"Tantric Buddhism" [...] is not the transcription of a native term, but a rather modern coinage, if not totally occidental. For the equivalent Sanskrit ''tāntrika'' is found, but not in Buddhist texts. ''Tāntrika'' is a term denoting someone who follows the teachings of scriptures known as Tantras, but only in [[Saivism]], not Buddhism [...] Tantric Buddhism is a name for a phenomenon which calls itself, in Sanskrit, Mantranaya, Vajrayāna, Mantrayāna or Mantramahāyāna (and apparently never Tantrayāna). Its practitioners are known as ''mantrins'', ''yogis'', or ''sādhakas''. Thus, our use of the anglicised adjective “Tantric” for the Buddhist religion taught in Tantras is not native to the tradition, but is a borrowed term which serves its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Onians, "Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm," D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001 pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''wearable generator''' is an article of clothing that contains some form of electrical generation system built in. The concept encompasses a variety of generation systems intended to supply small amounts of power to keep portable electronics in a good state of charge through natural motions of the body.

==Summary==
There are many great projects related to wearable technology or wearable power generation. One concept, for example, is an article of clothing that has the ability to convert the movements of the wearer into [[electricity]] using [[nanotechnology|nano]]-[[ion]] pumps.&lt;ref name="sparksuit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-Nike-ONE-Gran-Turismo.htm| title = Spark Suit information | publisher = Serious Wheels | accessdate = 2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[nanotechnology]] and has the ability to [[electrical generator|generate electricity]] for the purposes of building [[Muscle|muscle mass]] and improving [[motor coordination|coordination]].&lt;ref name="disenoart"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.diseno-art.com/encyclopedia/archive/nike_one.html| title = Spark Suit information (second reference) | publisher = Diseno-Art | accessdate = 2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency workers like firemen and paramedics could use chest-implanted sensors to create a floor plan of unfamiliar buildings; making a rookie perform his job as efficiently as a veteran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/mit-hacks-kinect-laser-for-a-wearable-map-generator-for-firefighters/| title = ''MIT Hacks Kinect Laser For A Wearable Map Generator For Firefighters'' | publisher = Tech Crunch | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cameras becoming cheaper and smaller, wearable generators may also serve as a quick method to recharge the batteries on those devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/smart-actuation-and-sensing-systems-recent-advances-and-future-challenges/a-technology-for-soft-and-wearable-generators| title = ''A Technology for Soft and Wearable Generators'' | publisher = Intech | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental burden of disposing used batteries has contributed to [[Electronic waste|e-waste]]; something that wearable generators may drastically reduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gizmowatch.com/entry/wearable-generators-to-power-battery-life-in-your-equipment/| title = ''Wearable generators to power battery life in your equipment'' | publisher = Gizmo Watch | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enough energy can theoretically be harnessed from a person's body heat to power a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=239901 | title = ''Wearable Fabric Could Power Your iPhone'' | publisher = Design News | accessdate = 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21002">The term '''white savior''', sometimes combined with [[savior complex]] to write '''white savior complex''', refers to a [[white people|white person]] who acts to help non-white people, with the help in some contexts perceived to be self-serving. The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]" (1899) by [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="zane"&gt;{{cite news | last=Zane | first=Damian | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36132482 | title=Barbie challenges the 'white saviour complex' | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=May 1, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been associated with Africa, and certain characters in film and television have been critiqued as white savior figures. Writer [[Teju Cole]] combined the term and "industrial complex" (derived from [[military-industrial complex]] and similarly applied elsewhere) to coin "White Savior Industrial Complex".

==Association with Africa==
{{see also|Aid}}
Africa has a [[slavery in Africa|history of slavery]] and [[Colonisation of Africa|of colonization]]. Damian Zane of [[BBC News]] said due to the history, Africans find the "white savior" attitude to help them "deeply patronising and offensive". Zane said, "Some argue that aid can be counter-productive, as it means African countries will continue to rely on outside help."&lt;ref name="zane" /&gt; Bhakti Shringarpure, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said, "Westerners trying to help poor, suffering countries have often been accused of having a 'white saviour complex': a term tied up in colonial history where Europeans descended to 'civilise' the African continent."&lt;ref name="shringarpure"&gt;{{cite news | last=Shringarpure | first=Bhakti | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/digital-saviour-saving-lives-internet-age-save-darfur | title=The rise of the digital saviour: can Facebook likes change the world? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=June 18, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Karen Attiah]] said the white savior framework in Africa "follows the venerable tradition" of the novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) by [[Joseph Conrad]] and that the tradition included the film ''[[Machine Gun Preacher]]'' (2011), the public relations campaign related to the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' (2012), and the writings of journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]].&lt;ref name="attiah"&gt;{{cite news | last=Attiah | first=Karen | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/06/louise-linton-just-wrote-the-perfect-white-savior-in-africa-story/ | title=Louise Linton just wrote the perfect White-Savior-in-Africa story | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor and producer [[Louise Linton]] wrote a memoir about her [[gap year]] in [[Zambia]], ''In Congo's Shadow'', and wrote an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', "How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare", to promote the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Linton | first=Louise | authorlink=Louise Linton | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-my-dream-gap-year-in-africa-turned-into-a-nightmare/ | title=How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701064204/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-my-dream-gap-year-in-africa-turned-into-a-nightmare/ | archivedate=July 1, 2016 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=July 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Schaub of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "The reaction to Linton's article was swift and negative, accusing her of using clichés and misrepresentations... Several people have described Linton's memoir as a 'white savior' fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Schaub | first=Michael | url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-louise-linton-memoir-20160706-snap-htmlstory.html |title=Controversial Africa memoir draws fire for Louise Linton, actress, self-published author and Trump dining companion | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zambians and other Africans negatively criticized the article on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shearlaw | first=Maeve | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/05/zambians-hit-back-at-white-saviour-gap-yah-memoir | title=Briton's African gap year memoir sparks angry Twitter response | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=July 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attiah said the popular [[Instagram]] account "BarbieSavior" was inspired by the backlash to Linton's words.&lt;ref name="attiah" /&gt; [[Special Broadcasting Service]]'s Amal Awad said the Instagram account was parodied "a reckless trend" of [[voluntourism]] (volunteering and touring) in which "'white saviours' use the less fortunate like props in their social media profiles". Awad said the interest in volunteering encouraged a business model that leverages a country's existing social issues and charges tourists for volunteering to be a "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Awad | first=Amal | url=http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2016/04/28/when-saviour-becomes-story | title=When the saviour becomes the story | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] | date=April 28, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baaz, Gondola, Marijnen, and Verweijen, writing in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', were critical of the "white savior complex" in the 2014 documentary ''[[Virunga (film)|Virunga]]'', which features the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Virunga National Park]] and the conservation work of its [[park ranger]]s. They said, "The movie features endless footage of a park guard hugging and playing with the gorillas, evoking the notion of the 'noble savage' who is close to nature, honest and naive, and dependent on the white man for his salvation. Rarely do we see the Congolese exercising political agency, even though there are numerous civil society activists in the region, often working at great personal risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baaz | first1=Maria Eriksson | last2=Gondola | first2=Didier | last3=Marijnen | first3=Esther | last4=Verweijen | first4=Judith | url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2015-03-05/virungas-white-savior-complex | title=Virunga's White Savior Complex | work=[[Foreign Affairs]] | date=March 5, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in film==
{{main|White savior narrative in film}}
In film, the white savior is a [[trope (cinema)|cinematic trope]] in which a [[white people|white]] character rescues [[person of color|people of color]] from their plight. The white savior is portrayed as messianic and often learns something about themselves in the process of rescuing.&lt;ref name="temple1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2263_reg.html | title=Matthew W. Hughey: The White Savior Film | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trope reflects how media represents [[sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] by racializing concepts like morality as identifiable with white people over nonwhite people.&lt;ref name="temple2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/authors/2263_qa.html | title=Interview with Matthew W. Hughey | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White saviors are often male and are sometimes out of place in their own society until they lead minorities or foreigners. ''Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness'' labels the stories as fantasies that "are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic". Types of stories include white travels to "exotic" Asian locations, white defense against racism in the [[Southern United States|American South]], or white protagonists having "racially diverse" helpers.&lt;ref name="vera"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Vera | first1=Hernán | last2=Gordon | first2=Andrew M. | year=2003 | chapter=The Beautiful White American: Sincere Fictions of the Savior | title=Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | isbn=978-1-4616-4286-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in television==

Stephanie Greco Larson, writing in ''Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment'', said ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1978–1986) and ''[[Webster (TV series)|Webster]]'' (1983–1987) were "shows in which white families adopt black children" and represented versions of "the white man's burden theme on television".&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite book | last=Larson | first=Stephanie Greco | year=2006 | chapter=African Americans in Film and Television Entertainment | title=Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment | series=Spectrum Series: Race and Ethnicity in National and Global Politics | publisher=Rowmn &amp; Littlefield | isbn=978-0-8476-9453-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin R. Means Coleman said, "In these comedies, Black children are rescued from their dysfunctional families or communities by Whites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=Robin R. Means | year=2003 | chapter=Black Sitcom Portrayals | editor1-last=Dines | editor1-first=Gail | editor2-last=Humez | editor2-first=Jean M. | title=Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader | edition=2nd | publisher=SAGE | isbn=978-0-7619-2261-2 | page=83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ''Diff'rent Strokes'' featured the white millionaire character Philip Drummond. Film historian [[Donald Bogle]] said, "The millionaire Drummond becomes a ''great white father figure'', able to provide the material comforts (as well as the subliminal emotional ones) and the cultural milieu that the Black community supposedly could never hope to match." Dustin Tahmahkera writes that Coleman labeled Drummond a "white savior" type who uses "his representational power to save the day by determining a conflict resolution that appeases all parties" including the indigenous representative Longwalker in the episode "Burial Ground". Tahmahkera also said a 1985 episode of ''[[Punky Brewster]]'' featured the girl protagonist telling a ghost story about her alter-ego Princess Moon helping "ancient Indians [who] suddenly appear... as cave dwellers who need a white savior... to defeat an evil spirit and help keep their ''Last of the Dogmen''-like secret existence intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tahmahkera | first=Dustin | year=2014 | chapter=Settler Self-Determination | title=Tribal Television: Viewing Native People in Sitcoms | publisher=UNC Press Books | isbn=978-1-4696-1869-2 | pages=96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson said, "Inner-city schools have been the site of white man's burden dramas on television for decades" with TV series featuring white savior teachers. Larson identified the following series with such teachers: ''[[Room 222]]'' (1969–1974), ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'' (1975–1979), ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'' (1978–1981), and ''[[Boston Public]]'' (2000–2004). Larson said while ''Room 222'' and ''Boston Public'' also had black teachers that "challenge the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior... these shows continue to avoid laying blame on social institutions for the status of blacks by showing the success of the individual black teachers."&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;

The TV series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' (2017–) features [[Finn Jones]] as the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Both the originating comic book character and the TV series actor are white. Prior to the series airing ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the casting had received criticism for not changing the character to be Asian-American. The newspaper quoted arguments put forward by Keith Chow, editor-in-chief of ''The Nerds of Color'' pop culture blog, "If you’re going to have all these trappings of Orientalism on top of a white savior trope, why not upend both of those things by casting an Asian-American to play the role?" Jones denied that Iron Fist would be a white savior figure and said that the series would address critics' concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Victor | first=Daniel | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/television/iron-fist-actor-at-center-of-whitewashing-debate-asks-fans-to-wait-and-see.html | title='Iron Fist' Actor, at Center of Whitewashing Debate, Asks Fans to Wait and See | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 8, 2017 | accessdate=March 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="White Savior Industrial Complex"==
[[File:Teju Cole.jpg|right|thumbnail|Writer Teju Cole, who coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex"]]
Writer [[Teju Cole]] coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex" following the release of the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' in March 2012, extrapolating the term in a seven-part response on [[Twitter]]. He later wrote an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' about the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cole | first=Teju | authorlink=Teju Cole | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/the-white-savior-industrial-complex/254843/ | title=The White-Savior Industrial Complex | journal=[[The Atlantic]] | date=March 21, 2012 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote frame|
# From Sachs to Kristof to Invisible Children to TED, the fastest growth industry in the US is the White Savior Industrial Complex.
# The white savior supports brutal policies in the morning, founds charities in the afternoon, and receives awards in the evening.
# The banality of evil transmutes into the banality of sentimentality. The world is nothing but a problem to be solved by enthusiasm.
# This world exists simply to satisfy the needs--including, importantly, the sentimental needs--of white people and Oprah.
# The White Savior Industrial Complex is not about justice. It is about having a big emotional experience that validates privilege.
# Feverish worry over that awful African warlord. But close to 1.5 million Iraqis died from an American war of choice. Worry about that.
# I deeply respect American sentimentality, the way one respects a wounded hippo. You must keep an eye on it, for you know it is deadly.

Cole's response became a [[viral phenomenon]], and ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Bhakti Shringarpure reflected on the supportive Internet response to the ''Kony 2012'' political campaign, "With the prevalence of campaigns, apps and games calling on us to help without really putting ourselves out, it seems that the white saviour idea is still alive and well – but now, the mode is digital."&lt;ref name="shringarpure" /&gt; Heather Laine Talley, writing in ''Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance'', said of the response to Cole coining the term, "The very idea of the white savior industrial complex was met with both celebration and rage. Cole was alternately described as a truth teller and as a racist." Talley summarized Cole's response to his critics, "Ultimately, Cole implores Western (white) do-gooders to rethink doing good in two ways. First, own up to the motives that drive philanthropic interventions, so that personal catharsis does not subsume the real need of others. Second, consider the structural underpinnings and historical legacies that together sustain the very infrastructure of the problems that captivate our activist hearts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Talley | first=Heather Laine | year=2014 | title=Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance | publisher=NYU Press | isbn=978-0-8147-8411-2 | pages=128–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Engles, writing in ''Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education'', concurred with Cole's assessment, "The lack of real-world efficacy of their efforts, and the apparent unwillingness of most to go any further than such limited and self-aggrandizing steps, suggests that mere validation of white racial privilege was indeed the most significant outcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Engles | first=Tim | year=2016 | chapter=Racialized Slacktivism | editor1-last=Kennedy | editor1-first=Tammie M. | editor2-last=Middleton | editor2-first=Irene Joyce | editor3-last=Ratcliffe | editor3-first=Krista | title=Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education | publisher=SIU Press | isbn=978-0-8093-3546-6 | page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan and her medical treatment in the West has been described as an example of the "white savior complex". The arguments behind this were the Western media and politicians quick reaction to the incident, portraying it as their rescue of a woman from her own savage culture and people. This also allegedly was the West's justification for invading and bombing the region to save savage people from their own kind, while killing more innocent people like Malala than the Taliban has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/assed-baig/malala-yousafzai-white-saviour_b_3592165.html|title=Malala Yousafzai and the White Saviour Complex|date=15 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bennorton.com/malala-yousafzai-spivak-abu-lughod-and-the-white-savior-complex/|title=Malala Yousafzai, Spivak, Abu-Lughod, &amp; the White Savior Complex|date=12 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
