{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''Augustinian theodicy''', named for the 4th- and 5th-century theologian, philosopher and (according to some [[Christian denominations]]) [[Saint#Christianity|Saint]] [[Augustine of Hippo]], is a type of [[Christian theology|Christian]] [[theodicy]] designed in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]]. As such, it attempts to explain the probability of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] (all-powerful) and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] (all-good) [[God in Christianity|God]] amid evidence of evil in the world. A number of variations of this kind of theodicy have been proposed throughout history; their similarities were first described by the 20th-century philosopher [[John Hick]], who classified them as "Augustinian". They typically assert that God is perfectly (ideally) [[good and evil|good]]; that he created the world [[Ex nihilo|out of nothing]]; and that evil is the result of humanity's [[original sin]]. The entry of evil into the world is generally explained as punishment for [[sin]] and its continued presence due to humans' misuse of [[free will]]. God's goodness and benevolence, according to the Augustinian theodicy, remain perfect and without responsibility for evil or suffering.

Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop the theodicy. He rejected the idea that evil exists in itself, instead regarding it as a corruption of goodness, caused by humanity's abuse of free will. Augustine believed in the existence of a physical [[Hell]] as a punishment for sin, but argued that those who choose to accept the [[salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] of [[Jesus Christ]] will go to [[Heaven]]. In the 13th century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] &amp;ndash; influenced by Augustine &amp;ndash; proposed a similar theodicy based on the view that God is goodness and that there can be no evil in him. He believed that the existence of goodness allows evil to exist, through the fault of humans. Augustine also influenced [[John Calvin]], who supported Augustine's view that evil is the result of free will and argued that sin corrupts humans, requiring God's [[grace (Christianity) |grace]] to give moral guidance.

The theodicy was criticised by Augustine's contemporary Fortunatus, a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] who contended that God must still be somehow implicated in evil, and 18th-century theologian [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] criticised Augustine's concept of evil for not dealing with individual human suffering. Hick regards evil as necessary for the moral and spiritual development of humans, and [[process theology|process theologians]] have argued that God is not omnipotent and so cannot be responsible for any evil. The logic of Augustine's approach has been adapted by [[Alvin Plantinga]], among others. Plantinga's adapted Augustinian theodicy, the [[free will defence]] &amp;ndash; which he proposed in the 1980s &amp;ndash; attempts to answer only the [[logical problem of evil]]. Such a defence (not a "theodicy" proper) does not demonstrate the existence of God, or the probable existence of God, but attempts to prove that the existence of God and the presence of evil (or ''[[privatio boni]]'') in the world are not logically contradictory.

==General forms==
The Augustinian theodicy was first distinguished as a form of [[theodicy]] by [[John Hick]] in ''Evil and the God of Love'', written in 1966, in which he classified Augustine's theodicy and its subsequent developments as "Augustinian". Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which attempts to clear God of all responsibility for evil, based on human free will, and the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which casts [[God]] as responsible for evil but justified because of its benefits for human development.&lt;ref name=Hall2003&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustinian theodicy is a response to the [[Problem of evil#Evidential problem of evil|evidential problem of evil]],&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; which raises the concern that if God is [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]], there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence&amp;nbsp;– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#DirIndVerEviArgEvi | title=The Problem of Evil |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=16 September 2002 |date=21 August 2009 | accessdate=8 February 2012 | author=Tooley, Michael|authorlink=Michael Tooley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010 /&gt; The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=Bennett2008&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the [[privation]] of good&amp;nbsp;– the corruption of God's good creation.&lt;ref name="Menn"&gt;Menn 2002, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustinian theodicy supports the notion of [[original sin]]. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the [[Genesis creation narrative]], including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil is believed to be a just punishment for the [[fall of man]]: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Corey 2000, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for [[moral evil]]: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil.&lt;ref name="Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010"/&gt; The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Green 2011, p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.&lt;ref name=Geivett&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Augustine===
[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 AD) was a philosopher and theologian born in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] (present-day [[Algeria]]). He followed the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]] during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' and ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', develop key ideas regarding his response to suffering. In ''Confessions'', Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by [[materialism]] and that reading [[Plato]]'s works enabled him to consider the existence of a non-physical [[substance theory|substance]]. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=24 March 2000 |date=12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the writings of [[Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;Korsmeyer 1995, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In ''City of God'', Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace human history and describe its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#HisEsc | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=24 March 2000 |date=12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine proposed that evil could not exist within God, nor be created by God, and is instead a by-product of God's creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the notion that evil exists in itself, proposing instead that it is a privation of (or falling away from) good, and a corruption of nature.&lt;ref name="Menn" /&gt; He wrote that "evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The City of God'', Augustine of Hippo, Book XI, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; Both moral and [[natural evil]] occurs, Augustine argued, owing to an evil use of free will,&lt;ref name=Bennett2008 /&gt; which could be traced back to [[Adam and Eve|Adam and Eve's]] original sin.&lt;ref name=Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this evil will, present in the [[soul|human soul]], was a corruption of the will given to humans by God, making suffering a just punishment for the sin of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Because Augustine believed that all of humanity was "[[Preformationism|seminally present in the loins of Adam]]", he argued that all of humanity inherited Adam's sin and his just punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of his belief that free will can be turned to evil, Augustine maintained that it is vital for humans to have free will, because they could not live well without it. He argued that evil could come from humans because, although humans contained no evil, they were also not perfectly good and hence could be corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine believed that a physical [[Hell]] exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini 1999, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, he believed that Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin.&lt;ref name=Cavadini1999p423&gt;Cavadini 1999, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved if they choose to receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.&lt;ref name=Cavadini1999p423 /&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 052.jpg|thumb|[[Gentile da Fabriano]]'s portrait of Thomas Aquinas, who developed a theodicy heavily influenced by Augustine]]
Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century [[scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher and theologian heavily influenced by Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#ThoAri | title=Saint Thomas Aquinas | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=12 July 1999 | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God,&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;Little 2005, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; through his [[Quinque viae|Five Ways]], and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, and that there is no evil in God.&lt;ref name=Geivett /&gt;

Aquinas supported Augustine's view that evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have been better off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin.&lt;ref name=Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010 /&gt; Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the [[moral agency|agent]]. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect.&lt;ref&gt;Little 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the [[Book of Job]], argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with [[heaven]] and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Howard-Snyder 1996, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmeyer 1995, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Wawrykow 2005, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calvin===

[[John Calvin]], a sixteenth-century French theologian and principal figure in the development of [[Calvinism]], was influenced by Augustine's works.&lt;ref name="Cavadini"&gt;Cavadini 1999, pp. 116–118&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be [[indictment|indicted]] for it.&lt;ref&gt;Case-Winters 1990, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin is the result of the fall of man, and argued that the human [[mind]], [[Will (philosophy)|will]], and [[Emotion|affections]] are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature.&lt;ref&gt;McKim 2004, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin proposed that humanity is [[predestined]], divided into the elect and the [[Reprobation|reprobate]]: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Thomas 1963, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Hortus Deliciarum - Hell.jpg|thumb|John Hick criticised the Augustinian concept of Hell, vividly depicted in this twelfth-century painting by Herrad von Landsberg.]]

===Fortunatus===
Augustine's ''Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean'', which partly touches on the problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself considered four years earlier, in ''Free Will''). Quoting the [[New Testament]], Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of [[Habit (psychology)|habits]].&lt;ref&gt;''Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean'', Augustine of Hippo, Ch. XXII&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
Scholars of religion Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng argued that the teachings of [[Buddhism]] challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in which good and evil have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This is similar to the Manicheist account of good and evil&amp;nbsp;– that the two are equal and in conflict&amp;nbsp;– though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;Ingram &amp; Streng 1986, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents in the form of the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent's]] temptation.&lt;ref name="Ingram" /&gt;

===Francesco Antonio Zaccaria===
The Italian theologian [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] criticised Augustine's concept of evil in the eighteenth century. He noted a distinction between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.&lt;ref&gt;Zaccaria 2009, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Hick===
John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he developed his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported the views of the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the [[Irenaean theodicy]] seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal hell would render "a Christian theodicy impossible".&lt;ref&gt;Hick 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.&lt;ref name=B&amp;N2005&gt;Barber &amp; Neville 2005, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process theology===
In ''God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy'', published in 1976, [[David Ray Griffin]] criticised Augustine's reliance on free will and argued that it is incompatible with divine [[omniscience]] and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin 1976, pp. 60–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Process theology]] argues that God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, he has the power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels the pain of the world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 13–24&lt;/ref&gt; Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ''ex nihilo'' (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb &amp; Griffin 1976, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alvin Plantinga===
[[File:AlvinPlantinga.JPG|thumb|[[Alvin Plantinga]], who presented a version of the free will defence as an alternative response to the problem of evil]]
In the 1980s, [[Alvin Plantinga]] presented a version of the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, Plantinga believed that a "possible state of affairs" must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a third proposition&amp;nbsp;– that evil is the result of the actions of free, rational, fallible human beings&amp;nbsp;– allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent.&lt;ref name=McGrath1995&gt;McGrath 1995, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent&amp;nbsp;– for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable.{{efn|Steve Duncan used the example of a rational man who is offered $5 for a Rembrandt. Assuming that he understands the meaning of the transaction and has no other reason to accept the offer, it can be predicted that he will reject the offer. Duncan holds that God could not create a world where the man freely accepts the offer (without changing the situation), illustrating Plantinga's point. {{refn|Duncan 2007, p. 105}} }} Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2007, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's version of the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his [[natural theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than attempt to show the existence of God as likely in the face of evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.&lt;ref name=McGrath1995 /&gt;

===Critique from an evolutionary scientific position===
Supposing that the evolutionary theory, the current consensus, is correct, John Hick criticised Augustine's theory for being "implausible" in light of Darwin's theory of [[evolution]], as it would make Augustine's idea of a fall from perfection inaccurate;&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; this is reiterated by professors [[Nancey Murphy]] and [[George Francis Rayner Ellis]], who also contend that Augustine's idea of transmitting original sin from Adam to the rest of humanity requires biological explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis &amp; Murphy 1996, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Comparative Religion [[Arvind Sharma]] has argued that natural evil cannot be the result of moral evil in the way Augustine suggested: scientific consensus is that natural disasters and disease existed before humans and hence cannot be the result of human sin.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma 2006, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; 

The twentieth-century philosopher [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] attempted to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy in the light of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without [[Creation myth|mythology]]. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil [[ontology|ontological]] existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the [[Pelagian view]] that human will could overcome sin on its own.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BASys''' (Bacterial Annotation System) is a freely available web server that can be used to perform automated, comprehensive annotation of bacterial [[genomes]].&lt;ref name=pmid15608206&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stothard P, Van Domselaar G, Shrivastava S, Guo A, O'Neill B, Cruz J, Ellison M, Wishart DS |title=BacMap: an interactive picture atlas of annotated bacterial genomes.|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|year=2005|volume=33|issue=Database issue|pages=D317-20|pmid=15608206|doi=10.1093/nar/gki075|pmc=540029}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of next generation DNA sequencing it is now possible to sequence the complete [[genome]] of a [[bacterium]] (typically ~4 million bases) within a single day.  This has led to an explosion in the number of fully sequenced [[microbe]]s. In fact, as of 2013, there were more than 2700 fully sequenced bacterial [[genomes]] deposited with [[GenBank]].  However, a continuing challenge with microbial genomics is finding the resources or tools for annotating the large number of newly sequenced [[genomes]]. BASys was developed in 2005 in anticipation of these needs. In fact, BASys was the world’s first publicly accessible microbial [[genome]] annotation web server.  Because of its widespread popularity, the BASys server was updated in 2011 through the addition of multiple server nodes to handle the large number of queries it was receiving.

The BASys server is designed to accept either assembled genome data (raw [[DNA sequence]] data) or complete [[proteome]] assignments as input.  If raw [[DNA sequence]] is provided, BASys employs [[GLIMMER|Glimmer]] (version 2.1.3) to identify the genes.&lt;ref name=pmid15980511/&gt; The output from BASys is a comprehensive genome-wide annotation (with ~60 annotation subfields for each gene) and a zoomable, hyperlinked [[genome map]] of the query genome. BASys uses nearly 30 different programs to determine and annotate gene/protein names, GO functions, COG functions, possible paralogues and orthologues, molecular weight, isoelectric point, [[operon]] structure, [[subcellular localization]], [[signal peptides]], [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane regions]], [[secondary structure]], 3D structure, reactions and pathways. The full list of programs used by BASys is given below:

In addition to its extensive annotation for each gene/protein in the query genome, BASys also generates colorful, clickable and fully zoomable circular maps of each input [[chromosome]].  These bacterial [[genome map]]s are generated used a program called CGView (Circular Genome Viewer) which was developed in 2004.&lt;ref name=pmid15479716&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stothard|first=P|author2=Wishart DS|title=Circular genome visualization and exploration using CGView.|journal=Bioinformatics|year=2005|volume=21|issue=4|pages=537–9|pmid=15479716|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bti054}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[genome map]]s are designed to allow rapid navigation and detailed visualization of all the BASys-generated gene annotations. A complete BASys run takes approximately 16 h for an average bacterial chromosome (approximately 4 Megabases). BASys annotations may be viewed and downloaded anonymously or through a password protected access system. BASys will store its bacterial genome annotations on the server for a maximum of 180 days. BASys handles approximately 1000 submissions a year. BASys is accessible at https://www.basys.ca/

==Scope and Access==
All data in BacMap is non-proprietary or is derived from a non-proprietary source. It is freely accessible and available to anyone. In addition, nearly every data item is fully traceable and explicitly referenced to the original source. BacMap data is available through a public web interface and downloads.

The '''Biblical Archaeology Society''' is a non-denominational organization that supports and promotes [[biblical archaeology]]. It publishes ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. Its past publications included ''[[Bible Review]]'' (1985–2005) and ''Archaeology Odyssey'' (1998–2006). The Biblical Archaeology Society also publishes books about biblical archaeology aimed at a general readership. The Society has, for more than 30 years, run seminars and tours offering an opportunity to learn directly from world-renowned archaeologists and scholars. It also produces videos (DVD) and CDs on archaeology and biblical archaeology.

The society was founded by [[Hershel Shanks]] in 1975 and he served as editor for 42 years, retiring at the end of 2017. Robert R. Cargill was selected to replace Shanks as editor of the Society and associated publications.

The Biblical Archaeology Society has been at the center of several controversies. 

In 1991, the Biblical Archaeology Society published ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', making the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] available to scholars around the world. Previously, access to the scrolls was limited to a small team of specialists who had been invited to translate them.

At a 2002 press conference co-hosted with the [[Discovery Channel]], the Biblical Archaeology Society announced the existence of the [[James Ossuary]]. Some critics have alleged that the ossuary, which may have once held the remains of [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], the brother of [[Jesus]], is a forgery. During the forgery trial, which lasted for several years, Shanks remained a staunch defender of the ossuary. On March 14, 2012, the defendants were acquitted of all charges of forgery because the ossuary's authenticity could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular biology]], '''biochips''' are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions. Biochips enable researchers to quickly screen large numbers of biological analytes for a variety of purposes, from disease diagnosis to detection of [[bioterrorism]] agents. '''Digital microfluidic biochips'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.ee.duke.edu/~krish/a16-su.pdf|title=High-Level Synthesis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips|publisher=Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; have become one of the most promising technologies in many biomedical fields. In a digital microfluidic biochip, a group of (adjacent) cells in the microfluidic array can be configured to work as storage, functional operations, as well as for transporting fluid droplets dynamically.

==History==
The development started with early work on the underlying [[sensor]] technology. One of the first portable, chemistry-based sensors was the [[glass electrode|glass pH electrode]], invented in 1922 by Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hughes, "The potential difference between glass and electrolytes in contact with water," ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 44, pp.&amp;nbsp;2860–2866, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;  In subsequent years. For example, a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor was produced by incorporating [[valinomycin]] into a thin membrane.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor in ''Handbook of Chemical and Biological Sensors'', J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor, eds., ch. Introduction to Chemical and Biological Sensors, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10, Institute of Physics Publishing, Philadelphia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] announced their discovery of the now familiar [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] molecules and set the stage for [[genetics]] research that continues to the present day.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;D. L. Nelson and M. M. Cox, ''Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry'', Worth Publishers, New York, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[sequencing]] techniques in 1977 by [[Walter Gilbert|Gilbert]]&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Maxam and W. Gilbert, "A new method for sequencing DNA," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 74, pp.&amp;nbsp;560–564, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Sanger|Sanger]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Sanger, S. Nicklen, and A. R. Coulson, "DNA sequencing with chainterminating inhibitors," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 74, pp.&amp;nbsp;5463–5467, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; (working separately) enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This research showed how [[hybridisation (molecular biology)|hybridization]] of complementary single [[oligonucleotide]] strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing. Two additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA-based. First, in 1983 [[Kary Mullis]] invented the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique,&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; a method for amplifying DNA concentrations. This discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples. Secondly in 1986 Hood and co-workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with [[fluorescent tag]]s instead of radiolabels,&lt;ref&gt;L. M. Smith, J. Z. Sanders, R. J. Kaiser, P. Hughes, C. Dodd, C. R. Connell, C. Heiner, S. B. H. Kent, and L. E. Hood, "Fluorescence detection in automated DNA sequence analysis," ''Nature'' 321, pp.&amp;nbsp;61–67, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically.

[[image:Biochip platform.jpg|frame|thumb right|300 px|Figure 1. Biochips are a platform that require, in addition to microarray technology, transduction and signal processing
technologies to output the results of sensing experiments.]]
Figure 1 shows the make up of a typical biochip platform. The actual sensing component (or "chip") is just one piece of a complete analysis system. [[Transducer|Transduction]] must be done to translate the actual sensing event (DNA binding, [[redox|oxidation/reduction]], ''etc.'') into a format understandable by a computer ([[voltage]], light intensity, mass, ''etc.''), which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final, [[human-readable]] output. The multiple technologies needed to make a successful biochip&amp;mdash;from sensing chemistry, to [[microarray]]ing, to signal processing&amp;mdash;require a true multidisciplinary approach, making the barrier to entry steep. One of the first commercial biochips was introduced by [[Affymetrix]]. Their "GeneChip" products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in genes such as [[p53]] (a tumor suppressor) and [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] (related to breast cancer).&lt;ref&gt;P. Fortina, D. Graves, C. Stoeckert, Jr., S. McKenzie, and S. Surrey in ''Biochip Technology'', J. Cheng and L. J. Kricka, eds., ch. Technology Options and Applications of DNA Microarrays, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–216, Harwood Academic Publishers, Philadelphia, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The chips are produced using [[microlithography]] techniques traditionally used to fabricate [[integrated circuit]]s (see below).

==Microarray fabrication==
[[File:Sarfus.DNABiochip.jpg|thumb|300px|3D [[Sarfus]] image of a DNA biochip]]
The microarray&amp;mdash;the dense, two-dimensional grid of biosensors&amp;mdash;is the critical component of a biochip platform. Typically, the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate, which may either be passive (''e.g.'' silicon or glass) or active, the latter
consisting of integrated electronics or [[microtechnology|micromechanical]] devices that perform or assist signal transduction. [[Surface chemistry]] is used to [[covalent bond|covalently bind]] the sensor molecules to the substrate medium. The fabrication of microarrays is non-trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may
ultimately decide the success of future biochip platforms. The primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position (typically on a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid) on the substrate. Various means exist to achieve the placement, but typically robotic micro-pipetting&lt;ref&gt;M. Schena, D. Shalon, R. W. Davis, and P. O. Brown, "Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray," ''Science'' 270, pp.&amp;nbsp;467–470, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; or micro-printing&lt;ref&gt;G. MacBeath, A. N. Koehler, and S. L. Schreiber, "Printing small molecules as microarrays and detecting protein-ligand interactions en masse," ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 121, pp.&amp;nbsp;7967–7968, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface. Because each sensor is unique, only a few spots can be placed at a time. The low-throughput nature of this
process results in high manufacturing costs.

Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process (later used by [[Affymetrix]]) in which a series of microlithography steps is used to [[Combinatorial chemistry|combinatorially synthesize]] hundreds of thousands of unique, single-stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one [[nucleotide]] at a time.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Fodor, J. L. Read, M. C. Pirrung, L. Stryer, A. T. Lu, and D. Solas, "Light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical analysis," ''Science'' 251, pp.&amp;nbsp;767–773, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Pease, D. Solas, E. J. Sullivan, M. T. Cronin, C. P. Holmes, and S. P. Fodor, "Light-generated oligonucleotide arrays for rapid DNA sequence analysis," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 91, pp.&amp;nbsp;5022–5026, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  One lithography step is needed per base type; thus, a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level. Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously, it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands (15&amp;ndash;25 nucleotides). Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done. Furthermore, light-directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules.

As noted above, most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors. This approach is used chiefly to map or "encode" the coordinate of each sensor to its function. Sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signalling technique (''e.g.'' fluorescence), thus making coordinates their only identifying feature. These arrays must be made using a serial process (''i.e.'' requiring multiple, sequential steps) to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position.

"Random" fabrication, in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip, is an alternative to the serial method. The tedious and expensive positioning process is
not required, enabling the use of parallelized self-assembly techniques. In this approach, large batches of identical sensors can be produced; sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array. A non-coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor. As the figure shows, such a design was first demonstrated (and later commercialized by Illumina) using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched [[fiber optic]] cable.&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Steemers, J. A. Ferguson, and D. R. Walt, "Screening unlabeled DNA targets with randomly-ordered fiber-optic gene arrays," ''Nature Biotechnology'' 18, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–94, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. L. Michael, L. C. Taylor, S. L. Schultz, and D. R. Walt, "Randomly ordered addressable high-density optical sensor arrays," ''Analytical Chemistry'' 70, pp.&amp;nbsp;1242–1248, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature. However, this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated.

==Protein biochip array and other microarray technologies==
[[Microarray]]s are not limited to [[DNA]] analysis; [[protein microarray]]s, [[antibody microarray]], [[chemical compound microarray]] can also be produced using biochips.  Randox Laboratories Ltd. launched Evidence, the first protein Biochip Array Technology analyzer in 2003.  In protein Biochip Array Technology, the biochip replaces the [[ELISA]] plate or [[cuvette]] as the reaction platform.  The biochip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample, producing a [[patient]] profile.  The patient profile can be used in disease screening, [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment.  Performing multiple analyses simultaneously, described as multiplexing, allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required.  Biochip Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology, using sandwich, competitive and antibody-capture [[immunoassay]]s. The difference from conventional immunoassays is that, the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the biochip in an ordered array rather than in solution.

In sandwich assays an enzyme-labelled antibody is used; in competitive assays an enzyme-labelled antigen is used.  On antibody-antigen binding a [[chemiluminescence]] reaction produces light.  Detection is by a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera.  The CCD camera is a sensitive and high-resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light.  The test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescence signals are analysed by imaging software to rapidly and simultaneously quantify the individual analytes.

Biochips are also used in the field of [[microphysiometry]] e.g. in skin-on-a-chip&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, F., Eggert, S., Wiest, J.: Skin-on-a-chip: Transepithelial electrical resistance and extracellular acidification measurements through an automated air-liquid interface, Genes, 2018, 9/2, 114; doi:10.3390/genes9020114&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">{{about|the linguistic term||Bongo Bongo Land}}
'''Bongo-Bongo''' in [[linguistics]] is used as a name for an [[imaginary language]]. It is most commonly invoked in [[Etymology|etymological studies]] to conceptualize random similarities between unrelated languages.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a name for a [[constructed language]] invented by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] as a teaching tool in linguistics.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;Murray, N. ''Writing Essays in English Language and Linguistics: Principles, Tips and Strategies for Undergraduates'' [[Cambridge University Press]] (2012) {{ISBN|978-0521128469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymological studies==
Random similarities occur between related and unrelated languages and these are commonly disregarded in the academic study of etymology. The widespread habit of unscientific researches to look for such coincidental similarities and proclaim them as proof of genetic relationship has given rise to the term ''Bongo-Bongo approach'' or ''Bongo-Bongo effect''.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; For example, when comparing random [[Underlying representation|surface forms]] in [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (which are known to be unrelated languages), "pairings" such as ''hegi'' (Basque for "ridge") and ''hegy'' (Hungarian for "hill") are easily found but ultimately meaningless in terms of etymology without additional historical linguistic research and data.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==Anthropology==
The concept can also be found occasionally in [[anthropology]] where the ''Bongo-Bongo'' are sarcastically used as an imaginary tribe or ethnicity (or by extension, [[Bongo Bongo Land]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kippenberg, HG (ed) ''Concepts of Person in Religion and Thought (Religion and Reason, No 37)'' [[Walter de Gruyter|de Gruyter]] (1990) {{ISBN|978-3110121599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cosmology}} 
'''Brane cosmology''' refers to several theories in [[particle physics]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] related to [[string theory]], [[superstring theory]] and [[M-theory]].

==Brane and bulk==
{{Main article|Brane}}
The central idea is that the visible, [[three-dimensional]] [[universe]] is restricted to a [[brane]] inside a [[Kaluza–Klein|higher-dimensional]] space, called the "bulk" (also known as "hyperspace"). If the additional [[dimension]]s are [[compact dimension|compact]], then the observed universe contains the extra dimension, and then no reference to the bulk is appropriate. In the bulk model, at least some of the extra dimensions are extensive (possibly infinite), and other branes may be moving through this bulk. Interactions with the bulk, and possibly with other branes, can influence our brane and thus introduce effects not seen in more standard cosmological models.

==Why gravity is weak and the cosmological constant is small==
Some versions of brane cosmology, based on the [[large extra dimension]] idea, can explain the weakness of [[gravity]] relative to the other [[fundamental forces]] of nature, thus solving the [[hierarchy problem]]. In the brane picture, the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear force]] are localized on the brane, but gravity has no such constraint and propagates on the full spacetime, called bulk. Much of the gravitational attractive power "leaks" into the bulk. As a consequence, the force of gravity should appear significantly stronger on small (subatomic or at least sub-millimetre) scales, where less gravitational force has "leaked". Various experiments are currently under way to test this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flux.aps.org/meetings/YR04/APR04/baps/abs/S690.html Session D9 - Experimental Tests of Short Range Gravitation.]&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions of the large extra dimension idea with [[supersymmetry]] in the bulk appears to be promising in addressing the so-called [[cosmological constant problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Y.

==Models of brane cosmology==
One of the earliest documented attempts to apply brane cosmology as part of a conceptual theory is dated to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Rubakov and M. E. Shaposhnikov,''Do we live inside a domain wall?'', [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370269383912534 Physics Letters B 125 (1983) 136–138].&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors discussed the possibility that the Universe has &lt;math&gt;(3+N)+1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, but ordinary particles are confined in a potential well which is narrow along &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; spatial directions and flat along three others, and proposed a particular five-dimensional model.

In 1998/99 [[Merab Gogberashvili]] published on [[Arxiv|arXiv]] a number of articles where he showed that if the Universe is considered as a thin shell (a mathematical [[synonym]] for "brane") expanding in 5-dimensional space then there is a possibility to obtain one scale for particle theory corresponding to the 5-dimensional [[cosmological constant]] and Universe thickness, and thus to solve the [[hierarchy problem]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Gogberashvili, ''Hierarchy problem in the shell universe model'', [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9812296 Arxiv:hep-ph/9812296].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Gogberashvili, ''Our world as an expanding shell'', [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9812365 Arxiv:hep-ph/9812365].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Gogberashvili, ''Four dimensionality in noncompact Kaluza–Klein model'', [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9904383 Arxiv:hep-ph/9904383].&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that the four-dimensionality of the Universe is the result of the [[Stability theory|stability]] requirement found in mathematics since the extra component of the [[Einstein field equations]] giving the confined solution for [[matter]] fields coincides with one of the conditions of stability.

In 1999 there were proposed the closely related [[Randall–Sundrum model|Randall–Sundrum]] scenarios, RS1 and RS2. (See ''[[Randall–Sundrum model]]'' for a nontechnical explanation of RS1). These particular models of brane cosmology have attracted a considerable amount of attention.

Later, the [[pre-big bang]], [[ekpyrotic]] and [[Cyclic Model|cyclic]] proposals appeared. The ekpyrotic theory hypothesizes that the origin of the [[observable universe]] occurred when two parallel branes collided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Musser|first=George|author2=Minkel, JR|title=A Recycled Universe: Crashing branes and cosmic acceleration may power an infinite cycle in which our universe is but a phase|publisher=Scientific American Inc.|date=2002-02-11|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-recycled-universe|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical tests==
{{see also|Large extra dimension#Empirical tests}}

As of now, no experimental or observational evidence of [[large extra dimension]]s, as required by the Randall–Sundrum models, has been reported. An analysis of results from the [[Large Hadron Collider]] in December 2010 severely constrains the black holes produced in theories with large extra dimensions.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;CMS Collaboration, "Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider", https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375&lt;/ref&gt;. The recent multi-messenger gravitational wave event GW170817 has also been used to put weak limits on large extra dimensions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Luca Visinelli |author2=Nadia Bolis |author3=Sunny Vagnozzi |title=Brane-world extra dimensions in light of GW170817 |journal=Phys.

'''Chloracne''' is an [[Acne vulgaris|acne]]-like eruption of [[blackhead]]s, [[cyst]]s, and [[pustule]]s associated with over-exposure to certain [[halogen]]ated [[aromatic compound]]s, such as chlorinated [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] and [[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans|dibenzofurans]]. The [[lesion]]s are most frequently found on the cheeks, behind the ears, in the armpits and groin region.

The condition was first described in German industrial workers in 1897 by Siegfried Bettmann,&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Bettmann (1869–1939), University of Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially believed to be caused by exposure to [[chlorine]] (hence the name "chloracne"). It was only in the mid-1950s that chloracne was associated with aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Williams DE, Wolfe WH, Lustik MB |year=1995 |title=An Epidemiologic Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following Exposure to Herbicides |volume=4 |page=427 |publisher= |id=A313403 |url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/31/3134/A313403.html |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substances that may cause chloracne are now collectively known as '''chloracnegens'''.

Chloracne is particularly linked to toxic exposure to [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]s ([[byproduct]]s of many [[chemical process]]es, including the manufacture of [[herbicides]] such as [[Agent Orange]])&amp;mdash;so much so that it is considered a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity and onset of chloracne may follow a typical [[asymptotic]] [[dose-response relationship]] [[curve]].

==Cause==
Chloracne normally results from direct skin contact with chloracnegens, although ingestion and [[inhalation]] are also possible causative routes.

Chloracnegens are [[fat-soluble]], meaning they persist in the body fat for a very long period following exposure. Chloracne is a chronic [[inflammation|inflammatory]] condition that results from this persistence, in combination with the toxin's chemical properties. It is believed, at least from [[rodent]] models, that the [[toxin]] activates a series of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] promoting [[macrophage]] proliferation, inducing [[neutrophilia]] and leading to a generalised inflammatory response in the skin. This process may also be augmented by induction of excess [[Tumor necrosis factors|tumor necrosis factor]] in the [[blood]] [[blood plasma|serum]].

The inflammatory processes lead to the formation of [[keratin]]ous plugs in skin pores, forming yellowish [[cyst]]s and dark [[pustule]]s. The associated [[pus]] is usually a color of green approximating that of a tennis ball. The skin lesions occur mainly in the face, but in more severe cases they involve the shoulders and chest, the back, and the abdomen. In advanced cases, the lesions appear also on the arms, neck, thighs, legs, hands and feet.

In some instances, chloracne may not appear for three to four weeks after toxic exposure; however, in other cases&amp;mdash;particularly in events of massive exposure&amp;mdash;the symptoms may appear within days.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Marchia B, Ravetzb JR |title=Risk management and governance: a post-normal science approach |journal=Futures |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=743–57 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0016-3287(99)00030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Once chloracne has been identified, the primary action is to remove the patient and all other individuals from the source of contamination. Further treatment is [[symptomatic]].

Secondary infections on severe or persistent lesions may need to be treated with oral [[antibiotics]] or [[isotretinoin]]. However, chloracne itself can be highly resistant to any treatment.

The course of the disease is highly variable. In some cases the lesions may disappear within two years or so; however, in other cases the lesions may be effectively permanent (mean duration of lesions in one 1984 study was 26 years, with some workers remaining disfigured over three decades after exposure).&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moses M, Lilis R, Crow KD |title=Health status of workers with past exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the manufacture of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid: comparison of findings with and without chloracne |journal=Am.

==Related conditions==
Chloracne is very often seen in combination with [[hyperhidrosis]] (clammy, sweaty skin) and [[porphyria cutanea tarda]] (a skin condition of increased pigmentation, hair coarsening and blistering).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19392">'''Computational neurogenetic modeling (CNGM)''' is concerned with the study and development of dynamic [[neuronal modeling|neuronal models]] for modeling brain functions with respect to [[gene]]s and dynamic interactions between genes. These include [[neural network models]] and their integration with gene network models. This area brings together knowledge from various scientific disciplines, such as [[computer science|computer]] and [[information science]], [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive science]], [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], as well as [[engineering]].

== Levels of processing ==

=== Molecular kinetics ===
Models of the [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of proteins and [[ion channels]] associated with [[neuron]] activity represent the lowest level of modeling in a computational neurogenetic model. The altered activity of proteins in some diseases, such as the [[amyloid beta]] protein in [[Alzheimer's disease]], must be modeled at the molecular level to accurately predict the effect on cognition.&lt;ref name = pCNGM_AD &gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kasabov | last2 = Schliebs | last3 = Kojima | first1 = Nikola K. | first2 = Reinhard | first3 = Hiroshi | title = Probabilistic Computational Neurogenetic Modeling: From Cognitive Systems to Alzheimer's Disease | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | date = 2011 | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 300–311 | doi = 10.1109/tamd.2011.2159839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion channels, which are vital to the propagation of [[action potentials]], are another molecule that may be modeled to more accurately reflect biological processes. For instance, to accurately model [[synaptic plasticity]] (the strengthening or weakening of [[synapse]]s) and memory, it is necessary to model the activity of the [[NMDA receptor]] (NMDAR). The speed at which the NMDA receptor lets Calcium ions into the cell in response to [[Glutamate]] is an important determinant of [[Long-term potentiation]] via the insertion of [[AMPA receptor]]s (AMPAR) into the [[plasma membrane]] at the synapse of the postsynaptic cell (the cell that receives the neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell).&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

=== Genetic regulatory network ===
[[Image:WagnerModel.png|thumb|right|An example of a [[Wagner's gene network model|model]] of a gene network. The genes, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''G''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are modified by either inhibitory signals, represented by bars and negative coefficients, or excitatory signals, represented by arrows and positive coefficients. The interactions are represented numerically by the matrix on the right, '''R'''.]]
In most models of neural systems neurons are the most basic unit modeled.&lt;ref name = book /&gt; In computational neurogenetic modeling, to better simulate processes that are responsible for synaptic activity and connectivity, the genes responsible are modeled for each [[neuron]].

A [[gene regulatory network]], protein regulatory network, or gene/protein regulatory network, is the level of processing in a computational neurogenetic model that models the interactions of [[gene]]s and proteins relevant to synaptic activity and general cell functions. Genes and proteins are modeled as individual [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]], and the interactions that influence a gene are modeled as excitatory (increases gene/protein expression) or inhibitory (decreases gene/protein expression) inputs that are weighted to reflect the effect a gene or protein is having on another gene or protein. Gene regulatory networks are typically designed using data from [[DNA microarrays|microarrays]].&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

Modeling of genes and proteins allows individual responses of neurons in an artificial neural network that mimic responses in biological nervous systems, such as division (adding new neurons to the artificial neural network), creation of proteins to expand their cell membrane and foster [[neurite]] outgrowth (and thus stronger connections with other neurons), up-regulate or down-regulate receptors at synapses (increasing or decreasing the weight (strength) of synaptic inputs), uptake more [[neurotransmitters]], change into different types of neurons, or die due to [[necrosis]] or [[apoptosis]]. The creation and analysis of these networks can be divided into two sub-areas of research: the 
gene up-regulation that is involved in the normal functions of a neuron, such as growth, metabolism, and synapsing; and the effects of mutated genes on neurons and cognitive functions.&lt;ref name = gene&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benuskova | first1 = L. | last2 = Kasabov | first2 = N. | year = 2008 | title = Modeling brain dynamics using computational neurogenetic approach | url = | journal = Cognitive Neurodynamics | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 319–334 | doi = 10.1007/s11571-008-9061-1 | pmc = 2585617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial neural network ===
[[Image:artificial neuron.png|thumb|right|A [[Artificial neuron|model]] of an individual neuron. The inputs, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, are modified by the input weights, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, and then combined into one input, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. The transfer function, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then uses this input to determine the output, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
An [[artificial neural network]] generally refers to any computational model that mimics the [[central nervous system]], with capabilities such as learning and pattern recognition. With regards to computational neurogenetic modeling, however, it is often used to refer to those specifically designed for biological accuracy rather than computational efficiency. Individual neurons are the basic unit of an artificial neural network, with each neuron acting as a node. Each node receives weighted signals from other nodes that are either [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] or [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]]. To determine the output, a [[transfer function]] (or [[activation function]]) evaluates the sum of the weighted signals and, in some artificial neural networks, their input rate. Signal weights are strengthened ([[long-term potentiation]]) or weakened ([[long-term depression]]) depending on how synchronous the presynaptic and postsynaptic activation rates are ([[Hebbian theory]]).&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

The synaptic activity of individual neurons is modeled using equations to determine the temporal (and in some 
cases, spatial) summation of synaptic signals, [[membrane potential]], threshold for action potential 
generation, the absolute and relative [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], and optionally ion receptor channel [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] and [[Gaussian noise]] (to increase biological accuracy by incorporation of random elements). In addition to connectivity, some types of artificial neural networks, such as [[spiking neural network]]s, also model the distance between neurons, and its effect on the synaptic weight (the strength of a synaptic transmission).&lt;ref name=CN_sum /&gt;

=== Combining gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks ===
For the parameters in the gene regulatory network to affect the neurons in the artificial neural network as intended there must be some connection between them. In an organizational context, each node (neuron) in the artificial neural network has its own gene regulatory network associated with it. The weights (and in some networks, frequencies of synaptic transmission to the node), and the resulting membrane potential of the node (including whether an [[action potential]] is produced or not), affect the expression of different genes in the gene regulatory network. Factors affecting connections between neurons, such as [[synaptic plasticity]], can be modeled by inputting the values of synaptic activity-associated genes and proteins to a function that re-evaluates the weight of an input from a particular neuron in the artificial neural network.

=== Incorporation of other cell types ===
Other cell types besides neurons can be modeled as well. [[Glial cells]], such as [[astroglia]] and [[microglia]], as well as [[endothelial cells]], could be included in an artificial neural network. This would enable modeling of diseases where pathological effects may occur from sources other than neurons, such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name = pCNGM_AD /&gt;

== Factors affecting choice of artificial neural network ==
While the term artificial neural network is usually used in computational neurogenetic modeling to refer to models of the central nervous system meant to possess biological accuracy, the general use of the term can be applied to many gene regulatory networks as well.

=== Time variance ===
Artificial neural networks, depending on type, may or may not take into account the timing of inputs. Those that do, such as [[spiking neural network]]s, fire only when the pooled inputs reach a membrane potential is reached. Because this mimics the firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks are viewed as a more biologically accurate model of synaptic activity.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

=== Growth and shrinkage ===
To accurately model the central nervous system, creation and death of neurons should be modeled as well.&lt;ref name = book /&gt; To accomplish this, constructive artificial neural networks that are able to grow or shrink to adapt to inputs are often used. [[Evolving classification function|Evolving connectionist systems]] are a subtype of constructive artificial neural networks ([[Evolving classification function|evolving]] in this case referring to changing the structure of its neural network rather than [[Evolutionary computation|by mutation and natural selection]]).&lt;ref name = ECoS /&gt;

=== Randomness ===
Both synaptic transmission and gene-protein interactions are [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] in nature. To model biological nervous systems with greater fidelity some form of randomness is often introduced into the network. Artificial neural networks modified in this manner are often labeled as probabilistic versions of their neural network sub-type (e.g., p[[spiking neural network|SNN]]).&lt;ref name = pSNN&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Schliebs | first2 = S. | last3 = Mohemmed | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Modelling the Effect of Genes on the Dynamics of Probabilistic Spiking Neural Networks for Computational Neurogenetic Modelling | url = | journal = Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics | volume = 7548 | issue = | pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-35686-5_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incorporation of fuzzy logic ===
[[Fuzzy logic]] is a system of reasoning that enables an artificial neural network to deal in non-[[Binary data|binary]] and linguistic variables. Biological data is often unable to be processed using [[Boolean logic]], and moreover accurate modeling of the capabilities of biological nervous systems requires fuzzy logic. Therefore, artificial neural networks that incorporate it, such as [[Evolving classification function|evolving fuzzy neural networks (EFuNN) or Dynamic Evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference Systems (DENFIS)]], are often used in computational neurogenetic modeling. The use of fuzzy logic is especially relevant in gene regulatory networks, as the modeling of protein binding strength often requires non-binary variables.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;&lt;ref name = ECoS&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = Michael J | year = 2009 | title = A Decade of Kasabov's Evolving Connectionist Systems: A Review | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, And Cybernetics—Part C: Applications and Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–269 | doi = 10.1109/TSMCC.2008.2012254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of learning ===
Artificial Neural Networks designed to simulate of the human brain require an ability to learn a variety of tasks that is not required by those designed to accomplish a specific task. [[Supervised learning]] is a mechanism by which an artificial neural network can learn by receiving a number of inputs with a correct output already known. An example of an artificial neural network that uses supervised learning is a [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP). In [[unsupervised learning]], an artificial neural network is trained using only inputs. Unsupervised learning is the learning mechanism by which a type of artificial neural network known as a [[self-organizing map]] (SOM) learns. Some types of artificial neural network, such as evolving connectionist systems, can learn in both a supervised and unsupervised manner.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

== Improvement ==
Both gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks have two main strategies for improving their accuracy. In both cases the output of the network is measured against known biological data using some function, and subsequent improvements are made by altering the structure of the network. A common test of accuracy for artificial neural networks is to compare some parameter of the model to data acquired from biological neural systems, such as from an [[EEG]].&lt;ref name = EEG&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Benuskova | first1 = L. | last2 = Wysoski | first2 = S. G. | last3 = Kasabov | first3 = N. | pages = 4638–4644 | title = Computational Neurogenetic Modeling: A Methodology to Study Gene Interactions Underlying Neural Oscillations | conference = 2006 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks | doi = 10.1109/IJCNN.2006.1716743 | location = Vancouver, BC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of EEG recordings, the [[local field potential]] (LFP) of the artificial neural network is taken and compared to EEG data acquired from human patients. The [[relative intensity ratios|relative intensity ratio]] (RIRs) and [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) of the EEG are compared with those generated by the artificial neural networks to determine the accuracy of the model.&lt;ref name = FFT&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Benuskova | first2 = L. | last3 = Wysoski | first3 = S.

=== Genetic algorithm ===
[[File:A-Numerical-Approach-to-Ion-Channel-Modelling-Using-Whole-Cell-Voltage-Clamp-Recordings-and-a-pcbi.0030169.sv001.ogv|thumb|right|An example of a model being refined through successive generations, using a genetic algorithm, to match experimental data.]]
Because the amount of data on the interplay of genes and neurons and their effects is not enough to construct a rigorous model, 
[[evolutionary computation]] is used to optimize artificial neural networks and gene regulatory networks, a common technique being the [[genetic algorithm]]. A genetic algorithm is a process that can be used to refine models by mimicking the process of natural selection observed in biological ecosystems. The primary advantages are that, due to not requiring derivative information, it can be applied to [[black box]] problems and [[Evolutionary multimodal optimization|multimodal optimization]]. The typical process for using genetic algorithms to refine a gene 
regulatory network is: first, create a population; next, to create offspring via a crossover operation and 
evaluate their fitness; then, on a group chosen for high fitness, simulate mutation via a mutation operator; 
finally, taking the now mutated group, repeat this process until a desired level of fitness is demonstrated.

=== Evolving systems ===
Methods by which artificial neural networks may alter their structure without simulated mutation and fitness selection have been developed. A [[Evolving classification function|dynamically evolving neural network]] is one approach, as the creation of new connections and new neurons can 
be modeled as the system adapts to new data. This enables the network to evolve in modeling accuracy without simulated natural selection. One method by which dynamically evolving networks may be optimized, called evolving layer neuron aggregation, combines neurons with sufficiently similar input weights into one neuron. This can take place during the training of the network, referred to as online aggregation, or between periods of training, referred to as offline aggregation. Experiments have suggested that offline aggregation is more efficient.&lt;ref name = ECoS /&gt;

== Potential applications ==
A variety of potential applications have been suggested for accurate computational neurogenetic models, such as simulating genetic diseases, examining the impact of potential treatments,&lt;ref name = nano&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Benuskova | first2 = L. | last3 = Wysoski | first3 = S.

The simulation of disease states is of particular interest, as modeling both the neurons and their genes and proteins allows linking genetic mutations and protein abnormalities to pathological effects in the central nervous system. Among those diseases suggested as being possible targets of computational neurogenetic modeling based analysis are epilepsy, schizophrenia, mental retardation, brain aging and Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name = book&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Benuskova | last2 = Kasabov | first1 = Lubica | first2 = Nikola | date = 2007 | title = Computational Neurogenetic Modeling | location = New York | publisher = Springer | ISBN = 0-387-48353-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cortical reaction''' is a process initiated during [[fertilisation|fertilization]] by the release of [[cortical granule]]s from the egg, which prevents [[polyspermy]], the fusion of multiple sperm with one egg. In contrast to the [[Polyspermy#Fast block of polyspermy|fast block of polyspermy]] which immediately but temporarily blocks additional sperm from fertilizing the egg, the cortical reaction gradually establishes a permanent barrier to sperm entry and functions as the main part of the [[Polyspermy#Slow block of polyspermy|slow block of polyspermy]] in many animals.

To create this barrier [[cortical granule]]s, specialized [[Vesicle (biology)#Secretory vesicles|secretory vesicles]] located within the egg's [[cell cortex|cortex]] (the region directly below the plasma membrane), are fused with the egg's plasma membrane, causing the contents of the cortical granules to be released outside the cell where they modify an existing extracellular matrix to make it impenetrable to sperm entry. The cortical granules contain [[proteases]] that clip perivitelline tether proteins, [[peroxidases]] that harden the vitelline envelope, and [[glycosaminoglycans]] that attract water into the perivitelline space, causing it to expand and form the [[hyaline layer]]. The trigger for the cortical granules to [[Exocytosis|exocytose]] is the release of calcium ions from cortical [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] in response to sperm binding to the egg.

In most animals, the extracellular matrix present around the egg is the [[Vitelline membrane|vitelline envelope]] which becomes the fertilization membrane following the cortical reaction. In mammals, however, the extracellular matrix modified by the cortical reaction is the [[zona pellucida]]. This modification of the zona pellucida is known as the zona reaction. Although highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the cortical reaction shows great diversity between species. While much has been learned about the identity and function of the contents of the cortical granules in the highly accessible sea urchin, little is known about the contents of cortical granules in mammals.

The cortical reaction within the egg is analogous to the [[acrosomal reaction]] within the sperm, where the acrosome, a specialized secretory vesicle that is homologous to cortical granules, is fused with the plasma membrane of the sperm cell to release its contents which degrade the egg's tough coating and allow the sperm to bind to and fuse with the egg.

==Echinoderms==
In the well-studied [[sea urchin]] model system, the granule contents modify a protein coat on the outside of the plasma membrane (the vitelline layer) so that it is released from the membrane. The released cortical granule proteins exert a [[colloid]] [[osmotic pressure]] causing water to enter the space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline layer, and the vitelline layer expands away from the egg surface. This is easily visible through a microscope and is known as "elevation of the fertilization envelope". Some of the former granule contents adhere to the fertilization envelope, and it is extensively modified and cross-linked. As the fertilization envelope elevates, non-fertilizing sperm are lifted away from the egg plasma membrane, and as they are not able to pass through the fertilization envelope, they are prevented from entering the egg. Therefore, the cortical reaction prevents [[polyspermy|polyspermic]] fertilization, a lethal event. Another cortical granule component, polysaccharide-rich hyalin, remains adherent to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, and becomes part of the hyaline layer.

==Mammals==
Although various mammals have been studied, mice represent the best studied animal models for understanding the cortical reaction in mammals. In mammals the cortical reaction leads to a modification of the [[zona pellucida]] that blocks polyspermy; enzymes released by cortical granules digest sperm receptor glycoproteins ZP2 and ZP3 so that they can no longer bind spermatozoon.

The '''Covenant of Mayors'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/IMG/pdf/covenantofmayors_text_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a European co-operation movement involving local and regional authorities. Signatories of the Covenant of Mayors voluntarily commit to increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and the use of [[renewable energy]] sources on their territories. By their commitment, they support the [[European Union]] 20% {{CO2}} reduction objective to be reached by 2020.

After the [[European Union climate and energy package]] was adopted in 2008, the [[European Commission]] launched the Covenant of Mayors to endorse and support the efforts deployed by local authorities in the implementation of sustainable energy policies. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/climate-change/mayors-commit-exceeding-eu-climate-goals/article-179356&lt;/ref&gt;

== Covenant of Mayors Signatories ==

European [[local authorities]] of all sizes – from small villages to capitals and [[major metropolitan area]]s – are eligible to sign up as Covenant of Mayors Signatories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/about/signatories_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities, towns and other urban areas have a crucial role to play in mitigating climate change, as they consume three quarter of the energy produced in the European Union and are responsible for a similar share of {{CO2}} emissions. Local authorities are also in a position to change citizens' behaviour and address climate and energy questions in a comprehensive manner, notably by conciliating public and private interests and by integrating [[sustainable energy]] issues into overall local development goals.

== Formal undertakings ==

To meet the {{CO2}} reduction targets they set themselves, signatories commit to a series of steps and accept to report and be monitored on their actions. Within predefined time frames, they formally undertake to fulfil the following:

* Develop adequate administrative structures, including allocation of sufficient human resources, in order to undertake the necessary actions;
* Prepare a '''Baseline Emission Inventory''';
* Submit a '''Sustainable Energy Action Plan''' within the year following the official adhesion to the Covenant of Mayors initiative, and including concrete measures leading to at least 20% reduction of {{CO2}} emissions by 2020;
* Submit an '''implementation report''' at least '''every second year after submission of their Sustainable Energy Action Plan''' for evaluation, monitoring and verification purposes

To comply with the crucial necessity of mobilising local stakeholders in the development of the Sustainable Energy Action Plans, signatories also undertake to:

* Share experience and know-how with other local authorities;
* '''Organise Local Energy Days''' to raise citizens awareness of sustainable development and energy efficiency;
* Attend or contribute to the Covenant of Mayors annual ceremony, thematic workshops and discussion group meetings;
* Spread the message of the Covenant in the appropriate fora and, in particular, encourage other mayors to join the Covenant.

== Sustainable Energy Action Plans ==

To reach and try to exceed the European Union energy and climate objectives, Covenant of Mayors signatories commit to develop a '''Sustainable Energy Action Plan''' (SEAP), within a year following their adhesion to the initiative. This action plan, approved by the municipal council, outlines the activities and measures foreseen by signatories to fulfil their commitments, with corresponding time frames and assigned responsibilities.

Various technical and methodological supporting materials (including the "SEAP Guidebook" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/IMG/pdf/seap_guidelines_en-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and template, reports on existing methodologies and tools, etc.) offer practical guidance and clear recommendations on the whole SEAP development process. Based on the practical experiences of local authorities and developed in close co-operation with the European Commission Joint Research Centre, this support package provides Covenant signatories with key principles and a clear step-by-step approach. All documents are downloadable on the www.eumayors.eu website library.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/support/library_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coordination and support ==
=== Covenant Coordinators and Supporters ===

Covenant Signatories do not always possess the adequate tools and resources to prepare a Baseline Emission Inventory, draft the related Sustainable Energy Action Plan and finance the actions featured in the latter. In light of this, provinces, regions, networks and groupings of municipalities have a crucial role to play in helping signatories honour their commitments.

'''Covenant Coordinators''' are public authorities from different government levels (national, regional, provincial) which provide strategic guidance to signatories, as well as financial and technical support in the development and implementation of their Sustainable Energy Action Plans. The Commission distinguishes between "Territorial Coordinators", which are sub-national decentralised authorities – including provinces, regions and public groupings of municipalities -, and "National Coordinators", which include national public bodies – such as national energy agencies and ministries of energy.

'''Covenant Supporters''' are European, national and regional networks and associations of local authorities which leverage their lobbying, communication and networking activities to promote the Covenant of Mayors initiative and support the commitments of its signatories.

=== Covenant of Mayors Office ===

Promotional, technical and administrative assistance is provided on a daily basis to Covenant signatories and stakeholders by the Covenant of Mayors Office (CoMO), managed by a consortium of local and regional authorities' networks, led by [[Energy Cities]] and composed of [[Council of European Municipalities and Regions|CEMR]], [[Climate Alliance]], [[Eurocities]] and [[FEDARENE]]. Funded by the [[European Commission]], the CoMO is responsible for the overall co-ordination of the initiative.

=== Institutions of the European Union ===

To support the elaboration and implementation the signatories' Sustainable Energy Action Plans, the [[European Commission]] has contributed to the development of financial facilities particularly targeting Covenant of Mayors signatories, among which the European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) facility, set up in co-operation with the [[European Investment Bank]], for large-scale projects, and ELENA-KfW which, established in partnership with the German Group [[KfW]], offers a complementary approach to mobilise sustainable investments of small and medium-sized municipalities.

Alongside the [[European Commission]], the Covenant benefits from full institutional support, including from the [[Committee of the Regions]], which has supported the initiative since its inception; the [[European Parliament]], where the two first signing ceremonies were held; and the [[European Investment Bank]], which assists local authorities in unlocking their investment potentials.

=== Joint Research Centre ===

The [[Joint Research Centre]] of the [[European Commission]] is responsible for providing technical and scientific support to the initiative. It works in close collaboration with the Covenant of Mayors Office to equip signatories with clear technical guidelines and templates to assist delivery of their Covenant of Mayors commitments, as well as to monitor implementation and results.

[[File:Horizontalsperre nirostahl.jpg|thumb|A metal damp-proof course between the stone foundation and brick wall]]
'''Damp proofing''' in [[construction]] is a type of moisture control applied to building walls and floors to prevent [[Damp (structural)|moisture]] from passing into the interior spaces. Dampness problems are among the most frequent problems encountered in residences.

==Overview==
[[File:FlexibleRainPipe.JPG|thumb|right|250px|DPC visible between concrete foundation and brickwork.]]
''Damp proofing'' is defined by the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) as a material that resists the passage of water with no [[Hydrostatics#Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] and ''waterproof'' as a treatment that resists the passage of water under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Greenlaw, Bruce. "Moisture-Proofing New Basements", ''Foundations and concrete work''. Newtown, Connecticut: Taunton Press, 2003. 93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, damp proofing keeps moisture out of a building where [[vapor barrier]]s keep interior moisture from getting into walls. Moisture resistance is not necessarily absolute; it is usually defined by a specific [[test method]], limits, and [[engineering tolerance]]s.

Damp proofing is accomplished several ways including:
* A '''damp-proof course''' (DPC) is a barrier through the structure designed to prevent moisture rising by [[capillary action]] such as through a phenomenon known as [[Damp (structural)#Rising damp|rising damp]]. Rising damp is the effect of water rising from the ground into property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timberwise.co.uk/damp-proofing/|title=Damp Proofing {{!}} Providing The Best Damp Treatments|date=2015-08-06|work=Timberwise|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damp proof course may be horizontal or vertical.&lt;ref name="Punmia"&gt;Punmia, B. C., A. K. Jain, and Arun Kumar Jain. ''Building construction''. 10th ed. New Delhi: Laxmi Pub., 2008. 631. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A DPC layer is usually laid below all masonry walls, regardless if the wall is a [[Load-bearing wall|load bearing wall]] or a [[Wall#Partition wall|partition wall]].
* A '''damp-proof membrane''' (DPM) is a [[membrane]] material applied to prevent moisture transmission. A common example is [[polyethylene]] sheeting laid under a concrete slab to prevent the [[concrete]] from gaining moisture through capillary action.&lt;ref&gt;"Damp-proof membrane (dpm, DPM)" def. 1. Gorse, Christopher A., and David Johnston. ''A dictionary of construction, surveying, and civil engineering''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A DPM may be used for the DPC.
* '''Integral damp proofing''' in concrete involves adding materials to the concrete mix to make the concrete itself impermeable.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;
* '''Surface coating''' with thin water proof materials for resistance to non-pressurized moisture such as rain water or a coating of cement sprayed on such as [[shotcrete]] which can resist water under pressure.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;
* '''Cavity wall construction''', such as [[rainscreen]] construction, is where the interior walls are separated from the exterior walls by a cavity.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;
* '''[[Pressure grouting]]''' cracks and joints in masonry materials.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;

==Materials==
Materials widely used for damp proofing include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=P.C. Varghese|title=Building Materials|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year=2005|ISBN=81-203-2848-5|page=230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBamtq45OykC&amp;pg=PT248&amp;lpg=PT248#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexible materials like [[butyl rubber]], hot bitumen ([[asphalt]]), plastic sheets, [[Bituminous waterproofing#Roofing felt|bituminous felts]], sheets of [[lead]], [[copper]], etc.
* Semi-rigid materials like [[Asphalt concrete#Mixture formulations|mastic asphalt]]
* Rigid materials, like impervious [[brick]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[slate]], [[Cement-mortar lined ductile iron pipe|cement mortar]], or cement concrete painted with bitumen, etc.
* Stones
*[[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] with waterproofing compounds
* Coarse [[sand]] layers under floors
* Continuous plastic sheets under floors

==Masonry construction==
A DPC is a durable, impermeable material such as slate, [[Bituminous waterproofing#Roofing felt|felt paper]], metal, plastic or special engineered bricks&lt;ref&gt;Curtin, William George. Structural masonry designers' manual. 3rd ed. revised Oxford: Blackwell Science, 2008. 314. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; bedded into the mortar between two courses of bricks or blocks. It can often be seen as a thin line in the mortar near ground level. To create a continuous barrier, pieces of DPC or DPM may be sealed together. In addition, the DPC may be sealed to the DPM around the outside edges of the ground floor, completely sealing the inside of the building from the damp ground around it.

In a masonry [[cavity wall]], there is usually a DPC in both the outer and inner wall.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In the outer wall it is normally {{convert|150|mm}} to {{convert|200|mm||abbr=on}} above ground level (the height of 2-3 brick courses). This allows rain to form puddles and splash up off the ground, without saturating the wall above DPC level. The wall below the DPC may become saturated in rainy weather. The DPC in the inner wall is usually below floor level, (under a suspended timber floor structure), or, with a solid concrete floor, it is usually found immediately above the floor slab so that it can be linked to the DPM under the floor slab. This enables installation of skirting boards above floor level without fear of puncturing it. Alternatively, instead of fitting separate inner and outer DPCs, it is common in commercial housebuilding to use a one-piece length of rigid plastic, (albeit an angled section), which fits neatly across the cavity and slots into both walls (a cavity tray). This method requires the need for weep vents to enable rainwater ingress to drain from the cavities otherwise rising dampness could occur from above the DPC.

==Concrete walls and floors==
[[Concrete]] normally allows moisture to pass through so a ''vertical damp proof barrier'' is needed. Barriers may be a coating or membrane applied to the exterior of the concrete. The coating may be [[asphalt]], asphalt emulsion, a thinned asphalt called cutback asphalt, or an [[elastomer]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenlaw, Bruce. "Moisture-Proofing New Basements", ''Foundations and concrete work''. Newtown, Connecticut: Taunton Press, 2003. 93-101. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Membranes are rubberized asphalt or [[EPDM rubber]]. Rubberized products perform better because concrete sometimes develops cracks and the barrier does not crack with the concrete.

==Remedial damp proofing==
Until the 20th century, masonry buildings in Europe and North America were generally constructed from highly permeable materials such as stone and [[Lime (material)|lime]]-based mortars and renders covered with soft water-based paints which all allowed any damp to diffuse into the air without damage. The later application of impermeable materials which prevent the natural dispersion of damp, such as [[tile]], [[linoleum]], cement and [[gypsum]]-based materials and synthetic paints is thought by some to be the most significant cause of damp problems in older buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Society of the Protection of Ancient Buildings|title=Technical Q&amp;A 20: Rising Damp|url=http://www.spab.org.uk/advice/technical-qas/technical-qa-20-rising-damp/|accessdate=16 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228182147/http://www.spab.org.uk/advice/technical-qas/technical-qa-20-rising-damp/|archive-date=2014-02-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many solutions for dealing with dampness in existing buildings, the choice of which will largely be determined by the types of dampness that are affecting the building, ''e.g.'', rising damp, hygroscopic damp, condensation, [[Damp (structural)#Rain penetration|penetrating damp]], etc. 

The leading trade Association for contractors in this industry is the Damp Proofing Association (DPA) with over 300 approved local contractors. They can be found at www.dampproofingassociation.com

==Health and safety==
Some DPC materials may contain [[asbestos]] fibres. This was more commonly found in the older, grey sealants as well as flexible tar boards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts''' became publicly known on February 26, 2015 when the group known as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released a video showing their destruction.

==Mosul Museum==
The [[Mosul Museum]], opened in 1952, is the second largest museum in Iraq, with the first being the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.

===Importance of the region===
Iraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C. The "city" became the center of the new social system, resulting in the need of centralized power.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 22) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the "treasure hunting" of old transformed into the beginnings of  the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction (2015)==

===Contents of ISIL video===
In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed "idolatrous". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.

A translation from the video is as follows: "These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries." &lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.

====Assyrian====
*Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of [[Nineveh]], an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler [[Sennacherib]]. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]], who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld.   
*Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the [[lamassu]]. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as "a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance." The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.&lt;ref&gt;[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human-Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.]&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 13 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's) &amp; Full Projection.2.JPG|thumb|Lamassu and Balawat Gate in the British Museum]]

Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balawat Gates====
The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[J.E. Curtis &amp; N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a "'major' find from a 'minor'" site.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt; Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a "hollow-way" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.

====Hatrene statues====
Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In ''Archaeology''. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hercules Hatra Iraq Parthian period 1st 2nd century CE.jpg|thumb|Hatrene statue of Hercules]]

The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/ Assessing the Damange at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts====
According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/full-story-isil-takeover-mosul-museum-150309053022129.html/ The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===

The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/364 Learning from the Iraq Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorhistoryx.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/what-isis-destroys-why-and-why-we-must-document-it-hyperallergic/ What ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Disaster Informatics''' or '''crisis informatics''' is the study of the use of information and technology in the preparation, mitigation, response and recovery phases of disasters and other emergencies. It began to emerge as a field after the successful use of a variety of technologies in disasters including the [[Asian tsunami]], [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]] and [[Hurricane katrina|Hurricane Katrina]].

Disaster informatics may involve incorporating [[social media]] content generated by people in disaster zones into humanitarian response plans based on [[satellite imagery]] and official [[emergency services]] procedures. Disaster informatics may involve [[crowdsourcing]], [[Participatory GIS|participatory mapping]] or [[citizen science]], with  members of the public as 'everyday analysts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palen |first=Leysia|authorlink= Leysia Palen |year=2010 |title=A vision for technology-mediated support for public participation &amp; assistance in mass emergencies &amp; disasters |url=https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/computingvisionspaper.pdf |accessdate=19 August 2014 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111352/https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/computingvisionspaper.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}

The term was first used in a [[request for proposal]] response by D. E. Yarrington after the WTC communications problems were revealed. Subsequently, in 2002, a grant proposal was submitted to the [[National Institutes of Health]]/[[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] to begin the formal study of disaster informatics as it related to public health. This initiative emerged from her library and information science work at [[Jackson State University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">In [[bioinformatics]], the '''EzTaxon database''' is a web-based tool for the identification of [[prokaryotes]] based on [[16S ribosomal RNA]] gene sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chun | first1 = Jongsik | last2 = Lee | first2 = Jae-Hak | last3 = Jung | first3 = Yoonyoung | last4 = Kim | first4 = Myungjin | last5 = Kim | first5 = Seil | last6 = Kwon Kim | first6 = Byung | last7 = Lim | first7 = Young-Woon | year = 2007 | title = EzTaxon: a web-based tool for the identification of prokaryotes based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences | url = | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 57 | issue = 10| pages = 2259–2261 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.64915-0 | pmid=17911292}}&lt;/ref&gt; EzTaxon is an [[open access]] database that is produced and maintained by ChunLab, Inc.

The EzTaxon database contains sequences of type strains of prokaryotic species with validly published names. Although EzTaxon is mainly used for the routine identification of prokaryotic isolates, sequences from uncultured taxa were not included. Thus in 2012, EzTaxon was extended to include uncultured prokaryotes and the name of the database was changed to EzTaxon-e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = OS | last2 = Cho | first2 = YJ | last3 = Lee | first3 = K | last4 = Yoon | first4 = SH | last5 = Kim | first5 = M | last6 = Na | first6 = H | last7 = Park | first7 = SC | last8 = Jeon | first8 = YS | last9 = Lee | first9 = JH | last10 = Yi | first10 = H | last11 = Won | first11 = S | last12 = Chun | first12 = J | year = 2012 | title = Introducing EzTaxon-e: a prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene sequence database with phylotypes that represent uncultured species | url = | journal = Int J Syst Evol Microbiol | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 716–21 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.038075-0 | pmid=22140171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming convention ==
[[Taxa]] names included in EzTaxon-e represent groups of uncultured sequences found in [[public domain]] databases. The names included in EzTaxon-e have no standing in formal nomenclature but they were created to help in the comparison of microbial communities and diversity in nature.
 
* New names found in EzTaxon-e are formed by adding special suffixes to [[Genbank]] sequence accession numbers of sequences (e.g. AB177171_s -&gt; species of which the sequence entry AB177171 serves type; AB177171_g -&gt; genus; AB177171_f -&gt; family; AB177171_o -&gt; order; AB177171_c -&gt; class; AB177171_p -&gt; phylum).
* Well-known names have been preserved for historical reasons. [[SAR11]], the famous marine inhabitant, is labeled as [[SAR11]](order), and further divided into 4 families (SAR11-1_f to SAR11-4_f).
* Based on 16S rRNA sequence [[phylogeny]], some obviously misclassified species have been renamed using special suffixes. For example, Bacteroides pectinophilus is not an authentic member of the [[genus]] Bacteroides. However, it may represent a novel genus in the family Lachnospiraceae. Therefore, in the EzTaxon-e database, Bacteroides pectinophilus is placed under a tentatively named new genus Bacteroides_g1.
*Sequences and tentative taxa that start with "4P" are products of the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium system.

'''Fitts's law''' (often cited as '''Fitts' law''') is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in [[human–computer interaction]] and [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]].

== Original model formulation ==
The original 1954 paper by [[Paul Fitts|Paul Morris Fitts]] proposed a metric to quantify the difficulty of a target selection task.
The metric was based on 
an information analogy, where the distance to the center of the target (''D'') is like a signal and the tolerance or width of the target (''W'') is like noise.
The metric is Fitts's ''index of difficulty'' (''ID'', in bits):

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{2D} {W}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

Fitts also proposed an ''index of performance'' (''IP'', in bits per second) as a measure of human performance.  The metric
combines a task's index of difficulty (''ID'') with the movement time (''MT'', in seconds) in selecting the target.  In Fitts's words, 
"The average rate of information generated by a series of movements is the average information per movement divided by the time per movement" (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;390).  Thus,

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{IP} = \Bigg(\frac{\text{ID}} {\text{MT}}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

Today, ''IP'' is more commonly called ''throughput'' (''TP'').  It is also common to include an adjustment for accuracy in the calculation.

Researchers after Fitts began the practice of building linear regression equations and examining the 
correlation (''r'') for goodness of fit.  The equation expresses the relationship between
''MT'' and the ''D'' and ''W'' task parameters:

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{MT} = a + b \cdot \text{ID} = a + b \cdot \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{2D}{W}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*	''MT'' is the average time to complete the movement.
*	''a'' and ''b'' are constants that depend on the choice of input device and are usually determined empirically by [[regression analysis]].
*	''ID'' is the index of difficulty.
*	''D''	is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target. 
*	''W'' is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion.	''W'' can also be thought of as the allowed error tolerance in the final position, since the final point of the motion must fall within ±{{frac|''W''|2}}	of the target's center.

Since shorter movement times are desirable for a given task, the value of the ''b'' parameter can be used as a metric when comparing computer pointing devices against one another. The first [[Human-Computer Interface]] application of Fitts's law was by Card, English, and Burr (1978), who used the index of performance (''IP''), interpreted as {{frac|1|''b''}}, to compare performance of different [[input device]]s, with the [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] coming out on top compared to the joystick or directional movement keys.&lt;ref name=Card1978&gt;{{cite journal |last=Card |first=Stuart K. |first2=William K. |last2=English |first3=Betty J. |last3=Burr |date=1978 |title=Evaluation of mouse, rate-controlled isometric joystick, step keys, and text keys for text selection on a CRT |journal=Ergonomics |volume=21 |number=8 |pages=601–613 |doi=10.1080/00140137808931762|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/SSL-77-1_Evaluation_of_Mouse_Rate-Controlled_Isometric_Joystick_Step_Keys_and_Text_Keys_for_Text_Selection_on_a_CRT.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This early work, according to [[Stuart Card]]'s biography, "was a major factor leading to the mouse's commercial introduction by [[Xerox]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/people/stuart/stuart.htm |title=Stuart Card |website=[[PARC (company)|PARC]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711210730/http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/people/stuart/stuart.htm |archivedate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments testing Fitts's law apply the model to a dataset in which either distance or width, but not both, are varied. The model's predictive power deteriorates when both are varied over a significant range.&lt;ref name=Graham1996&gt;{{cite thesis	|last=Graham	|first=Evan	|title=Pointing on a Computer Display	|type=Ph.D.	|publisher=Simon Fraser University	|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notice that because the ''ID'' term depends only on the ''ratio'' of distance to width, the model implies that a target distance and width combination can be re-scaled arbitrarily without affecting movement time, which is impossible. 
Despite its flaws, this form of the model does possess remarkable predictive power across a range of computer interface modalities and motor tasks, and has provided many insights into user interface design principles.

== Bits per second: model innovations driven by information theory ==
The formulation of Fitts's index of difficulty most frequently used in the [[Human-Computer Interaction]] community is called the Shannon formulation:

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D}{W}+1\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;	

This form was proposed by Scott MacKenzie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack|title=Scott MacKenzie's home page|first=I. Scott|last=MacKenzie|website=www.yorku.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor at [[York University]], and named for its resemblance to the [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].&lt;ref name=MacKenzie1992&gt;{{cite journal	|last=MacKenzie	|first=I. Scott	|date=1992 |title=Fitts' law as a research and design tool in human–computer interaction |journal=Human–Computer Interaction |volume=7 |pages=91–139 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/hci1992.pdf |format=pdf|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0701_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this form of the model, the difficulty of a pointing task was equated to a quantity of information transmitted (in units of bits) by performing the task. This was justified by the assertion that pointing reduces to an information processing task. Although no formal mathematical connection was established between Fitts's law and the Shannon-Hartley theorem it was inspired by, the Shannon form of the law has been used extensively, likely due to the appeal of quantifying motor actions using information theory. In 2002 the [[ISO 9241]] was published, providing standards for human-computer interface testing, including the use of the Shannon form of Fitts's law. It has been shown that the information transmitted via serial keystrokes on a keyboard and the information implied by the ''ID'' for such a task are not consistent.&lt;ref name=Soukoreff2011&gt;{{cite journal	|last1=Soukoreff |first1=R. William	|last2=Zhao |first2=Jian |last3=Ren |first3=Xiangshi |title=The Entropy of a Rapid Aimed Movement: Fitts' Index of Difficulty versus Shannon's Entropy	|year=2011 |journal=Human Computer Interaction |pages=222–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adjustment for accuracy: Use of the effective target width ==

An important improvement to Fitts's law was proposed by Crossman in 1956 (see Welford, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148)&lt;ref name=Welford&gt;{{cite book |last=Welford |first=A. T. |date=1968 |title=Fundamentals of Skill |publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used by Fitts
in his 1964 paper with Peterson.&lt;ref name=Fitts1964&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitts |first=Paul M. |last2=Peterson |first2=J. R. 
|title=Information capacity of discrete motor responses |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=67 |date=1964 |pages=103–112 |doi=10.1037/h0045689}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the adjustment, target width (''W'') is replaced by an effective target width (''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;).
''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is computed from the standard deviation in the selection coordinates gathered over a sequence of trials for a particular ''D-W'' condition.  If the selections are logged as ''x'' coordinates along the axis of approach to the target, then

:	&lt;math&gt;W_e = 4.133 \times SD_x&lt;/math&gt;

This yields

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID}_e = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D}{W_e}+1\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{IP} = \Bigg(\frac{ID_e} {MT}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

If the selection coordinates are normally distributed, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; spans 96% of the 
distribution.  If the observed error rate was 4% in the sequence of trials, then ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = ''W''.  If the error rate was greater than 4%, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''W'', and if the error rate was less than 4%, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''W''.  By using ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, a Fitts' law model more closely
reflects what users actually did, rather than what they were asked to do.

The main advantage in computing ''IP'' as above is that spatial variability, or accuracy, is included in the measurement.  
With the adjustment for accuracy, Fitts's law
more truly encompasses the speed-accuracy tradeoff.  The equations above appear in ISO 9241-9 as the recommended method of
computing ''throughput''.

== Welford's model: innovations driven by predictive power ==
Not long after the original model was proposed, a 2-factor variation was proposed under the intuition that target distance and width have separate effects on movement time. Welford's model, proposed in 1968, separated the influence of target distance and width into separate terms, and provided improved predictive power:&lt;ref name="Welford"/&gt;

:	&lt;math&gt;T = a + b_1 \log_2 (D) + b_2 \log_2 (W)&lt;/math&gt;

This model has an additional parameter, so its predictive accuracy cannot be directly compared with 1-factor forms of Fitts's law. However, a variation on Welford's model inspired by the Shannon formulation,

:	&lt;math&gt;T = a + b_1 \log_2 (D+W) + b_2 \log_2 (W) = a + b\log_2 \left(\frac{D+W}{W^k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

reduces to the Shannon form when ''k = 1''. Therefore, this model ''can'' be directly compared against the Shannon form of Fitts's law using the [[F-test]] of nested models.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker_2012&gt;{{cite journal	|last=Shoemaker	|first=Garth	|last2=Tsukitani	|first2=Takayuki	|last3=Kitamura	|first3=Yoshifumi	|last4=Booth	|first4=Kellogg	|title=Two-Part Models Capture the Impact of Gain on Pointing Performance	|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction	|date=December 2012	|volume=19|issue=4|pages=1–34|doi=10.1145/2395131.2395135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison reveals that not only does the Shannon form of Welford's model better predict movement times, but it is also more robust when control-display gain (the ratio between e.g. hand movement and cursor movement) is varied. Consequently, although the Shannon model is slightly more complex and less intuitive, it is empirically the best model to use for virtual pointing tasks.

== Extending the model from 1D to 2D and other nuances ==

=== Extensions to two or more dimensions ===
In its original form, Fitts's law is meant to apply only to one-dimensional tasks. However, the original experiments required subjects to move a stylus (in three dimensions) between two metal plates on a table, termed the reciprocal tapping task. The target width perpendicular to the direction of movement was very wide to avoid it having a significant influence on performance. A major application for Fitts's law is 2D virtual pointing tasks on computer screens, in which targets have bounded sizes in both dimensions.

Fitts's law has been extended to two-dimensional tasks in two different ways. For navigating e.g. hierarchical pull-down menus, the user must generate a trajectory with the pointing device that is constrained by the menu geometry; for this application the [[Accot-Zhai steering law]] was derived.

For simply pointing to targets in a two-dimensional space, the model generally holds as-is but requires adjustments to capture target geometry and quantify targeting errors in a logically consistent way.&lt;ref name=Wobbrock2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wobbrock |first=J. |last2=Shinohara |first2=K |date=2011 |title=The effects of task dimensionality, endpoint deviation, throughput calculation, and experiment design on pointing measures and models. |journal=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |pages=1639–1648 |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacKenzie1992-2D&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacKenzie |first=I. Scott |first2=William A. S. |last2=Buxton |date=1992 |title=Extending Fitts' law to two-dimensional tasks |journal=Proceedings of the ACM CHI 1992 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |pages=219–226 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/CHI92.html |doi=10.1145/142750.142794 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characterizing performance ===
Since the ''a'' and ''b'' parameters should capture movement times over a potentially wide range of task geometries, they can serve as a performance metric for a given interface. In doing so, it is necessary to separate variation between users from variation between interfaces. 
The ''a'' parameter is typically positive and close to zero, and sometimes ignored in characterizing average performance. Multiple methods exist for identifying parameters from experimental data, and the choice of method is the subject of heated debate, since method variation can result in parameter differences that overwhelm underlying performance differences.&lt;ref name=Soukoreff2004&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards a standard for pointing device evaluation, perspectives on 27 years of Fitts' law research in HCI |first1=R. William |last1=Soukoreff |first2=I. Scott |last2=MacKenzie |journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |year=2004 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=751–789 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/ijhcs2004.html |doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhai2002&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Zhai |first=Shumin |date=2002 |title=On the Validity of Throughput as a Characteristic of Computer Input |number=RJ 10253 |institution=Almaden Research Center |location=San Jose, California |url=http://www.m.shuminzhai.com/papers/ZhaiIBMReporRJ10253.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional issue in characterizing performance is incorporating success rate: an aggressive user can achieve shorter movement times at the cost of experimental trials in which the target is missed. If the latter are not incorporated into the model, then average movement times can be artificially decreased.

== Temporal targets ==
Fitts's law deals only with targets defined in space. However, a target can be defined purely on the time axis, which is called a temporal target. A blinking target or a target moving toward a selection area are examples of temporal targets. Similar to space, the distance to the target (i.e., temporal distance D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) and the width of the target (i.e., temporal width W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) can be defined for temporal targets as well. The temporal distance is the amount of time a person must wait for a target to appear. The temporal width is a short duration from the moment the target appears until it disappears. For example, for a blinking target, D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as the period of blinking and W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; as the duration of the blinking. As with targets in space, the larger the D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; or the smaller the W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, the more difficult it becomes to select the target.

The task of selecting the temporal target is called temporal pointing. The model for temporal pointing was first presented to [[Human–computer interaction|Human-computer Interaction]] field in 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Byungjoo|last2=Oulasvirta|first2=Antti|date=2016|title=Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2858036.2858143|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1857–1868|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858143|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The model predicts the error rate, the human performance in temporal pointing, as a function of temporal index of difficulty (ID&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;):

&lt;math&gt;\text{ID}_{t} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D_{t}}{W_{t}}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

A '''funeral oration''' or '''''epitaphios logos''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἐπιτάφιος λόγος}}) is a formal speech delivered on the ceremonial occasion of a [[funeral]]. Funerary customs comprise the practices used by a culture to remember the dead, from the funeral itself, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. In [[ancient Greece]] and, in particular, in  [[ancient Athens]], the funeral oration was deemed an indispensable component of the funeral ritual.

The ''epitaphios logos'' is regarded as an almost exclusive Athenian creation, although some early elements of such speeches exist in the [[epic poetry|epos]] of Homer and in the [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] of [[Pindar]]. [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] is the earlier extant of the genre.&lt;ref name="Colaiaco"&gt;J.A. Colaiaco, ''Socrates Against Athens'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians are those who set the standard and, therefore, [[Demosthenes]] praises them, saying that "you alone of all mankind publicly pronounce over your dead funeral orations, in which you extol the deeds of the brave".&lt;ref name="Leptines"&gt;Demosthenes, ''Against Leptines'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072&amp;layout=&amp;loc=20.141 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homer and Pindar==
In Homer very few elements of ''epitaphios logos'' or laudation are found. At the funeral of [[Patroclus]] chief in all the mourning is [[Achilles]]; the son of [[Peleus]] laid his bloodstained hand on the breast of his friend and cried, "Fare well Patroklos, even in the house of [[Hades]]. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag [[Hector]] hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you."&lt;ref name="HomerIl19"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 23, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;query=book%3D%2323 19 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; As he spoke he treated the body of Hector with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroklos.&lt;ref name="HomerIl19" /&gt; At the funeral of Hector the women, [[Andromache]], his mother and Helen, deliver the final public statements over the dead body.&lt;ref name="Foley40"&gt;H. P. Foley, ''Female Acts in Greek Tragedy'', 40&lt;/ref&gt; Andromache laments the loss of her husband with these emotional words:&lt;ref name="HomerIl477"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 22, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;layout=&amp;loc=22.477 477 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded mountain of Plakos in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was a child - ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter - would that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.}}

In the ''Sixth Olympian For Hagesias of Syracuse'', the poet mentions a characteristic example of an [[epitaph]] high praise: "Hagesias, that praise is ready for you, which once Adrastus' tongue rightly spoke for the seer Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, when the earth swallowed up him and his shining horses.  In Thebes, when the seven pyres of corpses had been consumed, the son of Talaus spoke in this way: “I long for the eye of my army, a man who was good both as a prophet and at fighting with the spear.”"&lt;ref name="Pindar"&gt;Pindar, ''Sixth Olympian'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162&amp;layout=&amp;loc=O.+6.1  15]&lt;/ref&gt; Nicole Loraux observes that the ''epitaphios'' was "born of lyric poetry and in competition with it", since the funeral oratory "uses poetic themes but reinterprets them from a resolutely political perspective".&lt;ref name="Loraux231"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athens==
The orator [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] claimed that the funeral oration had been originated in the 6th-century BC in Athens by [[Solon]],&lt;ref&gt;Anaximenes, ''Frag.'' 44&lt;/ref&gt; but this is widely doubted by historians.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sickinger, 1999, ''Public records and archives in classical Athens'', page 30. UNC Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usher"&gt;Stephen Usher, 1999, ''Greek oratory: tradition and originality'', page 349. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More plausible, but not beyond doubt,&lt;ref name="usher"/&gt; is the statement by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] that the Athenians instituted the funeral oration "in honour or those who fought at [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and died for their country, or to the glory of their exploits at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Ant. Rom.'' v. 17. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides describes in detail the funeral rituals and points out that "the dead are laid in the public sepulchre in the most beautiful suburb of the city, in which those who fall in war are always buried".&lt;ref name="Th2.34"&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', 2.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=2.34.1 34]&lt;/ref&gt; This suburb was [[Kerameikos]], where there was a monument for all the Athenians fell in battle, except such of them as fought at Marathon.&lt;ref name="Pausanias"&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', 29.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.29.1 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians now believe that the ''demosion sema'' (a collective burial site for the war dead) and the ''epitaphios logos'' were first established around 470 BC, customs that continued during the Periclean period.&lt;ref name="N95-96"&gt;A.W. Nightingale, ''Genres in Dialogues'', 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest preserved casualty list, giving the names of those who died fighting for their city in a given year, dates to 490-480 BC and it is associated with the [[battle of Marathon]],&lt;ref&gt;Keesling, C., The Marathon Casualty List from Eua-Loukou and the Plinthedon Style in Attic Inscriptions, Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, vol. 180 (2012), pp. 139-148&lt;/ref&gt; and white-ground [[lekythos|lekythoi]] depicting funerary scenes started around 470 BC.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Oakley, ''Bail Oinochoai'', 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|funeral oration]] of [[Pericles]], as reported by [[Thucydides]], is the earliest ''epitaphios'' presented in full.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, II, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0199;query=chapter%3D%23181;layout=;loc=2.36.1/ 35-46]&lt;/ref&gt; The burial of the war dead in the first year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] is regarded as reflecting the fifth-century dominance of the public co-memorial.&lt;ref&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheme and structure==

Though [[Plato]] is consistently suspicious of the ability of oratory to teach, in the ''[[Menexenus (dialogue)|Menexenus]]'' he demonstrates a theoretical interest in the project of funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson202"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 202&lt;/ref&gt; He actually describes the scheme of the traditional Athenian funeral oration with the following succinct phrase:&lt;ref name="Menexenus236e"&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus'', 236 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Menex.+236e e]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And the speech required is one which will adequately eulogize the dead and give kindly exhortation to the living, appealing to their children and their brethren to copy the virtues of these heroes, and to their fathers and mothers and any still surviving ancestors offering consolation.}}

Thereby, the traditional ''epitaphios'' must contain: a ''[[eulogy]]'' of the war dead and the city, an ''exhortation'' to the relatives to copy the virtues of the war dead and a ''consolation'' for the living members of their families.&lt;ref name="Helios"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Funeral Oration|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia The Helios]]|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the ''epitaphios'' consists of the following parts:
* ''Preamble'', which treats the performance expectations of the audience.&lt;ref name="Derderian181"&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 181&lt;/ref&gt; The orator usually asserts that it is almost impossible for him to find words worthy of the glorious achievements of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; Such a preamble reveals the position of the ''epitaphios'' as an oral genre within a ritually and socially bounded society.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;
*''Origin and ancestors''.
*''The war dead, their self-sacrifice and their devotion to the Athenian Polity''.
*''Epilogue'', which constitutes a consolation and an encouragement for the families of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; The epilogue employs a traditional dismissal of the mourners for further private lament, at which point the city's promise of education for the surviving orphans signals the resumption of life in the ''polis''.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;

== Function and critics ==

The primary function of the funeral oration was to give public expression to the conception of the potential excellence of [[polis]]. It was an occasion on which Athens "invented" and "reinvented" itself in narrative form.&lt;ref name="Loraux312"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 312&lt;/ref&gt; The city displayed its achievements, as well as the civic and personal virtues to which the citizens could aspire.&lt;ref name="Monoson202" /&gt; The secular prose of the funeral oration dedicates itself to celebrating the ideal of the democratic Athenian city.&lt;ref&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Children of Athena'', 45&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ''epitaphios'', a civic discourse, the city recognizes itself as it wishes to be.&lt;ref name="Loraux312" /&gt;

It is for this reason that Plato has chosen the funeral oration as a main target of him. In ''Menexenus'' he engages the concerns of funeral oratory and appropriates for philosophy part of the intellectual mission that the Athenians associated with the most celebrated and democratic form of [[epideictic]], the funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson205"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extant speeches==

Whereas the ''epitaphios'' originated itself as a public speech composed for a specific occasion, a number of specimens of this genre were not composed for delivery at the public burial. They would have been read to small audiences at the intellectual gatherings that met at so many venues. Gorgias' funeral oration, maybe that of [[Lysias]] and clearly Plato's parodic ''epitaphios'' in ''Menexenus'' were not designed to be delivered before the Athenian people.&lt;ref name="N95-96" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The so-called '''Hamburg School of Art History''' (''Hamburger Schule der Kunstgeschichte'') was a school of art historians primarily teaching at the [[University of Hamburg]], who were closely connected with the ''Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg'' (KBW) at the [[Warburg Haus, Hamburg]]. Its main members were scholars such as [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Fritz Saxl]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], who had been schooled to see images as cultural documents and inculcated in the investigation of pictorial types.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sears, "American Iconography: Assessing FSA Photographs, 1945", ''Visual Resources: An International Journal of Documentation'', Volume 30, Issue 3, 2014, pp. 239-254.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hamburg School of Art History is celebrated for the theoretical interpretations of subject matter known as [[iconography]] and [[iconology]]. It was soon established and attracted brilliant students such as [[Edgar Wind]], [[Hugo Buchthal]], [[Adolf Katzenellenbogen]], [[Walter Horn]], [[Charles de Tolnay]], [[Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich]], [[Lotte Brand Philip]], [[William S.

The '''High Altitude Observatory''' ('''HAO''') conducts research and provides support and facilities for the solar-terrestrial research community in the areas of solar and [[heliosphere|heliospheric]] physics, and the effects of solar variability on the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]], and upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=hao&gt;[http://www.hao.ucar.edu/ The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR): Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

HAO is a laboratory of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR). NCAR is managed by the [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] (UCAR), and receives substantial funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name=hao/&gt;

== Mission and vision ==

HAO's mission is to understand the behavior of the Sun and its impact on the Earth, to support, enhance, and extend the capabilities of the university community and the broader scientific community, nationally and internationally, and to foster the transfer of knowledge and technology. As articulated in its Strategic Plan for 2011-2015, HAO's vision is to: Perform world-leading science to understand fundamentally and with predictive capability the sources and nature of solar and geospace variability; Provide scientific leadership and facilities to serve the wider community in common pursuit of these science objectives, and both support and benefit from the NCAR community; Support the education and training of early-career researchers in solar-terrestrial physics and instrumentation; and Provide advocacy for solar-terrestrial physics, promoting its results, and articulating its societal importance, to the rest of NCAR, the NSF, the university community, and the public.

HAO's telescopes are located at its [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]], near the summit of that volcano on the [[Hawaii (island)|big island of Hawaii]]. NCAR's solar observatory shares space on the campus of NOAA's larger [[Mauna Loa Observatory]]. HAO's researchers are based at [[NCAR]] headquarters, in [[Boulder, Colorado]].

== History ==

Walter Orr Roberts was a graduate student under Donald Menzel at Harvard, and helped him set up a solar telescope at the Oak Ridge Station of Harvard College Observatory. In 1939, Menzel located a site for a western station in the Colorado mountains. In his unpublished memoirs, Menzel writes: “I returned the following summer, supervised the building of the observatory and an observer’s residence [on the mining property of Climax Molybdenum Company at Climax, Colorado], and started the installation of the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Remembering Walt Roberts. (1991). University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

“This branch of the Harvard College Observatory informally opened on 8 September 1940 at Climax Colorado (elevation 11,520 ft.). Its sole purpose was to study the sun, using the first coronagraph in the western hemisphere.” &lt;ref&gt;Hallgren, E. L. (1974). The University Corporation for Atmospheric research and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, 1960-1970: An institutional history. University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. (p.55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Roberts and his wife arrived in the summer of 1940, and remained at the observatory for 7 years (throughout WWII and beyond). Menzel continues: “In the summer of 1940, however, Walter and I quickly solved the problems of our coronagraph. After I left, he soon had it working properly. He obtained daily records of the spectrum of the corona, which furnished us with a valuable index of solar activity.

At Climax, Walter Roberts quickly proved observationally what most astronomers had previously suspected, that the corona itself rotated with the same period as the solar surface, in something over twenty-five days. He initiated a study of the fine structure of the solar atmosphere, determining the behavior of what he called “spicules,” a phenomenon that I had myself briefly discussed while at Lick Observatory. These studies formed the basis for his doctorate thesis submitted for the degree a year or two later.” &lt;ref&gt;Hallgren, E. L. (1974). The University Corporation for Atmospheric research and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, 1960-1970: An institutional history. University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. (p.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Work at the observatory was classified during WWII because of its value in predicting radio disturbances from the study of the corona. "The wartime work of the observatory was done under the auspices of the Navy, although overall direction remained in the hands of Harvard.” Post WWII, The National Bureau of Standards contracted the observatory for reports on solar activity. In 1946, CU Boulder became a joint sponsor with Harvard of the observatory, while the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory (CRPL) of the NSB funded HAO's operational costs. The headquarters of HAO was moved to Boulder in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Hallgren, E. L. (1974). The University Corporation for Atmospheric research and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, 1960-1970: An institutional history. University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. (pp.56-59).&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic recombination caused by human activity has been occurring since around 12,000 BC, when humans first began to [[Domestication|domesticate]] organisms. [[Genetic engineering]] as the direct transfer of [[DNA]] from one organism to another was first accomplished by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1972. It was the result of a series of advancements in techniques that allowed the direct modification of the [[genome]]. Important advances included the discovery of [[Restriction enzyme|restriction enzymes]] and [[DNA ligase|DNA ligases]], the ability to design [[Plasmid|plasmids]] and technologies like [[polymerase chain reaction]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]]. [[Transformation (genetics)|Transformation]] of the DNA into a host organism was accomplished with the invention of [[biolistics]], [[Agrobacterium#Uses in biotechnology|''Agrobacterium''-mediated recombination]] and [[microinjection]].

The first [[genetically modified animal]] was a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] created in 1974 by [[Rudolf Jaenisch]]. In 1976 the technology was commercialised, with the advent of [[genetically modified bacteria]] that produced [[somatostatin]], followed by [[insulin]] in 1978. In 1983 an antibiotic resistant gene was inserted into tobacco, leading to the first [[Genetically modified plant|genetically engineered plant]]. Advances followed that allowed scientists to manipulate and add genes to a variety of different organisms and induce a range of different effects. Plants were first commercialized with virus resistant tobacco released in China in 1992. The first [[genetically modified food]] was the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato marketed in 1994. By 2010, 29 countries had planted commercialized biotech crops. In 2000 a paper published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] introduced [[golden rice]], the first food developed with increased nutrient value.

The first evidence of plant domestication comes from [[emmer]] and [[einkorn wheat]] found in [[pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] villages in Southwest Asia dated about 10,500 to 10,100 BC.{{sfn|Zohary||Hopf|Weiss|p=1}}  The [[Fertile Crescent]] of Western Asia, [[Ancient Egyptian Agriculture|Egypt]], and [[History of agriculture in the Indian subcontinent|India]] were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild.

[[Selective breeding]] of domesticated plants was once the main way early farmers shaped organisms to suit their needs. [[Charles Darwin]] described three types of selection: methodical selection, wherein humans deliberately select for particular characteristics; unconscious selection, wherein a characteristic is selected simply because it is desirable; and [[natural selection]], wherein a trait that helps an organism survive better is passed on.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury&gt;
Kingsbury, Noel (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding]. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226437051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}  Early breeding relied on unconscious and natural selection. The introduction of methodical selection is unknown.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|25}} Common characteristics that were bred into domesticated plants include grains that did not shatter to allow easier harvesting, uniform ripening, shorter lifespans that translate to faster growing, loss of toxic compounds, and productivity.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|27–30}} Some plants, like the Banana, were able to be propagated by [[vegetative cloning]]. Offspring often did not contain seeds, and therefore sterile. However, these offspring were usually juicier and larger. Propagation through cloning allows these mutant varieties to be cultivated despite their lack of seeds.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Hybridization was another way that rapid changes in plant's makeup were introduced. It often increased vigor in plants, and combined desirable traits together. Hybridization most likely first occurred when humans first grew similar, yet slightly different plants in close proximity.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|32}} [[Triticum aestivum]], wheat used in baking bread, is an [[allopolyploid]]. Its creation is the result of two separate hybridization events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheatbp.net/WheatBP/Documents/DOC_Evolution.php|title=Evolution of Wheatpublisher=Wheat, the big picture|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128092033/http://www.wheatbp.net/WheatBP/Documents/DOC_Evolution.php|archivedate=2013-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grafting]] can transfer [[chloroplast]]s (specialised DNA in plants that can conduct [[photosynthesis]]), [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitichondrial DNA]] and the entire [[cell nucleus]] containing the [[genome]] to potentially make a new species making grafting a form of natural genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2079813-farmers-may-have-been-accidentally-making-gmos-for-millennia/|title=Farmers may have been accidentally making GMOs for millennia|last=Le Page|first=Michael|date=2016-03-17|website=|publisher=The New Scientist|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-rays were first used to deliberately mutate plants in 1927. Between 1927 and 2007, more than 2,540 genetically mutated plant varieties had been produced using x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schouten | first1 = H.

[[File:Griffith experiment.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Griffith's experiment|Griffith]] proved the existence of a "transforming principle", which [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Avery, MacLeod and McCarty]] later showed to be [[DNA]]]]
[[File:Agrobacterium-tumefaciens.png|thumb|right|The bacterium ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' inserts [[T-DNA]] into infected plant cells, which is then incorporated into the plants [[genome]].]]Various genetic discoveries have been essential in the development of genetic engineering. [[Mendelian inheritance|Genetic inheritance]] was first discovered by [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1865 following experiments crossing peas. Although largely ignored for 34 years he provided the first evidence of hereditary segregation and independent assortment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Genetics|year=1992|volume=131|issue=2|pages=245–25|title=What Did Gregor Mendel Think He Discovered?|author1=Hartl, D.

[[Edward Lawrie Tatum]] and [[George Wells Beadle]] developed the [[central dogma of genetics|central dogma]] that genes code for proteins in 1941. The [[double helix]] structure of DNA was identified by [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] in 1953.

As well as discovering how DNA works, tools had to be developed that allowed it to be manipulated. In 1970 [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith's]] lab discovered [[restriction enzymes]] that allowed DNA to be cut at specific places and separated out on an [[electrophoresis gel]]. This enabled scientists to isolate genes from an organism's genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.

[[Frederick Sanger]] developed a method for sequencing DNA in 1977, greatly increasing the genetic information available to researchers. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, allowed small sections of DNA to be amplified and aided identification and isolation of genetic material.

As well as manipulating the DNA, techniques had to be developed for its insertion (known as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]) into an organism's genome. Griffiths experiment had already shown that some bacteria had [[natural competence|the ability to naturally take up and express foreign DNA]]. Artificial competence was induced in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' in 1970 when [[Morton Mandel]] and [[Akiko Higa]] showed that it could take up [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage λ]] after treatment with calcium chloride solution (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(70)90051-3 |title = Calcium-dependent bacteriophage DNA infection | last = Mandel | first = Morton |author2=Higa, Akiko  | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | year= 1970| volume = 53 |issue = 1 |pages = 15962|pmid = 4922220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Stanley Cohen showed that CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment was also effective for uptake of plasmid DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.8.2110| title = Non chromosomal Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria: Genetic Transformation of Escherichia coli by R-Factor DNA| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 69| issue = 8| pages = 2110–14| year = 1972| last1 = Cohen | first1 = S.

[[File:Paul Berg in 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Berg]] created the first [[recombinant DNA]] molecules in 1972.]]
In 1972 [[Paul Berg]] used restriction enzymes and DNA ligases to create the first [[recombinant DNA]] molecules. He combined DNA from the  monkey virus [[SV40]] with that of the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.10.2904| title = Biochemical Method for Inserting New Genetic Information into DNA of Simian Virus 40: Circular SV40 DNA Molecules Containing Lambda Phage Genes and the Galactose Operon of Escherichia coli| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 69| issue = 10| pages = 2904–09| year = 1972| last1 = Jackson | first1 = D.

Cohen was researching plasmids, while Boyers work involved restriction enzymes. They recognised the complementary nature of their work and teamed up in 1972. Together they found a restriction enzyme that cut the [[pSC101]] plasmid at a single point and were able to insert and ligate a gene that conferred resistance to the [[kanamycin]] antibiotic into the gap. Cohen had previously devised a method where bacteria could be induced to take up a plasmid and using this they were able to create a bacteria that survived in the presence of the kanamycin. This represented the first genetically modified organism. They repeated experiments showing that other genes could be expressed in bacteria, including one from the toad [[Xenopus laevis]], the first cross kingdom transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1973_Boyer.php|title=Genome and genetics timeline – 1973|publisher=Genome news network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Genetics: Genetic Engineering Timeline|last=Arnold|first=Paul|year=2009|url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/genetics/articles/21983.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cohen, Stanley N. |author2=Chang, Annie C.

In 2010 scientists at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] announced that they had created the first synthetic bacterial [[genome]]. The researchers added the new genome to bacterial cells and selected for cells that contained the new genome. To do this the cells undergoes a process called resolution, where during bacterial cell division one new cell receives the original DNA genome of the bacteria, whilst the other receives the new synthetic genome. When this cell replicates it uses the synthetic genome as its template. The resulting bacterium the researchers developed, named [[Synthia]], was the world's first [[synthetic life]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1190719 |title=Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome |year=2010 |last1=Gibson |first1=D.

In 2015 [[CRISPR]] and [[TALENs]] was used to modify plant genomes. Chinese labs used it to create a fungus-resistant wheat and boost rice yields, while a U.K. group used it to tweak a barley gene that could help produce drought-resistant varieties. When used to precisely remove material from DNA without adding genes from other species, the result is not subject the lengthy and expensive regulatory process associated with GMOs. While CRISPR may use foreign DNA to aid the editing process, the second generation of edited plants contain none of that DNA. Researchers celebrated the acceleration because it may allow them to "keep up" with rapidly evolving pathogens. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stated that some examples of gene-edited corn, potatoes and soybeans are not subject to existing regulations. As of 2016 other review bodies had yet to make statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600765/10-breakthrough-technologies-2016-precise-gene-editing-in-plants/|title=10 Breakthrough Technologies 2016: Precise Gene Editing in Plants|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-08 |date=March 2016 |first=David |last=Talbot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="865">An '''intracule''' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mathematical function for the two electron density which depends not upon the absolute values of position or momentum but rather upon their relative values. Its use is leading to new methods in [[physics]] and [[computational chemistry]] to investigate the [[electronic structure]] of molecules and solids. These methods are a development of [[Density functional theory]] (DFT), but with the two electron density replacing the one electron density.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Islamic hygienical jurisprudence''' includes a number of regulations involving cleanliness during [[Salah|''salat'']] (obligatory prayer) through [[Wudu]] and [[Ghusl]], as well as [[Islamic dietary laws|dietary laws]] and [[Islamic toilet etiquette|toilet etiquette]] for [[Islam|Muslims]]. The ''fiqh'' is based on admonitions in the [[Qur'an]] for Muslims to be ritually clean whenever possible, as well as in [[Hadith|hadith]] (words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]). 

Cleanliness is an important part of Islam, including Qur'anic verses that teach how to achieve [[Ritual purification|ritual cleanliness]]. Keeping [[oral hygiene]] through cleaning the [[Tooth|teeth]] with the use of a form of [[toothbrush]] called [[miswak]] is considered [[sunnah]], the way of Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Ritual [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is also very important, as observed by the practices of [[wudu]] (partial ablution), [[ghusl]] (full ablution), and [[tayammum]] (water-free alternative using any natural surface such as rock, sand, or dust). 

In Muslim countries, bathrooms are often equipped with a [[Muslim shower]] situated next to the toilet, so that individuals may wash themselves properly. This [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is required in order to maintain ritual cleanliness.  The common Muslims practice of taking off shoes when entering mosques and homes is also based on ritual cleanliness.

==Islamic cleanliness and hygiene==
[[Sunni Islam]] has its own hygienical jurisprudence. It is preferable for a Sunni Muslim to remove the hair directly below the navel and under the arms also as trimming the nails once a week. Leaving hair and nails is permissible after 15 days and disliked after 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunnah.com/urn/204970|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification  - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best day for removing needless hair and cutting nails is Friday. It is permissible to use shaving cream to remove needless hair. Needless hair and nails should be buried to prevent illnesses from spreading. Cutting [[eyebrow]]s is permissible if they are too long. Sunni women should put their nails and hair removed from the head, below the navel and under the arms in a place where no non-permissible man can see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sunnah of Trimming Hair / Nails - ZIKR|url = http://www.zikr.co.uk/content/view/69/110/|website = www.zikr.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal grooming]] is also a matter of focus in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9037|title=Ruling on trimming hair|work=Islam QA|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing a [[beard]] to grow while trimming the moustache is emphasized with it being seen as [[Fard|mandatory]] by all respected Sunni scholars from the four major Sunni [[Madh'hab]].

==Islamic dietary laws==
{{Main|Islamic dietary laws}}
'''Islamic dietary laws''' provide a set of rules as to what Muslims eat in their diet. These rules specify the food that is '''[[halal|halāl]]''', meaning lawful. They are found in Qur'an, the holy book of [[Islam]], usually detailing what is unlawful, or '''[[haraam|harām]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icv.org.au/about/about-islam-overview/what-is-halal-a-guide-for-non-muslims/|title=What is Halal? A Guide for Non-Muslims {{!}} Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|work=Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic genitalia hygiene==
Urine is forbidden to be on a Muslim during prayer times, as it is considered dirty. The [[foreskin]] is a possible spot where urine can accumulate. [[Circumcision]] is used to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/2/65|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic toilet etiquette==
{{Main|Islamic toilet etiquette}}
The [[Islam]]ic faith has particular rules regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code is known as ''Qadaahul Haajah''.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Shu'aib |first=Tajuddin B. |work=The Prescribed Prayer Made Simple |title=Qadaahul Haajah (Relieving Oneself) |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/surgeons-perform-delicate-operation-for-muslims-124083.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|title=Surgeons perform delicate operation for Muslims|date=April 8, 2007|author=Niamh Horan|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of laterality, such as whether one uses the left or right hand and the foot used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC|year=1992|title=The Tao of Islam|author=Sachiko Murata|isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8|chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands especially after using the toilet which is mentioned in verse 5:6.

Examples of these rules include, but are not limited to:

* It is strongly forbidden to make the toilet close to the flowing waters, or to be by flowing water whilst relieving yourself.
* It is more preferable to step into the bathroom area with the left leg and step outside the bathroom area with the right leg.
* One should remain silent whilst on the toilet. Talking, answering greetings or greeting others is heavily disliked.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* One should not face nor turn one's back on [[Qibla]] (the direction Muslims face to pray) whilst relieving oneself.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* When leaving the toilet one should also say a prayer, "O Allah! Bestow your forgiveness upon me."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* Use of [[toilet paper]] is acceptable, but [[Anal cleansing|washing with water]] is still needed for purity and to minimize germs present in feces from touching the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Israr Hasan |year=2006 |title=Muslims in America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k5J493fDF38C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;vq=odd |isbn=978-1-4259-4243-4 |page=144 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light-time correction''' is a displacement in the ''[[apparent place|apparent position]]'' of a celestial object from its ''true position'' (or ''geometric position'') caused by the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer.

Light-time correction occurs in principle during the observation of any moving object, because the [[speed of light]] is finite. The magnitude and direction of the displacement in position depends upon the distance of the object from the observer and the motion of the object, and is measured at the instant at which the object's light reaches the observer. It is ''independent'' of the motion of the observer. It should be contrasted with the [[aberration of light]], which depends upon the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the observer at the time of observation, and is independent of the motion or distance of the object.

Light-time correction can be applied to any object whose distance and motion are known. In particular, it is usually necessary to apply it to the motion of a [[planet]] or other [[solar system]] object. For this reason, the combined displacement of the apparent position due to the effects of light-time correction and aberration is known as ''planetary aberration''. By convention, light-time correction is not applied to the positions of stars, because their [[proper motion|motion]] and distance may not be known accurately.

==Calculation==

A calculation of light-time correction usually involves an [[iteration|iterative]] process. An approximate light-time is calculated by dividing the object's geometric distance from [[Earth]] by the speed of light. Then the object's velocity is multiplied by this approximate light-time to determine its approximate displacement through space during that time. Its previous position is used to calculate a more precise light-time. This process is repeated as necessary. For planetary motions, a few (3–5) iterations are sufficient to match the accuracy of the underlying [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]].

==Discovery==

The effect of the finite speed of light on observations of celestial objects was first recognised by [[Ole Rømer]] in 1675, during a series of observations of [[eclipse]]s of the [[moons of Jupiter|moons]] of [[Jupiter]]. He found that the interval between eclipses was less when Earth and Jupiter are approaching each other, and more when they are moving away from each other. He correctly deduced that this difference was caused by the appreciable time it took for light to travel from Jupiter to the observer on Earth.

A '''Bible dictionary''' is a reference work containing encyclopedic entries related to the [[Bible]], typically concerning people, places, customs, doctrine and [[Biblical criticism]]. Bible dictionaries can be scholarly or popular in tone.

The first dictionary of the Bible in English was the ''Christian Dictionarie'' (1612) of [[Thomas Wilson (lexicographer)|Thomas Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=29689|title=Wilson, Thomas|first=Stephen|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44941">This is an outline of [[exegesis|commentaries and commentators]]. Discussed are the salient points of Jewish, patristic, medieval, and modern commentaries on the Bible. The article includes discussion of the [[Targums]], [[Mishna]], and [[Talmuds]], which are not regarded as Bible commentaries in the modern sense of the word, but which provide the foundation for later commentary. With the exception of these classical Jewish works, this article focuses on Christian Biblical commentaries; for more on Jewish Biblical commentaries, see [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]].

==Jewish commentaries==
{{Main|Jewish commentaries on the Bible}}

===Philo===
A visitor to Alexandria at the time when [[Christ]] was preaching in [[Galilee]] would find there and in its vicinity Jews using the [[Septuagint]] as their Bible, and could enter their Great Synagogue. Whoever had not seen it was not supposed to have beheld the glory of [[Israel]]. The members of their [[Sanhedrin]], according to Sukkah, were seated on seventy-one golden thrones valued at tens of thousands of talents of gold; and the building was so vast that a flag had to be waved to show the people when to respond. At the head of this assembly, on the highest throne, was seated [[Alexander the Alabarch]], the brother of Philo.

Philo himself was a man of wealth and learning, who mingled with all classes of men and frequented the theatre and the great library. Equally at home in the Septuagint and the Greek classics, he was struck and perplexed by the many beautiful and noble thoughts contained in the latter, which could bear comparison with many passages of the Bible. As this difficulty must have frequently presented itself to the minds of his coreligionists, he endeavoured to meet it by saying that all that was great in Socrates, [[Plato]], etc. originated with Moses. He set about reconciling [[Pagan]] philosophy with the [[Old Testament]], and for this purpose he made extensive use of the allegorical method of interpretation. He taught that many passages of the Pentateuch were not intended to be taken literally. In fact, he said that they were literally false, but allegorically true.

He did not make the distinction between natural and revealed religion. For example, Pagan systems may have natural religion highly developed, but, from a Judeo-Christian point of view, with much concomitant error. His exegesis served to tide over the difficulty for the time amongst the Hellenistic Jews, and had great influence on [[Origen of Alexandria]] and other Alexandrian Christian writers.

===The Targums===

Farrar, in his "Life of Christ", says that it has been suggested that when Christ visited the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], at twelve years of age, there may have been present among the doctors [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]], once thought the author of the [[Targum Jonathan|Yonathan Targum]], and the venerable teachers [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]], the handers-on of the [[Mishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04157a.htm|title=Commentaries on the Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Targums (the most famous of which is that on the Pentateuch erroneously attributed to Onkelos, a misnomer for [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], according to Abrahams) were the only approach to anything like a commentary on the Bible before the time of Christ. They were interpretative translations or paraphrases from [[Hebrew]] into [[Aramaic]] for the use of the synagogues when, after the [[Babylonian Captivity|Exile]], the people had lost the knowledge of Hebrew. It is doubtful whether any of them were committed to writing before the Christian Era. They are important as indicating the character of the Hebrew text used.

[[Rashi|Shlomo Yitzchaki]] (1040-1105), more commonly known as Rashi ('''RA'''bbi '''SH'''lomo '''I'''tzhaki), was a [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval French]] [[rabbi]] and author of a comprehensive commentary on the [[Talmud]] and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|commentary on the ''Tanakh'']].

===The Mishna and Talmuds===

Hillel and Shammai were the last "pair" of several generations of "pairs" ([[Zugot]]) of teachers. These pairs were the successors of the early scribes who lived after the Exile. These teachers are said to have handed down and expanded the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]], which, according to the uncritical view of many Jews, began with Moses. This Oral Law consists of legal and liturgical interpretations and applications of the Pentateuch. As no part of it was written down, it was preserved by constant repetition (Mishna). On the destruction of Jerusalem several rabbis, learned in this Law, settled at [[Council of Jamnia|Jamnia]], near the sea, twenty-eight miles west of Jerusalem. Jamnia became the headquarters of [[Council of Jamnia|Jewish learning until AD 135]], due to the [[Third Jewish Revolt]]. Then schools were opened at [[Sepphoris]] and [[Tiberias]] to the west of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The rabbis comforted their countrymen by teaching that the study of the Law (Oral as well as Written) took the place of the sacrifices. They devoted their energies to arranging the Unwritten Torah, or Law. One of the most successful at this was [[Rabbi Akiva|Rabbi Akiba]] who took part in the Third Jewish Revolt of [[Simon Bar-Kochba|Bar Kochba]], against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], and lost his life (135). The work of systematization was completed and probably committed to writing by the Jewish patriarch at [[Tiberias]], Rabbi [[Judah haNasi|Jehudah ha-Nasi]] "The Prince" (150-210). He was of noble birth, wealthy, learned, and is called by the Jews "Our Master the Saint" or simply Rabbi par excellence. The compilation made by this Rabbi is the [[Mishna]]. It is written in [[Hebrew Language|Mishnaic Hebrew]], and consists of six great divisions or orders, each division containing, on an average, about ten tractates, each tractate being made up of several chapters. The Mishna may be said to be a compilation of Jewish traditional moral theology, liturgy, law, etc. There were other traditions not embodied in the work of Rabbi, and these are called additional Mishna.

The discussions of later generations of rabbis all centred round the text of the Mishna. Interpreters or "speakers" laboured upon it both in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Babylonia]] (until 500), and the results are comprised in the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Jerusalem]] and Babylonian [[Talmud]]s. The word Talmud means teaching, doctrine. Each Talmud consists of two parts, the Mishna (in Hebrew), in sixty-three tractates, and an explanation of the same ([[Gemara]]), ten or twelve times as long. The explanatory portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is written in [[Western Neo-Aramaic|NeoWestern Aramaic]] and that of the Babylonian Talmud in Eastern [[Aramaic]], which is closely allied to [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. The passages in the Gemara containing additional Mishna are, however, given in New Hebrew. Only thirty-nine tractates of the Mishna have Gemara. The Talmud, then, consists of the Mishna (traditions from 450 BC till 200 AD), together with a commentary thereon, Gemara, the latter being composed about 200-500 AD. Next to the Bible the Babylonian Talmud is the great religious book of orthodox Jews, though the Palestinian Talmud is more highly prized by modern scholars. From the year 500 till the Middle Ages the rabbis (geonim) in Babylonia and elsewhere were engaged in commenting on the Talmud and reconciling it with the Bible. A list of such commentaries is given in ''The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.

===The Midrashim===

Simultaneously with the Mishna and Talmud there grew up a number of [[Midrashim]], or commentaries on the Bible. some of these were legalistic, like the [[halakhic]] sections of the Talmud but the most important were of an edifying, [[homiletics|homiletic]] character ([[Midrash Aggadah]]). These latter, although chronologically later, are important for the corroborative light which they throw on the language of the New Testament. The [[Gospel of St. John]] is seen to be steeped in early Jewish phraseology, and the words of Ps. cix [[Hebrew Bible]] 110], "The Lord said to my Lord", etc. are in one place{{Where|date=July 2011}} applied to the [[Messiah]], as they are in [[Gospel of St. Matthew 22:44]] (referenced from Psalm 110:1), though [[Rashi]] following the Rabbis interpreted the words in the sense of applying them to [[Abraham]].

[[Anan ben David]], a prominent Babylonian Jew in the eighth century, rejected Rabbinism for the written Old Testament and became the founder of the sect known a [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] (a word indicating their preference for the written Bible). This schism produced great energy and ability on both sides. The principal Karaite Bible commentators were [[Nahavendi]] (ninth century); [[Abu al-Faraj Harun]] (ninth century), exegete and Hebrew grammarian; [[Solomon ben Yerucham]] (tenth century); [[Sahal ben Mazliach]] (died 950), Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer; [[Joseph al-Bazir]] (died 930); [[Yefet ben Ali|Japhet ben Ali]], the greatest Karaite commentator of the tenth century; and [[Judah Hadassi]] (died 1160).

===Middle Ages===

[[Saadia Gaon|Saadiah of Fayûm]] (died 892), the most powerful writer against the Karaites, translated the Bible into Arabic and added notes. Besides commentaries on the Bible, Saadiah wrote a systematic treatise bringing revealed religion into harmony with Greek philosophy. He thus became the forerunner of Maimonides and the Catholic Schoolmen.

[[Solomon ben Isaac]], called Rashi (born 1040) wrote very popular explanations of the Talmud and the Bible.

[[Tobiah ben Eliezer]] a [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] scholar and [[paytan]] in 11th century [[Kastoria]] ([[Greece]]), wrote the ''Leḳaḥ Ṭov'' or ''Pesiḳta Zuṭarta'', a [[midrash]]ic commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] and the Five [[Megillot]].

[[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] of Toledo (died 1168) had a good knowledge of Oriental languages and wrote learned commentaries on the Old Testament. He was the first to maintain that Isaiah contains the work of two prophets.

[[Moses Maimonides]] (died 1204), the greatest Jewish scholar of the Middle Ages, of whom his coreligionists said that "from Moses to Moses there was none like Moses", wrote his "Guide to the Perplexed", which was read by [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas]]. He was a great admirer of Aristotle, who was to him the representative of natural knowledge as the Bible was of the supernatural.

There were the two Kimchis, especially David (died 1235) of Narbonne, who was a celebrated grammarian, lexicographer, and commentator inclined to the literal sense. He was followed by Nachmanides of Catalonia (died 1270), a doctor of medicine who wrote commentaries of a cabbalistic tendency; Immanuel of Rome (born 1270); and the Karaites [[Aaron ben Joseph of Constantinople|Aaron ben Joseph]] (1294), and [[Aaron ben Elias]] (fourteenth century).

===Modern===

[[Isaac Abarbanel]] (born [[Lisbon]], 1437; died [[Venice]], 1508) was a statesman and scholar. None of his predecessors came so near the modern ideal of a commentator as he did. He prefixed general introductions to each book, and was the first Jew to make extensive use of Christian commentaries. [[Elias Levita]] (died 1549) and [[Azariah dei Rossi|Azarias de Rossi]] (died 1577) have also to be mentioned.

[[Moses Mendelssohn]] of Berlin (died 1786), a friend of [[Lessing]], translated the Pentateuch into German. His commentaries (in Hebrew) are close, learned, critical, and acute. He had much influence, and was followed by [[Wessely]], [[Jarosław]], [[Herz Homberg|Homberg]], [[Euchel]], [[David Friedländer|Friedlander]], [[Hertz]], [[Herxheimer]], [[Ludwig Philippson]], etc., called "[[Biurists]]", or expositors. The modern liberal school among the Jews is represented by [[Salomon Munk]], [[Samuel David Luzzato]], [[Leopold Zunz]], Geiger, [[Julius Fürst]], etc.

[[Pesach Wolicki|Rabbi Pesach Wolicki]] (born 1970) is a biblical scholar and commentator. His book, ''Cup of Salvation'', also known as ''Cup of Salvation: A Powerful Journey Through King David's Psalms of Praise'', which was published by the [[Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation]] (CJCUC) in 2017, is a devotional biblical commentary on [[Psalms]] 113-118 otherwise known as the [[Hallel]].

==Patristic commentaries==
The history of [[Biblical hermeneutics|Christian exegesis]] may be roughly divided into three periods: the Age of the Fathers, the Age of Catenæ and Scholia (seventh to sixteenth century), and the Age of Modern Commentaries (sixteenth to twentieth century). The earliest known commentary on Christian scriptures was by a [[Gnostic]] named [[Heracleon]] in {{CE|the 170s}}. Most of the patristic commentaries are in the form of homilies, or discourses to the faithful, and range over the whole of Scripture. There are two schools of interpretation, that of Alexandria and that of Antioch.

===Alexandrian School===

The chief writers of the [[Alexandrian School]] were:
* [[Pantænus]],
* [[Clement of Alexandria]],
* [[Origen of Alexandria]],
* [[Dionysius of Alexandria]],
* [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]] the blind priest,
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]], and
* [[Pierius|St. Pierius]].
To these may be added
* [[St. Ambrose]], who, in a moderate degree, adopted their system.

Its chief characteristic was the allegorical method. This was, doubtless, founded on passages in the [[Synoptic Gospels|Gospels]] and the [[Epistles of St. Paul]], but it received a strong impulse from the writings of Alexandrian Jews, especially of Philo.

The great representative of this school was Origen (died 254). Origen was the son of [[Leonides of Alexandria]], himself a saint and martyr. Origen became the master of many great saints and scholars, one of the most celebrated being [[St. Gregory Thaumaturgus]]; he was known as the "[[Wiktionary:Adamantine|Adamantine]]" on account of his incessant application to study, writing, lecturing, and works of piety. He frequently kept seven amanuenses actively employed; it was said he became the author of 6000 works ([[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], Hær., lxiv, 63); according to [[St. Jerome]], who reduced the number to 2000 (Contra. Rufin., ii, 22), he left more writings than any man could read in a lifetime (Ep. xxxiii, ad Paulam). Besides his great labours on the [[Hexapla]] he wrote scholia, homilies, and commentaries on the Old and the New Testament. In his scholia he gave short explanations of difficult passages after the manner of his contemporaries, the annotators of the Greek classics. Most of the scholia, in which he chiefly sought the literal sense, are unfortunately lost, but it is supposed that their substance is embodied in the writings of [[St. John Chrysostom]] and other Fathers. In his other works Origen pushed the allegorical interpretation to the utmost extreme. In spite of this, however, his writings were of great value, and with the exception of St. Augustine, no writer of ancient times had such influence.

===Antiochene School===
{{main|School of Antioch}}

The writers of the Antiochene School disliked the allegorical method, and sought almost exclusively the literal, primary, or historical sense of Holy Scripture. The principal writers of this school were
* [[Lucian of Antioch|St. Lucian]],
* [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]],
* [[Maris of Chalcedon]],
* [[Eudoxius of Antioch|Eudoxius]],
* [[Theognis of Nicaea]],
* Asterius,
* [[Arius]] the heresiarch,
* [[Diodorus of Tarsus|Diodorus]] of Antioch, [[Bishop of Tarsus]], and his three great pupils,
* [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]],
* Theodore's brother [[Polychronius]], and
* St. [[John Chrysostom]]. With these may be counted

The great representatives of this school were Diodorus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and St. John Chrysostom. Diodorus, who died Bishop of Tarsus (394), followed the literal to the exclusion of the mystical or allegorical sense. Theodore was born at Antioch, in 347, became Bishop of Mopsuestia, and died in the communion of the Church, 429. He was a powerful thinker, but an obscure and prolix writer. He felt intense dislike for the mystical sense, and explained the Scriptures in an extremely literal and almost rationalistic manner.

His pupil, [[Nestorius]], became the subject of the Nestorian controversy; the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] translated his books into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and regarded Theodore as their great "Doctor". This made Catholics suspicious of his writings, which were finally condemned after the famous controversy on [[Three Chapter Controversy|The Three Chapters]]. Theodore's commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John's Gospel]], in Syriac, was published, with a Latin translation, by a Catholic scholar, Dr. Chabot.

St. John Chrysostom, priest of Antioch, became Patriarch of [[Constantinople]] in 398. He left homilies on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament.  When St. Thomas Aquinas was asked by one of his brethren whether he would not like to be the owner of [[Paris, France|Paris]], so that he could dispose of it to the [[King of France]] and with the proceeds promote the good works of his order, he answered that he would prefer to be the possessor of Chrysostom's ''Super Matthæum''. [[Isidore of Pelusium|St. Isidore of Pelusium]] said of him that if the Apostle St. Paul could have used [[Attic Greek|Attic speech]] he would have explained his own Epistles in the identical words of St. John Chrysostom.

===Intermediate School===

Other writers combined both these systems, some leaning more to the allegorical and some to the literal sense. The principal contributors were
* [[Isidore of Pelusium]],
* [[Theodoret]],
* [[St. Basil]],
* [[St. Gregory of Nazianzus]],
* [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]],
* [[St. Hilary of Poitiers]],
* [[Ambrosiaster]],
* St. [[Jerome]],
* St. [[Augustine]],
* [[St. Gregory the Great]], and
* [[Pelagius]].

Jerome, besides his translations of Scripture and other works, left many commentaries, in some of which he departed from the literal meaning of the text. At times he did not always indicate when he was quoting from different authors, which according to [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] accounts for his apparent discrepancies.

==Medieval commentaries==
The medieval writers were content to draw from the rich treasures left them by their predecessors. Their commentaries consisted, for the most part, of passages from the Church Fathers, which they connected together as in a chain, a ''[[catena (Biblical commentary)|catena]]''.

===Greek Catenists===

* [[Procopius of Gaza]] (sixth century) was one of the first to write a catena. He was followed by
* [[St. Maximus, Martyr]] (seventh),
* [[St. John Damascene]] (eighth),
* Olympiodorus (tenth),
* [[Oecumenius|Ecumenius]] (tenth),
* [[Nicetas of Constantinople]] (eleventh),
* [[Theophylact of Ohrid|Blessed Theophylactus]], Archbishop in Bulgaria (eleventh),
* [[Euthymius Zigabenus]] (twelfth), and the
* writers of anonymous catenæ edited by [[John Antony Cramer]] and [[Cardinal Mai]].

===Latin Catenists, Scholiasts, etc.===

The principal Latin commentators of this period were the Venerable Bede, Walafrid Strabo, Anselm of Laon, Hugh of Saint-Cher, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Nicholas de Lyra.

The [[Venerable Bede]] (seventh to eighth century), a good Greek and Hebrew scholar, wrote a useful commentary on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament. It is in reality a catena of passages from Greek and Latin Fathers judiciously selected and digested.

[[Walafrid Strabo]] (ninth century), a Benedictine, was credited with the "[[Glossa Ordinaria]]" on the entire Bible. It is a brief explanation of the literal and mystical sense, based on Rabanus Maurus and other Latin writers, and was one of the most popular works during the Middle Ages, being as well known as "The Sentences" of Peter Lombard.

[[Anselm of Laon]], professor at Paris (twelfth century), wrote the ''[[Glossa Interlinearis]]'', so called because the explanation was inserted between the lines of the Vulgate.

[[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] (Hugo de Sancto Caro), thirteenth century), besides his pioneer [[Biblical concordance]], composed a short commentary on the whole of the Scriptures, explaining the literal, allegorical, analogical, and moral sense of the text. His work was called ''Postillæ'', i. e. ''post illa'' (''verba textus''), because the explanation followed the words of the text.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (thirteenth century) left commentaries on Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Epistles of St. Paul, and was the author of the well-known ''Catena Aurea'' on the Gospels. This consists of quotations from over eighty [[Church Fathers]]. He throws much light on the literal sense and is most happy in illustrating difficult points by parallel passages from other parts of the Bible.

[[Nicholas de Lyra]] (thirteenth century), joined the [[Franciscans]] in 1291 and brought to the service of the Church knowledge of Hebrew and rabbinical learning. He wrote short notes or ''Postillæ'' on the entire Bible, and set forth the literal meaning with great ability, especially of the books written in Hebrew. This work was most popular, and in frequent use during the late Middle Ages, and [[Martin Luther]] was indebted to it.

A great impulse was given to exegetical studies by the [[Council of Vienne]] which decreed, in 1311, that chairs of Hebrew, Chaldean, and Arabic should be established at Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca.

Besides the major writers already mentioned the following are some of the principal exegetes, many of them Benedictines, from patristic times till the Council of Trent:

* [[Cassiodorus]] (sixth century);
* [[Isidore of Seville|Saint Isidore of Seville]] (seventh);
* [[Julian of Toledo]] (seventh);
* [[Alcuin]] (eighth);
* [[Rabanus Maurus]] (ninth);
* [[Druthmar]] (ninth);
* [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (ninth);
* [[Bruno of Würzburg]], a distinguished Greek and Hebrew scholar;
* [[Bruno of Cologne|St. Bruno]], founder of the Carthusians (eleventh);
* [[Gilbert of Poitiers]];
* [[Andrew of Saint Victor]] (twelfth);
* [[Rupert of Deutz]] (twelfth);
* [[Alexander of Hales]] (thirteenth);
* [[Albertus Magnus]] (thirteenth);
* [[Paul of Burgos]] (fourteenth to fifteenth);
* [[Alphonsus Tostatus]] of Avila (fifteenth);
* [[Ludolph of Saxony]]; and [[Dionysius the Carthusian]], who wrote a commentary on the whole of the Bible;
* [[Jacobus Faber Stapulensis]] (fifteenth to sixteenth);
* [[Gagnaeus]] (fifteenth to sixteenth).
* [[Erasmus]] and [[Cardinal Cajetan]] (sixteenth).

==Modern Catholic commentaries==

The influx of Greek scholars into Italy after the fall of Constantinople, the Christian and anti-Christian Renaissance, the invention of printing, the controversial excitement caused by the rise of Protestantism, and the publication of polyglot Bibles by Cardinal Ximenes and others, gave renewed interest in the study of the Bible among Catholic scholars. Controversy showed them the necessity of devoting more attention to the literal meaning of the text, according to the wise principle laid down by St. Thomas in the beginning of his "Summa Theologica".

It was then that the Jesuits, founded in 1534, stepped into the front rank to counter the attacks on the Catholic Church. The Ratio Studiorum of the Jesuits made it incumbent on their professors of Scripture to acquire a mastery of Greek, Hebrew, and other Oriental languages. [[Alfonso Salmeron]], one of the first companions of [[Ignatius Loyola]], and the pope's theologian at the Council of Trent, was a distinguished Hebrew scholar and voluminous commentator. [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], one of the first Christians to write a Hebrew grammar, composed a valuable commentary on the [[Psalms]], giving an exposition of the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Vulgate texts. It was published as part of [[Cornelius a Lapide]]'s commentary on the whole Bible. Cornelius a Lapide, S. J. (born 1566), was a native of the Low Countries, and was well versed in Greek and Hebrew. During forty years he devoted himself to teaching and to the composition of his great work, which has been highly praised by Protestants as well as Catholics.

[[Juan Maldonato]], a Spanish Jesuit, born 1584, wrote commentaries on Isaias, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, Psalms, Proverbs, Canticles (Song of Solomon), and Ecclesiastes. His best work, however, is his Latin commentary on the Four Gospels, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the best ever written. When Maldonato was teaching at the University of Paris the hall was filled with eager students before the lecture began, and he had frequently to speak in the open air.

Great as was the merit of the work of Maldonato, it was equalled by the commentary on the Epistles by [[Estius]] (born at Gorcum, Holland, 1542), a secular priest, and superior of the College at Douai. These two works are still of the greatest help to the student.

Many other Jesuits were the authors of valuable exegetical works, e.g.:
* [[Francis Ribera of Castile]] (born 1514);
* [[Francisco de Toledo (Cardinal)|Cardinal Toletus]] of Cordova (born 1532);
* [[Manuel de Sá]] (died 1596);
* [[Bonfrère of Dinant]] (born 1573);
* [[Mariana of Talavera]] (born 1537);
* [[Luis del Alcázar|Alcazar of Seville]] (born 1554);
* [[Barradius]] "the Apostle of Portugal";
* [[Sánchez of Alcalá]] (died 1628);
* [[Nicholas Serarius]] of Lorraine (died 1609);
* [[Lorinus of Avignon]] (born 1559);
* [[Tirinus of Antwerp]] (born 1580);
* [[Menochius of Pavia]];
* [[Pereira of Valencia]] (died 1610); and
* [[Pineda of Seville]].

The Jesuits were rivalled by
* [[Arias Montanus]] (died 1598), the editor of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible;
* [[Sixtus of Siena]], O. P. (died 1569);
* [[Johann Wild]] (Ferus), O. S. F.;
* [[Dominic Soto]], O. P. (died 1560);
* [[Andreas Masius]] (died 1573);
* [[Jansen of Ghent]] (died 1576);
* [[Génébrard of Cluny]] (died 1597);
* [[Antonio Agelli]] (died 1608);
* [[Luke of Bruges]] (died 1619);
* [[Calasius]], O. S. F. (died 1620);
* [[Malvenda]], O. P. (died 1628);
* [[Jansen of Ypres]]
* [[Simeon de Muis]] (died 1644);
* [[Jean Morin (theologian)|Jean Morin]], Oratorian (died 1659);
* [[Isaac Le Maistre]] (de Sacy);
* [[John Sylveira]], Carmelite (died 1687);
* [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (died 1704);
* [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], Oratorian (died 1712);
* [[Calmet]], Benedictine, who wrote a valuable dictionary of the Bible, of which there is an English translation, and a highly esteemed commentary on all the books of Scripture (died 1757);
* [[Louis de Carrières]], Oratorian (died 1717);
* [[Piconio]], Capuchin (died 1709);
* [[Bernard Lamy (mathematician)|Bernard Lamy]], Oratorian (died 1715);
* [[Pierre Guarin]], O. S. B. (died 1729);
* [[Charles François Houbigant|Houbigant]], Oratorian (died 1783);
* [[William Smits]], Recollect (1770);
* [[Jacques Le Long]], Oratorian (died 1721);
* [[Dominikus von Brentano]] (died 1797).

It's based on Russian Synodal Translation, its authors apply to ancient sources of the text ([[Masoretic Text]], [[Septuagint]], etc.). At the present time, is the only full Russian Orthodox Bible commentary on both canonical and deuterocanonical books of the Scripture. The Lopukhin Bible was republished in 1987 by Biblical Societies of Northern Europe countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ekzeget.ru/tolk_info.php?tolk=%D2%EE%EB%EA%EE%E2%E0%FF%20%C1%E8%E1%EB%E8%FF%20%C0.%CF.%20%CB%EE%EF%F3%F5%E8%ED%E0|title=Толковая Библия А.П.

The opinions of the English rationalists were disseminated on the Continent by [[Voltaire]] and others. In Germany the ground was prepared by the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)#Philosophy|Wolff]] and the writings of his disciple [[Johann Salomo Semler|Semler]]. The posthumous writings of [[Hermann Samuel Reimarus|Reimarus]] were published by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] between 1774-78 (''The Fragments of Wolfenbüttel''). Lessing pretended that the author was unknown. According to the "Fragments", Moses, Christ, and the Apostles were impostors. Lessing was vigorously attacked, especially by Goeze. [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn|Eichhorn]], in his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (Leipzig 1780-83, 3 vols.), maintained that the Scriptures were genuine productions, but that, as the Jews saw the intervention of God in the most ordinary natural occurrences, the miracles should be explained naturally.

[[Heinrich Paulus]] (1761–1850), following the lead of Eichhorn, applied to the Gospels the naturalistic method of explaining miracles. G. L Bauer, Heyne (died 1812), and Creuzer denied the authenticity of the greater portion of the Pentateuch and compared it to the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. The greatest advocate of such views was [[Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette|de Wette]] (1780–1849), a pupil of Paulus. In his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (1806) he maintained that the miraculous narratives of the Old Testament were popular legends, which in the course of centuries, became transformed and transfused with the marvellous and the supernatural, and were finally committed to writing in perfectly good faith.

[[David Strauss]] (1808–74) applied this mythical explanation to the Gospels.&lt;ref name=Strauss&gt;{{cite book | author = David Strauss  |title = The Life of Jesus Critically Examined (translated into English by Marian Evans 1860 | publisher = Calvin Blanchard | year = 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed most clearly, that if with Paulus the Gospels are allowed to be authentic, the attempt to explain the miracles naturally breaks down completely. Strauss rejected the authenticity and regarded the miraculous accounts in the Gospels as naive legends, the productions of the pious imaginations of the early generations of Christians.

The views of Strauss were severely criticized by the Catholics, Kuhn, Mack, Hug, and Sepp, and by the Protestants Neander, Tholuck, Ullman, Lange, Ewald, Riggenbach, Weiss, and Keim.

Baur originated a theory which was for a time in great vogue, but which was afterwards abandoned by the majority of critics. He held that the New Testament contains the writings of two antagonistic parties amongst the Apostles and early Christians. His principal followers were [[Eduard Zeller|Zeller]], [[Albert Schwegler|Schwegler]], [[Gottlieb Jakob Planck|Planck]], [[Köslin (theologian)|Köslin]], [[Ritsch]], [[Adolf Bernhard Christoph Hilgenfeld|Hilgenfeld]], Volkmar, Tobler, [[Karl Theodor Keim|Keim]], [[Hosten (theologian)|Hosten]], some of whom, however, emancipated themselves from their master.

* Beyschlag,
* [[H. Holtzmann]], and his collaborators
* Schmiedel, von Soden
{{col-end}}

Holtzmann, while practically admitting the authenticity of the Gospels, especially of St. Mark, explains away the miracles. He believes that miracles do not happen, and that the scripture are merely echoes of Old Testament miracle stories.  Holtzmann was severely taken to task by several writers in the "International Critical Commentary". The activity of so many acute minds has thrown great light on the language and literature of the Bible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">'''MOF Model to Text Transformation Language''' ('''Mof2Text''' or '''MOFM2T''') is an [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) specification for a [[model transformation language]]. Specifically, it can be used to express transformations which transform a model into text (M2T), for example a [[platform-specific model]] into [[source code]] or [[documentation]]. MOFM2T is one part of OMG's [[Model-driven architecture]] (MDA) and reuses many concepts of [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]], OMG's metamodeling architecture. Whereas MOFM2T is used for expressing M2T transformations, OMG's [[QVT]] is used for expressing M2M transformations.

'''Medical microbiology ''', the large subset of [[microbiology]] that is [[applied science|applied]] to [[medicine]], is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of [[infection|infectious disease]]s.  In addition, this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health.  There are four kinds of [[microorganism]]s that cause infectious disease: [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[Parasitism|parasites]] and [[virus]]es, and one type of infectious protein called  [[prion]].

A medical [[microbiologist]] studies the characteristics of [[pathogen]]s, their modes of transmission, mechanisms of infection and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/10/3465.full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803235551/http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/10/3465.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this information, a treatment can be devised.  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for [[physicians]], providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options.
Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially [[virulent]] or resistant strains of microbes, educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices.  They may also assist in preventing or controlling [[epidemics]] and outbreaks of disease.
Not all medical microbiologists study microbial [[pathology]]; some study common, non-pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop [[antibiotics]] or other treatment methods.

[[Epidemiology]], the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of [[health]] and [[disease]] conditions in populations, is an important part of medical microbiology, although the clinical aspect of the field primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals, their effects on the human body, and the methods of treating those infections. In this respect the entire field, as an applied science, can be conceptually subdivided into academic and clinical subspecialties, although in reality there is a fluid continuum between '''public health microbiology''' and '''clinical microbiology''', just as the state of the art in [[medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]] depends on continual improvements in academic medicine and [[research institute|research laboratories]]. 

==History ==
[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe microorganisms using a microscope.]]
In 1676, [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] observed bacteria and other microorganisms, using a single-lens [[microscope]] of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Frank N. Egerton |date=2006| doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2006)87[47:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2| volume=87| pages=47| title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 19: Leeuwenhoek's Microscopic Natural History| journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]] developed a method using [[cowpox]] to successfully immunize a child against smallpox.  The same principles are used for developing [[vaccines]] today.

Following on from this, in 1857 [[Louis Pasteur]] also designed vaccines against several diseases such as [[anthrax]], fowl [[cholera]] and [[rabies]] as well as [[pasteurization]] for food preservation.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | editor = Madigan M| editor2 = Martinko J | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 13th | publisher = Pearson Education | date = 2006 | isbn = 0-321-73551-X |page = 1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] is considered to be the father of [[antiseptic]] surgery.  By sterilizing the instruments with diluted [[carbolic acid]] and using it to clean wounds, post-operative infections were reduced, making surgery safer for patients.

In the years between 1876 and 1884 [[Robert Koch]] provided much insight into infectious diseases. He was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in [[Microbiological culture|pure culture]].  This gave rise to the [[germ theory]], a certain microorganism being responsible for a certain disease. He developed a series of criteria around this that have become known as the [[Koch's postulates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=Brock TD |author-link=Thomas D. Brock |date=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major milestone in medical microbiology is the [[Gram stain]]. In 1884 [[Hans Christian Gram]] developed the method of staining bacteria to make them more visible and differentiable under a microscope. This technique is widely used today.

In 1929 [[Alexander Fleming]] developed the most commonly used antibiotic substance both at the time and now: [[penicillin]].

[[DNA sequencing]], a method developed by [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[Frederick Sanger]] in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR (1977) DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors" ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 74:5463-5467.&lt;/ref&gt; caused a rapid change the development of [[vaccine]]s, medical treatments and diagnostic methods. Some of these include synthetic [[insulin]] which was produced in 1979 using [[recombinant DNA]] and the first genetically engineered vaccine was created in 1986 for [[hepatitis B]].

In 1995 a team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] sequenced the first bacterial [[genome]]; ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann R, Adams M, White O, Clayton R, Kirkness E, Kerlavage A, Bult C, Tomb J, Dougherty B, Merrick J, al. e (1995) Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd" ''Science'' 269:496-512.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few months later, the first [[eukaryotic]] genome was completed. This would prove invaluable for diagnostic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott LM, Harley JP, Klein DA (2005) Microbiology: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and transmission of infectious diseases ==
{{See also|Infection}}

Infections may be caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], and [[parasite]]s. The pathogen that causes the disease may be exogenous (acquired from an external source; environmental, animal or other people, e.g. [[Influenza]]) or endogenous (from normal flora e.g. [[candidiasis]]).&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book| last=Washington| first=JA| editor-first=S| editor-last=Baron| title=Medical Microbiology| edition=4th| publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston| date=1996| chapter=10 Principles of Diagnosis| isbn=0-9631172-1-1| chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8014/| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613091205/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8014/| archivedate=2016-06-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site at which a microbe enters the body is referred to as the portal of entry.&lt;ref name=Bittar&gt;{{cite book |last=Siebeling|first=RJ|editor-first=E, B |editor-last=Bittar, Neville |title=Microbiology| publisher = Elsevier| date = 1998|chapter=Chapter 7 Principles of bacterial pathogenesis | isbn = 1-55938-814-5|page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[respiratory tract]], [[GI tract|gastrointestinal tract]], [[genitourinary tract]], [[skin]], and [[mucous membranes]].&lt;ref name=Rhinehart&gt;{{cite book | author = Rhinehart E| author2 = Friedman M| title = Infection control in home care| publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning| date = 1999 | isbn = 0-8342-1143-2|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portal of entry for a specific microbe is normally dependent on how it travels from its natural habitat to the host.&lt;ref name=Bittar /&gt;

There are various ways in which disease can be transmitted between individuals. 
These include:&lt;ref name=Bittar /&gt;
* Direct contact - Touching an infected host, including [[Transmission (medicine)#Sexual transmission|sexual contact]]
* Indirect contact - Touching a contaminated surface
* [[Transmission (medicine)#Droplet contact|Droplet contact]] - Coughing or sneezing
* [[Fecal–oral route]] - Ingesting contaminated food or water sources
* Airborne transmission - Pathogen carrying [[Spore#Dispersal|spores]]
* [[Vector borne transmission|Vector transmission]] - An organism that does not cause disease itself but transmits infection by conveying pathogens from one host to another 
* [[Fomite|Fomite transmission]] - An inanimate object or substance capable of carrying infectious germs or parasites
* Environmental - Hospital-acquired infection ([[Nosocomial|Nosocomial infections]])

Like other pathogens, viruses use these methods of transmission to enter the body, but viruses differ in that they must also enter into the host's actual cells. Once the virus has gained access to the host's cells, the virus' genetic material ([[RNA]] or [[DNA]]) must be [[Viral replication|introduced to the cell]].  Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them. Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts RJ, "Fish pathology, 3rd Edition", Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baron1&gt;{{cite book|last=Roizman|first=B|editor-first=S|editor-last=Baron|title=Medical Microbiology|edition=4th|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|date=1996|chapter=42 Multiplication|isbn=0-9631172-1-1|chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511212551/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/|archivedate=2018-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms for infection, proliferation, and persistence of a virus in cells of the host are crucial for its survival. For example, some diseases such as [[measles]] employ a strategy whereby it must spread to a series of hosts. In these forms of viral infection, the illness is often treated by the [[Cell-mediated immunity|body's own immune response]], and therefore the virus is required to disperse to new hosts before it is destroyed by [[Immune system|immunological resistance]] or host death.&lt;ref name= Hilleman&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hilleman M| title= Strategies and mechanisms for host and pathogen survival in acute and persistent viral infections| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| volume=101| pages=14560–14566| date=October 2004| doi=10.1073/pnas.0404758101| pmc=521982| pmid=15297608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, some infectious agents such as the [[Feline leukemia virus]], are able to withstand immune responses and are capable of achieving long-term residence within an individual host, whilst also retaining the ability to spread into successive hosts.&lt;ref name= Greggs&gt;{{cite journal |author = Greggs WM| author2 = Clouser CL |author3 = Patterson SE|author4 = Manksy LM| title= Discovery of drugs that possess activity against feline leukemia virus| journal= Journal of General Virology| volume=93| issue=4| pages=900–905| date=April 2012| doi=10.1099/vir.0.039909-0 |url=http://jgv.sgmjournals.org/content/93/Pt_4/900.full|pmc=3542715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnostic tests ==
{{main|Diagnostic microbiology}}
Identification of an infectious agent for a minor illness can be as simple as clinical presentation; such as [[gastrointestinal disease]] and skin infections.  In order to make an educated estimate as to which microbe could be causing the disease, epidemiological factors need to be considered; such as the patient's likelihood of exposure to the suspected organism and the presence and prevalence of a microbial strain in a community.

Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by consulting the patient's medical history and conducting a physical examination. More detailed identification techniques involve [[microbial culture]], [[microscopy]], [[Infectious disease#Biochemical tests|biochemical tests]] and [[genotyping]]. Other less common techniques (such as [[X-rays]], [[CAT scans]], [[PET scans]] or [[NMR]]) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent.

=== Microbial culture ===
[[Image:K pneumoniae M morganii providencia styphimuriuma.JPG|thumb|200px|Four [[nutrient agar]] plates growing colonies of common [[Gram negative]] bacteria.]]
[[Microbiological culture]] is the primary method used for isolating infectious disease for study in the laboratory. Tissue or fluid samples are tested for the presence of a specific [[pathogen]], which is determined by growth in a selective or differential [[Growth medium|medium]].

The 3 main types of media used for testing are:&lt;ref name=Nester&gt;{{cite book | author = Nester E| author2 = Anderson D| author3 = Evans Roberts, C | author4=Nester M| title = Microbiology: A human perspective| publisher = McGraw Hill| date = 2009 | isbn = 1-55938-814-5|pages = 336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solid culture: A solid surface is created using a mixture of nutrients, salts and [[agar]]. A single microbe on an agar plate can then grow into colonies (clones where cells are identical to each other) containing thousands of cells. These are primarily used to culture bacteria and fungi.
* Liquid culture: Cells are grown inside a liquid media. Microbial growth is determined by the time taken for the liquid to form a [[colloidal suspension]]. This technique is used for diagnosing parasites and detecting [[mycobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Møller"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Møller M| author2= El Maghrabi R| author3= Olesen N|author4= Thomsen VØ| title=Safe inoculation of blood and bone marrow for liquid culture detection of mycobacteria| journal=Occupational Medicine |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=530–3 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15520021 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqh106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cell culture: Human or animal [[cell culture]]s are infected with the microbe of interest. These cultures are then observed to determine the effect the microbe has on the cells. This technique is used for identifying viruses.

=== Microscopy ===
[[Microbiological culture|Culture techniques]] will often use a microscopic examination to help in the identification of the microbe. Instruments such as [[compound light microscope]]s can be used to assess critical aspects of the organism. This can be performed immediately after the sample is taken from the patient and is used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques, allowing for resolution of cellular features. [[Electron microscopes]] and [[fluorescence microscope]]s are also used for observing microbes in greater detail for research.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan MT (2009) Brock Biology of Microorganisms: Pearson/Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biochemical tests ===
Fast and relatively simple [[Infectious disease#Biochemical tests|biochemical tests]] can be used to identify infectious agents. For bacterial identification, the use of [[metabolic]] or enzymatic characteristics are common due to their ability to ferment [[carbohydrates]] in patterns characteristic of their [[genus]] and [[species]]. Acids, alcohols and gases are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in [[Growth Medium|selective liquid or solid media]], as mentioned above. In order to perform these tests en masse, automated machines are used.  These machines perform multiple biochemical tests simultaneously, using cards with several wells containing different dehydrated chemicals.  The microbe of interest will react with each chemical in a specific way, aiding in its identification.

[[Serological]] methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid laboratory tests used to identify different types of microorganisms. The tests are based upon the ability of an [[antibody]] to bind specifically to an [[antigen]]. The antigen (usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent) is bound by the antibody, allowing this type of test to be used for organisms other than bacteria. This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be easily and definitively observed, depending on the test. More complex serological techniques are known as [[immunoassays]]. Using a similar basis as described above, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or the proteins generated by an infected host in response to the infection.&lt;ref name=Nester/&gt;

=== Polymerase chain reaction ===

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) assays are the most commonly used molecular technique to detect and study microbes.&lt;ref name=Mackay&gt;{{cite book | author = Mackay I | title = Real-time PCR in Microbiology: From Diagnosis to Characterisation| publisher = Horizon Scientific Press  | date = 2007 | isbn = 9781904455189|pages = 1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to other methods, sequencing and analysis is definitive, reliable, accurate, and fast.&lt;ref name=Viljoen&gt;{{cite book | editor = Viljoen GJ| editor2 = Nel LH| editor3 = Crowther JR | title = Molecular Diagnostic PCR Handbook| publisher = Springer| date = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4020-3404-6 |page = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[quantitative PCR]] is the primary technique used, as this method provides faster data compared to a standard PCR assay. For instance, traditional PCR techniques require the use of [[gel electrophoresis]] to visualize amplified DNA molecules after the reaction has finished. [[quantitative PCR]] does not require this, as the detection system uses [[Fluorometer|fluorescence]] and [[DNA probe|probes]] to detect the DNA molecules as they are being amplified.&lt;ref name=Tang&gt;{{cite book | author = Tang YW| author2 = Persing DH| title = Encyclopedia of Microbiology| publisher = Oxford Academic Press  | date = 2009 | isbn =  978-0-12-373944-5 |pages = 308–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, [[quantitative PCR]] also removes the risk of contamination that can occur during standard PCR procedures (carrying over PCR product into subsequent PCRs).&lt;ref name=Mackay /&gt; Another advantage of using PCR to detect and study microbes is that the DNA sequences of newly discovered infectious microbes or strains can be compared to those already listed in databases, which in turn helps to increase understanding of which organism is causing the infectious disease and thus what possible methods of treatment could be used.&lt;ref name=Viljoen /&gt; This technique is the current standard for detecting viral infections such as [[AIDS]] and [[hepatitis]].

== Treatments ==

Once an infection has been diagnosed and identified, suitable treatment options must be assessed by the physician and consulting medical microbiologists. Some infections can be dealt with by the body's own [[immune system]], but more serious infections are treated with [[antimicrobial]] drugs. [[Pathogenic bacteria|Bacterial infections]] are treated with [[antibacterials]] (often called antibiotics) whereas [[Mycosis|fungal]] and [[Viral disease|viral]] infections are treated with [[Antifungal medication|antifungals]] and [[Antiviral drug|antivirals]] respectively. A broad class of drugs known as [[antiparasitics]] are used to treat [[parasitic diseases]].

Medical microbiologists often make treatment recommendations to the patient's physician based on the strain of [[microbe]] and its [[antibiotic resistance]]s, the site of infection, the potential [[toxicity]] of  antimicrobial drugs and any [[drug allergies]] the patient has.

[[File:Antibiotic sensitvity and resistance.JPG|right|thumb|Antibiotic resistance tests:  bacteria in the culture on the left are sensitive to the antibiotics contained in the white, paper discs. Bacteria in the culture on the right are resistant to most of the antibiotics.]]
In addition to drugs being specific to a certain kind of organism (bacteria, fungi, etc.), some drugs are specific to a certain [[genus]] or [[species]] of organism, and will not work on other organisms. Because of this specificity, medical microbiologists must consider the effectiveness of certain antimicrobial drugs when making recommendations. Additionally, [[strain (biology)|strains]] of an organism may be resistant to a certain drug or class of drug, even when it is typically effective against the species. These strains, termed resistant strains, present a serious public health concern of growing importance to the medical industry as the spread of [[antibiotic resistance]] worsens. [[Antimicrobial resistance]] is an increasingly problematic issue that leads to millions of deaths every year.&lt;ref name="WHO 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/ | title=Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance 2014 | publisher=WHO | work=WHO | date=April 2014 | accessdate=May 9, 2015 | author=WHO | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515101620/http://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/ | archivedate=May 15, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst drug resistance typically involves microbes chemically inactivating an antimicrobial drug or a cell mechanically stopping the uptake of a drug, another form of drug resistance can arise from the formation of [[biofilm]]s. Some bacteria are able to form biofilms by adhering to surfaces on implanted devices such as catheters and prostheses and creating an [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix]] for other cells to adhere to.&lt;ref&gt;Vickery K, Hu H, Jacombs AS, Bradshaw DA, Deva AK (2013) A review of bacterial biofilms and their role in device-associated infection. Healthcare Infection .&lt;/ref&gt; This provides them with a stable environment from which the bacteria can disperse and infect other parts of the host. Additionally, the extracellular matrix and dense outer layer of bacterial cells can protect the inner bacteria cells from antimicrobial drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Stewart PS| author2=Costerton JW |title=Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9276 |pages=135–8 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11463434 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05321-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical microbiology is not only about diagnosing and treating disease, it also involves the study of beneficial microbes.  Microbes have been shown to be helpful in combating infectious disease and promoting health. Treatments can be developed from microbes, as demonstrated by Alexander Fleming's discovery of [[penicillin]] as well as the development of new antibiotics from the bacterial genus [[Streptomyces#Medicine|Streptomyces]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Taguchi T, Yabe M, Odaki H, Shinozaki M, Metsä-Ketelä M, Arai T, Okamoto S, Ichinose K (2013) Biosynthetic Conclusions from the Functional Dissection of Oxygenases for Biosynthesis of Actinorhodin and Related Streptomyces Antibiotics. Chemistry &amp; Biology 20:510-520.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only are microorganisms a source of antibiotics but some may also act as [[probiotics]] to provide health benefits to the host, such as providing better gastrointestinal health or inhibiting pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Williams NT (2010) Probiotics. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy 67:449-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MSCP Generic Poster.PNG|thumb|right|MSCP Poster outlining the various activities of the organisation. [http://www.mscp.org.au/ MSCP Website]]]

The '''Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy''' ('''MSCP''') is an institution dedicated to scholarly, extensive and engaged readings of key figures and texts in the history of modern European thought and contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au MSCP Identity Statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The School was founded in 2003 and formalised its status as an independent, [[not-for-profit]] organisation in 2004. It is based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and is housed by [[The University of Melbourne]].

== Formation and early years ==

In January 2002, Cameron Shingleton, Jon Roffe, Matt Sharpe and David Rathbone ran a summer school with four courses (on Nietzsche, on Deleuze, on Zizek and on Hegel, respectively) in the 1888 Building at the University of Melbourne.  Sharpe had just finished his PhD on Zizek with Marion Tapper and Jon Rundell at Melbourne; Rathbone had returned to Melbourne from studies with Agnes Heller and Reiner Schurmann at the New School for Social Research in New York; Shingleton had completed his honors degree on Nietzsche in the German department; and Roffe his, in French.  All four were of the opinion that the formalities of institutional academia alone were not sufficient to undertaking philosophical and critical thought. They thus formed the MSCP in the spirit of a [[guild]] of philosophers with the intention of preserving and fostering genuine intellectual engagement with continental philosophy. In 2003, they were joined by Sean Ryan, Craig Barrie, and Ashley Woodward, and later, Esther Anatolitis, Felicity Joseph, Jack Reynolds, Kate Noble, Alex Murray, Atliana Safich, Mark Tomlinson, Marc Hiatt, James Garrett, Bryan Cooke, Paul Daniels, Andrea Leon-Martino, and Sherah Bloor, all of whom have all been involved in various ways during the five years 2004-2009, running annual Summer and Winter Schools, as well as several conferences and research days.

== Events and activities ==
===Summer and Winter Schools===

The MSCP runs Summer and Winter Schools at the University of Melbourne during the university vacation breaks. Courses in the Schools consist of five two-hour lectures over a week and do not involve assessment or require any demonstrated prior knowledge of the topic in question. As the MSCP is a not-for-profit organisation, registration costs are minimal.

MSCP courses seek a detailed and scholarly encounter with philosophical thinkers and themes. In particular, the courses attempt to promote constructive ways of engaging with philosophy which are not widely represented in contemporary academic discourse. The courses aim to locate philosophy in the context of its historical and cultural milieu, encouraging lively, academic debate, emphasising the interdisciplinary aspects of philosophy. Classes are informal but strive to be rigorous and faithful to the philosophers and texts being studied.

Past courses have covered philosophers such as [[Hegel]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]], [[Derrida]], [[Deleuze]] and [[Badiou]]. A series of courses has run over several Summer and Winter Schools entitled 'MSCP History of Philosophy Series' which assessed philosophy from the [[pre-Socratics]] to [[modern empiricism]]. Similar courses, treating a theme rather than a particular philosopher or text, have included 'Three Centuries of Aphorism' and 'Democracy, Elites and Violence'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/past.html MSCP past sessions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===

The MSCP has run conferences including:

* 2002 Australasian Society of Continental Philosophy conference at the University of Melbourne (the MSCP hosted this conference in conjunction with the Department of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org.au/conferences.htm ASCP 2002 conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in December 2002
* 'Immanuel Kant Today', commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/kant_papers.html Immanuel Kant Today conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in February 2004
* 'Sensorium', a conference on philosophy and [[aesthetics]], held in June 2005
* '[[Sartre]] Colloquium' which included a performance of ''[[Huis Clos]]'' (held in conjunction with the Department of French, Italian and Spanish Studies and the Department of Philosophy), held in October 2005
* '200 Years of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/community/events/starters/archive/arts-starters-06-27-07.html "200 Years of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit''"]&lt;/ref&gt; held in July 2007

===Research days===

The MSCP has initiated a series of research days where philosophers in a particular field converge on a specific topic and workshop their papers together. So far, "[[Spinoza]] and the [[Infinity (philosophy)|Infinite]]", convened by Jon Roffe was held in December 2005 and was attended by [[Justin Clemens]], Simon Duffy, Minna Koivuniemi and Jon Roffe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/research/spinoza_infinite.html 'Spinoza and the Infinite' research day]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parrhesia Journal.PNG|thumb|left|''Parrhesia'' An International Journal of Critical Philosophy. [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/ Parrhesia Journal]]]

=== ''Parrhesia'' Journal ===
''[[Parrhesia: A Journal of Critical Philosophy]]'' is an international journal of [[Critical Philosophy]] affiliated with MSCP. It is edited by four MSCP members: Alex Murray, Matthew Sharpe, Jon Roffe and Ashley Woodward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org Parrhesia Journal website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000041083174 National Library of Australia entry for Parrhesia Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2006 and has included articles by [[Alain Badiou]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou1.pdf Badiou, Alain, "A musical variant on the metaphysics of the subject", trans. Justin Clemens, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 29 - 36]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou2.pdf Badiou, Alain, "The Event in Deleuze", trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 37 - 44 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacques Rancière]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia01/parrhesia01_ranciere.pdf Rancière, Jacques, "Thinking between disciplines: an aesthetics of knowledge," trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 1, 2006, pp. 1 - 12 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The MSCP and the University of Melbourne ==

[[File:Old Arts Building, University of Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Law Quadrangle at the University of Melbourne, home to the School of Philosophy. The MSCP office is located in this building.]]
 
During 2004, the founding Convenor, Jon Roffe, negotiated an informal relationship between the MSCP and the Philosophy Department with Chris Cordner (then Head of the Philosophy Department).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ Link to the MSCP via the School of Philosophy website ]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the MSCP to undertake its activities using an office in the Department and University of Melbourne resources and teaching spaces. Late 2004, the MSCP invited Dr Marion Tapper of the University of Melbourne Philosophy Department to become a member. This merely formalised her involvement as she had always been supportive of the MSCP both philosophically and on account of knowing all of its members personally from teaching and supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html Marion Tapper, School of Philosophy staff profile]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One way in which the MSCP attempts to transcend its university boundaries is by seeking new ways to teach and engage with philosophy.  In particular, MSCP events strive to be both informal and rigorous. With their courses offering no credit or assessment, students who attend are usually there for the joy of philosophy and seek to further their own intellects outside of a formal classroom setting. Being a not-for-profit organisation, the MSCP charges a minimum for its courses; again, this is aimed at transcending the current economic climate of university funding.

== Membership ==

New members are typically recommended by current members and, largely because the organisation was founded by postgraduate students, they are usually honours year or postgraduate students themselves.

'''Mud-puddling''', or simply '''puddling''', is a behaviour most conspicuous in [[butterfly|butterflies]], but occurs in other animals as well, mainly insects; they seek out [[nutrients]] in certain moist substances such as rotting plant matter, [[mud]] and carrion and they suck up the fluid. Where the conditions are suitable, conspicuous insects such as butterflies commonly form aggregations on wet [[soil]], dung or [[carrion]].&lt;ref name="Sculley"&gt;{{aut|Sculley, C.E. &amp; Boggs, C.L.}} (1996): Mating systems and sexual division of foraging effort affect puddling behaviour by butterflies.

[[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) are diverse in their strategies to gather liquid nutrients. Typically, mud-puddling behaviour takes place on wet soil. But even sweat on human skin may be attractive to butterflies such as species of ''[[Halpe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Collenette, C.L.}} (1934): On the sexes of some South American moths attracted to light, human perspiration and damp sand.

''Journal of Tropical Ecology'' '''22'''(1): 25–33. {{doi|10.1017/S0266467405002750}} (HTML abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; More unusual sources include [[blood]] and [[tears]]. Again, similar behaviour is not limited to the Lepidoptera, and for example, the various species of bees commonly called [[Halictidae|sweat bees]] are attracted to various kinds of sweat and tears, including that of humans, and other bee species have been recorded as doing so to various degrees.&lt;ref name="Hogue1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Leonard Hogue|title=Latin American Insects and Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CTf8bnlndwC&amp;pg=PA457|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07849-9|pages=457–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Morris|title=Insects and Human Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ok-3NLX_8GQC&amp;pg=PA280|year=2004|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-075-6|pages=280–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[species]] puddling behaviour is more commonly seen in males; for example, ''[[Speyeria mormonia]]'' males puddle with a much higher frequency than females.&lt;ref&gt;Sculley, Colleen E., and Carol L. Boggs. "Mating systems and sexual division of foraging effort affect puddling behaviour by butterflies." ''Ecological Entomology'' 21.2 (1996): 193-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the presence of an assembly of butterflies on the ground acts on ''[[Battus philenor]]'' for example, as a stimulus to join the presumptive mud-puddling flock.&lt;ref name="Sculley"/&gt;

==On soil==
In tropical [[India]] this phenomenon is mostly seen in the post-[[monsoon]] season. The groups generally include several species, particularly members of the families [[Papilionidae]] and [[Pieridae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Sreekumar, P.G. &amp; Balakrishnan, M.}} (2001): Habitat and altitude preferences of butterflies in Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala. ''Tropical Ecology'' '''42'''(2): 277-281. [http://www.tropecol.com/pdf/open/PDF_42_2/42213.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt;

Males seem to benefit from the sodium uptake through mud-puddling behaviour with an increase in reproductive success. The collected sodium and amino acids are often transferred to the female with the [[spermatophore]] during mating as a [[nuptial gift]]. This nutrition also enhances the survival rate of the eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Pivnik, K. &amp; McNeil, J.N.}} (1987): Puddling in butterflies: sodium affects reproductive success in ''[[Thymelicus lineola]]''.

When puddling, many butterflies and moths pump fluid through the digestive tract and release fluid from their anus. In some, such as the male [[Notodontidae|notodontid]] ''[[Gluphisia crenata]]'', this is released in forced anal jets at 3 second intervals. Fluid of up to 600 times the body mass may pass through and males have a much longer ileum (anterior hindgut) than non-puddling females.&lt;ref&gt;Scott R. Smedley in Resh, V. H. &amp; R. T.

Some [[Orthoptera]] &amp;ndash; e.g. the yellow-spined bamboo locust (''[[Ceracris]] kiangsu'') &amp;ndash; are attracted to human urine, specifically to the [[sodium]] and [[ammonium]] [[ion]]s in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Shen, Ke; Wang, Hao-Jie; Shao, Lin; Xiao, Kai; Shu, Jin-Ping; Xu, Tian-Sen &amp; Li, Guo-Qing}} (2009): Mud-puddling in the yellow-spined bamboo locust, ''Ceracris kiangsu'' (Oedipodidae: Orthoptera): Does it detect and prefer salts or nitrogenous compounds from human urine?

''[[Oecologia]]'' '''117'''(4): 536-542. {{doi|10.1007/s004420050690}} (HTML abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; In rotting, the tissues of fruits release [[sugar]]s and other organic compounds such as [[alcohol]]s that result from the metabolic processes of decay organisms, used as fuel by butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|DeVries, P.J. &amp; Walla, T.R.}} (2001): Species diversity and community structure in neotropical fruit-feeding butterflies. ''[[Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|Biol. J. Linn. Soc.]]'' '''74''': 1–15. [http://www.urbanwildlands.org/devries/DeVriesWallaBJLS2001.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Borneo lowland rain forest]], numerous species of butterflies regularly visit decaying fruit to drink. This behavior is mainly [[Opportunism#Biological opportunism|opportunistic]], though some are highly attracted to old fruit, notably [[Satyrinae]] (e.g. ''Neorina lowii'') and [[Limenitidinae]] such as ''[[Bassarona dunya]]''.&lt;ref name="HamerEtAl"/&gt;

[[Carrion]] is usually more intentionally utilized. Carrion-feeders seem to represent a different [[feeding guild]] from "classical" mud-puddlers and fruit-feeders. They include diverse [[taxa]], e.g. [[brush-footed butterflies]] such as ''[[Cirrochroa]] emalea'' of the [[Nymphalinae]] or the [[tawny rajah]] (''Charaxes bernardus'') of the [[Charaxinae]], as well as [[gossamer-winged butterflies]] like ''[[Curetis]] tagalica'' of the [[Curetinae]] or the [[common imperial]] (''Cheritra freja'') of the [[Theclinae]].&lt;ref name="HamerEtAl"/&gt;

Carrion-feeding has [[evolution|evolved]] independently in several lineages. Specialist carrion-feeders may even have the ability to smell out and home in on rotting meat over hundreds of meters. In the Bornean [[Charaxinae]], specialist (''[[Charaxes bernardus]]'') or opportunistic (some other ''[[Charaxes]]'' and ''[[Polyura]]'') tend to have a markedly larger bulk and smaller wings, making them more dashing, maneuvrable flyers than fruit specialists like ''[[Prothoe franck]]'' and opportunistic fruit visitors such as ''[[Charaxes durnfordi]]''. Other butterflies like most [[Pieridae]], [[Papilionidae]] and [[Morphinae]] are rarely if ever seen on carrion, dung and rotting fruit, though they may be avid mud-puddlers in the strict sense. Altogether, the [[Nymphalidae]] show the highest variety of nutrient-gathering strategies among the butterflies; the [[Limenitidinae]] have numerous mud-puddlers that also frequently visit dung but avoid fruits and carrion (namely the genus ''[[Limenitis]]''),&lt;ref name="HamerEtAl"/&gt; and some which are attracted to any pungent substance.&lt;ref&gt;Several ''[[Apatura]]'' species are famous among [[lepidopterologist]]s for being easily attracted with stinking cheese.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain [[moth]]s, mainly of the [[subfamily]] [[Calpinae]], are somewhat notorious for their blood- and tear-drinking habits. ''[[Hemiceratoides hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Madagascar]] has been noted to visit and suck tears by inserting their proboscis into the closed eyelids of roosting birds.&lt;ref&gt;* {{aut|Hilgartner, R.; Raoilison, Mamisolo; Büttiker, Willhelm; Lees, David C. &amp; Krenn, Harald W.}} (2007): Malagasy birds as hosts for eye-frequenting moths.

A [[Hanafi]] [[faqih|jurist]] and [[mufti]], he was also an authority on [[shari'ah]], [[hadith]], ''[[tafsir]]'' (Qur'anic exegesis), and ''[[tasawwuf]]'' (Sufism). Born in [[Deoband]], [[British India]], he graduated in 1917 from [[Darul Uloom Deoband]], where he later taught hadith and held the post of Chief Mufti. He resigned from the school in 1943 to devote his time to the [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] he moved to Pakistan, where he established [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in 1951. Of his written works, his best-known is ''[[Ma'ariful Qur'an]]'', a ''tafsir'' of the [[Qur'an]].

==Birth and early childhood==
Muhammad Shafi, son of Maulana Muhammad Yasin, was born on 21 Sha'ban 1314 [[anno hegirae|AH]] (c. 25 January 1897) in [[Deoband]], [[British India]] (in present-day [[Saharanpur district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]) to an [[Usmani]] family.&lt;ref name=taqi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi grew up in a religious environment. As a child he played in the courtyard of Darul Uloom Deoband and sat in the company of his father, who was a teacher at the school.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

==Education==
At about the age of five, Shafi began ''nazirah'' (reading of the [[Qur'an]]) with Hafiz Muhammad Azim at the Darul Uloom.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After reading the Qur'an, he did ''[[hifz]]'' (memorization of the Qur'an) with Hafiz Abdul Azim and Hafiz Namdar Khan.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1325 AH (1907/1908) he commenced the study of Urdu, Persian, mathematics and other subjects at Darul Uloom Deoband, which he completed within the next five years under the supervision of his father.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; He studied arithmetic and Euclid from his uncle Munshi Manzur Ahmad and ''[[tajwid]]'' from Qari Muhammad Yusuf Miruthi. Along with teaching Shafi the Persian books, Maulana Yasin also instructed him in the elementary [[Arabic]] books of ''sarf'' (morphology), ''nahw'' (grammar), and ''[[fiqh]]'' (jurisprudence), up to ''Fusul-i Akbari'', ''Hidayat an-Nahw'', and ''Munyat al-Musalli''.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

He did Daurah Hadith in 1335 AH (1916/1917) under the supervision of Anwar Shah Kashmiri, and completed his education in 1336 AH (1917/1918).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; The teachers under whom Shafi formally studied included:&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

*[[Allamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri]]
*[[Allamah Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]]
*Maulana Mufti Azizur Rahman Usmani
*Maulana Sayyid Miyan Asghar Husain Deobandi
*Maulana Muhammad Izaz Ali Amrohi
*Maulana Muhammad Rasul Khan
*Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim Balliyawi
*Maulana Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi
*Maulana Muhammad Ahmad ibn [[Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi]]
 
Foremost among his teachers was Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who was the school's Sadr Mudarris (head teacher). Some of the books Shafi studied with him were ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]]'' (with the exception of a small part), [[at-Tirmidhi]]'s ''[[Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Shama'il]]'' and '''Ilal'', ''al-Falsafah al-'Arabiyah'' on modern philosophy, and ''Sharh an-Nafisi'' on medicine (''tibb''). Shafi was among Kashmiri's closest students, and Kashmiri would later select Shafi for assistance in refuting the [[Ahmadiyya Movement]]. Shafi studied ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' and half of ''[[al-Hidayah (book)|Hidayah]]'' with Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, whom he would later accompany in the movement to create Pakistan. With Maulana Asghar Husain he studied the hadith collections ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'', ''[[Sunan an-Nasa'i]]'', and the remainder of ''Jami' at-Tirmidhi''. With Azizur Rahman, head of the Darul Uloom's [[Fatwa]] Department, Shafi studied the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]] of [[Imam Malik]] in the transmission of [[Yahya al-Laithi|Yahya ibn Yahya]] and the transmission of [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|ash-Shaybani]], [[at-Tahawi]]'s ''Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar'', ''[[Tafsir al-Jalalayn]]'', ''[[Mishkat al-Masabih]]'', [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s ''Sharh Nukhbat al-Fikar'', and ''Hisn-i Hasin''. He studied ''Sunan Ibn Majah'' with Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi. With Izaz Ali he studied all the books of literature, [[Maibazi]]'s ''Sharh Hidayat al-Hikmah'', [[at-Taftazani]]'s ''Sharh al-'Aqa'id al-Nasafiyah'', Ubayd Allah al-Mahbubi's ''Sharh al-Wiqayah'', and some other treatises. With Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim he studied ''[[Mulla Sadra|Sadra]]'' and ''[[Shams al-Bazighah]]''.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

After Daurah a few books still remained, including ''Qazi'', ''Mir Zahid'', and ''Umur-i 'Ammah''—these were completed in 1336 AH (1917/1918).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; In that year Shafi was also appointed to teach some lessons.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

==Teaching career==
Maulana Shafi was formally appointed as a teacher in Darul Uloom Deoband in 1337 AH (1918/1919).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; He began teaching the elementary level books of the curriculum and eventually reached the level of Daurah Hadith.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; The first book of Daurah level that he was given was ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]'', and he later taught other books. In 1354 AH (1935/1936) he was entrusted with teaching ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'' for some time in place of Maulana Asghar Husain. On Husain's request he was given this lecture permanently, and he taught it until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in 1362 AH (1943). Shafi was regarded as an exceptional lecturer on many subjects, but two of his lessons were most famous—one was ''Sunan Abu Dawud'', and the other was ''Maqamat al-Hariri'' in Arabic literature.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After leaving Darul Uloom Deoband, he taught ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' for three months at [[Jamiah Islamiyah Dabhel]], filling in for [[Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

Shafi established [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in Shawwal 1370 AH (1951). There he taught ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' for several years, as well as ''Muwatta Malik'' and ''[[Shama'il at-Tirmidhi]]''. Whenever due to health or other responsibilities he was unable to teach the whole of ''Bukhari'', then those years he would teach until the Book of Wudu, and other teachers would cover the remainder. In the last four years of his life, he was bedridden and thus unable to teach regularly. However, on the insistence of students and teachers, every year he taught the first lesson of ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and the last lessons of the [[Sihah Sittah]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Issuance of fatawa==
From the beginning of his teaching career Maulana Shafi frequently assisted Mufti Azizur Rahman, then head of the school's [[fatwa]] department.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt; Azizur Rahman resigned from the Darul Uloom in 1344 AH (1925/1926). Others occupied the post of Sadr Mufti (Chief Mufti) until the Majlis-e-Shura of Darul Uloom Deoband appointed Shafi to the post on 28 Rabi al-Awwal 1350 AH (c. 13 August 1931).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Mufti Muhammad Shafi writes in the introduction to ''Ma'ariful Qur'an'' that he occupied the post from 1349 AH.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;|group="note"}} In additions to undertaking the duties of fatwa-writing, Shafi also continued to teach some books of hadith and tafsir.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

In Rajab 1351 (November 1932) Shafi published a tract entitled ''Nihayat al-arab fi ghayat an-nasab'' on [[Caste system among Muslims#In South Asia|caste]]. The weavers of the Deoband area (who were regarded as a lower caste) revolted against the fatwa, and from early 1353 AH (1934/1935) to late 1354 AH (1935/1936) rallies were held and threats were made against Shafi, in response to which a group of teachers took to acting as his bodyguards. Several scholars wrote or spoke in defense of the fatwa, including Shafi's shaikh Ashraf Ali Thanawi, Sayyid Asghar Husain, and Husain Ahmad Madani. Due to the controversy, Shafi asked to be transferred to the teaching department, a request that was eventually granted by the Majlis-e-Shura in Sha'ban 1354 AH (c. November 1935).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Arthur F.|title=Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies: The Living Links to the Prophet|editor-last=Morimoto|editor-first=Kazuo|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203123157|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C&amp;pg=PA239|chapter=Trends of ashrāfization in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafi remained in the teaching department over the next few years, during which two other ulama held the post of Sadr Mufti. On 25 Safar 1359 AH (c. 4 April 1940), Shafi was appointed to the office a second time.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; He held the post until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in Rabi al-Awwal 1362 AH (March 1943).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Rizvi writes that Shafi occupied the post until 1361 AH (1942).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;|group="note"}}

Estimates of the number of fatwas that he issued while at Darul Uloom Deoband range from 26,000&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; to over 40,000. Some of Muhammad Shafi's fatwas have been published in eight large volumes titled ''Imdad al-Muftin'', while the majority remain unpublished.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Sufism==
From an early age, Shafi frequently attended the gatherings of [[Maulana Mahmud Hasan]]. Then when Mahmud Hasan was [[Malta exiles|imprisoned in Malta]], Shafi consulted [[Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanawi]]. Mahmud Hasan returned to Deoband on 20 Ramadan 1338 AH (June 1920). In 1339 AH (1920) Shafi gave ''bay'at'' (allegiance) at his hand. However, Mahmud Hasan died a few months later on 18 Rabi al-awwal AH (November 1920). Shafi returned to Thanawi after Mahmud Hasan's death. In Rabi ath-thani 1349 AH (1930) he received ''ijazat-i bay'at'' (permission to take disciples) and ''khilafah'' (spiritual successorship).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Pakistan Movement==
At the time Muhammad Shafi was teaching at Darul Uloom Deoband, Indians were struggling for independence from the British. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was formed to campaign for the creation of a separate Muslim state, [[Ashraf Ali Thanvi]] instructed all ''[[ulama]]'' and Muslims in general to support this campaign. Muhammad Shafi, with other scholars including Zafar Ahmad Usmani, joined the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]], a council of Islamic scholars formed by [[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]] to campaign for the creation of Pakistan. In 1363 AH (1944) Muhammad Shafi resigned from teaching and issuing fatwas at Darul Uloom Deoband in order to devote his time to the movement for the creation of Pakistan. He toured India, gave speeches, and issued ''fatwas'' for this purpose.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Migration to Pakistan==
After [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], in 1367 AH (1948), Muhammad Shafi left his hometown of Deoband and immigrated to Pakistan. He founded [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in 1370 AH (1950/1951). Muhammad Shafi died on 10 Shawwal 1396 (6 October 1976).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Works==
He wrote around one hundred books [[Exegesis#Islam|explaining]] the [[Quran]] and interpreting [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. His best-known and most widely translated work is the ''[[Ma'ariful Qur'an]]'' ("The Wisdom of the Quran"), which he finished (in Urdu) four years before his death.&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;''Ma'ariful Qur'an: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Holy Qur'an'' (Karachi: Mataba-e-Darul-Ulomm Karachi, 2008 ed.), Volume 1. p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; This work, a commentary on the entire Quran, began as a series of weekly lectures on [[Radio Pakistan]] that ran for ten years.&lt;ref name="ibid" /&gt;

The '''National Michael Chekhov Association (NMCA)''' is an accredited actor training and teacher certification program in the '''[[Michael Chekhov]] Acting Technique'''.

==Brief History==

The [http://www.chekhov.net/ '''National Michael Chekhov Association (NMCA)''']&lt;ref&gt;[[Mala Powers#National Michael Chekhov Association .28NMCA.29]]&lt;/ref&gt; began informally during the 1993 [[Association for Theatre in Higher Education]] (ATHE) conference at which the three founders, [[Mala Powers]], Chekhov Estate Executrix; [[Lisa Dalton (actor)]], American representative on the International Michael Chekhov Association's Board; and [http://usm.maine.edu/rscholar/william-kilroy Wil Kilroy], Professor, [[University of Southern Maine]], were presenting workshops on the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique.

Wil Kilroy initiated the Chekhov Theatre Institute in 1994 during the [[University of Southern Maine]] (USM) Summer Sessions. Several years later, the course was granted full graduate and undergraduate accreditation from the State of Maine Educational System. From 1994 through 2006, the three teachers team-taught the program at USM, initiating the first Michael Chekhov Teacher Certification Track globally.

In 2008 Charlie Bowles hosted the NMCA's summer training intensive in Arlington, TX. His involvement quickly escalated, becoming the Secretary and Treasurer on the NMCA Board. Charlie also acts as the Executive Producer of NMCA programming and was responsible for the creation the current NMCA training format and its sister publications.

==Program==

NMCA holds weeklong, 55-hour training intensives in various parts of the [[United States]] every year. Currently, the two main intensives are held in January at the [[University of Florida]] and in July at the [[University of Southern Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educational Programs of NMCA, Inc.|url=http://chekhov.net/eduprograms.html|website=chekhov.net|publisher=chekhov.net|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor Training===
Participants attend a weeklong intensive, learning the various tools of the technique while applying them to scene work, culminating in a final performance showcase.

===Teacher Certification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teacher Training Certificate Track|url=http://chekhov.net/teachertraining.html|website=chekhov.net|publisher=chekhov.net|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Participants attend two weeklong intensives, learning the various tools of the technique while applying them to scene work, culminating in a final performance. Toward the end of the course, the teacher candidate will lead the attending class in a selected tool, as well as, attend an additional day at the end the intensive to synthesize their understanding through discussion. Finally, the teacher candidate must complete and present an approved project that demonstrates their mastery of the technique and ability to effectively communicate its use to others.

'''Planetary migration''' occurs when a [[planet]] or other stellar satellite interacts with a disk of gas or [[planetesimal]]s, resulting in the alteration of the satellite's orbital parameters, especially its [[semi-major axis]].  Planetary migration is the most likely explanation for [[hot Jupiter]]s: [[extrasolar planets]] with [[giant planet|jovian]] masses but orbits of only a few days.  The generally accepted [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|theory of planet formation]] from a [[protoplanetary disk]] predicts such planets cannot form so close to their stars, as there is insufficient mass at such small radii and the temperature is too high to allow the formation of rocky or icy planetesimals.  It has also become clear that [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial-mass planet]]s may be subject to rapid inward migration if they form while the gas disk is still present. This may affect the formation of the cores of the giant planets (which have masses of the order of 10 Earth masses), if those planets form via the core accretion mechanism.

== Types of disk ==

=== Gas disk ===
Protoplanetary gas disks around young stars are observed to have lifetimes of a few million years. If planets with masses of around an Earth mass or greater form while the gas is still present, the planets can exchange [[angular momentum]] with the surrounding gas in the [[protoplanetary disk]] so that their orbits change gradually. Although the sense of migration is typically inwards in locally isothermal disks, outward migration may occur in disks that possess entropy gradients.

=== Planetesimal disk ===
During the late phase of planetary system formation, massive protoplanets and [[planetesimal]]s gravitationally interact in a chaotic manner causing many planetesimals to be thrown into new orbits. This results in angular-momentum exchange between the planets and the planetesimals, and leads to migration (either inward or outward). Outward migration of [[Neptune]] is believed to be responsible for the resonant capture of [[Pluto]] and other [[Plutino]]s into the 3:2 [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] with Neptune.

== Types of migration ==

===Disk migration===

This type of orbital migration arises from the gravitational force exerted by a sufficiently massive body embedded in a disk on the surrounding disk's gas, which perturbs its density distribution. By the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction]] principle of [[classical mechanics]], the gas exerts an equal and opposite gravitational force on the body, which can also be expressed in terms of a [[torque]]. This torque alters the [[angular momentum]] of the planet's orbit, resulting in a variation of the orbital elements, such as the [[semi-major axis]] (but all orbital elements can be affected). An increase over time of the semi-major axis leads to ''outward migration,'' i.e., away from the star, whereas the opposite behavior leads to ''inward migration''.

==== Type I migration ====

Small planets undergo Type I migration driven by torques arising from waves launched at the locations of the [[Lindblad resonance|Lindblad]] and from co-rotation resonances. Lindblad resonances excite spiral density waves in the surrounding gas, interior and exterior of the planet's orbit. In most cases, the outer spiral wave exerts a greater torque than does the inner wave, causing the planet to lose angular momentum, and hence migrate toward the star. The migration rate due to these torques is proportional to the mass of the planet and to the local gas density, and results in a migration timescale that tends to be short relative to the million-year lifetime of the gaseous disk.&lt;ref name=li2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubow|first=S. H.|author2=Ida, S. |chapter=Planet Migration |bibcode=2011exop.book..347L| title=Exoplanets |publisher=University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ| editor=S. Seager. |pages=347–371|date=2011|url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/Books/bid2263.htm| arxiv=1004.4137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional co-rotation torques are also exerted by gas orbiting with a period similar to that of the planet. In a reference frame attached to the planet, this gas follows [[horseshoe orbit]]s, reversing direction when it approaches the planet from ahead or from behind. The gas reversing course ahead of the planet originates from a larger semi-major axis and may be cooler and denser than the gas reversing course behind the planet. This may result in a region of excess density ahead of the planet and of lesser density behind the planet, causing the planet to gain angular momentum.&lt;ref name="Paadekooper_Mellema_2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paardekooper|first1=S.-J.|last2=Mellema|first2=G.|title=Halting type I planet migration in non-isothermal disks|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2006|volume=459|issue=1|pages=L17–L20|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20066304|arxiv=astro-ph/0608658|url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2006/43/aa6304-06/aa6304-06.html|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...459L..17P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasser|first1=R.|last2=Bitsch|first2=B.|last3=Matsumura|first3=S.|title=Saving super-Earths: Interplay between pebble accretion and type I migration|date=2017|arxiv=1704.01962|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa6ba3|volume=153|issue=5|journal=The Astronomical Journal|page=222|bibcode=2017AJ....153..222B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planet mass for which migration can be approximated to Type I depends on the local gas pressure scale-height and, to a lesser extent, the kinematic [[viscosity]] of the gas.&lt;ref name="li2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dangelo_lubow_2010 /&gt; In warm and viscous disks, Type I migration may apply to larger mass planets.

==== Type II migration ====

A planet massive enough to open a gap in a gaseous disk undergoes a regime of migration referred to as Type II. When the mass of a perturbing planet is large enough, the tidal torque it exerts on the gas transfers angular momentum to the gas exterior of the planet's orbit, and does the opposite interior to the planet, thereby repelling gas from around the orbit. In a Type I regime, viscous torques can efficiently counter this effect by resupplying gas and smoothing out sharp density gradients. But when the torques become strong enough to overcome the viscous torques in the vicinity of the planet's orbit, a lower density annular gap is created. The depth of this gap depends on the temperature and viscosity of the gas and on the planet mass. In the simple scenario in which no gas crosses the gap, the migration of the planet follows the viscous evolution of the disk's gas. In the inner disk, the planet spirals inward on the viscous timescale, following the accretion of gas onto the star. In this case, the migration rate is typically slower than would be the migration of the planet in the Type I regime. In the outer disk, however, migration can be outward if the disk is viscously expanding. A Jupiter-mass planet in a typical protoplanetary disk is expected to undergo migration at approximately the Type II rate, with the transition from Type I to Type II occurring at roughly the mass of Saturn, as a partial gap is opened.&lt;ref name=dangelo_etal_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dangelo_lubow_2008 /&gt; Type II migration is one explanation for the formation of [[hot Jupiter]]s.&lt;ref name="Armitage_2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Armitage|first1=Phillip J.|title=Lecture notes on the formation and early evolution of planetary systems|accessdate=|arxiv=astro-ph/0701485|bibcode=2007astro.ph..1485A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more realistic situations, unless extreme thermal and viscosity conditions occur in a disk, there is an ongoing flux of gas through the gap.&lt;ref name=lubow_dangelo_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubow|first=S.|author2=D'Angelo, G. |title=Gas Flow across Gaps in Protoplanetary Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2006|volume=641|issue=1|pages=526–533|doi=10.1086/500356|arxiv = astro-ph/0512292 |bibcode = 2006ApJ...641..526L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this mass flux, torques acting on a planet can be susceptible to local disk properties, akin to torques at work during Type I migration.

=== Tidal migration ===
Tides between the star and planet modify the semi-major axis and orbital eccentricity of the planet. The tide of a planet orbiting near a star raises a bulge on the star. If the star's rotational period is longer than the planet's orbital period the location of the bulge lags behind a line between the planet and the center of the star creating a torque between the planet and the star. As a result, the planet loses angular momentum and its semi-major axis decreases with time. If the planet is in an eccentric orbit the strength of the tide is stronger when it is near perihelion. The planet is slowed the most when near perihelion, causing its aphelion to decrease faster than its perihelion, reducing its eccentricity. Unlike disk migration which lasts a few million years until the gas dissipates tidal migration continues for billions of years. Tidal evolution of close-in planets produces semi-major axes typically half as large as they were at the time that the gas nebula cleared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0716 Tidal Evolution of Close-in Extra-Solar Planets], Brian Jackson, Richard Greenberg, Rory Barnes, (Submitted on 4 Jan 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kozai cycles and tidal friction===
The orbit of a planet that has an orbit that is inclined relative to the plane of a binary star can shrink due to a combination of Kozai cycles and tidal friction. Interactions with the more distant star cause the planets orbit to undergo an exchange of eccentricity and inclination due to the Kozai mechanism. This process can increase the planet's eccentricity and lowers its perihelion enough to create strong tides between the planet on the star increases. When it is near the star the planet loses angular momentum causing its orbit to shrink. The planet's eccentricity and inclination cycle repeatedly slowing the evolution of the planets semi-major axis.&lt;ref name="Fabrycky_Tremaine_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fabrycky|first1=Daniel|last2=Tremaine|first2=Scott|title=Shrinking Binary and Planetary Orbits by Kozai Cycles with Tidal Friction|journal=The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 669, Issue 2, pp. 1298–1315|date=2007|volume=669|issue=2|pages=1298–1315|doi=10.1086/521702|arxiv=0705.4285|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/521702/meta|bibcode=2007ApJ...669.1298F}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the planet's orbit shrinks enough to remove it from the influence of the distant star the Kozai cycles end. Its orbit will then shrink more rapidly as it is tidally circularized. The orbit of the planet can also become retrograde due to this process. The Kozai cycles can also occur in a system with two planets that have differing inclinations due to gravitational scattering between planets and can result in planets with retrograde orbits.&lt;ref name="Noaz_etal_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoz|first1=Smadar|last2=Farr,|first2=Will M.|last3=Lithwick|first3=Yoram|last4=Rasio|first4=Frederic A.|last5=Teyssandier|first5=Jean|title=Hot Jupiters from secular planet-planet interactions|journal=Nature|date=2011|volume=473|issue=7346|pages=187–189|doi=10.1038/nature10076|arxiv=1011.2501|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7346/full/nature10076.html|bibcode=2011Natur.473..187N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nagasawa_etal_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagasawa|first1=M.|last2=Ida|first2=S.|last3=Bessho|first3=T.|title=Formation of Hot Planets by a Combination of Planet Scattering, Tidal Circularization, and the Kozai Mechanism|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2008|volume=678|issue=1|pages=498–508|doi=10.1086/529369|arxiv=0801.1368|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/529369/meta|bibcode=2008ApJ...678..498N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetesimal-driven migration===
The orbit of a planet can change due to gravitational encounters with a large number of planetesimals. Planetesimal-driven migration is the result of the accumulation of the transfers of angular momentum during encounters between the planetesimals and a planet. For individual encounters the amount of angular momentum exchanged and the direction of the change in the planet's orbit depends on the geometry of the encounter. For a large number of encounters the direction of the planet's migration depends on the average angular momentum of the planetesimals relative to the planet. If it is higher, for example a disk outside the planet's orbit, the planet migrates outward, if it is lower the planet migrates inward. The migration of a planet beginning with a similar angular momentum as the disk depends on potential sinks and sources of the planetesimals. For a single planet system planetesimals can only be lost (a sink) due to their ejection, which would cause the planet to migrate inward. In multiple planet systems the other planets can act as sinks or sources. Planetesimals can be removed from the planet's influence after encountering an adjacent planet or transferred to its influence by that planet. These interactions cause the planet's orbits to diverge as the outer planet tends to remove planetesimals with larger momentum from the inner planet influence or add planetesimals with lower angular momentum, and vice versa. The planet's resonances, where the eccentricities of planetesimals are pumped up until they intersect with the planet, also act as a source. Finally, the planet's migration acts as both a sink and a source of new planetesimals creating a positive feedback that tends to continue its migration in the original direction. Planetesimal-driven migration can be damped if a planetesimals are lost to various sinks faster than new ones are encountered due to its sources or sustained if the new planetesimals enter its influence faster than they are lost. If sustained migration is due to its migration only it is called runaway migration, if it due to the loss of planetesimals to another planets influence it its is called forced migration&lt;ref name="Levison_etal_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levison|first1=H.

The migration of the outer planets is a scenario proposed to explain some of the orbital properties of the bodies in the Solar System's outermost regions.&lt;ref name=Levinson2007&gt;{{cite journal | author=Harold F.

At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the [[solar nebula]] dispersed, because the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100&amp;nbsp;AU,&lt;ref name=Levinson2007/&gt; and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this scenario the Kuiper belt was originally much denser and closer to the Sun: it contained millions of planetesimals, and had an outer edge at approximately 30&amp;nbsp;AU, the present distance of Neptune. After the [[formation of the Solar System]], the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600&amp;nbsp;million years (about 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn divergently crossed the 2:1 [[orbital resonance]], in which Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.&lt;ref name="Levinson2007" /&gt; This resonance crossing increased the eccentricities of Jupiter and Saturn and destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Encounters between the planets followed causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the dense planetesimal belt. The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while moving outwards themselves. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug01/bombardment.html |title=Uranus, Neptune, and the Mountains of the Moon |work= Planetary Science Research Discoveries |date=21 August 2001 |author=G. Jeffrey Taylor |publisher=Hawaii Institute of Geophysics &amp;amp; Planetology |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. This scattering scenario explains the trans-Neptunian populations' present low mass. In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not believed to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the [[Late Heavy Bombardment|period of giant impacts]].&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Genesis of Planets |author=Douglas N.

'''Process qualification''' is the qualification of manufacturing and production processes to confirm they are able to operate at a certain standard during sustained commercial manufacturing. Data covering critical process parameters must be recorded and analyzed to ensure critical quality attributes can be guaranteed throughout production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Qualification|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/cms/index.php?id=215|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include testing equipment at maximum operating capacity to show quantity demands can be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM070336.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all processes have been qualified the manufacturer should have a complete understanding of the process design and have a framework in place to routinely monitor operations. Only after process qualification has been completed can the manufacturing process begin production for commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Validation A Lifecycle Approach|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/aboutfda/centersoffices/cder/ucm255585.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally important as qualifying processes and equipment is qualifying software and personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROCESS QUALIFICATION (P2Q)|url=http://www.validation-online.net/process-qualification.html|publisher=validation-online.net|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well trained staff and accurate, thorough records helps ensure ongoing protection from process faults and quick recovery from otherwise costly process malfunctions. In many countries qualification measures are also required, especially in the [[pharmaceutical manufacturing]] field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2001_83_cons2009/2001_83_cons2009_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Process qualification should cover the following aspects of manufacturing:
* Facility
* Utilities
* Equipment
* Personnel
* End-to-end manufacturing
* Control protocols and monitoring software.

Process qualification is the second stage of [[Process Validation]].

A vital component of process qualification is [[Process Performance Qualification Protocol]]. PPQ Protocol is essential in defining and maintaining production standards within an organization.

{{italic title}}
'''''Pure Theory of Law''''' ({{lang-de|Reine Rechtslehre}}) is a book by legal theorist [[Hans Kelsen]], first published in 1934 and in a greatly expanded "second edition" (effectively a new book) in 1960. The second edition appeared in English translation in 1967, as ''Pure Theory of Law'',&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley, U. California P., 1967. The title page has correctly ''Pure Theory of Law'', but the paperback cover has wrongly ''The&lt;!-- [sic] --&gt; Pure Theory of Law''. This has been corrected, for the paperback cover as well as the hardback dustjacket, in a reprint by another publisher "by arrangement with" the Hans Kelsen-Institut: Clark, NJ; The LawbookExchange&lt;!-- the non-spacing is correct --&gt;; 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-58477-578-2}} (p), {{ISBN|978-1-58477-206-4}} (h).&lt;/ref&gt; the first edition in English translation in 1992, as ''Introduction to the Problems of Legal Theory''. The theory proposed in this book has probably been the most influential theory of law produced during the 20th century. It is, at the least, one of the high points of modernist legal theory.&lt;ref&gt;Both editions will be included in forthcoming volumes in the [http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ Hans Kelsen Werke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185519/http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ |date=2013-10-29 }}. A fuller and more accurate translation of the second edition is also planned. The current translation, in omitting many footnotes, obscures the extent to which the Pure Theory of Law is both philosophically grounded and responsive to earlier theories of law.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The two editions of Kelsen's book were separated by twenty-six years, and the second edition (1960) was almost twice the length of the first in the detail of its presentation. The original terminology which was introduced in the first edition was already present in many of Kelsen's writings from the 1920s, and were also subject to discussion in the critical press of that decade as well, before it was first published in 1934. Although the second edition was significantly longer, the two editions had a great deal of similarity of content, and much of the material covered in the volumes is consistent not only with one another, but also with many of Kelsen's previous writings from the 1910s and 1920s. The following sections herein shall follow Kelsen's own preference for the presentation of his main topics of the pure theory of law as he presented them in the second edition of this book.

==Chapters==
===I. Law and Nature===
In the first paragraph of ''Pure Theory of Law'', Kelsen introduces his theory as being a theory of positive law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of positive law is then presented by Kelsen as forming a hierarchy of laws which start from a [[basic norm]] (''Grundnorm'') where all other norms are related to each other by either being inferior norms, when the one is compared to the other, or superior norms. The interaction of these norms is then further subject to representation as a static theory of law (Kelsen's chapter 4) or as a dynamic theory of law (Kelsen's chapter 5).

===II. Law and Morals===
Kelsen's strict separation of law and morality, in Chapter Two of ''Pure Theory of Law'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=59–69}}; Kelsen's ''Recht und Moral'' is more accurately translated as "Law and Morality".&lt;/ref&gt; was an integral part of his presentation of the Pure Theory of Law. The application of the law, in order to be protected from moral influence or political influence, needed to be safeguarded by its separation from the sphere of conventional moral influence or political influence. Kelsen did not deny that moral discussion was still possible and even to be encouraged in the sociological domain of intersubjective activity. However, the Pure Theory of Law was not to be subject to such influences.

===III. Law and Science===
In Chapter Three of ''Pure Theory of Law'', law is defined as the application of norms to its functions within the delineations of a science of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=70−107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science was generally the domain of the causal understanding of epistemological data and its primary logical and causally oriented technique was to be distinguished from the normative reasoning as was to be found in the Pure Theory of Law. Therefore, the legal sciences were to be normatively based in distinction from the physical sciences which were to be causally based.

===IV. The Static Aspect of Law===
In Chapter Four, Kelsen distinguishes the static theory of law from the dynamic theory of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=108-192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The static theory of law represents the law as a hierarchy of laws where the individual laws are related as being either superior or inferior the one to the other. This hierarchical theory was largely adopted from Adolf Merkl's research in the structural aspects of the law while Kelsen was still in Vienna. At nearly one hundred pages each, Kelsen's chapters on the static aspect of law and the dynamic aspect of law are the most extensively developed sections of this book.

===V. The Dynamic Aspect of Law===
In Chapter Five of ''Pure Theory of Law'', sections 34 and 35, Kelsen discusses the dynamic theory of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=193–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dynamic theory of law, the static theory of law comes into direct contact with the governmental administration of the state which must recognize the function of the legislature in the writing of new law. At the same time there is also the understanding of law as being affected by the accumulated standing law which represents the decisions of the courts which in principle become part of the hierarchical representation of the Pure Theory of Law. Importantly, Kelsen allows for the legislative process to recognize the law as the product of political and ethical debate which is the product of the activity of the legislature before it becomes part of the domain of the static theory of law. At nearly one hundred pages in length, this chapter on the dynamic aspect of law is the longest and most fully developed chapter in this book other than the chapter on the static aspect of law.

===VI. Law and State===
Chapter Six of ''Pure Theory of Law'' has Kelsen present his celebrated identity theory of law and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=279–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is Kelsen's highly functional theory of the state and the law as representing the same entity. It is not to be confused with the sociological domain or the cultural domain of intersubjective activity. Nor is it to be confused with the political or even the religious domain of intersubjective interaction among individuals.

===VII. State and International Law===
In Chapter Seven, Kelsen discusses the interaction of state law and international law as these are especially guided by the understanding of political sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=320–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Kelsen, the assessment of international law is that it represents a very primitive form of law in distinct contrast to the highly developed forms of law as may be found in individual nations and states. As a result, Kelsen emphasizes that international law is often prone to the conduct of war and severe diplomatic measures (blockade, seizure, internment, etc.) as offering the only corrective measures available to it in regulating the conduct between nations. For Kelsen, this is largely inevitable due to the relative primitiveness of international law in contemporary society.

===VIII. Interpretation===
Kelsen's final chapter, Chapter Eight, deals with the subject of interpretation in at least three of its most important aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=348-355}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kelsen discusses the nature and methodology of the interpretation of the law. Second, he discusses interpretation as an act of cognition and of voluntary will. Third, he discusses interpretation as it is to be understood as part of the science of law, as Kelsen has defined it as being 'purified' from the undue influences of politics, morals, and metaphysics.

==Supportive and supplementary commentary==
Kelsen attempted to reconstruct 'legal science (''Rechtswissenschaft'')' as a 'science of norms (''Normen'')', on analogy with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s conception of a science of 'causality' as used in natural science (Hans Kelsen, ''Society and Nature'', 1946, pages 249-262, Kegan Paul Press). This type of legal science would be 'pure' in two senses as described below.

===Defining 'purity' of legal science===
Firstly, it would be 'pure' in a sense analogous to that in Kant's ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]]''. It would set out ''a priori'' a 'pure part' of legal science, consisting of a framework of fundamental concepts. Then, in an empirical part of legal science, this framework would be applied to empirical (sociological, historical and so on) material so as to understand that material as 'law'.&lt;ref&gt;To suppose, as is still sometimes done, that Kelsen's title ''Reine Rechtslehre'' should be translated into English not as 'Pure Theory of Law' but as 'Theory of Pure Law' is therefore wrong, conceptually as well as grammatically. Grammatically, ''Reine Rechtslehre'' translates exactly as 'Pure Theory of Law'—'Theory of Pure Law' would have been ''Lehre des reinen Rechts''. This theory of law is a pure theory; it is not a theory of pure law.&lt;/ref&gt;

The science, in both of its parts, would also be 'pure' in a second sense, in being solely descriptive—excluding from the science any element of evaluation. The core subject matter of legal science, for Kelsen, is legal norms. He defines a 'norm' as 'the meaning of an act of will'. Thus, for Kelsen a norm does not necessarily have any element of generality—hence not all norms are rules. Indeed, as the meaning of an act of will, a norm is not intrinsically rational; departing from Kant both back toward [[David Hume]] as well as in the direction of contemporary philosophical [[positivism]], Kelsen denies the existence of [[practical reason]].

Legal science, as Kelsen would like it to be, has to describe a legal norm without either evaluating it or adopting it as an evaluation. This can be done by distinguishing rigorously between the social statement that is the norm itself and the legal-scientific restatement of it that is, or is contained in, a description of the norm. Kelsen terms the norm itself a 'legal norm (''Rechtsnorm'')' and its descriptive restatement a 'legal proposition (''Rechtssatz'')'.&lt;ref&gt;Translators into English have not always served Kelsen well on this. One translation renders ''Rechtssatz'' as 'rule of law in a descriptive sense'. Yet one can have sympathy for the translators; though Kelsen's reasoning is rigorous, his style cannot be described as limpid.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a jurist (legal scientist) states that the law of a certain country contains the norm 'theft is to be punished with imprisonment', this legal proposition is not a comment on whether anybody in that country has a moral or other extra-legal obligation to impose, accept or evade such a penalty. In reading Kelsen, however, one has to bear in mind that, when he refers to a 'norm', he is usually speaking elliptically: he is uttering a legal proposition which stands for a legal norm, in much the same way that a picture of a dog shows the dog but does not bark.

This kind of 'purity' already excludes ideas of [[natural law]], in which description and evaluation are intimately connected. That leaves as the subject matter of legal science only [[positive law]]. Kelsen is a '[[legal positivist]]' both in that he excludes evaluation from legal science, through a strict separation of 'is' and 'ought', and in that he considers only positive law to be law. Although he never made much sense of the idea of 'custom', he included all public international law as 'law'.

At the same time, although it is not easy to reconcile with his rejection of practical reason, Kelsen was emphatic that politicians should support and make use of legal science. And legal scientists should assist them, for instance in law reform. Although if, when doing so, they go beyond the role of mere technician and recommend policy-based choices between possible norms, they will no longer be acting as legal scientists. For Kelsen, 'is' and 'ought' occupy separate worlds as a matter of logic, but not in practice. Their logical separation should be incorporated into practice.

Kelsen insisted that, if social scientists wished to deal with law, they would have to take their concept of law from legal science—that is, from the Pure Theory of Law. Kelsen made this point particularly against [[Max Weber]], whose philosophical orientation and legal background were similar to his own. And, indeed, although Weber had said much about what is socially called 'law', he had not developed a clear concept of it himself.

===Legal orders===
For Kelsen as for other central European contemporaries, norms occur not singly but in sets, termed 'orders'. The ordering principle of an order of moral norms—and of an order of natural law, if one could exist—would be logical, as deduction. From the general norm 'do not kill other human beings', it follows deductively that A must not kill any other human being. Kelsen calls this a 'static' order. An order of positive law, he maintains, is not, or not centrally, like that. Although it forms a hierarchy, it is 'dynamic', in that its ordering principle is authorisation. Each relatively 'higher' norm authorises someone (an individual or an organ, primarily of the state) to create further and relatively 'lower' norms. In this is found the specific characteristic of positive law, hence of all law, that it regulates its own creation. Even though positive legal norms do commonly contain elements of generality, those elements are not central to the relation between a higher and a lower norm. This is a relation of legal 'validity' (not to be confused with logical validity), which is that the creation of the lower norm has been authorised by the higher norm. Since this moment of creation always involves extraneous considerations, Kelsen does not need to supplement his model with a concept of 'discretion'.

What has to be consistent in a dynamic order of norms is only the process of authorising. This process can (and perhaps always does) result in multiple and mutually uneven strands of hierarchy, such as legislative, executive and judicial strands.&lt;ref&gt;The hierarchy does not have to be, and probably will not be, even-sided, like a pyramid—although that image has been used by one of Kelsen's French translators. ''Reine Rechtslehre'', 2nd ed sec. 35, refers to ''Stufenbau'', which the French translation renders as ''pyramide'' while the English translation has 'hierarchical structure'. 'Steps and stairs' has also been suggested, but it might be best not to attempt an image.&lt;/ref&gt; In each strand, at every point in the process of norm-creation, many types of extra-legal factor may be taken into account—moral, political, economic and others. Kelsen notes that, in this respect, the Pure Theory of Law has an affinity with American '[[legal realism]]'.

At the same time, the 'hierarchy' model does not readily fit a common-law system. It takes as its paradigm a single constitutional document under which codes and statutes are enacted, with both administration and adjudication in subordinate places. However, at least outside the United States, common-law systems are moving in the direction of that paradigm. The 'hierarchy' model also fits public law more readily than private law. It is difficult to be convinced by Kelsen's contention that, in private transactions, the parties are exercising legal authorisation.

===Basic norm (''Grundnorm'')===
Kelsen assumes, however, that the scientific representation of a positive-legal order, as a hierarchy of legal propositions, must have a guarantor of unity. This guarantor cannot be other than a component of the representation, hence a legal proposition. Being a legal proposition, it counts as a representation of an actual norm. So Kelsen calls it, elliptically, a '[[basic norm]] (''Grundnorm'')'.&lt;ref&gt;It is a 'basis (''Grund'')' in a logical sense. Once again, it might be best not to attempt an image.&lt;/ref&gt; A basic norm is 'presupposed' in legal science for each order of positive law, to make it possible to understand that material as an order of positive law. This norm is simply that 'the historically first constitution is to be obeyed'. That constitution may have become established by custom or by revolution: the jurist does not evaluate the circumstances.

Kelsen was always aware that a 'constitution' (''Verfassung'') might or might not be a single document. In some legal orders, indeed, it can be difficult to draw a line between 'constitutional' and other norms. In 1964, Kelsen relativised the idea of 'constitution', holding that each relatively higher legal norm is a 'constitution' in relation to any norm created under its authority. This need not, however, wholly supersede a narrower sense of 'constitution', which identifies those relatively 'high' legal norms that can be changed only through a specially onerous process such as a large parliamentary majority or a popular referendum.

To presuppose a basic norm for a particular positive-legal order does not involve any moral or other extra-legal evaluation of the basic norm's requirement of obedience. The jurist simply supposes that such a requirement has been stated. The jurist does so, irrespective of whether any such norm can be empirically discovered. At this point, serious difficulties emerge—with which Kelsen wrestled for much of his long life.

One part of the problem lay in his starting point, the question 'Why should the law be obeyed?'. He gives the idea of a basic norm two roles. In one role, it is the guarantor of unity in legal-scientific representation of a positive-legal order. In another role, it is an answer, for that legal order, to the obedience question—put in the more clearly descriptive form, 'Why is the law binding?'. One might think, rather, that to suppose for a particular positive-legal order simply that the historically first constitution (identified on this occasion) 'is to be obeyed' is instead to assume that a reason for obedience has already been established outside the legal order and beyond the ken of legal science. In that case, legal science would be seriously inadequate. On the other hand, if the reason for the bindingness of a legal norm is intrinsic to its 'legal' character, that reason might have to be sought in the 'legal' form of the individual norm and not in any kind of further guarantee.

Another part of the problem lay in the requirement that the 'basic' factor be, or count as, a norm. Early on, Kelsen may have supposed that there could be such a real norm. Later, however, the 'basic norm' was relegated to being only a 'hypothesis'. In a philosophical light, nonetheless, it had the status—in Kantian terms—of a 'transcendental-logical presupposition', a logical condition for the possibility of a certain kind of knowledge.

Eventually, Kelsen accepted the criticism that the concept of a basic norm involves an infinite regress. If the basic norm of a particular positive-legal order is an authorising norm, one can ask what is the source of the authority of the basic norm itself. If 'is' and 'ought' are to remain entirely separated, that can only be a still more 'basic' norm; and then the same question could be asked again, and so on infinitely. At this point, Kelsen took a further step back, accepting that the concept of a basic norm is doubly contradictory: it is self-contradictory in that it involves an infinite regress; in addition, since no such norm actually exists, to presuppose the existence of such a norm contradicts reality. The concept is a full 'fiction' in the sense to be found in [[Hans Vaihinger]]'s 'philosophy of "as if"'. But then not much remains of it, although Kelsen evidently considered that what remained was vital.
 
And there Kelsen ended, committed to an epistemology that was so radically relativistic as to challenge the very idea of authorisation. Nonetheless, if Kelsen does not provide an effective answer to the obedience question, he has posed that question—and many others—with exceptional sophistication.

===Metaphysics and persons===
Ideas of natural law are also excluded by Kelsen's rejection of 'metaphysics' in a strong sense, supposing something supra-human. He similarly rejects duplication in ideas of 'the state' as a supra-human entity—rather than a mere, fictional personification of the national legal order. His main target, in the 1930s, was fascist theories of state and law, such as that of [[Carl Schmitt]]. But, for Kelsen, it is also an illusion to think that, in a ''Rechtsstaat'' (roughly, 'rule of law state'), 'the state' is wholly subject to law: from a 'legal point of view', the state and the positive-legal order are the same. It is likewise an illusion to think of a 'legal person', whether relating in fact to a number of real people or to a single real individual, as anything other than a fictional personification of a bundle of norms that are rights and duties pertaining to such people. This is simply so, however, only in the 'pure part' of legal science. Kelsen is perfectly well aware that, in the empirical part, 'the state' will turn out to be a heavily armed real apparatus. One can make a similar extrapolation for the reality of legal persons, where corporate legal persons would turn out to be organisations and individual legal persons to have gender, class, ethnicity and so on.

===Law and power===
Descriptively, the Pure Theory of Law has always been about power. A positive-legal order can be identified when there are norms that regulate their own creation through a process of authorisation and, in addition, the order itself is 'by and large effective'. Kelsen does not closely specify 'by and large', but he does attribute effectiveness to coercion. In this respect, there is some affinity with [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s 'command' theory of law. But Kelsen's approach is quite different from Austin's. Austin finds the defining characteristic of law on the plane of the signifier, in imperative utterances. Kelsen has almost no interest in the signifier but focuses on the signified: a 'norm' is an utterance that, whatever its grammatical form, has the meaning 'ought (''Sollen'')'.

Austin and Kelsen also differ in that, for Kelsen, legal norms are addressed primarily to officials. Officials are directed to apply sanctions to individuals when the individuals' behaviour does not conform to a pattern specified in the norm. It is anticipated that individuals, in choosing how they will behave, will take into account the possibility that an official will apply the sanction. In that way, norms and the orders to which they belong can be effective. However, most if not all jurists now accept [[H. L. A. Hart]]'s point in ''[[The Concept of Law]]'', though directed principally against Austin, that not all legal norms are coercive—some, and some of the most important, are facilitative. The Pure Theory of Law can accommodate this by accepting that what matters most is not whether particular legal norms are coercive but whether, by containing coercive norms, the legal order as a whole is coercive—which Hart does not deny.

===International and national law===
Identification of law as characteristically coercive is more difficult with public international law, but Kelsen finds sufficient sanctions.

As to the relation between public international law and national law, however, his position changed dramatically. In the first edition of ''Reine Rechtslehre'', 1934, like many liberal contemporaries he was an internationalist monist: he looked to public international law as global law, subsuming all national or state legal orders. This had the happy consequence that, in its contemporary application, the universality of the Pure Theory (and Kelsen insisted that only universal truths could be 'scientific') would coincide with that of predominantly global law.

By the end of World War II, however, he gave up on this aspiration as unrealistic and, with evident reluctance, accepted a sort of optional monism. He found equally tenable the view that the public international legal order is supremely valid and the view that each national or state legal order is—for itself, in a kind of 'solipsism'—supremely valid. The story of the 'basic norm' might be read as a battle to come to terms with the 'solipsist' option. Kelsen needed not to adopt such solipsism but to provide an account of it.

===Toward a general theory of norms===
From the mid-1960s until his death in 1973, Kelsen branched out into general theory of norms. In a longer view, it was a return to his youthful passion for philosophy. His notes on this were published posthumously in 1979 as ''Allgemeine Theorie der Normen'' and appeared in English translation in 1990 as ''General Theory of Norms''. This work, however, neither offers a completed general theory of norms nor goes far toward locating the Pure Theory of Law within a general theory of norms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1382">In [[general relativity]], the '''quadrupole formula''' describes the rate at which [[gravitational wave]]s are emitted from a system of masses based on the change of the (mass) [[quadrupole moment]]. The formula reads
:&lt;math&gt; \bar{h}_{ij}(t,r) = \frac{2 G}{c^4 r} \ddot{I}_{ij}(t-r/c), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \bar{h}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;: the spatial part of the [[trace reversed]] perturbation of the metric, i.e. the gravitational wave, and &lt;math&gt;I_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass quadrupole moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The formula was first obtained by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1916.

The theme of international mobility gives rise to a variety of projects and activities, from cultural events and revision days to e-mentoring and tutoring. These collaborations also aim at encouraging students to spend a year abroad during their studies, at widening access to language study and at promoting greater national capacity in the areas of employment that require proficiency in languages and enhance intercultural competence while helping to encourage a broader social profile of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russell's teapot''' is an [[analogy]], formulated by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims, rather than shifting the burden of ''disproof'' to others.  

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a [[teapot]], too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. 

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]], and has had influence in various fields and media.

== Description ==
In an article titled "Is There a God?" commissioned, but never published, by ''Illustrated'' magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:

{{quote|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Is There a God?

}}

In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:

{{quote|I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Gods of Olympus]] or [[Norse religion|Valhalla]]. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.&lt;ref name="garvey"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Garvey |title=Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence, and the Atheist's Teapot |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=9–22 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2010.10820011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
Chemist [[Peter Atkins]] said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. [[Occam's razor]] suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|editor=Clayton, Philip|editor2=Simpson, Zachary R.|first=Peter|last=Atkins|authorlink=Peter Atkins|contribution=Atheism and science|pages=129–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WhGyYy0SIoC|accessdate=2016-03-03|isbn=9780199279272|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosopher [[Paul Chamberlain]] says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chamberlain|title=Why People Don't Believe: Confronting Six Challenges to Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdNgqzawLAC&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3209-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like [[Mother Goose]] and the [[tooth fairy]], the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that "When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist."&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

In his books ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed "agnostic conciliation", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters.&lt;ref name="devchap"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4 | title-link = A Devil's Chaplain | chapter = The Great Convergence | pages = 146-151 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBRYZtOuqZcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.&lt;ref name = "goddel"&gt;{{cite book | title = The God Delusion | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2016 | edition = 10th Anniversary | isbn = 9781784161934 | title-link = The God Delusion | chapter = The Poverty of Agnosticism | pages = 69-77 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=emE7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist.&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt; Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it – each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: "the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms – the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is."&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent.&lt;ref name = "Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Right to Believe: Perspectives in Religious Epistemology | editor1-first = Dariusz | editor1-last = Łukasiewicz | editor2-first = Roger | editor2-last = Pouivet | first = Peter | last = van Inwagen | authorlink = Peter van Inwagen | chapter = Russell's China Teapot | pages = 11-26 | publisher = [[Ontos Verlag]] | location = Frankfurt | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783110320169 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bmyK32rqKf0C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Alvin Plantinga]] states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:

{{quote|Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with sufficiently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. No country with such capabilities is sufficiently frivolous to waste its resources by trying to send a teapot into orbit. Furthermore, if some country had done so, it would have been all over the news; we would certainly have heard about it. But we haven't. And so on. There is plenty of evidence against teapotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gutting|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Gutting|date = February 9, 2014|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/|title = Is Atheism Irrational?|accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response|date = August 11, 2010|accessdate = November 27, 2018|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = On Dawkins's Atheism: A Response|first = Gary|last = Gutting|authorlink = Gary Gutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], without believing in God, says that belief in God "is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot" because God is a "grand and big idea" which "is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur" and "because God cannot be [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], cannot be turned into a mere thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Wood|authorlink=James Wood (critic)|title=The Celestial Teapot|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=18 December 2006|issue=27|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-celestial-teapot|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Eric |last=Reitan |title=Contributors |publisher=Religion Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/ericreitan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.&lt;ref name=Reitan&gt;{{cite book | title = Is God a Delusion? |first = Eric |last=Reitan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 2008 | media_type = | pages = 78–80 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar analogies ==
Other thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as [[J. B. Bury]] in his 1913 book, ''History of Freedom of Thought'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter.... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of Freedom of Thought|edition= Illustrated Edition, published 2014 by [[Lulu Press, Inc.]]|isbn= 9781304988607 |last= Bury|first= John Bagnall|authorlink= J.

[[Astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394535128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:r7NWYii6Wt0C|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence in religious parodies ==
The concept of Russell's teapot has influenced more explicitly [[Parody religion|religion-parodying]] concepts such as the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]]&lt;ref name = "goddel"/&gt; and the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name="Wolf2006"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Church of the Non-Believers | first=Gary | last=Wolf | date=14 November 2006 | publisher=[[Wired News]] | url=https://www.wired.com/2006/11/atheism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s musician and psychedelic poet [[Daevid Allen]] of the band [[Gong (band)|Gong]] employed the image of a flying teapot in his [[Gong (band)#Mythology|Planet Gong Universe]] and the ''[[Flying Teapot (album)|Flying Teapot]]'' album trilogy, and refers to Russell's teapot in his book ''Gong Dreaming 2: The Histories &amp; Mysteries of Gong from 1969-1975''.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

'''Seascape ecology''' is a scientific discipline that deals with the causes and [[Ecology|ecological]] consequences of spatial pattern in the [[marine environment]], drawing heavily on conceptual and analytical frameworks developed in terrestrial [[landscape ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Wiens JA, Wu J, Urban DL (2017) Chapter 16: Landscape ecologist’s perspectives on seascape ecology. p485-494.

Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. For marine systems, the application of landscape ecology came about through a recognition that many of the concepts developed in the theory of [[island biogeography]]&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur RH,Wilson EO (1967) The Theory of Island Biogeography. Monographs in Population Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff DS (1974) Equilibrium theory of island biogeography and ecology. Annual review of Ecology and Systematics, 5(1), pp.161-182.&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of patch dynamics (precursors to modern landscape ecology) could be applicable to a range of marine environments from plankton patches &lt;ref&gt;Steele JH (1978) Spatial Pattern in Plankton Communities. Plenum Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; to patch reefs &lt;ref&gt;Molles MC Jr (1978) Fish species diversity on model and natural reef patches: experimental insular biogeography. Ecological Monographs 48: 289–305.&lt;/ref&gt;, intertidal mussel beds &lt;ref&gt;Paine RT, Levin SA (1981) Intertidal landscapes: disturbance and the dynamics of pattern.
Ecological Monographs 51(2): 145–178.&lt;/ref&gt; and seagrasses meadows &lt;ref&gt;McNeill SE, Fairweather PG (1993) Single large or several small marine reserves? An experimental approach with seagrass fauna. Journal of Biogeography 1: 429–440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins BD, Bell SS (1994) Seagrass landscapes: a terrestrial approach to the marine subtidal environment. Trends in Ecology and Evolution 9(8): 301–314.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Progress in the ecological understanding of spatial patterning was not confined to shallow seafloor environments. For the [[open ocean]], advances in ocean observing systems since the 1970s have allowed scientists to map, classify, quantify and track dynamic spatial structure in the form of [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], [[surface roughness]], currents, runoff plumes, ice, temperature fronts and plankton patches using oceanographic technologies – a theme increasingly referred to as pelagic seascape ecology &lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo M, Secor DH, Browman HI (2016) Observing and managing seascapes: linking synoptic oceanography, ecological processes, and geospatial modelling. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 73(7), pp.1825-1830.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh MT, Hales B, Saraceno M, Spitz YH, White AE, Letelier RM (2014) Hierarchical and dynamic seascapes: A quantitative framework for scaling pelagic biogeochemistry and ecology. Progress in Oceanography, 120, pp.291-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scales KL, Alvarez-Berastegui D, Embling C, Ingram S (2017) Chapter 3: Pelagic seascapes. p57-88. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;.Subsurface structures too, such as [[Internal wave|internal waves]], [[Thermocline|thermoclines]], [[Halocline|haloclines]], boundary layers and stratification resulting in distinct layering of organisms, is increasingly being mapped and modelled in multiple dimensions.

Like landscape ecologists, seascape ecologists are interested in the spatially explicit geometry of patterns and the relationships between pattern, ecological processes and environmental change. A central tenet in landscape ecology is that patch context matters, where local conditions are influenced by attributes of the surroundings. For instance, the physical arrangement of objects in space, and their location relative to other things, influences how they function&lt;ref&gt;Bell SS, McCoy ED, Mushinsky HR (EDS.). 1991. Habitat structure: the physical arrangement of objects in space. Chapman and Hall, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A landscape ecologist will ask different questions focused at different scales than other scientists, such as: What are the ecological consequences of different shaped patches, patch size, quality, edge geometry, spatial arrangement and diversity of patches across the landscape? At what scale(s) is structure most influential? How do landscape patterns influence the way that animals find food, evade predators and interact with competitors? How does human activity alter the structure and function of landscapes?

Several guiding principles that exist at the core of landscape ecology have made major contributions to terrestrial landscape planning and conservation, but in marine systems our understanding is still in its infancy. The first book on seascape ecology was published in December 2017&lt;ref&gt;Seascape Ecology edited by Simon J. Pittman http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119084431.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Seascapes are defined broadly as spatially heterogeneous and dynamic spaces that can be delineated at a wide range of scales in time and space. With regard to seascapes defined by sampling units, a 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; quadrat can be a valid seascape sample unit (SSU), just as can a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; analytical window in a geographical information system. The wide diversity of possible focal scales in marine ecology means that the term seascape cannot be used as an indication of scale, or a level of organisation.

== Seascape patterns ==
The sea exhibits complex spatial patterning that can be mapped and quantified, such as gradients in plant communities across [[Salt marsh|tidal saltmarshes]] or the intricate mosaics of patches typical of [[Coral reef|coral reefs]]&lt;ref&gt;Costa B, Walker BK, Dijkstra JA (2017) Chapter 2: Mapping and quantifying seascape patterns. p27-56. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. In the open ocean too, dynamic spatial structure in the form of water currents, eddies, temperature fronts and plankton patches can be measured readily&lt;ref&gt;Bakun A (1996) Patterns in the Ocean: Ocean Processes and Marine Population Dynamics.
University of California Sea Grant, San Diego, CA, United States in cooperation with
Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas de Noroeste, La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scales KL, Alvarez-Berastegui D, Embling C, Ingram S (2017) Chapter 3: Pelagic seascapes.
 p57-88. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. Physical processes such as storms dramatically influence spatial patterning in the environment and human activity can also directly create patch structure, modify mosaic composition and even completely remove elements of the seascape. Furthermore, climate-change induced shifts in species related to water temperature change and sea level rise are driving a gradual reconfiguration of the geography of species and habitats.

The patterns revealed by remote sensing devices are most often mapped and represented using two types of model: (1) collections of discrete patches forming mosaics e.g.  as represented in two-dimensional benthic habitat map, or (2) continuously varying gradients in three-dimensional terrain models e.g. in remotely sensed bathymetric data&lt;ref&gt;McGarigal K, Tagil S, Cushman SA (2009) Surface metrics: an alternative to patch metrics for the quantification of landscape structure. Landscape Ecology 24(3): 433–450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wedding L, Lepczyk C, Pittman S, Friedlander A, Jorgensen S (2011) Quantifying seascape structure: extending terrestrial spatial pattern metrics to the marine realm. Marine Ecology Progress Series 427: 219–232.&lt;/ref&gt;. In landscape ecology, patches can be classified into a binary patch-matrix model based on island biogeography theory where a focal habitat patch type (e.g. seagrasses) is surrounded by an inhospitable matrix (e.g. sand), or a patch-mosaic of interconnected patches, where the interactions of the parts influence the ecological function of the whole mosaic. Both patch and gradient models have provided important insights into the spatial ecology of marine species and biodiversity.

== Scale matters ==
Scale, the spatial or temporal dimensions of a phenomenon, is central to seascape ecology and the topic permeates all applications of a seascape ecology approach from conceptual models through to design of sampling, analyses and interpretation of results&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2001) The rise of the concept of scale in ecology: The concept of scale is evolving from verbal expression to quantitative expression. BioScience 51(7): 545–553.&lt;/ref&gt;. Species and life-stage responses to patchiness and gradients in environmental structure are likely to be scale dependent, therefore, scale selection is an important task in any ecological study. Seascape ecology acknowledges that decisions made for scaling ecological studies influence our perspective and ultimately our understanding of ecological patterns and processes&lt;ref&gt;Levin SA (1992) The problem of pattern and scale in ecology. Ecology 73: 1943–1967.&lt;/ref&gt;. Historically, marine scientists have played a significant role in communicating the importance of scale in ecology&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2017) Chapter 4: Scale and scaling in seascape ecology. p89-117. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, a physical oceanographer, [[Henry Stommel]], published a conceptual diagram that was to have a profound effect on all of the environmental sciences &lt;ref&gt;Vance TC, Doel RE (2010) Graphical methods and cold war scientific practice: The Stommel diagram’s intriguing journey from the physical to the biological environmental sciences. Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences 40: 1–47.&lt;/ref&gt;. The diagram &lt;ref&gt;Stommel H (1963) Varieties of oceanographic experience.

In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;. The oceanographer [[John Steele (oceanographer)|John Steele]] (1978) adapted the Stommel diagram to depict the spatial and temporal scales of patchiness in [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]] and [[fish]].

Measuring habitat structure at multiple scales is typical in seascape ecology, particularly where a single meaningful scale is not known or not meaningful to the ecological process of interest. Multi-scale measurements have been used to discover the scale at which populations are associated with key habitat features&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC, Piatt JF (1986) Scale-dependent correlation of seabirds with schooling fish in a coastal ecosystem. Marine Ecological Progress Series 32: 237–246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Brown KA (2011) Multi-scale approach for predicting fish species distributions across coral reef seascapes. PLoS ONE 6(5): e20583.&lt;/ref&gt;. With regard to scaling seascapes, one approach is to select spatial and temporal scales to be ecologically meaningful to the organism’s movements or other processes of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Hile SD, Caldow, C &amp; Monaco ME (2007) Using seascape types to explain the spatial patterns of fish using mangroves in Puerto Rico. Marine Ecology Progress Series 348, 273-284&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of information, or the lack of continuous observation on the way animals use space through time, can all too often result in insufficient consideration of seascape context potentially resulting in misleading conclusions on the primary drivers of ecological patterns and processes. Pittman and McAlpine (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ &amp; McAlpine CA (2003) Movements of marine fish and decapod crustaceans: Process, theory and application. Advances in Marine Biology 44, 205-294.&lt;/ref&gt; offer a multi-scale framework for scaling ecological studies that integrates hierarchy theory with movement ecology and the concept of ecological neighborhoods&lt;ref&gt;Addicott JF, Aho JM, Antolin MF, Padilla DK, Richardson JS, Soluk DA (1987) Ecological neighborhoods: scaling environmental patterns. Oikos 1:340-346.&lt;/ref&gt;. Here the focal scale is guided by the spatial and temporal scales relevant to an ecological process of interest. The focal scale is nested within a spatial hierarchy that incorporates patterns and processes at both finer and broader scales&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Davis B, Santos-Corujo RO (2017) Chapter 7: Animal movements through the seascape: Integrating movement ecology with seascape ecology. p189-227.

A '''software system''' is a [[system]] on intercommunicating [[software component|components]] based on [[software]] forming part of a [[computer system]] (a combination of [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and software). It "''consists of a number of separate [[Computer program|programs]], [[configuration file]]s, which are used to set up these programs, [[system documentation]], which describes the structure of the system, and [[user documentation]], which explains how to use the system''".&lt;ref name="sommerville" /&gt;

While a [[computer program]] is a set of instructions ([[source code|source]], or [[object code]]) a software system has many more components such as specification, test results, end-user documentation, maintenance records, etc.&lt;ref name=penny &gt;''Software Maintenance: Concepts and Practice'' by Penny Grubb and Armstrong A. Takang 2003 {{ISBN|981238426X}} pages 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term "software system" should be distinguished from the terms "[[computer program]]" and "[[software]]". The term computer program generally refers to a set of instructions ([[source code|source]], or [[object code]]) that perform a specific task. However, a software system generally refers to a more encompassing concept with many more components such as specification, test results, end-user documentation, maintenance records, etc.&lt;ref name="penny"/&gt;

The use of the term software system is at times related to the application of [[systems theory]] approaches in the context of [[software engineering]]. A software system consists of several separate computer programs and associated [[configuration file]]s, [[documentation]], etc., that operate together.&lt;ref name="sommerville"&gt;{{cite book | title=Software Engineering | publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] | author=Sommerville, Ian | year=2007 | pages=5–6 | section=1.1.1; What is software? | isbn=978-0-321-31379-9 | edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is used in the study of large and complex software, because it focuses on the major ''components'' of software and their ''interactions''. It is also related to the field of [[software architecture]].

Software systems are an active area of research for groups interested in [[software engineering]] in particular and [[systems engineering]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mpi-sws.org/ | title=The Max Planck Institute for Software Systems | accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic journals like the ''[[Journal of Systems and Software]]'' (published by [[Elsevier]]) are dedicated to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/jss/index.html | title=Journal of Systems and Software (JSS) | publisher=[[University of Trier]], Germany | work=[[DBLP]] | accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACM ''[[Software System Award]]'' is an annual award that honors people or an organization ''"for developing a software system that has had a lasting influence, reflected in contributions to concepts, in commercial acceptance, or both"''.&lt;ref name="acmaward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awards.acm.org/software_system/ |work=ACM Awards |title=Software System Award | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | accessdate=June 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been awarded by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) since 1983, with a cash prize sponsored by [[IBM]].

==Categories==
Major categories of software systems include those based on [[application software]], [[programming software]] and [[system software]], although the distinction can sometimes be difficult. Examples of software systems include [[operating system]]s, [[computer reservations system]]s, [[air traffic control]] systems, military command and control systems, [[telecommunication network]]s, [[content management system]]s, [[database management system]]s, [[expert system]]s, [[embedded system]]s etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">'''The Lovers' Guide''' is a sex and relationships advice brand, produced by Lifetime Productions International Ltd, which launched with the release of the first ''Lovers' Guide'' video in 1991. Presented by the sexologist Dr Andrew Stanway, and produced by [[Robert Page (Lifetime Group)|Robert Page]] and William Campbell, this became the only non-fiction film to top the UK video charts; it sold 1.3 million copies in the UK and went into 13 languages and 22 countries around the world. The release caused controversy. While the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] (British Board of Film Classification) granted the title an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]], which would normally be a license for general UK distribution, this was technically merely advisory and the producer, Robert Page, faced charges of obscenity, which were subsequently dropped.

''The Lovers' Guide'' is distinct for using explicit video material to illustrate the instructional points being made. While the explicit nature of the visual content would usually warrant an [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] in the UK, restricting sales to licensed sex shops, all ''Lovers' Guide'' videos and DVDs have been granted 18 certificates.

''Lovers' Guide'' products has expanded to ten further DVDs, a book, an encyclopaedia, two CD-ROMs and cassettes and CDs of the soundtracks. It has also been shown on encrypted television. These have been produced, distributed and retailed with partners such as W.H. Smith, Woolworths, Carlton, Bloomsbury, Warners, Sony and Universal. The brand website is [http://www.loversguide.com/].

'''Tomislav Volek''', is a Czech musicologist who is best known for his research on the music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].

==Biography==
Spending much of his career in Prague, Volek made a virtue of necessity by exploring the musical life of eighteenth-century Bohemia, with particular emphasis on Mozart’s activities in Prague. Meticulous archival research combined with a willingness to advance daring new hypotheses led to a series of pathbreaking articles, one of which, ''“Über den Ursprung von Mozarts Oper [[La clemenza di Tito]]”'' (''Mozart-Jahrbuch'', 1959), contributed to a fundamental reassessment of one of Mozart’s late operas, although some of his theories, especially the claim that Mozart began work on the opera much earlier than the summer of 1791, have been thoroughy refuted in English-language musicological literature.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of this literature, see Daniel E. Freeman, ''Mozart in Prague'' (2013), pp. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His work on ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and its Bohemian context is also of crucial importance, as is his edition of Mozart documents, ''“The Mozartiana of Czech and Moravian Archives”'' (Prague, 1991).

Volek is President of the Czech Mozart Society and a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

==Religion and mythology==
{{Main article|Trees in mythology}}
Various trees of life are recounted in [[folklore]], [[culture]] and [[fiction]], often relating to [[immortality]] or [[fertility]]. They had their origin in religious symbolism.

===Ancient Iran===
[[File:Detail of a rhyton from Marlik, Iran, 1000 BC.jpg|thumb|Tree of life on a rhyton from [[Marlik]], Iran, currently at the [[National Museum of Iran]].]]

In the [[Avestan]] literature and [[Iranian mythology]], there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: [[Amesha Spenta]] [[Amordad]] (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), [[Gaokerena]] (or white [[Haoma]], a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]] (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), [[Barsom]] (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or [[Haoma]] that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), [[Haoma]] (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_36319.html |title = Plant of life, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date = 2013|publisher = Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 15. |last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaokerena]] is a large, sacred [[Haoma]] planted by [[Ahura Mazda]]. [[Ahriman]] (Ahreman, Angremainyu) created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, [[Ahura Mazda]] created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Because [[Ahriman]] is responsible for all evil including death, while [[Ahura Mazda]] is responsible for all good (including life).

[[haoma]] is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.

Haoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit ''soma''. The near identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254670/haoma |title=haoma (Zoroastrianism) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haoma-i |title=HAOMA i. BOTANY – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related issue in ancient mythology of [[Iran]] is the myth of [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]], two trees who were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the [[creation myth]] where living beings are created by Gods (who have a human form).

===Ancient Mesopotamia and Urartu===
[[File:Rilievi in alabastro da palazzo di ashurnasirpal II a nimrud, albero sacro, 883-859 ac ca. 01.JPG|thumb|upright|Assyrian tree of life, from [[Nimrud]] panels.]]
The [[Assyria]]n tree of life was represented by a series of nodes and criss-crossing lines. It was apparently an important religious symbol, often attended to in [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] by human or eagle-headed [[winged genie]]s, or the King, and blessed or fertilized with [[bucket and cone]]. [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] have not reached consensus as to the meaning of this symbol. The name "Tree of Life" has been attributed to it by modern scholarship; it is not used in the Assyrian sources. In fact, no textual evidence pertaining to the symbol is known to exist.
[[File:Urartu Helmet Fragment 2~.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Urartu|Urartian]] tree of life]]

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' is a similar quest for immortality. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], Etana searches for a 'plant of birth' to provide him with a son. This has a solid provenance of antiquity, being found in [[cylinder seal]]s from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] (2390–2249 [[Common Era|BCE]]).

In ancient [[Urartu]], the tree of life was a religious symbol and was drawn on walls of fortresses and carved on the armor of warriors. The branches of the tree were equally divided on the right and left sides of the stem, with each branch having one leaf, and one leaf on the apex of the tree. Servants stood on each side of the tree with one of their hands up as if they are taking care of the tree.

===Baha'i Faith===
{{see also|Sidrat al-Muntaha}}
The concept of the tree of life appears in the writings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], where it can refer to the [[Manifestation of God]], a great teacher who appears to humanity from age to age.  An example of this can be found in the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = Adib |authorlink = Adib Taherzadeh |year = 1976 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher = George Ronald |place = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-270-8 |url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/Cover.html |pages = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazemi, Farshid (2009). ''[http://bahai-library.com/kazemi_mysteries_alast Mysteries of Alast: The Realm of Subtle Entities and the Primordial Covenant in the Babi-Bahá'í Writings]''. Bahá'í Studies Review 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|"Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, when in those hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were all gathered in My presence beneath the shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the all-glorious paradise? Awestruck ye listened as I gave utterance to these three most holy words: O friends! Prefer not your will to Mine, never desire that which I have not desired for you, and approach Me not with lifeless hearts, defiled with worldly desires and cravings. Would ye but sanctify your souls, ye would at this present hour recall that place and those surroundings, and the truth of My utterance should be made evident unto all of you."}}

Also, in the ''[[Tablet of Ahmad (Arabic)|Tablet of Ahmad]]'' of Bahá'u'lláh: "Verily He is the Tree of Life, that bringeth forth the fruits of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tablet of Ahmad |url=http://www.bahaiprayers.org/ahmad.htm |website=www.bahaiprayers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh refers to his male descendants as branches ({{lang-ar|ﺍﻏﺼﺎﻥ}} [[Aghsán|''ʾaghṣān'']]) &lt;ref name="Smith-aghsan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Aghsán |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calls women leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Liya, Sally (2004). [http://bahai-library.com/liya_trees_symbols_religions The Use of Trees as Symbols in the World Religions] in: Solas, 4. Donegal, Ireland. Association for Baha'i Studies English-Speaking Europe. P. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction has been made between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The latter represents the physical world with its opposites, such as good and evil and light and dark. In a different context from the one above, the tree of life represents the spiritual realm, where this duality does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
The ''Bo'' tree, also called ''[[Bodhi]]'' tree,  according to Buddhist tradition, is the pipal ([[Ficus religiosa]]) under which the Buddha sat when he attained Enlightenment (Bodhi) at Bodh Gaya (near Gaya, west-central Bihar state, India). A living pipal at Anuradhapura, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), is said to have grown from a cutting from the Bo tree sent to that city by King Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70648/Bo-tree |title=Bo tree (tree) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tibetan tradition when Buddha went to the holy Lake Manasorovar along with 500 monks, he took with him the energy of Prayaga Raj. Upon his arrival, he installed the energy of Prayaga Raj near Lake Manasorovar, at a place now known as Prayang. Then he planted the seed of this eternal banyan tree next to Mt. Kailash on a mountain known as the "Palace of Medicine Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1/12/2001 |title=The Kumbha Mela Times |publisher=Kmt.himalayaninstitute.org |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207041420/http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1%2F12%2F2001 |archivedate=December 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Fusang}}
In [[Chinese mythology]], a carving of a tree of life depicts a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] and a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]; the dragon often represents immortality.  A [[Taoism|Taoist]] story tells of a tree that produces a [[peaches of immortality|peach of immortality]] every three thousand years, and anyone who eats the fruit receives immortality.

An [[archaeological]] discovery in the 1990s was of a sacrificial pit at [[Sanxingdui]] in [[Sichuan]], [[China]]. Dating from about 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]], it contained three [[bronze]] trees, one of them 4 meters high.  At the base was a dragon, and fruit hanging from the lower branches.  At the top is a bird-like (Phoenix) creature with claws.  Also found in Sichuan, from the late [[Han dynasty]] (c 25 – 220 CE), is another tree of life. The [[ceramic]] base is guarded by a horned beast with wings.  The leaves of the tree represent coins and people.  At the apex is a bird with coins and the [[Sun]].

===Christianity===
{{See also|Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of the knowledge of good and evil#Christianity}}
The tree of life first appears in Genesis 2:9 and 3:22-24 as the source of [[Immortality|eternal life]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], from which access is revoked when man is driven from the garden. It then reappears in the last book of the Bible, the [[Book of Revelation]], and most predominantly in the last chapter of that book (Chapter 22) as a part of the new garden of paradise. Access is then no longer forbidden, for those who "wash their robes" (or as the textual variant in the King James Version has it, "they that do his commandments") "have right to the tree of life" (v.14). A similar statement appears in Rev 2:7, where the tree of life is promised as a reward to those who overcome. Revelation 22 begins with a reference to the "pure river of water of life" which proceeds "out of the throne of God". The river seems to feed two trees of life, one "on either side of the river" which "bear twelve manner of fruits" "and the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations" (v.1-2).&lt;ref&gt;The Bible (King James version), The Revelation of St. John, chapter &amp; verses as noted.&lt;/ref&gt; Or this may indicate that the tree of life is a vine that grows on both sides of the river, as John 15:1 would hint at.

{{quote|All these things stood for something other than what they were, but all the same they were themselves bodily realities. And when the narrator mentioned them he was not employing figurative language, but giving an explicit account of things which had a forward reference that was figurative. So then the tree of life also was Christ... and indeed God did not wish the man to live in Paradise without the mysteries of spiritual things being presented to him in bodily form. So then in the other trees he was provided with nourishment, in this one with a sacrament... He is rightly called whatever came before him in order to signify him.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, The Literal Meaning of Genesis, VIII, 4, 8 (On Genesis, New City Press, p. 351-353)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Eastern Christianity the tree of life is the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Isaac the Syrian says that "Paradise is the love of God, in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained," and that "the tree of life is the love of God" (Homily 72).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{main article|Tree of life vision}}
The tree of life vision is a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] described and discussed in the [[Book of Mormon]]. According to the Book of Mormon, the vision was received in a [[dream]] by the prophet [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], and later in vision by his son [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], who wrote about it in the [[First Book of Nephi]]. The vision includes a path leading to a tree symbolizing [[salvation]], with an iron rod along the path whereby followers of [[Jesus]] may hold to the rod and avoid wandering off the path into pits or waters symbolizing the ways of sin. The vision also includes a large building wherein the wicked look down at the righteous and mock them.

The vision is said to symbolize the spiritual plight of humanity and is a well known and cited story within [[Mormonism]]. A Mormon commentator reflected a common Mormon belief that the vision is "one of the richest, most flexible, and far-reaching pieces of symbolic prophecy contained in the standard works [scriptures]."&lt;ref&gt;Corbin T. Volluz, "Lehi's Dream of the Tree of Life: Springboard to Prophecy," JBMS 2/2 (1993): 38. - as quoted in  Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life: Understanding the Dream as Visionary Literature, Charles Swift, Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 2005.

===Europe===
[[File:Husaby Church 2013 11th century Tree of Life sculpture.jpg|thumb|upright|11th century tree of life sculpture at an ancient [[Sweden|Swedish]] church]]
In ''Dictionnaire Mytho-Hermetique'' (Paris, 1737), [[Antoine-Joseph Pernety]], a famous [[alchemy|alchemist]], identified the tree of life with the [[Elixir of life]] and the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

In ''[[Stephen Oppenheimer#Eden in the East|Eden in the East]]'' (1998), [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] suggests that a tree-worshipping culture arose in [[Indonesia]] and was diffused by the so-called "Younger Dryas" event of c. 10,900 BCE or 12,900 BP, after which the sea level rose. This culture reached China (Szechuan), then [[India]] and the [[Middle East]]. Finally the Finno-Ugric strand of this diffusion spread through [[Russia]] to [[Finland]] where the Norse myth of [[Yggdrasil]] took root.

===Georgia===
The [[Borjgali]] ({{lang-ka|ბორჯღალი}}) is an ancient [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] tree of life symbol.

===Germanic paganism and Norse mythology===
In [[Germanic paganism]], trees played (and, in the form of reconstructive Heathenry and [[Germanic Neopaganism]], continue to play) a prominent role, appearing in various aspects of surviving texts and possibly in the name of gods.

The tree of life appears in [[Norse mythology|Norse religion]] as ''[[Yggdrasil]]'', the world tree, a massive tree (sometimes considered a [[European yew|yew]] or [[ash tree]]) with extensive lore surrounding it.  Perhaps related to Yggdrasil, accounts have survived of [[Germanic people|Germanic Tribes]]' honouring sacred trees within their societies.  Examples include [[Thor's Oak]], [[sacred grove]]s, the [[Sacred tree at Uppsala]], and the wooden [[Irminsul]] pillar. In [[Norse Mythology]], the apples from [[Iðunn]]'s ash box provide immortality for the gods.

{{see also|Sidrat al-Muntaha}}
The "Tree of Immortality" (Arabic: شجرة الخلود) is the tree of life motif as it appears in the [[Quran]]. It is also alluded to in hadiths and tafsir. Unlike the [[Tree of life (biblical)|biblical account]], the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, also called the tree of immortality, which Allah specifically forbade to Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler |first=Brannon |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo9jAavEHdIC&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tree+in+the+shade%22&amp;f=false |title=Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis |edition=annotated |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0826449566 |page=24 |quote=''Abu Hurayrah'': The Prophet Muhammad said: "In Paradise is a tree in the shade of which the stars course 100 years without cutting it: the Tree of Immortality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Oliver Leaman |year=2006 |editor-link=Oliver Leaman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=%22special%20tree%20in%20Eden%22&amp;f=false |title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415326391 |page=11 |quote=Unlike the biblical account of Eden, the Qur'an mentions only one special tree in Eden, the Tree of Immortality, from which Adam and Eve were prohibited.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satan repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, thus disobeying Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Three Translations of the Koran (Al-Qur'an) Side by Side {{cite quran|20|120|s=ns}}, "Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away? S: But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to him; he said: O Adam! Shall I guide you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which decays not? "&lt;/ref&gt; The hadiths also speak about other trees in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Muhammad Ali (2011) ''Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur'an'' "This in itself gives an indication that it is the well-known tree of evil, for both good and evil are compared to two trees in {{cite quran|14|24|e=25|s=ns|b=n}} and elsewhere. This is further corroborated by the devil's description of it as “the tree of immortality” ({{cite quran|20|120|s=ns|b=n}}), ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Indian [[Ahmadiyya]] movement founded in 1889, Quranic reference to the tree is symbolic; eating of the forbidden tree signifies that Adam disobeyed God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/original_sin.html | title=Quran, Adam and Original Sin | publisher=Al Islam | author=Bilal Khalid | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=87&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2 | title=The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary Volume 1 | page=86 | publisher=Islam International Publications | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish sources===
{{main article|Etz Chaim|Tree of life (biblical)|l2=Biblical tree of life}}
''[[Etz Chaim]]'', Hebrew for "tree of life," is a common term used in Judaism. The expression, found in the [[Book of Proverbs]], is figuratively applied to the [[Torah]] itself.  ''Etz Chaim'' is also a common name for [[yeshiva]]s and [[synagogue]]s as well as for works of [[Rabbinic literature]]. It is also used to describe each of the wooden poles to which the parchment of a [[Sefer Torah]] is attached.

The tree of life is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]]; it is distinct from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. After [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] disobeyed God by eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were driven out of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Remaining in the garden, however, was the tree of life. To prevent their access to this tree in the future, [[cherubs|Cherubim]] with a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|9}})

In the Book of Proverbs, the tree of life is associated with [[wisdom]]: "[Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy ''[is every one]'' that retaineth her." ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|3:13-18|9}}) In {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|15:4|HE}} the tree of life is associated with calmness: "A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;For other direct references to the tree of life in the Jewish biblical canon, see also {{bibleverse||Proverbs|11:30|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|13:12|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]], generally considered [[biblical canon|non-canonical]], states that in the time of the great judgment God will give all those whose names are in the [[Book of Life]] fruit to eat from the tree of life.&lt;!-- where in Enoch? --&gt;

====Kabbalah====

Jewish [[mysticism]] depicts the tree of life in the form of ten interconnected nodes, as the central symbol of the [[Kabbalah]]. It comprises the ten ''[[Sefirot]]'' powers in the divine realm. The [[panentheistic]] and [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|anthropomorphic]] emphasis of this [[Emanationism|emanationist]] theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, and the purpose of Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the ''Sefirot'', restoring harmony to Creation. From the time of the [[Renaissance]] onwards, Jewish Kabbalah became incorporated as an important tradition in non-Jewish Western culture, first through its adoption by [[Christian Kabbalah]], and continuing in [[Western esotericism]] occult [[Hermetic Qabalah]]. These adapted the Judaic Kabbalah tree of life [[Syncretism|syncretically]] by associating it with other religious traditions, esoteric theologies, and magical practices.

===Mesoamerica===
{{Main article|Mesoamerican world tree}}
The concept of world trees is a prevalent motif in [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Religious cosmology|cosmologies]] and [[iconography]]. World trees embodied the four [[cardinal directions]], which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic ''[[axis mundi]]'' connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Mary |authorlink=Mary Miller (art historian) |author2=[[Karl Taube]] |year=1993 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=978-0-500-05068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Izapa]]n, [[Mixtec]], [[Olmec]], and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a ''[[ceiba]]'' tree, and is known variously as a ''wacah chan'' or ''yax imix che'', depending on the [[Mayan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Raising the sky: The Maya creation myth and the Milky Way|work=The Real Maya Prophecies: Astronomy in the Inscriptions and Codices |url=http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |publisher=Maya Astronomy |accessdate=9 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106021734/http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |archivedate=6 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright [[caiman]], whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt;

Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in [[Mesoamerican calendars]], and the directional colors and deities. [[Mesoamerican codices]] which have this association outlined include the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Codex Borgia|Borgia]] and [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer]] [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt; It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.

World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a "water-monster," symbolic of the underworld). The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freidel, David A. |author2=[[Linda Schele]] |author3=Joy Parker |year=1993 |title=Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path |publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-688-10081-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In a myth passed down among the [[Iroquois]], ''The World on the Turtle's Back'', explains the origin of the land in which a tree of life is described. According to the myth, it is found in the heavens, where the first humans lived, until a pregnant woman fell and landed in an endless sea. Saved by a giant turtle from drowning, she formed the world on its back by planting bark taken from the tree.

The tree of life motif is present in the traditional [[Ojibway]] cosmology and traditions. It is sometimes described as Grandmother Cedar, or ''Nookomis Giizhig'' in [[Anishinaabemowin]].

In the book [[Black Elk Speaks]], [[Black Elk]], an Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux) ''wičháša wakȟáŋ'' ([[medicine man]] and holy man), describes his vision in which after dancing around a dying tree that has never bloomed he is transported to the other world (spirit world) where he meets wise elders, 12 men and 12 women.  The elders tell Black Elk that they will bring him to meet "Our Father, the two-legged chief" and bring him to the [[Axis mundi|center of a hoop]] where he sees the tree in full leaf and bloom and the "chief" standing against the tree. Coming out of his trance he hopes to see that the earthly tree has bloomed, but it is dead.&lt;ref name="First People"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/Black-Elk-Speaks-Visions-of-the-Other-World.html | title=Black Elk Speaks | publisher=First People of America and Canada - Turtle Island. | work=Visions of the Other World | accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serer religion ===
In [[Serer religion]], the tree of life as a religious concept forms the basis of [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]]. Trees were the first things created on Earth by the supreme being [[Roog]] (or [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]). In the competing versions of the [[Serer people|Serer]] creation myth, the ''Somb'' (''[[Prosopis africana]]'') and the ''Saas'' tree ([[Faidherbia albida|acacia albida]]) are both viewed as trees of life.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; However, the prevailing view is that, the ''Somb'' was the first tree on Earth and the progenitor of [[plant species|plant life]].&lt;ref name="Serer"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La Civilisation [[Serer people|Sereer]] - ''Pangool''", vol. 2., Les Nouvelles Editions [[Africa]]ines du [[Senegal]] (1990), pp 125–6, 199–200, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} &amp; {{en icon}} Niangoran-Bouah, Georges, "L'univers Akan des poids à peser l'or : les poids dans la société", Les nouvelles éditions africaines - MLB, (1987), p 25, {{ISBN|2723614034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Somb'' was also used in the [[Serer ancient history|Serer tumuli and burial chambers]], many of which had survived for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; Thus, ''Somb'' is not only the tree of life in Serer society, but the symbol of immortality.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt;

===Turkic===
[[File:Flag of Chuvashia.svg|thumb|The tree of life, as seen as in [[flag of Chuvashia]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] state in the [[Russian Federation]]]]
The World Tree or tree of life is a central symbol in [[Turkic mythology]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It is a common [[kilim motifs|motif in carpets]]. In 2009 it was introduced as the main design of the common [[Turkish lira]] sub-unit 5 [[kuruş]].

===Hinduism===

In the sacred books of Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma), Puranas mention divine tree Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). This divine tree is guarded by Gandharvas in the garden of Amaravati, city under the control of Indra, King of gods. Popular story goes like this, for a very long time, gods and demi-gods who are believed to be fathered by Kashyapa Prajapati and have different mothers. After a long time frequent battles between the two half-brother clans, both groups decided to churn the milky ocean to obtain Amrutam (అమృతం, अमृत ) and share equally. During the churning, along with many other mythical items emerged the Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). It is gold in colour. It has mesmerizing aura. It can be pleased with chanting and offers. When it is pleased, it grants every wish. 

==Popular culture==
Austrian [[symbolist]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] portrayed his version of the tree of life in his painting, ''[[The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze]]''.  This iconic painting later inspired the external facade of the "New Residence Hall" (also called the "Tree House"), a colorful 21-story student residence hall at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Masco&gt;{{cite web|title=MassArt Residence Story: This is the house that collaboration built|url=http://www.masco.org/news/sp-house-collaboration-built|work=MASCO: Medical Academic and Scientific Community Organization|publisher=MASCO, Inc.|accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Herbert]]'s poem ''[[s:The Sacrifice|The Sacrifice]]'' (part of ''[[George Herbert#Works|The Temple]]'', 1633), the tree of life is the [[rood]] on which Jesus Christ was crucified. In [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the tree of life plays a role, especially in the sixth published book (the first in the in-world chronology) ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]''.

[[Alex Proyas]]' 2009 film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' ends with the two young protagonists directed towards the tree of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.tvguide.com/knowing/review/296881 | title=''Knowing'': Review | first=Cammila | last=Albertson | newspaper=[[TV Guide]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | year=2009| accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Supernatural (season 13)|season 13]] of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', fruit from the tree of life is an important ingredient in a spell to open a portal to an alternate reality. The angel [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]] is able to find the tree in [[Syria]] and returns from a mission with the fruit in ''[[Scoobynatural]]''. The fruit is used in subsequent episodes as part of the spell to open the portal between the worlds.

The '''World Forestry Center''' is a nonprofit educational institution in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].  Located near the [[Oregon Zoo]] in [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]], the organization was established in 1964{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} as the '''Western Forestry Center''', with the actual building opening in 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"&gt;"New forestry center opens" (June 6, 1971). ''The Sunday Oregonian'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wfchist"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:P15exhibw.jpg|thumb|Forestry Building in 1905]]
The  World Forestry Center has its roots in the 1905 [[Lewis &amp; Clark Centennial Exposition|Lewis and Clark Centennial American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair]] for which an enormous [[log cabin]] was built of huge native trees and advertised as the world's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public interest in the '''Forestry Building''', which was turned over to the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]], lasted long after the exposition ended, right up until it was destroyed by fire on August 17, 1964.&lt;ref name="wfchist"&gt;{{cite web

The day after the fire, a group of civic and industry leaders conceived The Western Forestry Center.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} A new, more fire-resistant forestry building designed by Oregon architect [[John Storrs (architect)|John Storrs]] was built in Washington Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} It opened to the public on June 5, 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"/&gt;  The name was changed to "World Forestry Center" in 1986 to reflect the center's revised focus on forestry on a global scale.&lt;ref name="wfchist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new name"&gt;Hill, Alma (January 4, 1986). "Forestry center gets new name". ''The Oregonian'', p. C2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2005, after a $7 million, 6-month renovation, the {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} museum reopened with new interactive exhibits about the sustainability of forests and trees of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Programs==
The World Forestry Center's mission is to "educate and inform people about the world's forests and trees, and their importance to all life, in order to promote a balanced and [[sustainability|sustainable]] future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.worldforestrycenter.org/organization/wfc_aboutus.php

The center achieves its mission with three programs: the Discovery Museum, two donated working forests—the Magness Memorial Tree Farm and the Johnson-Swanson Tree Farm—and the World Forest Institute which was established in 1989. The primary program is the International Fellowship Program.

In 1989, the World Forestry Center established the World Forest Institute to meet a growing demand for forestry information.  As the forestry sector becomes increasingly complex, there is a greater need for international collaboration and exchange of information on forest trade, regulation, management, and forest resources. The World Forest Institute was created through the vision and support of [[Harry Merlo|Harry A. Merlo]], a pioneer of the forest products industry, and an early visionary of the globalization of the forestry sector.

[[File:World Forestry Center.jpg|thumb|left|The forestry center in 2016]]
The fellowship program brings young forestry and forest products professionals from around the world to work at the World Forest Institute for 6 to 12 months.  Fellows are commonly sponsored by their employer, government institutions, the forest industry, or an NGO, and carry out applied research projects of interest to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/03/world_forestry_program_sends_a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to completing a practical research project, the program works to get Fellows a broad exposure to natural resource management in the U.S. so that when they return to their home countries they have a basic understanding of the owners and managers of land and natural resources throughout the country.

The institute won the 2012 Portland Mayor's International Business Award from the Oregon Consular Corps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFAaHSSvLro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://portland4biz.com/portland-international-business-awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/05/in_downtown_portland_awards_an.html&lt;/ref&gt; This award recognizes businesses that contribute to a global environment in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/?c=51108&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Forestry Center campus also accommodates three other buildings: Julian N. Cheatham Hall, Harold A. Miller Hall and Harry A. Merlo Hall, which houses the administrative offices and the World Forest Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Leadership Hall of Fame===
The Leadership Hall of Fame commemorates people who have made important contributions to [[forestry]].  The photographs and biographies of nearly 200 forestry leaders are displayed in three chests constructed of select [[Black Walnut]] from the [[Eastern United States|eastern U.S.]]

==Public access==
Parking at the World Forestry Center costs $2 per hour, to a maximum of $8 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorewashingtonpark.org/parking# |title=Explore Washington Park|publisher=Washington Park Transportation Management Association |accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Park (MAX station)|Washington Park light rail station]] provides regional [[Public transport|public transit]] access to the World Forestry Center. Additionally, [[TriMet]] bus route 63-Washington Park provides daily service to the World Forestry Center via Washington Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trimet.org/schedules/r063.htm |title=Bus Line 63-Washington Park |publisher= TriMet|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Z Pulsed Power Facility''', informally known as the '''Z machine''', is the largest high frequency [[electromagnetic wave]] generator in the world and is designed to test materials in conditions of extreme temperature and pressure. Since its refurbishment in October 1996&lt;ref name="sandia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/zpinch.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories - News Releases |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609044428/http://www.sandia.gov/media/zpinch.htm |archive-date=2015-06-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been used primarily as an [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research facility.
Operated by [[Sandia National Laboratories]], it gathers data to aid in [[computer modeling]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s and eventual [[Nuclear power|nuclear fusion pulsed power plants]]. The Z machine is located at Sandia's main site in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].

==Origins==
{{see also|Fusion power#History of research}}
The Z machine origins can be traced from the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] needing to replicate the [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reactions]] of a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear bomb]] in a lab environment to better understand the physics involved.

Since the 1970s the DoE had been looking into [[List of fusion power technologies|ways]] to [[fusion power|generate electricity from fusion reactions]], with continuous reactions such as [[tokamak]]s or discrete fusion of small balls of light atoms. Since at the time lasers were far from having the required power, the main approach considered was heavy ion fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/faq-s#TOC-What-is-heavy-ion-fusion- |title=FAQs |publisher=Fusionpowercorporation.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010153/http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/faq-s#TOC-What-is-heavy-ion-fusion- |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However major advances such as [[Q-switching]] and [[mode-locking]] made [[laser]]s an option (culminating in the [[National Ignition Facility]]) and the Heavy Ion Fusion programs became more or less dormant. In 1985, the review of DoE's program by the National Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/1985-icf-review-by-the-national-academies |title=1985 ICF Review by the National Academies |publisher=Fusionpowercorporation.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010156/http://www.fusionpowercorporation.com/1985-icf-review-by-the-national-academies |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated "The energy crisis is dormant for the time being". Heavy ion fusion machines were tasked to help military research improve [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bombs]].

The first research at Sandia dates back from 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/particle-beam-fusion-program-publications-and-related-reports-january-1971-to-july-1979/oclc/079670227 |title=Particle beam fusion program publications and related reports, January 1971 to July 1979 (Book, 1979) |publisher=WorldCat.org |date=2015-05-02 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621010434/http://www.worldcat.org/title/particle-beam-fusion-program-publications-and-related-reports-january-1971-to-july-1979/oclc/079670227 |archive-date=2015-06-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Gerold Yonas&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Rd2P4Mvj7vw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnsl.org/Documents/GerryYonas_shortbio.pdf |format=PDF |title=Gerry Yonas : Resume |publisher=Bnsl.org |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620231327/http://www.bnsl.org/Documents/GerryYonas_shortbio.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated and directed the particle-beam fusion program.

In the December 1976 issue of Popular Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 |title=Popular Science |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1976 conference proceedings published in 1977, an article titled "Particle Beam Fusion Research"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/physics/FEC/STIPUB439_VOL1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research 1976 : Vol. 1 |publisher=Naweb.iaea.org |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225931/http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/physics/FEC/STIPUB439_VOL1.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; described early work and first generation machines: Hydra (1972); Proto I (1975); Proto II (1977); EBFA/PBFA (electronic beam fusion accelerator/particle beam fusion accelerator) (1980).

In 1985, the PBFA-II was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/saturn.htm |title=Saturn News Release |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094201/http://www.sandia.gov/media/saturn.htm |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harrison, J.L. |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/5700471-2njsdC/5700471.pdf |title=PBFA control and monitor system &amp;#124; SciTech Connect |publisher=Osti.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandia continued to target heavy ion fusion at a slow pace despite the National Academies report.

The November 1978 issue of Scientific American carried Yonas' first general-public article, "Fusion power with particle beams".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fusion power with particle beams |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=|bibcode=1978SciAm.239...50Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, defense-related research was also ongoing at Sandia with the Hermes III machine and Saturn (1987), upgraded from PBFA-I, which operated at lower total power than PBFA-II but advanced Sandia's knowledge in high voltage and high current and was therefore a useful predecessor to the Z machine.

In 1996, the US Army published a report&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130619090333/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/md/md1400/md1450/data/md1450data.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; on the decommissioning of the Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator. This report is useful in understanding ties between nuclear arms testing and inertial fusion energy research.

Also in 1996, the PBFA-II machine was once again upgraded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/251439-H9Gefu/webviewable/251439.pdf |title=PBFA Z: A 20-MA z-pinch driver for plasma radiation sources &amp;#124; SciTech Connect |publisher=Osti.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; into PBFA-Z&lt;ref name="sandia.gov"/&gt; or simply "Z machine", described for the first time to the general public on August 1998 in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fs1.bib.tiera.ru/content/DVD-009/_Scientific_american_%28August_1998%29_%281998%29%28en%29%2888s%29.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121004233022/http://www.pescadoo.net/malc/art-6.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics of the Z machine==
The Z machine uses the well known principle of [[Z-pinch]] where the fast discharge of capacitors through a tube of plasma causes it to be compressed towards its centerline by the resulting [[Lorentz force]]s. [[Willard Harrison Bennett|Bennet]] successfully researched the application of Z-pinches to plasma compression. The Z machine layout is cylindrical. On the outside it houses huge [[capacitor]]s discharging through [[Marx generator]]s which generate a one microsecond high-voltage pulse. Yonas then uses a system to divide this time by a factor of 10, using the [[dielectric]] power of water, to enable the creation of 100ns discharges.

However this effort was not successful for Heavy Ion Fusion, due to lack of sufficient focusing of the beams, despite the high power used. It had been known for a long time that the Lorentz forces were radial but the current flow was highly unstable and rotated along the cylinder which causes [[Pinch (plasma physics)#Pinch production and types|twisting]] of the imploding tube therefore decreasing the quality of the compression.

A Russian scientist, [[Valentin Panteleimonovich Smirnov|Valentin Smirnov]], then had the idea of replacing the tube (called "liner") with a wire array, to fight the azimuthal flow of the current, and therefore fight the MHD instability. The Angara V&lt;ref&gt;[http://dorland.pp.ph.ic.ac.uk/magpie/publications/workshop2009/8th_Wednesday/6B1%20Oleinik.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; facility of the [[Kurchatov Institute]] had been built for the same reason: to help simulate and design the second stage of hydrogen bombs and test the effect of high power x-rays on nuclear missiles' warheads. The space inside the wire array was filled with polystyrene, which helps homogenize the X-ray flux.

Any country developing thermonuclear weapons has its own Z machine, but those not using water lines had long rising pulses (for example 800ns in the Sphinx, the French machine at [[Gramat]]). In the UK, the [[MAGPIE|Magpie]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923084547/http://dorland.pp.ph.ic.ac.uk/magpie/experiments/Generator.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; machine was situated at the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] under control of Malcolm Haines.

By removing the polystyrene core, Sandia was able to obtain a thin 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm plasma cord in which 10 million amperes flowed with 90 megabars of pressure.

==Early operation 1996-2006==
The key attributes of Sandia's Z machine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/zmachine.htm |title=Sandia National Laboratories - News Releases |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609044423/http://www.sandia.gov/media/zmachine.htm |archive-date=2015-06-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are its 18 million amperes and a discharge time of less than 100 [[second|nanoseconds]]. The array of [[tungsten]] wires is called a "liner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/z290.htm |title=Sandia Z accelerator |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428231250/http://www.sandia.gov/media/z290.htm |archive-date=2015-04-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, Sandia tested the idea of nested wire arrays;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR1999/zmach.htm |title=News Release - Z machine |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607033045/http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR1999/zmach.htm |archive-date=2015-06-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the second array, out of phase with the first, compensates for [[Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities]].
In 2001, Sandia introduced the Z-Beamlet laser (from surplus equipment of the [[National Ignition Facility]]) as a tool to better image the compressing pellet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neal Singer |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/Zbeam.htm |title=News Release - Z-Beamlet |publisher=Sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094139/http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/Zbeam.htm |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This confirmed the shaping uniformity of pellets compressed by the Z machine.

Sandia announced the fusing of small amounts of [[deuterium]] in the Z machine on April 7, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030603190249/http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2003/nuclear-power/Zneutrons.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being used as an X-ray generator, the Z machine propelled small plates at 34 kilometers a second, faster than the 30 kilometers per second that Earth travels in its orbit around the [[Sun]], and four times [[escape velocity|Earth's escape velocity]] (3 times it at sea level).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2005/nuclear-power/z-saturn.html |title=Sandia National Labs: News: Title |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040225/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2005/nuclear-power/z-saturn.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also successfully created a special, hyperdense "hot ice" known as [[ice VII]], by quickly compressing water to pressures of 70,000 to 120,000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (7 to 12 [[gigapascal|GPa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/z-ice.html |title=Ice created in nanoseconds by Sandia's Z machine - March 15, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135615/http://sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/z-ice.html |archive-date=2011-10-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical shock from impacting Z-machine accelerated projectiles is able to melt diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/diamonds.html |title=Z machine melts diamond to puddle |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031129/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/diamonds.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good overview of the different missions of the Z machine can be found in the 2002 Trivelpiece committee report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/newsreleases/reports/TrivelpieceSANDReport2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pulsed Power Peer Review Committee Report |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175927/http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/newsreleases/reports/TrivelpieceSANDReport2002.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reviewed the pulsed power activities at Sandia.

During this period the power of X-ray produced jumps from 10 to 300TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/media/images/jpg/Z03.jpg |format=PDF |title=Pulsed Power Graph |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094156/http://www.sandia.gov/media/images/jpg/Z03.jpg |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to target the next milestone of fusion breakeven, another upgrade was then necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2004/physics-astron/Z-R.html |title=Z's $61.7 million refurbishment to advance fusion machine's capabilities |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083952/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2004/physics-astron/Z-R.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two billion Kelvin==
At the beginning of 2006, the Z machine produced plasmas with announced temperatures in excess of 2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin]] (2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|9}}&amp;nbsp;K) or 3.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]] (2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]), even reaching a peak at 3.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|9}}&amp;nbsp;K or 6.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;°F (3.7&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/physics-astron/hottest-z-output.html |title=Sandia's Z machine exceeds two billion degrees Kelvin |publisher=Share.sandia.gov |date=2006-03-08 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105101307/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/physics-astron/hottest-z-output.html |archive-date=2015-11-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haines_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haines_b" /&gt;
It was achieved in part by replacing the tungsten wires with thicker steel wires. This temperature, which enables a 10% to 15% efficiency in converting electrical energy to soft x-rays, was much higher than anticipated (3 to 4 times the [[kinetic energy]] of the incoming wires on axis). The [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book Of Records]] formerly listed it as the highest human-achieved temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbZMg7CGnKYC&amp;pg=PA277 |title=Guinness World Records 2008 - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=1074 |title=BNL Newsroom &amp;#124; 'Perfect' Liquid Hot Enough to be Quark Soup |publisher=Bnl.gov |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820105503/http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=1074 |archive-date=2012-08-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Large Hadron Collider]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gayle |first=Damien |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2189318/Atom-smashing-scientists-reach-highest-recorded-man-temperature--100-000-TIMES-hotter-Suns-interior.html |title=Atom-smashing scientists reach highest ever recorded man-made temperature - 100,000 TIMES hotter then the Sun's interior &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620232835/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2189318/Atom-smashing-scientists-reach-highest-recorded-man-temperature--100-000-TIMES-hotter-Suns-interior.html |archive-date=2015-06-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have since produced higher temperatures). The origin of this extra energy still remains unexplained, but it has been theorized that small-scale [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] turbulence and viscous damping would convert magnetic energy into thermal energy of the ions, which then would transfer their energy to the electrons through collisions.&lt;ref name="haines_a"&gt;{{cite journal

A $60 million (raised to $90 million) retrofit program called ZR (Z Refurbished) was announced in 2004 to increase its power by 50%. The Z machine was dismantled in July 2006 for this upgrade, including the installation of newly designed hardware and components and more powerful [[Marx generator]]s. The de-ionized water section of the machine has been reduced to about half the previous size while the oil section has been expanded significantly in order to house larger intermediate storage lines (i-stores) and new laser towers, which used to sit in the water section. The refurbishment was completed in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/zaccelerator.html |title=Successful 'shots' signal re-opening of Sandia’s giant Z accelerator - October 17, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402210006/http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/zaccelerator.html |archive-date=2010-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The newer Z machine can now shoot around 26 million amperes&lt;ref name="sandia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/about_z/index.html|title=About Z|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=30 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030142206/http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/about_z/index.html|archive-date=2016-10-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (instead of 18 million amperes previously) in 95 nanoseconds.
The radiated power has been raised to 350 terawatts and the X-ray energy output to 2.7 [[megajoule]]s. However the maximum temperature the new version may reach with the same record holder [[stainless steel]] wire-array liner used in 2005 is not yet known.

The ultra-high temperatures reached in 2006 (2.66 to 3.7 billion kelvins) are much higher than those required for the classical [[hydrogen]], deuterium and [[tritium]] fusion previously considered. They could allow, in theory if not in practice, the fusion of light hydrogen atoms with heavier atoms such as [[lithium]] or [[boron]]. These two possible fusion reactions do not produce [[neutron]]s, and thus no [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] or [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]], so they open the possibility of human-made clean [[aneutronic fusion]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Sandia's roadmap includes another Z machine version called ZN (Z Neutron) to test higher yields in fusion power and automation systems. ZN is planned to give between 20 and 30 MJ of hydrogen fusion power with a shot per hour using a Russian [[Linear Transformer Driver]] (LTD) replacing the current Marx generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/070427.html |title=Sandia National Labs: News: Publications: Sandia Lab News: April 27, 2007 |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093956/http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/070427.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 8 to 10 years of operation, ZN would become a transmutation pilot plant capable of a fusion shot every 100 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2006/067148.pdf |format=PDF |title=Z-Inertial Dusion Energy : Power Plant Final Report FY 2006 |publisher=Prod.sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step planned would be the Z-IFE (Z-inertial fusion energy) test facility, the first true z-pinch driven prototype fusion power plant. It is suggested it would integrate Sandia's latest designs using LTDs. Sandia Labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million amperes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/accelerator_architecture_PRSTAB_2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Architecture of petawatt-class z-pinch accelerators |publisher=Sandia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192309/http://www.sandia.gov/pulsedpower/prog_cap/pub_papers/accelerator_architecture_PRSTAB_2007.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, fusion shot simulations at 60 to 70 million amperes are showing a 100 to 1000 fold return on input energy.

Major problems include producing energy in a single Z-pinch shot, and quickly reloading the reactor after each shot. By their early estimates, an implosion of a fuel capsule every 10 seconds could economically produce 300&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion energy.
