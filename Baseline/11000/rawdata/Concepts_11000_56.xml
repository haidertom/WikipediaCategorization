'''Aerial perspective''' or '''atmospheric perspective''' refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).

==History==

Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by [[polymath]]s such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the [[Pompeian Styles]], dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.

==Optics==

The major component affecting the appearance of objects during [[daylight]] is [[scattering]] of light, called [[Diffuse sky radiation|skylight]], into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see [[haze]]). Scattering adds the sky light as a [[veiling luminance]] onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short [[wavelength]] than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see [[Rayleigh scattering]] for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the [[moon]] is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of [[self-luminous]] objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.

==Why reducing contrast reduces clarity==

The ability of a person with normal [[visual acuity]] to see fine details is determined by his or her [[contrast sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. H. (1977). Visual contrast sensitivity. Optica Acta, 24, 107-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrast sensitivity is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the smallest contrast for which a person can [[Contrast (vision)|see]] a sine-wave [[grating]]. A person's [[contrast sensitivity function]] is contrast sensitivity as a function of [[spatial frequency]]. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of [[visual angle]]. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.

The high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, R., &amp; Sekuler, R. (2006). Perception (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.

It is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.

==In art==

In art, especially painting, ''aerial perspective''  refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.

[[File:Frans Koppelaar - Backlight Langestraat.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Koppelaar]], Backlight Langestraat|left]]
(One caution: in common speech, the words ''perspective'' and ''viewpoint'' tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an [[aerial viewpoint]], such as that forming the basis of the [[aerial landscape]] genre. The example by [[Frans Koppelaar]] pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since the observer is apparently standing on the ground.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8303">'''Algorithm engineering''' focuses on the design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer [[algorithms]], bridging the gap between algorithm theory and practical applications of algorithms in [[software engineering]].&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;"Algorithm Engineering", Camil Demetrescu, Irene Finocchi, [[Giuseppe Francesco Italiano|Giuseppe F. Italiano]], web: [http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a general methodology for algorithmic research.&lt;ref name="AEDef"&gt;"Algorithm Engineering – An Attempt at a Definition", [[Peter Sanders (computer scientist)|Peter Sanders]], web: [http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

In 1995, a report from an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-sponsored workshop "with the purpose of assessing the current goals and directions of the Theory of Computing (TOC) community" identified the slow speed of adoption of theoretical insights by practitioners as an important issue and suggested measures to
* reduce the uncertainty by practitioners whether a certain theoretical breakthrough will translate into practical gains in their field of work, and
* tackle the lack of ready-to-use algorithm libraries, which provide stable, bug-free and well-tested implementations for algorithmic problems and expose an easy-to-use interface for library consumers.&lt;ref name="EOTCS"&gt;"Emerging Opportunities for Theoretical Computer Science", Aho, Johnson, Karp, Kosaraju, McGeoch, Papadimitriou, web: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Scientists have encountered a widening gap between theoretical insights and their application in software engineering disciplines. While algorithm theory provides the mathematical foundation to discover ..., it often does not meet the practical requirements of software engineering. --&gt;
 
But also, promising algorithmic approaches have been neglected due to difficulties in mathematical analysis.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Algorithm engineering was mentioned as one of the approaches to speed up adoption .... --&gt;

The term "algorithm engineering" was first used with specificity in 1997, with the first Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE97), organized by [[Giuseppe Francesco Italiano|Giuseppe F. Italiano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.unive.it/~wae97 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from algorithm theory==
 
Algorithm engineering does not intend to replace or compete with algorithm theory, but tries to enrich, refine and reinforce its formal approaches with [[experimental algorithmics]] (also called empirical algorithmics).

This way it can provide new insights into the efficiency and performance of algorithms in cases where
* the algorithm at hand is less amenable to algorithm theoretic analysis,
* formal analysis pessimistically suggests bounds which are unlikely to appear on inputs of practical interest,
* the algorithm relies on the intricacies of modern hardware architectures like data locality, branch prediction, instruction stalls, instruction latencies which the machine model used in Algorithm Theory is unable to capture in the required detail,
* the crossover between competing algorithms with different constant costs and asymptotic behaviors needs to be determined.&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDEA"&gt;"Towards a Discipline of Experimental Algorithmics", Bernard M. E. Moret, web: [http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

Some researchers describe algorithm engineering's methodology as a cycle consisting of algorithm design, analysis, implementation and experimental evaluation, joined by further aspects like machine models or realistic inputs.
They argue that equating algorithm engineering with [[experimental algorithmics]] is too limited, because viewing design and analysis, implementation and experimentation as separate activities ignores the crucial feedback loop between those elements of algorithm engineering.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Realistic models and real inputs===

While specific applications are outside the methodology of algorithm engineering, they play an important role in shaping realistic models of the problem and the underlying machine, and supply real inputs and other design parameters for experiments.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Design===
Compared to algorithm theory, which usually focuses on the asymptotic behavior of algorithms, algorithm engineers need to keep further requirements in mind: Simplicity of the algorithm, implementability in programming languages on real hardware, and allowing code reuse.
Additionally, constant factors of algorithms have such a considerable impact on real-world inputs that sometimes an algorithm with worse asymptotic behavior performs better in practice due to lower constant factors.

===Analysis===
Some problems can be solved with heuristics and randomized algorithms in a simpler and more efficient fashion than with deterministic algorithms. Unfortunately, this makes even simple randomized algorithms ''difficult to analyze because there are subtle dependencies to be taken into account''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Implementation===
Huge semantic gaps between theoretical insights, formulated algorithms, programming languages and hardware pose a challenge to efficient implementations of even simple algorithms, because small implementation details can have rippling effects on execution behavior.
The only reliable way to compare several implementations of an algorithm is to spend an considerable amount of time on tuning and profiling, running those algorithms on multiple architectures, and looking at the generated machine code.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Experiments===
See: [[Experimental algorithmics]]

===Application engineering===
Implementations of algorithms used for experiments differ in significant ways from code usable in applications.
While the former prioritizes fast prototyping, performance and instrumentation for measurements during experiments, the latter requires ''thorough testing, maintainability, simplicity, and tuning for particular classes of inputs''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Algorithm libraries===
Stable, well-tested algorithm libraries like [[Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms|LEDA]] play an important role in technology transfer by speeding up the adoption of new algorithms in applications. 
Such libraries reduce the required investment and risk for practitioners, because it removes the burden of understanding and implementing the results of academic research.

==Conferences==
Two main conferences on Algorithm Engineering are organized annually, namely:
* Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA), established in 1997 (formerly known as WEA).
* SIAM Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), established in 1999.

The 1997 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'97) was held in Venice (Italy) on September 11–13, 1997. The Third International Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'99) was held in London, UK in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The first Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation (ALENEX99) was held in Baltimore, Maryland on January 15–16, 1999.&lt;ref name="jhu"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by [[DIMACS]], the [[Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science]] (at [[Rutgers University]]), with additional support from [[SIGACT]], the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory, and SIAM, the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]].&lt;ref name=jhu/&gt;

[[Turbulent flow]]s are complex multi-scale and chaotic motions that need to be classified into more elementary components, referred to '''coherent turbulent structures'''. Such a structure must have temporal coherence, i.e. it must persist in its form for long enough periods that the methods of time-averaged statistics can be applied. Coherent structures are typically studied on very large scales, but can be broken down into more elementary structures with coherent properties of their own, such examples include [[hairpin vortices]]. Hairpins and coherent structures have been studied and noticed in data since the 1930s, and have been since cited in thousands of scientific papers and reviews.&lt;ref name = "green"&gt;#Green, Sheldon I., “Fluid Vortices: Fluid mechanics and its applications” Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1995.

[[Flow visualization]] experiments, using smoke and dye as tracers, have been historically used to simulate coherent structures and verify theories, but computer models are now the dominant tools widely used in the field to verify and understand the formation, evolution, and other properties of such structures. The kinematic properties of these motions include size, scale, shape, [[vorticity]], [[Turbulence kinetic energy | energy]], and the dynamic properties govern the way coherent structures grow, evolve, and decay. Most coherent structures are studied only within the confined forms of simple wall turbulence, which approximates the coherence to be steady, fully developed, incompressible, and with a zero pressure gradient in the [[boundary layer]].  Although such approximations depart from reality, they contain sufficient parameters needed to understand turbulent coherent structures in a highly conceptual degree.&lt;ref name= "hussain"&gt;Hussain, A. K. M. F. "Coherent structures- reality and myth" Phys. Fluids 26, 2816, doi: 10.1063/1.864048. (1983) &lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Discovery== 
The presence of organized motions and structures in turbulent shear flows was apparent for a long time, and has been additionally implied by [[Mixing length model | mixing length]] hypothesis even before the concept was explicitly stated in literature. There were also early correlation data found by measuring jets and turbulent wakes, particularly by Corrsin and Roshko. Hama's hydrogen bubble technique, which used [[flow visualization]] to observe the structures, received wide spread attention and many researchers followed up including Kline. Flow visualization is a laboratory experimental technique that is used to visualize and understand the structures of turbulent [[shear flow | shear flows]].&lt;ref name = "green" /&gt;
[[File:Fog visualization.jpg|thumb|An example of a flow visualization using fog as the visual tracer]]

With a much better understanding of coherent structures, it is now possible to discover and recognize many coherent structures in previous flow-visualization pictures collected of various turbulent flows taken decades ago. Computer simulations are now being the dominant tool for understanding and visualizing coherent flow structures. The ability to compute the necessary time-dependent [[Navier–Stokes equations | Navier-Stokes equations]] produces graphic presentations at a much more sophisticated level, and can additionally be visualized at different planes and resolutions, exceeding the expected sizes and speeds previously generated in laboratory experiments. However, controlled flow visualization experiments are still necessary to direct, develop, and validate the numerical simulations now dominant in the field.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

==Definition==
A [[Turbulence  | turbulent flow]] is a flow regime in fluid dynamics where fluid velocity varies significantly and irregularly in both position and time.&lt;ref&gt;Pope S B. Turbulent flows[J]. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, a coherent structure is defined as a turbulent flow whose vorticity expression, which is usually stochastic, contains orderly components that can be described as being instantaneously coherent over the spatial extent of the flow structure. In other words, underlying the three-dimensional chaotic vorticity expressions typical of turbulent flows, there is an organized component of that vorticity which is phase-correlated over the entire space of the structure. The instantaneously space and phase correlated vorticity found within the coherent structure expressions can be defined as coherent vorticity, hence making coherent vorticity the main characteristic identifier for coherent structures. Another characteristic inherent in turbulent flows is their [[intermittency]], but intermittency is a very poor identifier of the boundaries of a coherent structure, hence it is generally accepted that the best way to characterize the boundary of a structure is by identifying and defining the boundary of the coherent vorticity.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

By defining and identifying coherent structure in this manner, turbulent flows can be decomposed into coherent structures and incoherent structures depending on their coherence, particularly their correlations with their vorticity. Hence, similarly organized events in an ensemble average of organized events can be defined as a coherent structure, and whatever events not identified as similar or phase and space aligned in the ensemble average is an incoherent turbulent structure. 

Other attempts at defining a coherent structure can be done through examining the correlation between their momenta or pressure and their turbulent flows. However, it often leads to false indications of turbulence, since pressure and velocity fluctuations over a fluid could be well correlated in the absence of any turbulence or vorticity. Some coherent structures, such as [[Vortex ring | vortex rings]], etc. can be large-scale motions comparable to the extent of the shear flow. There are also coherent motions at much smaller scales such as hairpin vortices and typical eddies, which are typically known as coherent substructures, as in coherent structures which can be broken up into smaller more elementary substructures.

==Characteristics== 
Although a coherent structure is by definition characterized by high levels of coherent vorticity, [[Reynolds stress]], production, and heat and mass transportation, it does not necessarily require a high level of kinetic energy. In fact, one of the main roles of coherent structures is the large-scale transport of mass, heat, and momentum without requiring the high amounts of energy normally needed. Consequently, this implies that coherent structures are not the main production and cause of Reynolds stress, and incoherent turbulence can be similarly significant.&lt;ref&gt;Ganapathisubramani, B., Longmire, E. K., Marusic, I. “Characteristics of vortex packets in turbulent boundary layers” J. Fluid Mech., vol. 478, pp. 35-46 (2003). &lt;/ref&gt;

Coherent structures cannot [[Superposition principle| superimpose]], i.e. they cannot overlap and each coherent structure has its own independent domain and boundary. Since eddies coexist as spatial superpositions, a coherent structure is not an [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]]. For example, eddies dissipate energy by obtaining energy from the mean flow at large scales, and eventually dissipating it at the smallest scales. There is no such analogous exchange of energy between coherent structures, and any interaction such as tearing between coherent structures simply results in a new structure. However, two coherent structures can interact and influence each other. The mass of a structure change with time, with the typical case being that structures increase in volume via the diffusion of vorticity. 

One of the most fundamental quantities of coherent structures is characterized by coherent vorticity, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_c &lt;/math&gt;. Perhaps the next most critical measures of coherent structures are the coherent vs. incoherent Reynold's stresses, &lt;math&gt; -u_c\nu_c &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; - \langle u_r\nu_r \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. These represent the transports of momentum, and their relative strength indicates how much momentum is being transported by coherent structures as compared to incoherent structures. The next most significant measures include contoured depictions of coherent strain rate and shear production. A useful property of such contours is that they are invariant under Galilean transformations, hence the contours of coherent vorticity constitute an excellent identifier to the structure's boundaries. The contours of these properties not only locate where exactly coherent structure quantities have their peaks and saddles, but also identify where the incoherent turbulent structures are when overlaid on their directional gradients. In addition, spatial contours can be drawn describe the shape, size, and strength of the coherent structures, depicting not only the mechanics but also the dynamical evolution of coherent structures. For example, in order for a structure to be evolving, and hence dominant, its coherent vorticity, coherent Reynolds stress, and production terms should be larger than the time averaged values of the flow structures.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

==Formation==
Coherent structures form due to some sort of instability, e.g. the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability]]. Identifying an instability, and hence the initial formation of a coherent structure, requires the knowledge of initial conditions of the flow structure. Hence, documentation of the initial condition is essential for capturing the evolution and interactions of coherent structures, since initial conditions are quite variable. Overlooking the initial conditions was common in early studies due to researchers overlooking their significance. Initial conditions include the mean velocity profile, thickness, shape, the probability densities of velocity and momentum, the spectrum of Reynolds stress values, etc.  These measures of initial flow conditions can be organized and grouped into three broad categories: [[Laminar flow | laminar]], highly disturbed, and fully turbulent.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

Out of the three categories, coherent structures typically arise from instabilities in laminar or turbulent states.  After an initial triggering, their growth is determined by evolutionary changes due to non-linear interactions with other coherent structures, or their decay onto incoherent turbulent structures. Observed rapid changes lead to the belief that there must be a regenerative cycle that takes place during decay. For example, after a structure decays, the result may be that the flow is now turbulent and becomes susceptible to a new instability determined by the new flow state, leading to a new coherent structure being formed. It is also possible that structures do not decay and instead distort by splitting into substructures or interacting with other coherent structures.

==Categories of Coherent Structures==

===Lagrangian Coherent Structures===
[[File:Skeleton turbulence.png|400px|right|thumb|Attracting (red) and repelling (blue)  LCSs extracted from a two-dimensional turbulence experiment (Image: Manikandan Mathur)&lt;ref name=Mathur2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mathur | first1 = M. | last2 = Haller | first2 = G. | last3 = Peacock | first3 = T. | last4 = Ruppert-Felsot | first4 = J. | last5 = Swinney | first5 = H. | title = Uncovering the Lagrangian Skeleton of Turbulence | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.144502 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 98 | issue = 14 | pages = 144502 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17501277| pmc = |bibcode = 2007PhRvL..98n4502M }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Lagrangian coherent structures]] (LCSs) are influential material surfaces that create clearly recognizable patterns in passive tracer distributions advected by an unsteady flow. LCSs can be classified as hyperbolic (locally maximally attracting or repelling material surfaces), elliptic (material vortex boundaries), and parabolic (material jet cores). These surfaces are generalizations of classical invariant manifolds, known in [[dynamical systems]] theory, to finite-time unsteady flow data. This Lagrangian perspective on coherence is concerned with structures formed  by fluid elements, as opposed to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics) | Eulerian]] notion of coherence, which considers features in the instantaneous velocity field of the fluid.  Various mathematical techniques have been developed to identify [[Lagrangian coherent structure | LCSs]] in two- and three-dimenisonal data sets, and have been applied to laboratory experiments, numerical simulations and geophysical observations. &lt;ref&gt;Peacock, T., Haller, G. "Lagrangian Coherent structures: the hidden skeleton of fluid flows" Physics Today, 41 (2013). http://georgehaller.com/reprints/PhysToday.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2015&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322| title = Lagrangian Coherent Structures| journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics| volume = 47| pages = 137| year = 2015| last1 = Haller | first1 = G. | bibcode = 2015AnRFM..47..137H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairpin Vortices===
Hairpin vortices are found on top of turbulent bulges of the [http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Introduction_to_turbulence/Wall_bounded_turbulent_flows turbulent wall], wrapping around the turbulent wall in hairpin shaped loops, where the name originates. The hairpin-shaped vortices are believed to be one of the most important and elementary sustained flow patterns in turbulent boundary layers. Hairpins are perhaps the simplest structures, and models that represent large scale turbulent boundary layers are often constructed by breaking down individual hairpin vortices, which could explain most of the features of wall turbulence. Although hairpin vortices form the basis of simple conceptual models of flow near a wall, actual turbulent flows may contain a hierarchy of competing vortices, each with their own degree of asymmetry and disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian, R. J. “Hairpin vortex organization in wall turbulence” Phys. Fluids 19, 041301 (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;

Hairpin vortices resemble the horseshoe vortex, which exists because of perturbations of small upward motion due to differences in upward flowing velocities depending on the distance from the wall. These form multiple packets of hairpin vortices, where hairpin packets of different sizes could generate new vortices to add to the packet. Specifically, close to the surface, the tail ends of hairpin vortices could gradually converge resulting in provoked eruptions, producing new hairpin vortices. Hence, such eruptions are a regenerative process, in which they act to create vortices near the surface and eject them out onto the outer regions of the turbulent wall. Based on the eruptive properties, such flows can be inferred to be very efficient at heat transfer because of mixing. Specifically, eruptions carry hot fluids up while cooler flows are brought downwards during the converging of tails of the hairpin vortices before erupting.&lt;ref&gt;Haidari, A. H., Smith, C. R. “The generation and regeneration of single hairpin vortices” J. Fluid Mech., vol. 277, pp. 135-162. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that production and contributions to &lt;math&gt; -\overline{u'v'} &lt;/math&gt;, the Reynolds stress, occur during strong interactions between the inner and outer walls of hairpins. During the production of this Reynold's stress term, the contributions come in sharp intermittent time segments when eruptions bring new vortices outward. 

Formation of hairpin vortices has been observed in experiments and numerical simulations of single hairpins, however observational evidence for them in nature is still limited. Theodorsen has been producing sketches that indicate the presence of hairpin vortices in his flow visualization experiments. These smaller elementary structures can be seen overlaying the main vortex in the sketch to the right (image of sketch to Theodorsen's steam experiment that exposes the presence of structures). The sketch was well advanced for the time, but with the advent of computers came better depictions. Robinson in 1952 isolated two types of flow structures that he named the "horseshoe", or arch, vortex and the "quasi-streamwise" vortex (classic figure shown to the right).&lt;ref name="green"/&gt; 
 
[[File:CreativeLicensedAfterRobinson.png|thumb|Describes the two main flow structures that Robinson found through Direct Numerical Simulations&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;]]

Since the mass usage of computers, [[Direct numerical simulation| direct numerical simulations]] or DNS have been used widely, producing vast data sets describing the complex evolution of flow. DNS indicates many complicated 3-dimensional vortices are embedded in regions of high shear near the surface. Researchers look around this region of high shear for indications of individual vortex structures based on accepted definitions, like coherent vortices. Historically, a vortex has been thought of as a region in the flow where a group of vortex lines come together hence indicating the presence of a vortex core, with groups of instantaneous circular paths about the core. In 1991, Robinson defined a vortex structure to be a core consisting of convected low pressure regions, where instantaneous streamlines can form circles or spiral shapes relative to the plane normal to the vortex core plane. Although it is not possible to track the evolution of hairpins over long periods, it is possible to identify and trace their evolution over short time periods. Some of the key notable features of hairpin vortices are how they interact with the background shear flow, other vortices, and how they interact with the flow near the surface.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

A '''control moment gyroscope''' (CMG) is an [[attitude control]] device generally used in [[spacecraft]] attitude control systems. A CMG consists of a spinning rotor and one or more motorized [[gimbal]]s that tilt the rotor’s [[angular momentum]].  As the rotor tilts, the changing angular momentum causes a [[gyroscopic]] torque that rotates the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100021932.pdf|title=Space Station Control Moment Gyroscope Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=|website=NASA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/space/control-moment-gyroscopes-cmg|title=CONTROL MOMENT GYROSCOPES (CMG)|website=aerospace.honeywell.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics==
CMGs differ from [[reaction wheel]]s. The latter apply [[torque]] simply by changing rotor spin speed, but the former tilt the rotor's spin axis without necessarily changing its spin speed. CMGs are also far more power efficient. For a few hundred watts and about 100&amp;nbsp;kg of mass, large CMGs have produced thousands of [[newton meter]]s of torque. A reaction wheel of similar capability would require [[Watt|megawatts]] of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=smallsat|title=R Votel, D Sinclair. "Comparison of control moment gyros and reaction wheels for small Earth-observing satellites." 26th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design varieties==

===Single-gimbal===
The most effective CMGs include only a single [[gimbal]].  When the gimbal of such a CMG rotates, the change in direction of the rotor's angular momentum represents a torque that reacts onto the body to which the CMG is mounted, e.g. a spacecraft.  Except for effects due to the motion of the spacecraft, this torque is due to a constraint, so it does no mechanical work (i.e., requires no energy).  Single-gimbal CMGs exchange angular momentum in a way that requires very little power, with the result that they can apply very large torques for minimal electrical input.

===Dual-gimbal===
Such a CMG includes two gimbals per rotor.  As an actuator, it is more versatile than a single-gimbal CMG because it is capable of pointing the rotor's momentum vector in any direction.  However, the torque generated by one gimbal's motion must often be reacted by the other gimbal on its way to the spacecraft, requiring more power for a given torque than a single-gimbal CMG.  If the goal is simply to store momentum in a mass-efficient way, as in the case of the [[International Space Station]], dual-gimbal CMGs are a good design choice.  However, if a spacecraft instead requires large output torque while consuming minimal power, single-gimbal CMGs are a better choice.

===Variable-speed===
Most CMGs hold rotor speed constant using relatively small motors to offset changes due to dynamic coupling and non-conservative effects.  Some academic research has focused on the possibility of increasing and decreasing rotor speed while the CMG gimbals.  Variable-speed CMGs (VSCMGs) offer few practical advantages when considering actuation capability because the output torque from the rotor is typically much smaller than that caused by the gimbal motion. The primary practical benefit of the VSCMG when compared to the conventional CMG is an additional degree of freedom—afforded by the available rotor torque—which can be exploited for continuous CMG singularity avoidance and VSCMG cluster reorientation. Research has shown that the rotor torques required for these two purposes are very small and within the capability of conventional CMG rotor motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaub|first1=Hanspeter|last2=Junkins|first2=John L.|title=Singularity Avoidance Using Null Motion and Variable-Speed Control Moment Gyros|journal=Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics|date=January 2000|volume=23|issue=1|pages=11–16|doi=10.2514/2.4514|accessdate=|bibcode=2000JGCD...23...11S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the practical benefits of VSCMGs are readily available using conventional CMGs with alterations to CMG cluster steering and CMG rotor motor control laws. The VSCMG also can be used as a [[Flywheel energy storage|mechanical battery]] to store electric energy as [[kinetic energy]] of the flywheels.

==Potential problems==

===Singularities===
At least three single-axis CMGs are necessary for control of spacecraft attitude.  However, no matter how many CMGs a spacecraft uses, gimbal motion can lead to relative orientations that produce no usable output torque along certain directions.  These orientations are known as ''singularities'' and are related to the [[kinematics]] of robotic systems that encounter limits on the end-effector velocities due to certain joint alignments.  Avoiding these singularities is naturally of great interest, and several techniques have been proposed.  David Bailey and others have argued (in patents and in academic publications) that merely avoiding the "divide by zero" error that is associated with these singularities is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6154691.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6154691&amp;RS=PN/6154691 |title=Orienting a satellite with controlled momentum gyros - US Patent 6154691 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Saturation===
A cluster of CMGs can become saturated, in the sense that it is holding a maximum amount of angular momentum in a particular direction and can hold no more.

As an example, suppose a spacecraft equipped with two or more dual-gimbal CMGs experiences a transient unwanted torque, perhaps caused by reaction from venting waste gas, tending to make it roll clockwise about its forward axis and thus increase its angular momentum along that axis. Then the CMG control program will command the gimbal motors of the CMGs to slant the rotors' spin axes gradually more and more forward, so that the angular momentum vectors of the rotors point more nearly along the forward axis. While this gradual change in rotor spin direction is in progress, the rotors will be creating gyroscopic torques whose resultant is anticlockwise about the forward axis, holding the spacecraft steady against the unwanted waste gas torque.

When the transient torque ends, the control program will stop the gimbal movement, and the rotors will be left pointing more forward than before. The inflow of unwanted forward angular momentum has been routed through the CMGs and dumped into the rotors; the forward component of their total angular momentum vector is now greater than before.

If these events are repeated, the angular momentum vectors of the individual rotors will bunch more and more closely together round the forward direction. In the limiting case, they will all end up parallel, and the CMG cluster will now be saturated in that direction; it can hold no more angular momentum. If the CMGs were initially holding no angular momentum about any other axes, they will end up saturated exactly along the forward axis. If however (for example) they were already holding a little angular momentum in the "up" (yaw left) direction, they will saturate (end up parallel) along an axis pointing forward and slightly up, and so on. Saturation is possible about any axis.

In the saturated condition attitude control is impossible. Since the gyroscopic torques can now only be created at right angles to the saturation axis, roll control about that axis itself is now non-existent. There will also be major difficulties with control about other axes. For example, an unwanted left yaw can only be countered by storing some "up" angular momentum in the CMG rotors. This can only be done by tilting at least one of their axes up, which will slightly reduce the forward component of their total angular momentum. Since they can now store less "right roll" forward angular momentum, they will have to release some back into the spacecraft, which will be forced to start an unwanted roll to the right.{{efn|In fact control will already be difficult even when the cluster is not quite saturated. For example, roll control needs the gyroscopic torques to have a forward-facing component. Those gyroscopic torques are always at right angles to the rotor spin axes, so near saturation in our example the forward-facing components are quite small compared to the total gyroscopic torques. This means that the total gyroscopic torques will have to be quite large to give usable roll control, and this can only be achieved by making the gimbal motions faster. Eventually these will exceed the capabilities of the gimbal motors.}}

The only remedy for this loss of control is to desaturate the CMGs by removing the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. The simplest way of doing this is to use [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the forward direction, producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction, opposing the RCS as long as it is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the [[Angular momentum#Discussion|moment of momentum]] of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.{{efn|It might be asked why the RCS thrusters were not used originally to directly oppose the torque created by the waste gas venting, thus bypassing the CMGs altogether and rendering them unnecessary. One answer is that RCS thrusters usually produce much more thrust than venting waste gas, or the other likely causes of unwanted torque; a few seconds of RCS firing can drain away angular momentum that has taken hours to accumulate in the CMGs. The RCS is used for "coarse" attitude control, with the CMGs providing "fine" adjustments. Another reason for temporarily storing angular momentum in the CMGs is that quite possibly one unwanted torque may be followed some time later by another unwanted torque in the opposite direction. In this case the angular momentum left stored after the first event is used to counter the second event, without expenditure of precious RCS fuel. Cyclic unwanted torques like this are often caused by orbital interactions with a gravity gradient.}}

It is worth noting that "saturation" can only apply to a cluster of two or more CMGs, since it means that their rotor spins have become parallel. It is meaningless to say that a single constant-speed CMG can become saturated; in a sense it is "permanently saturated" in whatever direction the rotor happens to be pointing. This contrasts with a single [[reaction wheel]], which can absorb more and more angular momentum along its fixed axis by spinning faster, until it reaches saturation at its maximum design speed.

===Anti-parallel alignment===
There are other undesirable rotor axis configurations apart from saturation, notably anti-parallel alignments.  For example, if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal CMGs gets into a state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward, while the other rotor spin is facing directly aft (i.e. anti-parallel to the first), then all roll control will be lost.  This happens for the same reason as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll.  However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control will become increasingly difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.

In the anti-parallel configuration, although roll control is lost, control about other axes still works well (in contrast to the situation with saturation).  An unwanted left yaw can be dealt with by storing some "up" angular momentum, which is easily done by tilting both rotor spin axes slightly up by equal amounts.  Since their fore and aft components will still be equal and opposite, there is no change in fore-and-aft angular momentum (it will still be zero) and therefore no unwanted roll.  In fact the situation will be improved, because the rotor axes are no longer quite anti-parallel and some roll control will be restored.

Anti-parallel alignment is therefore not quite as serious as saturation but must still be avoided. It is theoretically possible with any number of CMGs; as long as some rotors are aligned parallel along a particular axis, and all the others point in exactly the opposite direction, there is no saturation but still no roll control about that axis. With three or more CMGs the situation can be immediately rectified simply by redistributing the existing total angular momentum among the rotors (even if that total is zero).{{efn|For example, suppose there are four CMGs and the starting configuration is two spins facing forward and two facing back.  Then one of the forward-facing rotors can be swung smoothly to "up", while one rear-facing rotor is swung simultaneously to "down".  The resulting gyroscopic torques will cancel each other out exactly while this motion is in progress, and the final "+" shaped configuration is no longer anti-parallel.}}  In practice the CMG control program will continually redistribute the total angular momentum to avoid the situation arising in the first place.

If there are only two CMGs in the cluster, as in our first example, then anti-parallel alignment will inevitably occur if the total stored angular momentum reaches zero.  The remedy is to keep it away from zero, possibly by using RCS firings.  This is not very satisfactory, and in practice all spacecraft using CMGs are fitted with at least three.  However it sometimes happens that after malfunctions a cluster is left with only two working CMGs, and the control program must be able to deal with this situation.

===Hitting the gimbal stops===
Older CMG models like the ones launched with Skylab in 1973 had limited gimbal travel between fixed mechanical stops. On the  Skylab CMGs the limits were plus or minus 80 degrees from zero for the inner gimbals, and from plus 220 degrees to minus 130 degrees for the outer ones (so zero was offset by 45 degrees from the centre of travel). Visualising the inner angle as 'latitude' and the outer as 'longitude', it can be seen that for an individual CMG there were 'blind spots' with radius 10 degrees of latitude at the 'North and South poles', and an additional 'blind strip' of width 10 degrees of 'longitude' running from pole to pole, centred on the line of 'longitude' at plus 135 degrees. These 'blind areas' represented directions in which the rotor's spin axis could never be pointed.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Skylab carried three CMGs, mounted with their casings (and therefore their rotor axes when the gimbals were set to zero) facing in three mutually perpendicular directions. This ensured that the six 'polar blind spots' were spaced 90 degrees apart from each other. The 45 degree zero offset then ensured that the three 'blind strips' of the outer gimbals would pass halfway between neighbouring 'polar blind spots' and at a maximum distance from each other. The whole arrangement ensured that the 'blind areas' of the three CMGs never overlapped, and thus that at least two of the three rotor spins could be pointed in any given direction.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The CMG control program was responsible for making sure that the gimbals never hit the stops, by redistributing angular momentum between the three rotors to bring large gimbal angles closer to zero. Since the total angular momentum to be stored had only three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], while the control program could change six independent variables (the three pairs of gimbal angles), the program had sufficient freedom of action to do this while still obeying other constraints such as avoiding anti-parallel alignments.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971/&gt;{{rp|5}}

One advantage of limited gimbal movement such as Skylab's is that singularities are less of a problem. If Skylab's inner gimbals had been able to reach 90 degrees or more away from zero, then the 'North and South poles' could have become singularities; the gimbal stops prevented this.

More modern CMGs such as the four units [[Integrated Truss Structure#Z1 truss|installed on the ISS]] in 2000 have unlimited gimbal travel and therefore no 'blind areas'. Thus they do not have to be mounted facing along mutually perpendicular directions; the four units on the ISS all face the same way. The control program need not concern itself with gimbal stops, but on the other hand it must pay more attention to avoiding singularities.

[[Skylab]], launched in May 1973, was the first spacecraft to be fitted with large CMGs for attitude control.

They were arranged so that the casings (and therefore the rotors when all gimbals were at their zero positions) pointed in three mutually perpendicular directions.  Since the units were dual-gimballed, each one could produce a torque about any axis at right angles to its rotor axis, thus providing some redundancy; if any one of the three failed, the combination of the remaining two could in general still produce a torque around any desired axis.&lt;ref name = ChubbSeltz1971&gt;{{cite web

===Gyrodynes on Salyut and Mir===
CMGs were used for attitude control on the [[Salyut programme|Salyut]] and [[Mir]] space stations, where they were called gyrodynes (from the Russian гиродин ''girodin''; this word is also sometimes used &amp;ndash; especially by Russian crew &amp;ndash; for the CMGs on the [[ISS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===International Space Station===
[[Image:ISS gyroscope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|NASA personnel handle a single Control Moment Gyroscope for the [[International Space Station]].]]
The ISS employs a total of four CMGs, mounted on Z1 truss&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_098a_Zvezda_Press_Kit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as primary actuating devices during normal flight mode operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative to the surface of the Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of [[gravity gradient]], [[atmospheric drag]], [[solar pressure]], and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred{{cn|date=May 2017}}&lt;!-- the cite is old from 1990 - the first ISS module was launched in 1998, it was a theoretical study and proposal, and I can't find a citation to say that it is done that way--&gt; because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.&lt;ref&gt;A.

===Proposed===
As of 2016, the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the ISS carries no CMGs of its own.  However, the proposed but as yet unbuilt Science and Power Module (NEM-1) would be fitted with several externally-mounted CMGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Its twin NEM-2 (if completed) would later be installed symmetrically on the other lateral UM port.

On 24 February 2015, the Scientific and Technical Council of [[Roscosmos]] announced that after decommissioning of the ISS (then planned for 2024) the newer Russian modules would be detached and form the nucleus of a small all-Russian space station to be called [[Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex|OPSEK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5347">In [[probability theory]], the '''craps principle''' is a theorem about [[Event (probability theory)|event]] [[probabilities]] under repeated [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|iid]] trials. Let &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; denote two [[mutually exclusive]] events which might occur on a given trial. Then the probability that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs before &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; equals the [[conditional probability]] that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs given that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; occur on the next trial, which is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[ E_1 \, \, \text{before}\,\, E_2]=\operatorname{P}\left[E_1\mid E_1\cup E_2\right]=\frac{\operatorname{P}[E_1]}{\operatorname{P}[E_1]+\operatorname{P}[E_2]}&lt;/math&gt;

The events &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; need not be [[collectively exhaustive]] (if they are, the result is trivial).&lt;ref name="stat_TheC"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Craps principle 10/16| author = Susan Holmes| work = statweb.stanford.edu| date = 1998-12-07| accessdate = 2016-03-17| url = http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/courses/s116/node63.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ouellette2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Ouellette|title=The Calculus Diaries: How Math Can Help You Lose Weight, Win in Vegas, and Survive a Zombie Apocalypse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQzJoqBwtT4C&amp;pg=PT50|date=31 August 2010|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-45903-4|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the event that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs before &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be the event that neither &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; occurs on a given trial. Since &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[mutually exclusive]] and [[collectively exhaustive]] for the first trial, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{P}(A) = \operatorname{P}(E_1)\operatorname{P}(A \mid E_1) + \operatorname{P}(E_2)\operatorname{P}(A \mid E_2) + \operatorname{P}(B) \operatorname{P}(A \mid B) = \operatorname{P}(E_1) + \operatorname{P}(B) \operatorname{P}(A \mid B)&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(B) = 1 - \operatorname{P}(E_1) - \operatorname{P}(E_2)&lt;/math&gt;. 
Since the trials are i.i.d., we have &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A \mid B) = \operatorname{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Using &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A|E_1)=1,\quad \operatorname{P}(A|E_2)=0&lt;/math&gt; and solving the displayed equation for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt; gives the formula 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A) = \frac{\operatorname{P}(E_1)}{\operatorname{P}(E_1)+\operatorname{P}(E_2)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Application==

If the trials are repetitions of a game between two players, and the events are

:&lt;math&gt;E_1:\mathrm{ player\ 1\ wins}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_2:\mathrm{ player\ 2\ wins}&lt;/math&gt;

then the craps principle gives the respective conditional probabilities of each player winning a certain repetition, given that someone wins (i.e., given that a [[draw (tie)|draw]] does not occur). In fact, the result is only affected by the relative marginal probabilities of winning &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[E_1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[E_2]&lt;/math&gt; ; in particular, the probability of a draw is irrelevant.

===Stopping===
If the game is played repeatedly until someone wins, then the conditional probability above is the probability that the player wins the game. This is illustrated below for the original game of [[craps]], using an alternative proof.

==Craps example==
If the game being played is [[craps]], then this principle can greatly simplify the computation of the probability of winning in a certain scenario. Specifically, if the first roll is a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, then the dice are repeatedly re-rolled until one of two events occurs:
:&lt;math&gt;E_1:\text{ the original roll (called ‘the point’) is rolled (a win) }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_2:\text{ a 7 is rolled (a loss) }&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; are mutually exclusive, the craps principle applies. For example, if the original roll was a 4, then the probability of winning is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3/36}{3/36 + 6/36}=\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

This avoids having to sum the [[infinite series]] corresponding to all the possible outcomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\operatorname{P}[\text{first i rolls are ties,}(i+1)^{\text{th}}\text{roll is ‘the point’}]&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, we can express the probability of rolling &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; ties followed by rolling the point:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[\text{first i rolls are ties, }(i+1)^{\text{th}} \text{roll is ‘the point’}]
 = (1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])^i\operatorname{P}[E_1]
&lt;/math&gt;

The summation becomes an infinite [[geometric series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])^i\operatorname{P}[E_1]
= \operatorname{P}[E_1] \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])^i
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \frac{\operatorname{P}[E_1]}{1-(1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])}
= \frac{\operatorname{P}[E_1]}{\operatorname{P}[E_1]+\operatorname{P}[E_2]}
&lt;/math&gt;

which agrees with the earlier result.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4268">A '''digital imaging technician''' ('''DIT''') works in the [[Motion picture industry|motion picture film industry]].  The DIT position was created in response to the transition from the long established [[Movie camera|film movie camera]] medium into the current [[digital cinema]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenlight.tv/blog/2013/02/08/what-is-a-digital-imaging-technician/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140517010745/http://www.screenlight.tv/blog/2013/02/08/what-is-a-digital-imaging-technician/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DIT is the camera department crew member who works in collaboration with the [[cinematographer]] on workflow, systemization, camera settings, signal integrity and image manipulation to achieve the highest image quality and creative goals of cinematography in the digital realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalproductionme.com/article-718-4k__bane_or_blessing/2/|title=4K - Bane or blessing?|last=Pennington|first=Adrian|date=|website=www.digitalproductionme.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the progression of the digitization ever more tasks concerning data management emerged:  the position of the Digital Imaging Technician was introduced. The DIT is the connector between on-set time and post production. DITs support the camera team with technical and creative tasks with the digital camera. Their purpose is to ensure the best technical quality possible, as well as production safety. DITs are responsible for tasks during preparation, on-set time and post production. They are also responsible for managing data on set, such as making backups and quality checks of the material. In post production, the DIT hands the recordings to the post production team, possibly after checking the quality of the material and generating working copies.

Data backups and quality control are of great significance for the DIT who has to make sure that the original camera data and [[metadata]] is backed up at least twice daily, ensuring data integrity with checksum verification. Furthermore, the data has to be backed up on [[LTO tape]] which is more sturdy than electronic devices and is used for long-term storage. Another copy must be made on a transfer data carrier that will be sent to post production along with the reports of the content. Again, the data has to be backed up. The data has to be accessible at all times and should be saved in a system where it can be reviewed, displaying the metadata of each clip.

The DIT's role on-set has become especially prevalent through assisting cinematographers, normally accustomed to [[film stock]], in achieving their desired look digitally.  This is accomplished by the DIT through monitoring picture exposure, setting up Color Decision List  ([[ASC CDL|CDL]]) on daily basis and, if requested, "look up tables" ([[3D lookup table|LUTs]]) for the post-production. Additionally, the DIT deals with settings in the digital camera's menu system, such as recording format and outputs.

Next to the DIT, the [[data wrangler]] position is created as a support role for managing, transferring and securing all the digital data acquired on-set via the [[digital cinematography cameras]], interacting with the [[Clapper Loader|2nd AC]]. Depending on the scale of the project, the DIT can be the data wrangler but never the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tristan Hey|title=The Role of the Digital Imaging Technician|date=2012-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahH3PZA7Gh0|accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the DIT is responsible for securing the digital audio recorded by the external [[digital audio]] recorder operated by the [[Production sound mixer|Production Sound Mixer]].

Prior to the DIT position, several other positions, such as Video Controller, Video Shader or Video Engineer, performed similar functions of exposure and color control over the live video image.  While these positions continue to exist, especially in live broadcast and studio television, the DIT position has become entrenched in Cinema, Commercials and higher end television.

In mathematics, the '''double Fourier sphere (DFS)''' method is a simple technique that transforms a function defined on the surface of the [[sphere]] to a function defined on a rectangular domain while preserving [[periodic function|periodicity]] in both the longitude and latitude directions.

==Introduction== 
First, a function &lt;math&gt;f(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; on the sphere is written as &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; using [[spherical coordinates]], i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda,\theta) = f(\cos\lambda\sin\theta,\sin\lambda\sin\theta, \cos\theta),  (\lambda,\theta)\in[-\pi,\pi]\times[0,\pi].&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;-periodic in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, but not periodic in &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The periodicity in the latitude direction has been lost. To recover it, the function is "doubled up” and a related function on &lt;math&gt;[-\pi,\pi]\times[-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}(\lambda,\theta) = \begin{cases} 
 g(\lambda + \pi, \theta), &amp; (\lambda, \theta) \in [-\pi, 0] \times [0, \pi],\\
 h(\lambda, \theta), &amp;(\lambda, \theta) \in [0, \pi] \times [0, \pi],\\
 g(\lambda, -\theta), &amp;(\lambda, \theta) \in [0, \pi] \times [-\pi, 0],\\
 h(\lambda + \pi, -\theta), &amp; (\lambda, \theta) \in [-\pi, 0] \times [-\pi, 0],\\
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g(\lambda, \theta) = f(\lambda- \pi, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(\lambda, \theta)  = f(\lambda, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \theta) \in[0, \pi] \times [0, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. The new function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;-periodic in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and is constant along the lines &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pm\pi&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the poles.

The function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; can be expanded into a double Fourier series

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f} \approx \sum_{j=-n}^n \sum_{k=-n}^n a_{jk} e^{ij\theta}e^{ik\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
The DFS method was proposed by Merilees&lt;ref&gt;P. E. Merilees, The pseudospectral approximation applied to the shallow water equations on a sphere, Atmosphere, 11 (1973), pp. 13–20&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further by [[Steven Orszag]].&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Orszag, Fourier series on spheres, Mon. Wea. Rev., 102 (1974), pp. 56–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The DFS method has been the subject of relatively few investigations since (a notable exception is Fornberg's work),&lt;ref&gt;B. Fornberg, A pseudospectral approach for polar and spherical geometries, SIAM J. Sci. Comp, 16 (1995), pp. 1071–1081&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps due to the dominance of [[spherical harmonics]] expansions. Over the last fifteen years it has begun to be used for the computation of gravitational fields near [[black holes]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Bartnik and A. Norton, Numerical methods for the Einstein equations in null quasispherical coordinates, SIAM J. Sci. Comp, 22 (2000), pp. 917–950&lt;/ref&gt; and to novel [[space-time]] [[Spectroscopy|spectral analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Sun, J. Li, F.-F. Jin, and F. Xie, Contrasting meridional structures of stratospheric and tropospheric planetary wave variability in the northern hemisphere, Tellus A, 66 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1517">The '''engine pressure ratio''' ('''EPR''') is the total pressure ratio across a [[jet engine]], measured as the ratio of the total pressure at the exit of the propelling nozzle divided by the total pressure at the entry to the compressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/epr.html | title=Pressure variation - EPR | accessdate=January 2, 2015 | author=Glenn Research Center (NASA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jet engines use either EPR or compressor/fan RPM as an indicator of thrust.&lt;ref&gt;http://code7700.com/epr.html&lt;/ref&gt; When EPR is used the pressures are measured anywhere convenient in the turbine intake and exhaust ducts.

== Integrated engine pressure ratio ==

The integrated engine pressure ratio (IEPR) is the ratio of the pressure at the core engine exhaust ''and'' fan discharge pressure compared to the intake pressure to the [[gas turbine engine]].  The IEPR is an engine indicator system unique to the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]].

A [[proposition|statement]], [[hypothesis]], or [[theory]] has '''falsifiability''' (or is  '''falsifiable''') if it is contradicted by a basic statement, which, in an eventual successful or failed falsification, must respectively correspond to a true or [[hypothetical]] observation.&lt;ref name="twomeanings"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XXII}}: "We must distinguish two meanings of the expressions ''falsifiable'' and ''falsifiability'':&lt;br /&gt;
"1) ''Falsifiable'' as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability. This purely logical concept — falsifiable in principle, one might say — rests on a logical relation between the theory in question and the class of basic statements (or the potential falsifiers described by them).&lt;br /&gt;
"2) ''Falsifiable'' in the sense that the theory in question can definitively or conclusively or demonstrably be falsified ("demonstrably falsifiable").&lt;br /&gt;
"I have always stressed that even a theory which is obviously falsifiable in the first sense is never falsifiable in this second sense. (For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reproducibility"&gt;For an actual falsification to occur, the basic statement must be  [[Reproducibility|reproducible]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66}}: "We say that a theory is falsified only if we have accepted basic statements which contradict it (cf. section 11, rule 2). This condition is necessary, but not sufficient; for we have seen that non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words, we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the claim "all swans are white" is falsifiable since it is contradicted by this basic statement: "In 1697, during the [[Willem de Vlamingh|Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh]] expedition, there were black swans on the shore of the Swan River in Australia", which in this case is a true observation.&lt;ref&gt;Back in those days it was assumed that everyone (in Europe) believed that swans had to be white {{harv|Life On Perth|2007}}, but this changed, because this basic statement is reproducible: swans can be seen at different times and locations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="observation"&gt;Popper put as an example of falsifiable statement with failed falsifications  Einstein's [[equivalence principle]]. See {{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XX}}: "Einstein's principle of proportionality of inert and (passively) heavy mass. This equivalence principle '''conflicts with many potential falsifiers: events whose observation is logically possible'''. Yet despite all attempts (the experiments by Eötvös, more recently refined by Rickle) to realize such a falsification experimentally, the experiments have so far corroborated the principle of equivalence."&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is also known by the terms '''refutable''' and '''refutability'''.

The concept was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]].   He saw falsifiability as the logical part and the cornerstone of his scientific [[epistemology]], which sets the limits of scientific inquiry.  He proposed that statements and theories that are not falsifiable are [[unscientific]].  Declaring an unfalsifiable theory to be [[scientific method|scientific]] would then be [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}

==Overview==
The classical view of the [[philosophy of science]] is that it is the goal of science to prove [[hypotheses]] like "All swans are white" or to [[inductive reasoning|induce]] them from observational data. The [[Inductive reasoning|Inductivist]] methodology supposes that one can somehow move from a series of statements such as 'here is a white swan', 'over there is a white swan', and so on, to a universal statement such as 'all swans are white'. As observed by  [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and later by Popper and others, this method is clearly ''deductively'' invalid, since it is always possible that there may be a non-white swan that has eluded observation&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popper|1959|p=4}} : "Now it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we are justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white."&lt;/ref&gt; (and, in fact, the discovery of the Australian [[black swan]] demonstrated the deductive invalidity of this particular statement). This is known as the [[problem of induction]].

One solution to the problem of induction, proposed by Immanuel Kant in [[Critique of Pure Reason]], is to consider as valid absolutely [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the conclusions that we would otherwise have drawn from these dubious inferential inductions.&lt;ref&gt;In {{harvnb|Kant|1787|loc=sec II, B4}}: "If, therefore, a judgment is thought with strict universality, i.e., so that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely a priori."&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kant, Popper accepted that we have to work with unproven hypotheses, but he refused that we have to justify them in any way&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=9}}: "According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way—an anticipation, a hypothesis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction. These conclusions are then compared with one another and with other relevant statements, so as to find what logical relations (such as equivalence, derivability, compatiblity, or incompatibility) exist between them."&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote {{harv|Popper|1959|p=6}}: "I do not think that his ingenious attempt to provide an a priori justification for synthetic statements was successful." However, if one finds one single swan that is not white, deductive logic admits the conclusion that the statement that all swans are white is false. Falsificationism thus strives for questioning, for falsification, of hypotheses instead of proving them or trying to view them as valid in any way.

For a statement to be questioned using observation, it needs to be at least theoretically possible that it can come into conflict with observation. A key observation of falsificationism is thus that a criterion of demarcation is needed to distinguish those statements that can come into conflict with observation and those that cannot, but the criterion itself concerns only the logical form of the theory: 

{{Quote|text=I shall require that [the] logical form [of the theory] shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}

Popper always insisted on a clear distinction between the logic (of falsifiability) and its applied less precise methodology.&lt;ref |group=notes&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=Sec. 3}}: "Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref |group=notes&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|loc=section 23, 1er paragraphe}} : "The requirement of falsifiability which was a little vague to start with has now been split into two parts. The first, the methodological postulate (cf. section 20), can hardly be made quite precise. The second, the logical criterion, is quite definite as soon as it is clear which statements are to be called ‘basic’."&lt;/ref&gt; The required logical form, the criterion,  is that there must exist basic statements that contradict the theory (and also some that corroborate it because the theory must be consistent). This logical form informally implies the possibility of refutations by experience because, in its informal methodological context, a basic statement must be intersubjective and interpretable in terms of observations.

Objections can be raised against falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation similar to those which can be raised against [[Formal verification|verifiability]].  For example, as pointed out by many{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} and reformulated by Colin McGinn, 
{{quote|text=[w]e have to be able to infer that if a falsifying result has been found in a given experiment it will be found in future experiments; ... this is clearly an inductive inference.|author=Colin McGinn|source={{harvnb|McGinn|2002|loc=sec. 3}}}}

Very early, in anticipation of this specific objection Popper wrote,  
{{Quote|text=This attack would not disturb me.  My proposal is based upon an ''asymmetry'' between verifiability and falsifiability; an asymmetry which results from the logical form of universal statements. For these are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements.|sign=Karl Popper|source=[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p 19}}

In its simple form, the point here is that although a singular existential statement such as 'there is a white swan in Europe' cannot be used to affirm a universal statement, it can be used to show that one is false: the statement 'there is a non white swan in Australia' implies that the universal statement 'all swans are white' is false. Moreover, this singular existential statement is empirical: it is impractical to observe all the swans in the world to verify that they are all white, but one can observe one swan that is not white.  This shows the fundamental difference between verifiability and falsifiability. Also, in the logical form of the theory, there is no notion of future experiments, but only a (formal) class of basic statements that contradict it.&lt;ref name="reproducibility" /&gt;&lt;ref name="empiricalisalogicalrequirement"/&gt;

Such a simple contradiction with a basic statement is not what Popper calls a falsification.&lt;ref name="falsifiabilityVsfalsification"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=66|loc=sec. 22}}: "We must clearly distinguish between falsifiability and falsification. We have introduced falsifiability solely as a criterion for the empirical character of a system of statements. As to falsification, special rules must be introduced which will determine under what conditions a
system is to be regarded as falsified."&lt;/ref&gt; A falsification usually entails a derivation from a system of statements, which include the universal statement and initial conditions, to a singular statement, which is contradicted by a falsifying hypothesis,&lt;ref name="reproducibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Popper|1959|p=55}}: "We may distinguish, within a theoretical system, statements belonging to various levels of universality. The statements on the highest level of universality are the axioms; statements on the lower levels can be deduced from them. Higher level empirical statements have always the character of hypotheses relative to the lower level statements deducible from them: they can be falsified by the falsification of these less universal statements. ... The falsifying mode of inference here referred to—the way in which the falsification of a conclusion entails the falsification of the system from which it is derived—is the modus tollens of classical logic. It may be described as follows:  Let p be a conclusion of a system t of statements which may consist of theories and initial conditions ..."&lt;/ref&gt; but the argument can be generalized. Popper explains 
{{quote|text="... it is possible by means of purely deductive inferences (with the help of the modus tollens of classical logic) to argue from the truth of singular statements to the falsity of universal statements. Such an argument to the falsity of universal statements is the only strictly deductive kind of inference that proceeds, as it were, in the ‘inductive direction’; that is, from singular to universal statements."|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=19}}}}   Contemporary philosopher [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] mentions{{sfn|Miller|2014|p=4}} that other similar objections have been anticipated and answered by Popper.{{sfn|Popper|1972|loc=Chapter 1}}

The falsifiability criterion does not imply that unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics are not parts of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: "For Popper, however, to assert that a theory is unscientific, is not necessarily to hold that it is unenlightening, still less that it is meaningless, for it sometimes happens that a theory which is unscientific (because it is unfalsifiable) at a given time may become falsifiable, and thus scientific, with the development of technology, or with the further articulation and refinement of the theory. Further, even purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function in the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of reality."&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to intuition, unfalsifiable statements can be embedded in—and [[logical consequence|deductively entailed]] by—falsifiable theories. For example, while "all men are mortal" is unfalsifiable, it is a [[logical consequence]] of the falsifiable theory that "all men die 150 years after their birth at the latest".{{sfn|Keuth|2004|p=45}} Similarly, the ancient metaphysical and unfalsifiable idea of the existence of atoms has led to corresponding falsifiable modern theories. Popper invented the notion of [[metaphysical]] research programs to name such unfalsifiable ideas that guide the search for a new theory.{{sfn|Popper|1982|loc=Introductory comments}}

Thus falsificationism has two levels. At the logical level, scientists use deductive logic to attempt to falsify theories. At the non-logical level, they decide on some criteria, which use falsification and other factors, to pick which theories they will study, improve, replace, apply or (further) test. These other criteria may take into account a metaphysical research program. They are not considered in the formal falsifiability criterion, but they can give a meaning to this criterion. Needless to say, for Popper, these other criteria, the so called rules of the game, are necessary. Some philosophers consider them  as parts of Popper's demarcation criterion, but Popper viewed them only as a necessary context.

In contrast to [[Positivism]], which held that statements are meaningless if they cannot be verified or falsified, Popper claimed that falsifiability is merely a special case of the more general notion of [[critical rationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=26}}: "The proper answer to my question 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?' is, I believe, 'By criticizing the theories or guesses of others and--if we can train ourselves to do so--by criticizing our own theories or guesses.' (The latter point is highly desirable, but not indispensable; for if we fail to criticize our own theories, there may be others to do it for us.) This answer sums up a position which I propose to call 'critical rationalism'."&lt;/ref&gt; even though he admitted that empirical refutation is one of the most effective methods by which theories can be criticized. Criticizability, in contrast to falsifiability, and thus rationality, may be comprehensive (i.e., have no logical limits), though this claim is controversial, even among proponents of Popper's philosophy and critical rationalism.

==Definition==
For Popper (and others) in any scientific discussion we accept a background knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=238}}: While discussing a problem we always accept (if only temporarily) all kinds of things as unproblematic: they constitute for the time being, and for the discussion of this particular problem, what I call our background knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt; Such a background knowledge is thus implicit in the definition of falsifiability and corresponds to different types of statements, their relationship&lt;ref name="twomeanings"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1983|p=XXII}}: "We must distinguish two meanings of the expressions ''falsifiable'' and ''falsifiability'':&lt;br /&gt;
"1) ''Falsifiable'' as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability. This purely logical concept — falsifiable in principle, one might say — rests on a logical relation between the theory in question and the class of basic statements (or the potential falsifiers described by them).&lt;br /&gt;
"2) ''Falsifiable'' in the sense that the theory in question can definitively or conclusively or demonstrably be falsified ("demonstrably falsifiable").&lt;br /&gt;
"I have always stressed that even a theory which is obviously falsifiable in the first sense is never falsifiable in this second sense. (For this reason I have used the expression ''falsifiable'' as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of ''falsifiability'' but rather of ''falsification'' and of its  problems)"&lt;/ref&gt; and their interpretation in terms of observations and measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=84}}: "... that is to say, basic statements must be testable, inter-subjectively, by ‘observation’. Since they are singular statements, this requirement can of course only refer to observers who are suitably placed in space and time (a point which I shall not elaborate)."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different types of statements===
Recall that a theory is falsifiable if it is contradicted by a basic statement. It remains to define what kind of statements create theories and what are basic statements. [[Physical law|Scientific theories]]  are a particular kind of [[universal quantification|universal statements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=37}}: " The empirical sciences are systems of theories. The logic of scientific knowledge can therefore be described as a theory of theories.  Scientific theories are universal statements."&lt;/ref&gt; Basic statements are particular kind of [[existential quantification|existential statements]].&lt;ref name="basicstatements"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=83–84}}: "A statement of the form ‘There is a so-and-so in the region k’ or ‘Such-and-such an event is occurring in the region k’ (cf. section 23) may be called a ‘singular existential statement’ or a ‘singular there-is statement’. And the statement which results from negating it, i.e. ‘There is no so-and-so in the region k’ or ‘No event of such-and-such a kind is occurring in the region k’, may be called a ‘singular non-existence statement’, or a ‘singular there-is-not statement’.  We may now lay down the following rule concerning basic statements: basic statements have the form of singular existential statements."&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all universal statements are theories and not all existential statements are basic statements. Theories have the form of '''strictly''' universal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=48}}: "The theories of natural science, and especially what we call natural laws, have the logical form of strictly universal statements; thus they can be expressed in the form of negations of strictly existential statements or, as we may say, in the form of non-existence statements (or ‘there-is-not’ statements). For example, the law of the conservation of energy can be expressed in the form: ‘There is no perpetual motion machine’, or the hypothesis of the electrical elementary charge in the form: ‘There is no electrical charge other than a multiple of the electrical elementary charge’."&lt;/ref&gt; Basic statements have the form of [[wiktionary:singular existential statement|'''singular''' existential statements]].&lt;ref name="basicstatements" /&gt; Thus we need to distinguish between  existential and universal statements and also between singular  and strict  statements.

Existential and universal statements are built-in concepts in [[First-order logic|logic]]. The first are statements  such as "there is a white swan".  Logicians call these statements [[existential quantification|existential statements]], since they assert the existence of something.  They are equivalent to a first-order logic statement of the form: ''There exists an x such that x is a swan, and x is white.'' The second are statements that categorize all instances of something, such as "all swans are white". Logicians call these statements [[universal quantification|universal]]. They are usually parsed in the form: ''For all x, if x is a swan, then x is white''.

Unlike existential and universal statements, singular and strict statements are not built-in concepts in logic, because they correspond to a specific perspective on our experience of the world.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=42}}  We can understand them in terms of the concepts of universal or individual names: {{quote |text="... ‘dictator’, ‘planet’, ‘H2O’ are universal concepts or universal names. ‘Napoleon’, ‘the earth’, ‘the Atlantic’ are singular or individual concepts or names. In these examples individual concepts or names appear to be characterized either by being proper names, or by having to be defined by means of proper names, whilst universal concepts or names can be defined without the use of proper names."|author=Karl Popper|source={{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=42–43}}}}

A statement is strict or pure, if it does not use any individual name. So, a law of nature cannot refer to particular things. The sentence "This apple is attracted by the planet earth" is not a scientific statement. Popper wrote an entire section on strictly universal and strictly existential statements,{{sfn|Popper|1959|pp=47-50}} because he considers the distinction between universal and individual concepts
or names to be of fundamental importance.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=43}}

A statement is singular if it contains an individual name or the equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;This is Popper's definition. There is no well established definition of ''singular statement'', ''singular sentence'' or ''singular proposition''. For example,  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says that it is a sentence without variables, free or bound. This is also the definition adopted by Alfred Tarski in ''Introduction to logic and to the methodology of deductive sciences''. However, in the debate between Fregeans and Russellians in the philosophy of language, the definition is more restrictive: a singular sentence means a sentence with a single subject that respects a property such as "Mont Blanc is more than 4000 meters high" - see "Singular Propositions and
Singular Thoughts" by Arthur Sullivan.&lt;/ref&gt;   So, a basic statement must make reference to a specific thing or specific location and time. The sentence "There exists a black swan" is not a basic statement, but the statement "There is a black swan on the shore of the Swan River" is a basic statement, it is a singular existential statement.

Popper arrived at these conditions through an analysis of what one expects from basic statements.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=83}}  In addition, a basic statement must be inter-subjective.{{sfn|Popper|1959|p=84}} So, "John saw a  black swan on the shore of the Swan River" is not a basic statement.&lt;ref&gt;Unless, of course, the theory is about people seeing black swans, in which case, we view John as a thing, just as the shore is a thing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological rules and falsifying hypotheses===
Falsifiability is defined strictly in terms of the logical form of the theory,&lt;ref name="twomeanings" /&gt; but this criterion of demarcation can not work without being complemented by methodological rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=28–29}}: "If therefore we characterize empirical science merely by the formal or logical structure of its statements, we shall not be able to exclude from it that prevalent form of metaphysics which results from elevating an obsolete scientific theory into an incontrovertible truth. Such are my reasons for proposing that empirical science should be characterized by its methods: by our manner of dealing with scientific systems: by what we do with them and what we do to them. Thus I shall try to establish the rules, or if you will the norms, by which the scientist is guided when he is engaged in research or in discovery, in the sense here understood."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, contemporary philosophers consider that Popper's demarcation criterion has two parts: the logical part (stated in terms of rules of inference - ways to logically infer new statements from existing statements) and the methodological part (stated in terms of rules that do not claim to prove anything).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}}: "Popper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its applied methodology. The logic of his theory is utterly simple: if a single ferrous metal is unaffected by a magnetic field it cannot be the case that all ferrous metals are affected by magnetic fields. Logically speaking, a scientific law is conclusively falsifiable although it is not conclusively verifiable. Methodologically, however, the situation is much more complex: no observation is free from the possibility of error—consequently we may question whether our experimental result was what it appeared to be."&lt;/ref&gt;  The methodological rules define falsification. They should not be confused with the (logical) rules of inferences used to define falsifiability, which is about the logical form of the theory.&lt;ref name="falsifiabilityVsfalsification"/&gt;

In this larger picture, the fact that a single basic statement can contradict a strictly universal statement, though true logically, is in itself useless, because it cannot lead to a falsification. To support falsification, Popper requires that a class of basic statements corroborate a falsifying hypothesis.&lt;ref name="reproducibility"/&gt; A  basic statement corroborates the falsifying hypothesis, if it does not logically contradict it, but contradicts the theory to be falsified. Though it corresponds to the empirical notion of reproducible experiments, this requirement exists entirely at the formal level&lt;ref name="empiricalisalogicalrequirement"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|pp=66–67}}: "The requirement that the falsifying hypothesis must be empirical, and so falsifiable, only means that it must stand in a certain logical relationship to possible basic statements; thus this requirement only concerns the logical form of the hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt; and must be complemented by methodological rules in a falsification process.

==Naïve falsification{{anchor|Naïve|Na.C3.AFve}}==&lt;!-- see [[Karl Popper]] --&gt;

Naïve falsificationism is an unsuccessful attempt to prescribe a rationally unavoidable method for science. Sophisticated methodological falsification, on the other hand, is a prescription of a way in which scientists ought to behave as a matter of choice. The object of this is to arrive at an incremental process whereby theories become ''less bad''.{{Citation needed|reason=We don't even know what naive falsification means here|date=June 2018}}

Naïve falsification considers scientific statements individually. Scientific theories are formed from groups of these sorts of statements, and it is these groups that must be accepted or rejected by scientists. Scientific theories can always be defended by the addition of [[ad hoc hypothesis|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]].{{Citation needed|reason=The two previous sentences are not connected - what is the point?|date=June 2018}}  As Popper put it, a ''decision'' is required on the part of the scientist to accept or reject the statements that go to make up a theory or that might falsify it. At some point, the weight of the ''ad hoc'' hypotheses and disregarded falsifying observations will become so great that it becomes unreasonable to support the base theory any longer, and a decision will be made to reject it.{{Citation needed|reason=Where Popper says that|date=June 2018}}

Although the logic of naïve falsification is valid, it is rather limited. Nearly any statement can be made to fit the data, so long as one makes the requisite 'compensatory adjustments'. Popper drew attention to these limitations in ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' in response to criticism from [[Pierre Duhem]]. [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] expounded this argument in detail, calling it [[confirmation holism]]. To logically falsify a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]], one must find a true falsifying singular statement. But Popper pointed out that it is always possible to ''change'' the universal statement or the existential statement so that falsification does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: "It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least."&lt;/ref&gt; On hearing that a black swan has been observed in Australia, one might introduce the ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis, 'all swans are white except those found in Australia'; or one might adopt another, more cynical view about some observers, 'Australian [[ornithology|bird watchers]] are incompetent'.

Thus, naïve falsification ought to, but does not, supply a way of handling competing hypotheses for many subject controversies (for instance [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[urban legends]]). People arguing that there is no support for such an observation may argue that there is nothing to see, that all is normal, or that the differences or appearances are too small to be statistically significant.  On the other side are those who concede that an observation has occurred and that a universal statement has been falsified as a consequence.  Therefore, naïve falsification does not enable scientists, who rely on [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] criteria, to present a definitive falsification of universal statements.{{Citation needed|reason=Who says that|date=June 2018}}

==Falsificationism==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

In place of naïve falsification, Popper envisioned science as progressing by the successive rejection of falsified theories, rather than falsified statements.  Falsified theories are to be replaced by theories that can account for the [[phenomena]] that falsified the prior theory, that is, with greater [[explanatory power]]. For example, [[Aristotle|Aristotelian mechanics]] explained observations of everyday situations, but were falsified by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s experiments, and were replaced by Newtonian mechanics, which accounted for the phenomena noted by Galileo (and others). [[Newtonian mechanics]]' reach included the observed motion of the planets and the mechanics of gases. The Youngian wave theory of light (i.e., waves carried by the [[luminiferous aether]]) replaced Newton's (and many of the Classical Greeks') particles of light but in turn was falsified by the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] and was superseded by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electrodynamics and Einstein's [[special relativity]], which did account for the newly observed phenomena. Furthermore, Newtonian mechanics applied to the atomic scale was replaced with [[quantum mechanics]], when the old theory could not provide an answer to the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], the [[Gibbs paradox]], or how [[Atomic orbital|electron orbits]] could exist without the particles radiating away their energy and spiraling towards the centre. Thus the new theory had to posit the existence of unintuitive concepts such as [[energy levels]], [[quantum|quanta]] and [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]].

At each stage, experimental observation made a theory untenable (i.e., falsified it) and a new theory was found that had greater ''explanatory power'' (i.e., could account for the previously unexplained phenomena), and as a result, ''provided greater opportunity for its own falsification''.

==Criterion of demarcation==
Popper uses falsification as a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]] to draw a sharp line between those theories that are scientific and those that are unscientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if for no other reason than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory, or come to see an unfalsifiable theory as unsupportable. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.

The Popperian criterion excludes from the domain of science not unfalsifiable ''statements'' but only ''whole theories'' that ''contain no'' falsifiable statements; thus it leaves us with the [[confirmation holism|Duhemian]] problem of what constitutes a 'whole theory' as well as the problem of what makes a statement 'meaningful'.  Popper's own falsificationism, thus, is not only an alternative to verificationism, it is also an acknowledgement of the conceptual distinction that previous theories had ignored.

===Verificationism===
{{Main|Verificationist}}
{{See also|Abductive reasoning}}

In the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism (also known as the verifiability theory of meaning) holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be both meaningful and scientific.
This was an essential feature of the [[logical positivism]] of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] that included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], the Berlin philosopher [[Hans Reichenbach]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both. In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation.

Thus, Popper urged that verifiability be replaced with falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation. On the other hand, he strictly opposed the view that non-falsifiable statements are meaningless or otherwise inherently bad, and noted that falsificationism is only  concerned with meaningful statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=18|loc=footnote 3}}: "Falsifiability separates two kinds of perfectly meaningful statements: the falsifiable and the non-falsifiable. It draws a line inside meaningful language, not around it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in courts of law===
Falsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases (see below). A survey of 303 federal judges&lt;ref&gt;Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N = 619). Only 303 usable surveys were
obtained for a response rate of 51% (see {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}).&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in 1998 (and fully reported in {{harvnb|Krafka|2002}}) revealed that  "[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert’s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases."

==== The McLean v. Arkansas case ====
In the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that "[[creation science]]" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):
* It is guided by natural law; 
* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law;  
* It is testable against the empirical world; 
* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and 
* It is falsifiable. 
In his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}

==== The Daubert case ====
In the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.&lt;ref&gt;The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.&lt;/ref&gt;  These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested. ''Scientific methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes science from other fields of human inquiry.'' Green 645. See also C. Hempel, Philosophy of Natural Science 49 (1966) (''[T]he statements constituting a scientific explanation must be capable of empirical test''); K. Popper, Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge 37 (5th ed. 1989) (''[T]he criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability'') (emphasis deleted).|author=Harry Blackmun|source={{harvnb|Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|1993|p=593}}}}

In a partially dissident opinion, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]  supported by Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], responded that: {{Quote| text=I defer to no one in my confidence in federal judges; but I am at a loss to know what is meant when it is said that the scientific status of a theory depends on its ''falsifiability,'' and I suspect some of them will be, too.|author = William Rehnquist|source= {{harvnb|Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|1993|p=600}}}}

Professor of Law David H. Kaye&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[David Kaye (law professor)]], United Nations special rapporteur. David H. Kaye is distinguished professor of law at [[Penn State Law]].&lt;/ref&gt; argued that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that "inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaye|2005|p=2}}: "... several courts have treated the abstract possibility of falsification as sufficient to satisfy this aspect of the screening of scientific evidence. This essay challenges these views. It first explains the distinct meanings of falsification and falsifiability. It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfalsifiable statistics/double evidence standards combo==
There are combinations of prediction types and methodologies that, while each component is compatible with falsifiability on its own, renders falsification impossible together. One example is the combination of statistical predictions in which individual exceptions do not falsify the theory with different evidence standards for different data points in which one type of data point only require ordinary evidence while another require extraordinary evidence. On one hand, the theory that there are no black swans is falsifiable even if there is a requirement of extraordinary evidence for a black swan, since it is not impossible for an individual observation of a black swan to eventually meet the requirement of extraordinary evidence. On the other hand, in a country where there are in reality the same number of black swans as white swans, the theory that there are more white swans than black swans at a population level with individual exceptions is falsifiable as long as the level of evidence required to record a white swan is the same as that for recording black swans. But if the theory is that white swans are more statistically common than black swans with exceptions and a higher level of evidence is required for recording a black swan than for recording a white swan, the difference in evidence standards will cause more white swans than black swans to be recorded even in a country where the ratio is in fact 50/50. This makes the combination of statistical prediction with exceptions and differences in evidence standards incompatible with falsifiability. This have been implicated in the [[replication crisis]], especially in [[psychology]] in which the two methodologies are more common than in other fields and therefore more often combine to prevent falsifiability even though the two factos are not unheard of on their own in other fields, as well as the problem being caused by active application of methodologies and therefore spreading the issues to other fields that psychology interacts with through interdisciplines such as [[evolutionary psychology]] spreading the problems to evolution research, and not allowing the other fields to help falsifiability in psychology as would have been possible had the problem been a passive lack of components for falsifiability.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence | David Miller, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Vast Graveyard of Undead Theories: Publication Bias and Psychological Science’s Aversion to the Null | Christopher J.

Nobody else does better, but they keep trying, like chemists still in search of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] or physicists trying to build [[perpetual motion machines]].|author=[[Rafe Champion]]|source="Agreeing to Disagree: Bartley's Critique of Reason", 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | asin=B00CGETUCM | url=https://www.amazon.com/Reason-Imagination-Critical-Rationalist-Papers-ebook/dp/B00CGETUCM | title=Reason and Imagination (Critical Rationalist Papers Book 2) | author=Champion, Rafe | year=2013 | quote=Philosophers' talk about rationality is apt to soar into the stratosphere of abstractions so it must be stated that Bartley's approach has immediate and practical applications.  Following his teacher, Karl Popper, the operating principle of Bartley's rationalism is the formula 'I may he wrong and you may be right, and by means of critical discussion we may get nearer to the truth of the matter'.  This simple principle of rationality requires philosophical defence in depth, backed up by a wide range of improved traditions and institutions to sustain the flow of ideas and critical discussion. These vehicles already exist of course, if only in rudimentary forms, among them talk-back radio, the range of serious 'little magazines' and programs on TV which allow opposing points of view to he explored and debated. These forums are vitally important despite all their imperfections and lapses into the trivial and the banal; the important thing is that they exist, not that they should be scrupulously fair and unbiased at all times nor that they confine themselves to matters of great moral and intellectual moment.  Bartley has provided philosophical air support for the footsoldiers of rationality.  He offers a solution to the basic logical problem of rationality, namely how can we justify the basic premise of rationality, that is, the principle of rationality itself, the principle that we should engage in critical discussion to seek for rationally defensible beliefs?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|What distinguishes science from all other human endeavours is that the accounts of the world that our best, mature sciences deliver are strongly supported by evidence and this evidence gives us the strongest reason to believe them.'  That anyway is what is said at the beginning of the advertisement for a recent conference on induction at a celebrated seat of learning in the UK.  It shows how much critical rationalists still have to do to make known the message of ''Logik der Forschung'' concerning what empirical evidence is able to do and what it does.|author=[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]]|source="Some hard questions for critical rationalism", 2011{{sfn|Miller|2014}}}}

===Kuhn and Lakatos===
Whereas Popper was concerned in the main with the ''logic'' of science, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' examined in detail the [[history of science]]. Kuhn argued that scientists work within a conceptual [[paradigm]] that strongly influences the way in which they see data. Scientists will go to great length to defend their paradigm against falsification, by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses to existing theories. Changing a 'paradigm' is difficult, as it requires an individual scientist to break with his or her peers and defend a heterodox theory.

Some falsificationists saw Kuhn's work as a vindication, since it provided historical evidence that science progressed by rejecting inadequate theories, and that it is the ''decision'', on the part of the scientist, to accept or reject a theory that is the crucial element of falsificationism. Foremost amongst these was [[Imre Lakatos]].

Lakatos attempted to explain Kuhn's work by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific universal statements of naïve falsification. In Lakatos' approach, a scientist works within a research program that corresponds roughly with Kuhn's 'paradigm'. Whereas Popper rejected the use of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses as unscientific, Lakatos accepted their place in the development of new theories.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978}}

===Feyerabend===
[[Paul Feyerabend]] examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method. Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Sokal and Bricmont===
In their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticized falsifiability on the grounds that it does not accurately describe the way science really works. They argue that theories are used because of their successes, not because of the failures of other theories. Their discussion of Popper, falsifiability and the philosophy of science comes in a chapter entitled "Intermezzo," which contains an attempt to make clear their own views of what constitutes truth, in contrast with the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.

Sokal and Bricmont write, "When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher subjective probability. ... But Popper will have none of this: throughout his life he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of 'confirmation' of a theory, or even of its 'probability'. ... [but] the history of science teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of their successes." (Sokal and Bricmont 1997, 62f)

They further argue that falsifiability cannot distinguish between astrology and astronomy, as both make technical predictions that are sometimes incorrect.

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]], a contemporary philosopher of critical rationalism, has attempted to defend Popper against these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Sokal and Bricmont: Back to the Frying Pan|journal=Pli|volume=9|year=2000|pages=156–73|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003401/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}, also chapter 6 of {{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=David|title=Out of Error|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller argues that astrology does not lay itself open to falsification, while astronomy does, and this is the litmus test for science.

===Economics===
[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from falsifiable to unfalsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: "For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mises_Action"&gt;Ludwig von Mises. [[Human Action]], p. 11, "r. Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction". Referenced 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper's, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].

===Evolution===
{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}
Numerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied "[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution, Third Edition |first=M |last=Ridley |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited |year=2003 |isbn=1-4051-0345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.&lt;ref name="The Evolution Wars"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=C |title=The Evolution Wars |publisher=Time Magazine |date=2005-08-07 |page=32|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[River Out of Eden]] |publisher=Basic Books |year=1995 |isbn=0-465-06990-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Blind Watchmaker]] |publisher=W.

===Young-earth creationism===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}

Much of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.

===Historicism===
Theories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper "fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history"&lt;ref name="popperc"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,&lt;ref name="popperc" /&gt;  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.

===Mathematics===
Like all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, "One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food swaps''' are events where members of a local community meet up to share homemade, homegrown, and foraged foods with each other. Apart from diversifying their [[larder]]s and redistributing surpluses and gluts, they provide opportunities for building stronger communities, and picking up tips. No money changes hands. Attendees bring items that they wish to swap and then bid for each other's produce, either verbally or on cards in the form of a [[silent auction]], until suitable swaps are negotiated. Often attendees bring extra items either as free samples or as contributions to a [[potluck]] lunch or tea, so that there is more time to get to know each other, exchange gossip and pass on tips.

==History==
Food has been swapped and traded since prehistoric times, from cacao beans to spices, fresh-killed meat to foraged berries.&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winterman|first=Denise|title=Food swapping: The movement taking off in the UK|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22539062|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Food Swap Network started in Brooklyn, New York in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Swap Network Founders|url=http://www.foodswapnetwork.com/about-us/|publisher=Food Swap Network|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 125 groups have been established across the US and Canada, as well as in Europe including the UK.&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"/&gt;  'Apples for Eggs' is a produce-sharing network set up in the UK in 2011.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Hyslop"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyslop|first=Leah|title=Word of mouth: Apples for Eggs, a food-swapping scheme|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10383395/Word-of-mouth-Apples-for-Eggs-a-food-swapping-scheme.html|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=Telegraph Magazine|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Apples for Eggs' has 159 registered swappers and organises events in York, Ormskirk, Henley, Stoke, and Brampton in Cumbria. There are similar events in Brazil, Denmark, France and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sturgess|first=Emma|title=Food swapping: a fast way to free, homegrown food|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/16/food-swapping-fast-free-homegrown|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
There are several networks that organise food swaps, but anyone can create an event. The organisers provide premises, which may be a person's home, or a community building, publicise the event, and may also provide swapping cards or in some other way specify a procedure to be followed. The organisers may also provide tables and seating and may lay on teas and coffees for the attendees, or at least provide hot water and utensils for them to make their own.

Attendees may be advised to package their produce both for good looks and for transportability. While attendees kitchens are unlikely to be certified nut-free or have Food Standards Agency guarantees of cleanliness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apples for Eggs|url=http://www.applesforeggs.com/|publisher=Apples for Eggs|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; swappers may be asked to specify ingredients, whether an item can be considered vegetarian or vegan, storage instructions, and a suggested use-by date, all based on trust and judgement.

Items may be grouped into swappable units, for example six cup-cakes may be equivalent to one loaf of bread, or three small fresh-caught fish. Swappers cruise the room, noting their interest by filling in bid cards at the different stands before the big exchange starts.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"/&gt; Teas and coffees, or a potluck lunch provide an opportunity for people to get to know each other, and to swap recipes and tips. Attendees are usually asked to bring free samples of their wares, or some other items to share with others during the lunch or tea. Afterwards, bid cards are finalised, and finally, people actually swap their goods with others and clear up the room.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Hyslop"/&gt;

If a food swap event last two hours, the timetable may be as follows: During the first 30 minutes people sign-in, set-up, and greetings go on. Swappers fill out name tags and swap sheets and set up their wares on the tables. The next 30 minutes to 1 hour are for everyone to walk around, examine, and sample items from other swappers, writing swap bids on other swappers' cards. Potluck tea or lunch may take place here too. The final 30 minutes are when all the swapping actually happens. Everyone goes back to their own bid cards, looks at the offers, finds interested offerers via their name tags, and swaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a food swap?|url=http://www.foodswapnetwork.com/what-is-a-food-swap/|publisher=Food Swap Network|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Organisers of food swaps say the idea is part of a "new type of collectivism" including skills sharing and clothes swapping, and that it also feeds into current trends for thrift, recycling and making things yourself. The aims of food swapping are said to be to reduce waste, save people money, and bring communities together.&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"/&gt; Vicky Swift, who runs 'Apples for Eggs', told the BBC that the growing popularity of food swaps is about more than just food. "They are really social events and you get such a mix of people, from university students to pensioners. I think people like the sense of community that a food swap provides and you meet like-minded people with the same interests. People mingle, chat and swap expertise."&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"/&gt; She added to ''The Telegraph'', "There’s something very bonding about exchanging goods with someone you haven’t met before, and when you meet them again, you feel you’ve made a lasting connection. We really are seeing little communities blossom around these events."&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Hyslop"/&gt;

Martin Dolce, a UK food swapper, explained that when it's time to swap, you've got to move fast. "The first time I was forewarned that it would get a bit frantic. I thought: 'I'm a businessman, I can handle it.' I didn't know what was going on and I missed the choice stuff. Now I proactively go and grab something I like: you want that, I've got that, boom. The first five minutes are crucial."&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"/&gt;

''The Guardian'' warns that food swapping isn't for everyone. Nicki Jones, at a UK food swap said, "This would be my mother's worst nightmare. She couldn't bear the thought of having anyone else's things."&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"/&gt;

'''Funnel charts''' are a type of [[chart]], often used to represent stages in a [[sales process]]&lt;ref name=Crystal-2004&gt;{{cite book  |title=Crystal Reports 10: The Complete Reference|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and show the amount of potential revenue for each stage. This type of chart can also be useful in identifying potential problem areas in an organization’s sales processes. A funnel chart is similar to a stacked percent bar chart.

== Composition ==
A funnel chart displays values as progressively decreasing proportions amounting to 100 percent in total. The size of the area is determined by the series value as a percentage of the total of all values.&lt;ref name=Microsoft-2008&gt;{{cite book  |title=SQL Server 2008 Books Online |publisher=Microsoft |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any funnel consists of the higher part called ''head'' (or ''base'') and the lower part referred to as ''neck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |website=AnyChart JavaScript Chart Documentation | url=http://docs.anychart.com/7.9.1/Basic_Charts_Types/Funnel_Chart/ |title=Funnel Chart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
A typical example of a funnel chart starts with the sales leads on top, then down to the qualified leads, the hot leads and the closed deals. A business is bound to lose some number of potential deals at each step in the [[sales process]] and this is represented by the narrowing sections as you move from the top section (the widest) to the bottom section (the narrowest.) This allows executives to see how effective the sales team is in turning a [[sales lead]] into a closed deal. A sales funnel chart can also be used to quickly communicate your organization's sales process to new members of the sales team or other interested parties.

A funnel chart can be used to display [[Web site]] visitor trends. It is likely that the funnel chart will display a wide area at the top, indicating visitor page hits to the [[homepage]], and the other areas will be proportionally smaller, like the downloads or the people interested in buying the product.
 
Another example is the [[order fulfillment]] funnel chart with the initiated orders on top and down to the bottom the orders delivered to satisfied customers. It shows how many there are still in the process and the [[percentage]] cancelled and returned.&lt;ref name="Van Leeuwen-2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Leeuwen |first=Matthys |url=http://ordercore.blogspot.com/2009/02/fulfill-orders.html |title=Managing Multi-Channel Orders with OrderCore - Enabling a Customer Focus in Order Fulfillment |publisher=Lulu |year=2009 |pages=34 |isbn=978-0-557-03968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of chart ==
Ideally the funnel chart shows a [[wikt:process|process]] that starts at 100% and ends with a lower [[percentage]] where it is noticeable in what stages the [[fall out]] happens and at what [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]]. If the chart is also combined with [[research]] data, meaning quantified measurements of just how many items are lost at each step of the sales or [[order fulfillment]] process, then the funnel chart illustrates where the biggest bottlenecks are in the process.

Note that unlike a real [[funnel]], everything that is "poured in" at the top doesn't flow through to the bottom.  The name only refers to the [[shape]] of the [[chart]], the purpose of which is illustrative.

'''''Gravi de pugna''''' is a [[pseudepigrapha|forged]]&lt;!--For the preference of this term over the more conventional ''[[pseudepigrapha]]'', see Bart Ehrman ''Forged''--&gt; letter written in the name of [[Augustine of Hippo]] which asserts that the morally superior side is always superior in battle and therefore that wars are proven to be [[just war]]s by their military success. The letter was widely accepted as authentic, and reassured soldiers that [[Gott mit uns|God was on their side]].

== Ideology ==
{{quotebox|width=25em|align=right|quote="You are concerned with whether you will prevail in battle: I don't wish you to doubt... when you are fighting God will look down from heaven, and discern which side is just and give that side the victory"|source=''Gravi de pugna'', translated by David A. Lenihan.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=58-59}}}}

''Gravi de pugna'' is best known for its simple assertion that [[God in Christianity|God]] will assure that the morally superior side will win military battles,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and conversely, that victory itself validates that the use of force was appropriate.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}{{efn|This is a form of the [[just-world hypothesis]].}} Udo Heyn claims this was a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] notion,{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}} and Phillip Wynn reports that it had long been believed in pagan antiquity by the time of this letter.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} This understanding was, in fact, utterly rejected by Augustine.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} Kelly DeVries regards the theology of ''Gravi de pugna'' as shallow and considers it to raise problems of [[theodicy]] and legitimacy as soon as the first Christian army loses.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}

Gravi also urges prayer for victory before battle, which was also rejected by Augustine, who found such prayers inappropriate.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}}

== History ==
''Gravi de pugna'' was written in the fifth century.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}
The letter was widely accepted as authentic from its introduction through the medieval era,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and was the most frequently cited text in this period on holy war.{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}} It was invoked to justify numerous wars, including by [[Hincmar of Reims]], [[Rabanus Maurus]], [[Sedulius Scottus]], [[Ivo of Chartres]], and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=29,37,38}} It was also recited at the [[Siege of Lisbon]] in {{CE|1147}}.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}
''Gravi'' imbued the [[Crusaders]] with confidence that God was on their side, squelching all moral concerns and leading to behavior that did not comply with then-accepted [[rules of war]].{{sfn|Chan|2016|p=17}}

The work lost influence with the [[renaissance of the 12th century]], which developed more sophisticated [[jurisprudence]] and moral reasoning,{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=27}} At the same time, Augustine's own opinions, which had been largely unknown, were studied by the [[decretists]] and through them, [[Aquinas]] as well.{{sfn|Lenihan|1996|p=76-77}} The authenticity of ''Gravi de Pugna'' was not conclusively rejected until [[Erasmus]].{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=37-38}}
Although it is regarded by contemporary scholars as "obviously un-Augustinian",{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=59}}
it is now widely recognized that ''Gravi de pugna'' has inaccurately influenced scholars of Augustine's views on war even up through modern times.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=38}}{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}}

'''Joseph L. Graves, Jr.''' (born 1955), is an American Scientist and the Associate Dean for Research and Professor of [[Biology|Biological Studies]] at the Joint School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering which is jointly administered by [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]] and [[UNC Greensboro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncat.edu/~univstud/faculty.html University Studies Faculty, North Carolina A &amp; T State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116043939/http://www.ncat.edu/~univstud/faculty.html |date=2007-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His past research has included an examination of the [[evolution]] of life history and physiological performance in [[Drosophila]], a genus of small flies often called [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]]. His current work includes the genomics of adaptation, as well as the response of bacteria to metallic/metallic oxide nanoparticles.  A particular application of this research has been to the evolutionary theory of aging.&lt;ref name="biopage"&gt;[http://www.minority.unc.edu/institute/2002/spkrbios/drgraves.htm Graves profile] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]'s [http://minority.unc.edu/institute/ Minority Health Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Using his background in evolutionary biology, he has also written two books that address myths and theories of race in American society. Graves has made appearances in six documentary films on these general topics. He has been a Principal Investigator on grants from the [[National Institute of Health]], [[National Science Foundation]] and the Arizona Disease Research Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfmanproductions.com/graves.html Dr. Joseph L. Graves, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206120027/http://www.wolfmanproductions.com/graves.html |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Graves was born in 1955 and received his B.A. in [[biology]] from [[Oberlin College]] in 1977 and his PhD from [[Wayne State University]] in 1988. Before his appointment to North Carolina A &amp; T State University, he held positions at the [[University of California, Irvine]]; at the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West campus of Arizona State University]], with a joint appointment in [[African American Studies]] at the main campus of [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]; and as University Core Director at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]].

Childhood experiences shaped Graves' interest in race and racism: "My parents were poor. They didn’t know how to read. I had to teach myself how to read," he says. "The school system of my home was racially biased. When I was in kindergarten teachers wanted to declare me mentally retarded so that I could be placed in a special education curriculum. The regular curriculum had a [[tracking system]]," Graves continues. "For no apparent reason, all the black kids ended up in the lower track." But, by graduation day, years later, Graves had risen to be among the highest ranked students at his high school. He accepted an academic scholarship to attend Oberlin College and graduated from there with a A.B. in Biology in 1977.  His next two years were spent at the Institute for Tropical Disease at the University of Lowell (today called U. Mass. Lowell.)  And thus, this allowed him to earn a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship to begin his PhD work at the University of Michigan in 1979. He completed his PhD in Evolutionary, Environmental, and Systematic Biology at Wayne State University in 1988.  This work afforded him the prestigious President's Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of California, Irvine from 1988-1990. He joined the faculty at the University of California, Irvine in 1990.

==Career==

===Research===
{{rquote|left|Most Americans still believe that there is some biological legitimacy to our socially constructed racial categories. However, our modern scientific understanding of human genetic diversity flies in the face of all of our social stereotypes.|Joseph L. Graves, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graves |first=Joseph L |url=http://www.heartland.org/pdf/12721n.pdf |title=The Biological Case Against Race |work=American Outlook |date=January 1, 2002 |accessdate=November 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115040049/http://www.heartland.org/pdf/12721n.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Working with Laurence D. Mueller, Graves found that [[population density]] is an important factor in determining both the immediate chances of survival and the course of [[natural selection]] for small organisms such as fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;"Population density effects on longevity" ''Genetica'' Volume 91, Numbers 1-3 / February 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In "Chance, Development, and Aging", ''Human Biology'' December 2001, Graves wrote that the explanation of individual patterns of [[aging]] must take into account subtle mechanisms such as extensive chance variations in cell number and connections, in cell fates during differentiation, and in physiological patterns that arise during development. Graves has studied the tiny insects for more than a decade in pursuit of greater understanding of [[senescence]], the process of aging.

In addition to the study of aging, Graves is interested in the [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]] as it relates to the biology of race and racism in western society. He has received a fair amount of attention from the press for his writings on this topic, especially his strong statements about the socially constructed nature of race. According to his profile on the University of North Carolina Minority Health Project website, he believes: &lt;blockquote&gt;there are still significant academic and popular views of race that are mired in the biological determinism of the 19th century and the application of proper scientific method and philosophy, along with quantitative genetics reveals the underlying racist ideology of these programs.&lt;ref name="biopage"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
In addition to his research interests, Graves has also been an active participant in the struggle to protect and improve the teaching of science in the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minority.unc.edu/institute/2006/spkrbios/JosephGraves.cfm Joseph L.

He advocates discussing human biological variation and race in high school and college science curricula.&lt;ref&gt;"Why We Should Teach Our Students about Race." ''Reports of the National Center for Science Education'', v22 n3 p23-26 May–June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 4 and 114 of the [[Constitution of Latvia]] form the foundation for '''language policy in Latvia''', declaring [[Latvian language|Latvian]] to be the official state language and affirming the rights of ethnic minorities to preserve and develop their languages. [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] and the [[Livonian language]], in addition to Latvian, are considered indigenous and all other languages foreign, including [[Russian language|Russian]] (the [[first language]] for more than one third of the population&lt;ref name="2000 census results"&gt;[http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 2000 census results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321200854/http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 |date=21 March 2008 }} — choose "Results of Population Census Year 2000, in short" and "Iedzīvotāju dzimtā valoda un citu valodu prasme"{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Other significant minority foreign languages include [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Romani language|Romani]].

The preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals "the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Latvia/Latvia_Language_English.htm State Language Law] — Sections 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
The [[official language]] (''valsts valoda'', literally ''state language'') in Latvia is Latvian; this status has been explicitly defined since 1988.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=167|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, amendments to the 1989 Law on Languages strengthened the position of Latvian. All other languages, except the [[Extinct language|extinct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/fu.html|title=Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) languages|website=Helsinki.fi|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livonian language]], are defined as foreign languages in Section 5 of the State Language Law of 1999.

Since 1998, the official status of the Latvian language has been written into the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution]] (Article 4); and since 2002, MPs have been asked to promise to strengthen Latvian as the only official language in order to take their seats (Article 18). In the Constitution's chapter on human rights, rights to get answers from authorities in Latvian are specified since 2002 (Article 104). The current State Language Law was not amended since its adoption in 1999 (as at 2017).

In 1995, Latvia signed, and in 2005 ratified the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]. When ratifying it, the Latvian [[Saeima]] (Parliament) made two declarations (worded as reservations) limiting the implementation of Articles 10 and 11. As at 2008, Latvia did not plan to sign the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], 2008 — see Paragraph 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is implemented by a number of institutions: the State Language Commission (under the [[President of Latvia|President]]) prepares proposals in this field; the [[Latvian State Language Center|State Language Centre]] (under the Ministry of Justice) executes control, imposes fines for administrative violations and translates documents of international significance, the Latvian Language Agency (under the Ministry of Education and Science) provides consultations and opportunities for learning the Latvian language, analyses the language situation.

== Official use of languages ==

Since the State Language Law came into force in 2000, submitting documents to government (local included) and state public enterprises is allowed in Latvian only, except in cases specially defined in the law (emergency services, foreign residents etc.), according to Section 10. From 1992–2000, authorities had to accept documents in Russian, German and English, too, and were allowed to answer in the language of application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=165 1992 Law on Languages] — Sections 8, 9{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the losses of the Latvian government in the cases ''[[Podkolzina v. Latvia]]'' ([[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]]) and ''[[Ignatāne v. Latvia]]'' ([[Human Rights Committee|UN HRC]]), a certain level of command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections&lt;ref&gt;''Жданова Д.'' ООН встала на защиту «Равноправия», «Час» 10.08.01.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from participation.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} - This is exactly what the mentioned ''Iganatane'' and ''Podkolzina'' cases are about - see, e.g., Para 7.4. in ''Ignatane'', Para. 36 in ''Podkolzina'' judgment--&gt; As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saeima.lv/en/legislation/rules-of-procedure|title=Rules of Procedure|website=saeima.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local councilors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=58052&amp;from=off Law on status of member of republican city or municipality council — See Section 4]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.

Names and surnames in Latvian-issued documents are formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases ''Kuhareca v. Latvia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=721719&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR decision in case No. 71557/01]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mencena v.

Latvia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.microlink.lv/pipermail/minelres/2007-July/005184.html|title=MINELRES: Communication to the UN HRC: minority names spelling in Latvia|website=Lists.microlink.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toponyms are formed in Latvian language only (on the [[Livonian coast]] - in Livonian as well), according to Section 18 of the State Language Law.

The Electronic Mass Media Law&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/Electronic_Mass_Media_Law.doc|title=Electronic Mass Media Law|website=Vvc.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; orders to use only Latvian language in the first channels of public radio and television, and basically Latvian language in their second channels (Section 66).

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Latvia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Language policy is an important issue in Latvia: here, demonstrators demand official status for the Russian language.]] --&gt;
The government of Latvia in its policy documents refers to Latvia as a (democratic) [[nation state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.gov.lv/UI/imagebinary.asp?imageid=3124 Guidelines of cultural policy 2006-2015 "Nation state"]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructing societal integration on the basis of the Latvian language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; while respecting the diversity of languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/VVA_angl.pdf Guidelines of the State Language Policy for 2005-2014] — p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity (Latvian political party)|Unity block]], comprising most of the governing coalition as of 2011, also describes Latvia as a nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvk.lv/cgi-bin/wdbcgiw/base/komisijas2010.CVKAND10.progr?NR=5|title=Programma|website=Cvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the nation state, where "language = nation", is seen as the core and main engine of the language policy of the Latvian state.&lt;ref&gt;''Dilāns G.''

One critic, James Hughes, Reader in Comparative Politics at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], has pointed out that Russian-speakers in Latvia constitute one of the largest linguistic minorities in Europe, therefore he considers Latvia's language laws to be denying Russophones their language rights, and thus they are contrary to international practice in the field of minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |title=Discrimination against the Russophone Minority in Estonia and Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=James Hughes |year=2005 |work=Development &amp; Transition |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504025222/http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |archivedate= 4 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nataliya Pulina in ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]'' asserts that Latvia's Russophones are by percentage actually the largest linguistic minority in the [[European Union|EU]] whose language has no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Наталия |last=Пулина |script-title=ru:Татьяна Жданок: "Русские могут влиять на политику Латвии" |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |work=[[Moskovskiye Novosti|Московские новости]] |language=Russian |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326223109/http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |archivedate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the demographic arguments for Russian language rights in Latvia, the [[BBC]]'s Angus Roxburgh reported in 2005:

Among the political parties, [[ForHRUL]] offers in its programme to grant co-official status to Russian, Latgalian and possibly others languages in municipalities where these are native for more than 20% of population.&lt;ref&gt;ForHRUL programme (2006) — see section 7.5.: [http://rusojuz.lv/ru/party/programma/14661-/ Russian], [http://rusojuz.lv/lv/party/Programmas/24543-/ Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; In a draft of its political programme,&lt;ref&gt;HC programme project – section "Cultural and language diversity": [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Russian], [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harmony Centre|HC]] offers to grant co-official status to Latgalian and Russian in printed media, public sphere and education (for Russian, in communication with authorities, as well), stressing its support for the sole state language. Both these parties are in permanent opposition on the state level.

On the other hand, TB/LNNK, a member of governing coalition between 2006 and 2010, is demanding that Latvian be made the sole language of instruction, even in minority schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tb.lv/index.php?id=382|title=Jaunumi|website=Tb.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private use of languages==
The Law on Electronic Media&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"/&gt; prescribes that national and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in Latvian language (section 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/2003-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2003-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).

According to Section 6 of State Language Law, levels of skills in Latvian are defined for various professions, which concern legitimate public interest. Totally, there are six levels and two lists of professions (longer for public sector and shorter for private sector), classified by needed level. For those who didn't get education in Latvian and aren't disabled, an examination is needed to define their skills in Latvian, to work in these professions. Those who fail to show needed level during inspections, can be fined. Labour market shows high demand for skills in Latvian, Russian and English languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/A5_VVA_valodu_prasmes_LV_Q.pdf Valodu prasmes ietekme uz ekonomiski aktīvo iedzīvotāju dzīves kvalitāti], 2006{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 11 of State Language Law, organizers of public events have to provide in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care ''et cetera'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=10124|title=Noteikumi par tulkojumu nodrošināšanu pasākumos|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=DOC&amp;id=102667|title=Noteikumi par valodu lietošanu informācijā|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, according to the Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), organizers of any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=KDOC&amp;id=42090&amp;version_date=13.02.1997|title=Par sapulcēm, gājieniem un piketiem|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of the 1990s, some Polish language schools were created besides the existing schools with Latvian and Russian language of instruction.

As at 2007, there was also increasing number of minority children attending Latvian-language schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by ECRI — see Paragraph 54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Education law,&lt;ref&gt;Education law: [http://www.ttc.lv/index.php?&amp;id=10&amp;tid=59&amp;l=LV&amp;seid=down&amp;itid=13759 edition being in force between 27.02.2004. and 15.09.2005., English] and [http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=50759&amp;menu_body=KDOC current version, Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted in 1998, the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) had to be only Latvian since 2004. This has mostly affected Russian schools, some existing in Latvia without interruption since at least 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Гурин А. Г.'' [http://www.russkije.lv/ru/journalism/read/pervye-russkie-shkoly/ Первые русские школы]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Russian School Defense Staff|wide protests in 2003 and 2004]], the law was amended allowing to teach up to 40% of curricula in minority languages (Transition Rules) and allowing orphans to continue their education not only in Latvian, but also in the language he or she began it (Section 56).

In 2005, one judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/2005-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgment in case No. 2005-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court (upon request of ForHRUL, NHP and LSP MPs) has declared unconstitutional the ban of public co-funding for private minority schools, another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/2004-18-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2004-18-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has declared the proportion "60+:40" constitutional.

According to the same 1998 Education Law, the tertiary education in public colleges and universities has to be in Latvian only since 1999 (it had to be basically in Latvian since the second year, according to 1992 Law on Languages, Section 11). In fact, there still exist programmes with education in English for foreigners ([[Riga Technical University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtuasd.lv/resource/show/3|title=Riga Technical University Department of Foreign Students|website=Rtuasd.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or according to special laws ([[Riga Graduate School of Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=124716&amp;mode=DOC 2005 Latvian-Swedish Treaty on Riga Graduate School of Law] - See Article 7; there is a version in English under one in Latvian&lt;/ref&gt;). There is a demand for tertiary education in Russian, too: it is used, for example, at the [[Baltic International Academy]].

In 2018, President [[Raimonds Vejonis]] promulgated the bill banning use of Russian as the language of instruction also at private universities in Latvia. The Latvian parliament passed the legislation on June 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/education/?doc=141364&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
&lt;!-- {{main|Language legislation in Latvia}}--&gt;
[[File:Обязательство Государственнаго Казначейства Латвии 100 рублей 1919.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A banknote of the Republic of Latvia, 1919]]
[[File:Обязательство Государственнаго Казначейства Латвии 100 рублей 1919 реверс.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A banknote of the Republic of Latvia, 1919]]

In the medieval [[Livonian Confederation]], [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] were the dominant languages of education and administration. German kept this position under subsequent periods of rule by [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and, initially, under the [[Russian Empire]]. German was the language of instruction in the first institution of tertiary education on the territory of Latvia ([[Riga Polytechnicum]], founded in 1862). In [[Latgale]], the Polish language gained some influence, beginning from the 16th century.

From the mid-19th century, Latvian started to rise in influence. At the end of the 19th century, tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] instigated a policy of [[Russification]] in non-Russian areas of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Russia |last= Raisanovsky |first= Nicholas V. |authorlink= Nicholas V. Riasanovsky |year= 1993 |edition= 5th |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York; Oxford |isbn= 0-19-507462-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, language of administration, that of Riga Polytechnicum and most schools was changed from German to Russian, and some German toponyms in eastern Latvia were Russianized (e.g., Dünaburg became Dvinsk). After the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]], possibilities for schooling in Latvian increased.

The pro-[[Bolshevik]] revolutionary [[Soviet (council)|soviet]], [[Iskolat]], declared on 4 January 1918 that Latvian should be the primary language of administration on the territory of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=170|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the short-lived [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1919, Latgalian enjoyed co-equal status with both Latvian and Russian as an official language of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=169|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was initially liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became [[Daugavpils]]), it also allowed Russian and German languages to be used in Parliament along Latvian,&lt;ref&gt;Saeimas kārtības rullis.

Русские в довоенной Латвии — Р.: БРИ, 2000. {{ISBN|9984-606-68-6}} — стр. 281—296 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly hard hit were the Belarusian primary schools, all but 5 of which were closed. Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.&lt;ref&gt;''Latvijas izlūkdienesti 1919-1940: 664 likteņi'', ed.

During World War II, Latvia's German community was mostly moved to Germany, and the Jewish community was destroyed (hit first by the Stalinist deportations in 1941, then by the [[Holocaust]]). Due to that, these groups' respective schools disappeared.

In the postwar [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the proportion of Latvian-speaking population decreased due to large losses in World War II and mass deportation, while the Russian-speaking population increased due to the presence of military forces and mass immigration of labour to implement the Soviet Union's industrialization policy (still, due to low birth rate, the population of Latvia had grown by 27.4% between 1959 and 1989 censuses, while that of the whole USSR — by 36.8%).&lt;ref&gt;''demoscope.ru'' database: population of USSR and its republics (by ethnicity) — [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172652/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php |date=16 March 2010 }}, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172713/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php |date=16 March 2010 }}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the use of Russian increased and it started to dominate in the areas integrated on a federal level (state security, railway etc.). As concerns tertiary education, in some faculties, the language of instruction was only Latvian, in some, only Russian; in some there were two language "streams".&lt;ref&gt;Latvijas PSR augstākās mācību iestādes.

Latvian was declared the state language of the Latvian SSR by a decree of the republican [[Supreme Soviet]] on 6 October 1988. Nevertheless, citizens could still choose to communicate with state authorities in Russian, and all correspondence with the USSR's federal bodies was to be in Russian.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Demographic background ==
&lt;!--{{main|Languages of Latvia}}--&gt;
In the first post-Soviet [[census]] in 2000, 1,311,093 persons in Latvia reported Latvian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing the vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million Latvian speakers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lav|title=Latvian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, [[Livonian language|Livonian]] was a [[moribund language]] spoken by some 35 people, of whom only 10 were fluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nyelvrokonaink |last=Nanovfszky |first=György (ed.) |year=2000 |publisher=Teleki László Alapítvány |location=Budapest |isbn=963-00-3424-7 |language=Hungarian, Russian |oclc=45621804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of the 21st century, it was estimated that Livonian was the native tongue of 4 people in Latvia, all of whom were older than 70.&lt;ref&gt;''Ernšreits V.''

Latvia's current territory is a close approximation to the range of Latvian habitation since the Latvian people emerged. As such, Latvian and Livonian are native only to Latvia.&lt;!-- and have been given special status under Latvian law with the intent to counter the policy of Russification under the Soviet Union--&gt;

Of all districts and cities in Latvia, the highest command of Latvian was in [[Talsi District]] (98.8%), while the lowest was in Daugavpils (41.4%). In Daugavpils was also the highest percentage of people speaking Russian (95.7%), and in [[Kuldīga District]] the lowest (57.6%). There was a similar breakdown with regards to mother tongue: 94.6% in Talsi District and for 11.6% in Daugavpils for Latvian, 80.4% in Daugavpils and for 3.0% in Talsi District for Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=388|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] was not considered a language separate from Latvian in any census, whether during the Soviet period, or since the restoration of independence. Therefore, no specific data on the number of its native speakers were available until the 2011 census. Then, 8.8. % of the population indicated they use Latgalian, described as a variety of Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/home-latvian-spoken-62-latvian-population-majority-vidzeme-and-lubana-county-39158.html|title=At home Latvian is spoken by 62% of Latvian population; the majority – in Vidzeme and Lubāna county - Latvijas statistika|website=Csb.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International recommendations ==
In 1999, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] found Latvia's new language law to be "essentially in conformity with Latvia's international obligations and commitments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/item/4702.html |title=High Commissioner welcomes State Language Law in Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-29 |author=OSCE Press Statement |year=1999 |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he stated that the government regulations were "essentially in conformity with both the Law and Latvia's international obligations", but that "specific matters will have to be reviewed upon Latvia's anticipated ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/media/attachments/30/01/2012/Cilvektiesibas_Latvija_2000_1.pdf Human Rights in Latvia in 2000] [[LCHRES]] — p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The ratification took place in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9641">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Löb's theorem''' states that in any formal system F with [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA), for any formula ''P'', if it is provable in F that "if ''P'' is provable in F then ''P'' is true", then ''P'' is provable in F. More formally, if ''Bew(#P)'' means that the formula ''P'' with [[Gödel number]] #''P'' is provable (from the [[German language|German]] "beweisbar"), then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{if}\ PA \vdash (Bew(\# P) \rightarrow P)\mathrm{, then}\ PA \vdash P,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{ PA \vdash Bew(\# P) \rightarrow P }{ PA \vdash P }.&lt;/math&gt;

An immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if ''P'' is not provable in PA, then "if ''P'' is provable in PA, then ''P'' is true" is not provable in PA. For example, "If &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt; is provable in PA, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt;" is not provable in PA.

Löb's theorem is named for [[Martin Löb|Martin Hugo Löb]], who formulated it in 1955.

==Löb's theorem in provability logic==
[[Provability logic]] abstracts away from the details of encodings used in [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] by expressing the provability of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the given system in the language of [[modal logic]], by means of the modality {{tooltip|&lt;math&gt;\Box \phi&lt;/math&gt;|The box is intended to be a box; it is not your browser failing to display another glyph.}}.

Then we can formalize Löb's theorem by the axiom

:&lt;math&gt;\Box(\Box P\rightarrow P)\rightarrow \Box P,&lt;/math&gt;

known as axiom GL, for Gödel-Löb. This is sometimes formalised by means of an inference rule that infers

:&lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt;

from

:&lt;math&gt;\Box P\rightarrow P.&lt;/math&gt;

The provability logic GL that results from taking the [[modal logic]] ''K4'' (or ''K'', since the axiom schema '''4''', &lt;math&gt;\Box A\rightarrow\Box\Box A&lt;/math&gt;, then becomes redundant) and adding the above axiom GL is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic.

==Modal proof of Löb's theorem==
Löb's theorem can be proved within modal logic using only some basic rules about the provability operator (the K4 system) plus the existence of modal fixed points.

===Modal formulas===
We will assume the following grammar for formulas:
# If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[propositional variable]], then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.
# If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a propositional constant, then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.
# If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, then &lt;math&gt;\Box A&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.
# If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are formulas, then so are &lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;

A modal sentence is a modal formula that contains no propositional variables. We use &lt;math&gt;\vdash A&lt;/math&gt; to mean &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem.

===Modal fixed points===
If &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a modal formula with only one propositional variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then a modal fixed point of &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a sentence &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi \leftrightarrow F(\Box \Psi)&lt;/math&gt;

We will assume the existence of such fixed points for every modal formula with one free variable. This is of course not an obvious thing to assume, but if we interpret &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; as provability in Peano Arithmetic, then the existence of modal fixed points is in fact true.{{Citation needed|reason="This is of course not an obvious thing to assume..."|date=September 2016}}

===Modal rules of inference===
In addition to the existence of modal fixed points, we assume the following rules of inference for the provability operator &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;:

# '''(necessitation)''' From &lt;math&gt;\vdash A&lt;/math&gt; conclude &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box A&lt;/math&gt;: Informally, this says that if A is a theorem, then it is provable.
# '''(internal necessitation)''' &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A&lt;/math&gt;: If A is provable, then it is provable that it is provable.
# '''(box distributivity)''' &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow (\Box A \rightarrow \Box B)&lt;/math&gt;:  This rule allows you to do modus ponens inside the provability operator. If it is provable that A implies B, and A is provable, then B is provable.

===Proof of Löb's theorem===

# Assume that there is a modal sentence &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box P \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Roughly speaking, it is a theorem that if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is provable, then it is, in fact true.&lt;br&gt;This is a claim of ''soundness''.
# From the existence of modal fixed points for every formula (in particular, the formula &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;) it follows there exists a sentence &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi \leftrightarrow (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 2, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi \rightarrow (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From the necessitation rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box(\Psi \rightarrow (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P))&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 4 and the box distributivity rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box\Psi \rightarrow \Box(\Box \Psi \rightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Applying the box distributivity rule with &lt;math&gt; A = \Box \Psi &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B= P&lt;/math&gt; gives us &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box(\Box \Psi \rightarrow P) \rightarrow (\Box\Box\Psi \rightarrow \Box P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 5 and 6, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow (\Box\Box\Psi \rightarrow \Box P)&lt;/math&gt;.
# From the internal necessitation rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow \Box \Box \Psi&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 7 and 8, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow \Box P&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 1 and 9, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 2, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash   (\Box \Psi \rightarrow P) \rightarrow \Psi&lt;/math&gt;. 
# From 10 and 11, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Psi&lt;/math&gt;
# From 12 and the necessitation rule, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Box \Psi&lt;/math&gt;.
# From 13 and 10, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\vdash P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
An immediate corollary of Löb's theorem is that, if ''P'' is not provable in PA, then "if ''P'' is provable in PA, then ''P'' is true" is not provable in PA. Given we know PA is consistent (but PA does not know PA is consistent), here are some simple examples:
* "If &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt; is provable in PA, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt;" is not provable in PA, as &lt;math&gt;1+1=3&lt;/math&gt; is not provable in PA (as it is false).
* "If &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt; is provable in PA, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt;" is provable in PA, as is any statement of the form "If X, then &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt;".
* "If [[Paris–Harrington theorem#The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem|the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem]] is provable in PA, then the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true" is not provable in PA, as "The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true" is not provable in PA (despite being true).

In [[Doxastic logic]], Löb's theorem shows that any system classified as a ''[[Doxastic logic#Types of reasoners|reflexive]]'' "[[Doxastic logic#Increasing levels of rationality|type 4]]" reasoner must also be "''modest''": such a reasoner can never believe "my belief in P would imply that P is true", without first believing that P is true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Smullyan|Smullyan, Raymond M.]], (1986) [http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1029818&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=44077077&amp;CFTOKEN=65318791 ''Logicians who reason about themselves''], Proceedings of the 1986 conference on Theoretical aspects of reasoning about knowledge, Monterey (CA), Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco (CA), pp. 341-352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Converse: Löb's theorem implies the existence of modal fixed points==
Not only does the existence of modal fixed points imply Löb's theorem, but the converse is valid, too.  When Löb's theorem is given as an axiom (schema), the existence of a fixed point (up to provable equivalence) &lt;math&gt;p\leftrightarrow A(p)&lt;/math&gt; for any formula ''A''(''p'')'' modalized in p'' can be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-005-9013-8|date=June 2006|volume=35|issue=3|pages=225–230|title=Note on Some Fixed Point Constructions in Provability Logic|author=Per Lindström|doi=10.1007/s10992-005-9013-8|journal=Journal of Philosophical Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus in [[normal modal logic]], Löb's axiom is equivalent to the conjunction of the axiom schema '''4''', &lt;math&gt;(\Box A\rightarrow \Box\Box A,)&lt;/math&gt; and the existence of modal fixed points.

This poster was issued by various branches of the United States Military to educate and prevent domestic abuse.]]
The '''management of domestic violence''' deals with the treatment of victims of [[domestic violence]] and preventing repetitions of such violence. The response to domestic violence in [[Western countries]] is typically a combined effort between law enforcement, social services and health care. The role of each has evolved as domestic violence has been brought more into public view.

Historically, domestic violence has been viewed as a private family matter that need not involve the government or [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref name="fagan1995"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf |title=Criminalization of Domestic Violence: Promises and Limits|author=Fagan, Jeffrey |conference=Conference on Criminal Justice Research and Evaluation |year=1995 |booktitle=Research Report |publisher=National Institute of Justice|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police officer]]s were often reluctant to intervene by making an [[arrest]], and often chose instead to simply counsel the couple and/or ask one of the parties to leave the residence for a period of time. The courts were reluctant to impose any significant sanctions on those convicted of domestic violence, largely because it was viewed as a [[misdemeanor]] offense.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The modern view in industrialized countries is that domestic violence should be viewed as a public matter and all criminal authority should be involved; that once the violence is reported it should be taken seriously.  Further, supports need to be put in place to restore the victim's safety and respect, which often includes the efforts of the person who did the harm.

Medical professionals can make a difference in the lives of those who experience abuse. Many cases of spousal abuse are handled solely by physicians and do not involve the police. Sometimes cases of domestic violence are brought into the [[emergency room]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Carole Washaw suggests that many doctors prefer not to get involved in people's "private" lives. Jenny Clifton, John Jacobs, Jo Tulloch found that training for general practitioners in the United States about domestic violence was very limited or they had no training. Abbott and Williamson found that knowledge and understanding of domestic violence was very limited among health care professionals in a [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[United Kingdom]] county, and that they do not see themselves as being able to play a major role in helping women in regards to domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Williamson-p83" /&gt; Furthermore, in the biomedical model of health care, injuries are often just treated and diagnosed, without regard for the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Warshaw, C. |year=1993 |chapter=Limitations of the Medical Model in the Care of Battered Women |editors=Bart, P., E.

In the U. S., the Institute of Medicine recognized the shortcomings of the health care system in its 2002 report entitled Confronting Chronic Neglect and attributed some of the problems cited to a lack of adequate training among health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Cohn, F, Salmon, ME, Stobo JD |title=Confronting Chronic Neglect, the Education and Training of Health Professional on Family Violence |year=2002 |publisher=National Academy Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health professionals have an ethical responsibility to recognize and address exposure to abuse in their patients, in the health care setting. For example, the American Medical Association's code of medical ethics states that "Due to the prevalence and medical consequences of family violence, physicians should routinely inquire about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse as part of the medical history. Physicians must also consider abuse in the differential diagnosis for a number of medical complaints, particularly when treating women." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion202.shtml |title=AMA&amp;nbsp;– Opinion 2.02&amp;nbsp;– Abuse of Spouses, Children, Elderly Persons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although acts of domestic violence are criminal and a violation of human rights, safety and dignity, as of 2010 the United Nation has found that it is still often considered a private matter. Some countries with laws against domestic violence may not enforce them and there are many countries that do not [[Criminalization|criminalize]] domestic violence.

==Counseling==

===Counseling for victim===
Due to the extent and prevalence of violence in relationships, counselors and therapists are encouraged to assess every client for domestic violence (both experienced and perpetrated). If the clinician is seeing a couple for couple's counseling, this assessment should be conducted with each individual privately during the initial interview, in order to increase the victim's sense of safety in disclosing any violence in the relationship.&lt;ref name="Lawson 2003 19–33"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawson | first1 = D. M. | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6678.2003.tb00221.x | title = Incidence, Explanations, and Treatment of Partner Violence | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 81 | pages = 19–99 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to determining whether violence is present, counselors and therapists should also make the distinction between situations where battering may have been a single, isolated incident or an ongoing pattern of control. The therapist must, however, consider that violence may be present even when there has been only a single physical incident as emotional/verbal, economic, and sexual abuse may be more insidious.&lt;ref name="Lawson 2003 19–33"/&gt;

Another important issue in assessing clients for domestic violence lies in differing definitions of abuse&amp;nbsp;– the therapist's definition may differ from that of the client, and paying close attention to the way the client describes their experiences is crucial in developing effective treatment plans. The therapist must determine if it is in the best interest of the client to explain that some behaviors (such as emotional abuse) are considered domestic violence, even if the client did not previously consider them as such.

If it becomes apparent to the therapist that domestic violence is taking place in a client's relationship, there are several statements the clinician can make that have been shown to be effective in rapport-building and immediate crisis intervention with clients. Firstly, it is essential that the therapist believe the victim's story and validate their feelings. It is recommended that the therapist acknowledge them for taking a risk in disclosing this information, and assure them that any ambivalent feelings they may be having are normal. The therapist should emphasize that the abuse they have experienced is not their fault, but should keep their feelings of ambivalence in mind and refrain from blaming their partner or telling them what to do. It is unreasonable for the therapist to expect that a victim will leave their perpetrator solely because they disclosed the abuse, and the therapist should respect the victim's autonomy and allow them to make their own decisions regarding termination of the relationship. Finally, the therapist must explore options with the client (such as emergency housing in shelters, police involvement, etc.) in order to uphold their obligation to protect the welfare of the client.&lt;ref name="Lawson 2003 19–33"/&gt;

====Lethality assessment====
A lethality assessment is a tool that can assist in determining the best course of treatment for a client, as well as helping the client to recognize dangerous behaviors and more subtle abuse in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Safety planning====
Safety planning allows the victim to plan for dangerous situations they may encounter, and is effective regardless of their decision on whether remain with their perpetrator. Safety planning usually begins with determining a course of action if another acute incident occurs in the home. The victim should be given strategies for their own safety, such as avoiding confrontations in rooms where there is only one exit and avoiding certain rooms that contain many potential weapons (such as kitchens, bathrooms, etc.).&lt;ref name="azcadv.org"&gt;{{cite web

Gender specific groups (male offenders only or female offenders only) are common in the field.  Groups can be helpful to establish group norms that are contrary to the use of violence that, in turn, create a context where offenders are held accountable to their own values in a respectful manner. Successful completion of groups is generally associated with old age, higher levels of education, lower reported drug use, non-violent criminal histories, and longer intimate relationships.&lt;ref name=Pollard&gt;Pollard, Carrie (2004).

Along with offering group conversations, others incorporate individual and conjoint conversations to assist in ending the violence and repairing the harms. One such approach, which focuses on [[restorative justice]], is highlighted in the critically acclaimed documentary [[A Better Man (film)|A Better Man]]. ''[[Maclean's]]'' reported, “The film manages to be simultaneously agonizing and hopeful… it is revelatory to know these kinds of [restorative] conversations are possible.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/culture/movies/in-attiya-khans-a-better-man-a-different-way-to-understand-domestic-abuse/ MacLean's]&lt;/ref&gt; Film reviewer Miria Bale of [[Vulture.com]] heralds the film is a "Revolutionary documentary."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/why-attiya-khan-confronted-her-longtime-abuser-on-camera.html Vulture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anger management]] alone has not been shown to be effective in treating domestic violence offenders because such an approach seldom addresses the societal influences that are influencing offenders choices to perpetrate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Anger management is recommended as a part of an offender program that is based on accountability, along with topics such as recognizing abusive patterns of behavior and re-framing communication skills.  Interventions require not only stopping the violence but developing a plan to repair harms.&lt;ref name=Bidgood&gt;Bidgood, Bruce Alan (1999).

Within any of the practice settings, occupational therapists may encounter victims of domestic violence including individuals who have not reported abuse. Occupational therapists are in a position to uncover information that leads to suspicion of violence or identification of abuse that has occurred. As health care professionals, occupational therapists follow state mandated requirements to report abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In treatment sessions, they may encounter individuals who have either chosen to remain in or must move on from an intimate relationship where abuse has occurred. Occupational therapists may see patients for complications directly related to abuse, such as physical injuries. On the other hand, occupational therapy services may be requested for unrelated issues but consequences of violence are addressed after the patient reveals abuse to the therapist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The consequences of domestic violence may impact the ability to perform [[Occupational therapy#Areas of occupation|daily occupations]]. Occupational therapy contributes to recovery by enabling victims to create new roles, develop satisfying and productive routines, and gain the self-efficacy necessary to overcome the effects of domestic violence.

OT interventions with children who are exposed to domestic violence are focused on promoting age appropriate academic, play, and social skills to facilitate proper development and success in school activities. This may include activities to improve organization, study habits, or attention. Adolescents who have seen or experienced domestic abuse may also benefit from occupational therapy to work on relationship and life skills and learn coping strategies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Duluth model===

{{See also|Duluth model}}
In 1981, the Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project became the first multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of domestic violence. This experiment, conducted in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], frequently referred to as the "Duluth Project" because it is constantly evolving through the help of an entire community.&lt;ref name="Home of the Duluth Model"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home of the Duluth Model|url=http://www.theduluthmodel.org|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Domestic Abuse Intervention Program has federal, state and local funders who support them. This funding allows DAIP to explore strategies to end violence to communities throughout the United States and around the world.&lt;ref name="Home of the Duluth Model"/&gt;

The objectives of the Duluth approach:&lt;ref name="Home of the Duluth Model"/&gt;
* Remove the blame from the victim and make the offender accountable for the abuse.
* Create criminal and civil justice systems to hold offenders accountable and keep the victims safe.
* Use the experiences and voices from battered women to improve and create policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1268">==Introduction==
The mental model theory of reasoning was developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991). It has been applied to the main domains of deductive inference including relational inferences such as spatial and temporal deductions; propositional inferences, such as conditional, disjunctive and negation deductions; quantified inferences such as syllogisms; and meta-deductive inferences.

Ongoing research on [[mental models and reasoning]] has led the theory to be extended to account for probabilistic inference (e.g., Johnson-Laird, 2006) and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

'''Michael X''' (1933 &amp;ndash; 16 May 1975), born '''Michael de Freitas''' in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], was a self-styled [[Black (people)|black]] [[revolutionary]] and [[civil rights]] [[Activism|activist]] in 1960s [[London]]. He was also known as '''Michael Abdul Malik''' and '''Abdul Malik'''. Convicted of [[murder]] in 1972, Michael X was executed by [[hanging]] in 1975 in [[Port of Spain]]'s Royal Jail.

==Biography==
Michael de Freitas was born in Trinidad to an "[[Obeah]]-practising black woman from Barbados and an absent Portuguese father from [[St Kitts]]".&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/michael-x-a-life-in-black-and-white-by-john-williams-887845.html "Notting Hill to death row"] (review of ''Michael X: A Life In Black And White'', by John Williams), ''[[The Independent]]'', 8 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by his mother to [[Passing (racial identity)|pass for white]], "Red Mike" was a headstrong youth and was expelled from school at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt; In 1957, he immigrated to the [[United Kingdom]], where he settled in London and worked as an enforcer and frontman for the [[slumlord|slum landlord]] [[Peter Rachman]].&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, Nigel, ''Underground: The London Alternative Press, 1966-74'', London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s he had renamed himself "Michael X" and became a well-known exponent of [[Black Power]] in London. Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1965, Colin McGlashan called him the "authentic voice of black bitterness."&lt;ref name=didion&gt;Didion, Joan (12 June 1980) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7366 "Without Regret or Hope."] ''New York Review of Books.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, under the name Abdul Malik, he founded the Racial Adjustment Action Society (RAAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | authorlink= | last = Werbner | first = Pnina  | year = 1991 | title =Black and Ethnic Leaderships in Britain: The Cultural Dimensions of Political Action | publisher = Routledge | publication-place = London | page = 29. | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he was involved with the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]/hippie organisation the [[London Free School]] (LFS) through his contact with [[John Hopkins (political activist)|John "Hoppy" Hopkins]], which both helped widen the reach of the group, at least in the [[Notting Hill]] area, and create problems with local police who disliked his involvement. Michael and the LFS were instrumental in organising the first outdoor [[Notting Hill Carnival]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Miles|Miles, Barry]] (2010), ''London Calling: A Countercultural History of London Since 1945'', pp. 187–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, he became the first non-white person to be charged and imprisoned under the UK's [[Race Relations Act 1965|Race Relations Act]], which was designed to protect Britain's Black and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations from [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;Eds. (10 November 1967), "Black Muslim Gets One Year in Britain." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 12 months in jail for advocating the immediate killing of any white man seen "laying hands" on a black woman.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. (30 September 1967), "Michael X On Trial For Race Hate Charges", ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said "white men have no soul".&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, Katharine, ''Speaking Back: the free speech versus hate speech debate'', John Benjamins, 2002, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he became the self-appointed leader of a [[Black Power]] [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] on [[Holloway Road]], [[North London]], called the "Black House". The commune was financed by a young millionaire benefactor, [[Nigel Samuel]].  Michael X said, "They've made me the archbishop of violence in this country. But that 'get a gun' rhetoric is over. We're talking of really building things in the community needed by people in the community. We're keeping a sane approach."&lt;ref&gt;Eds. (29 January 1970) "London Getting a Black Cultural Leader." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] donated a bag of their hair to be auctioned for the benefit of the Black House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Cavett, Dick | date=11 September 1971 | title=The Dick Cavett Show | medium=Television | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kXCnKfdGOY&amp;t=442 | accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what the media called "the slave collar affair", businessman Marvin Brown was enticed to The Black House, viciously attacked, and made to wear a spiked "slave" collar around his neck as Michael X and others threatened him in order to [[extortion|extort]] money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk |title=Man In Michael X Centre led in 'slave collar'. |publisher=''The Times'' |date=23 June 1970 |accessdate=13 November 2008 | location=London | first=Philippe | last=Naughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Black House closed in the autumn of 1970. The two men found guilty of assaulting Marvin Brown were imprisoned for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk |title=Two found guilty in Black Power case. |work=[[The Times]] |date=14 July 1971 |accessdate=13 November 2008 | location=London | first=Philippe | last=Naughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black House burned down in mysterious circumstances, and soon Michael X and four colleagues were arrested for extortion. His bail was paid by John Lennon in January 1971.&lt;ref name=harry&gt;[[Bill Harry|Harry, Bill]], ''The John Lennon Encyclopedia'', Virgin Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1971, he fled to his native Trinidad, where he started an agricultural commune devoted to [[black power|Black empowerment]] {{Convert|16|mi|km}} east of the capital, [[Port of Spain]].  "The only politics I ever understand is the politics of revolution," he told the ''[[Trinidad Express]]''.  "The politics of change, the politics of a completely new system."&lt;ref name=didion /&gt;  He began another commune, also called the Black House, which, in February 1972, also burned down.

===Murder trial===
Police who had come to the commune to investigate the fire discovered the bodies of Joseph Skerritt and [[Gale Benson]], members of the commune. They had been hacked to death and separately buried in shallow graves. Benson, who had been going under the name Hale Kimga, was the daughter of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Leonard F. Plugge]]. She had met Michael X through her relationship with [[Malcolm X]]'s cousin [[Hakim Jamal]].

Michael X fled to [[Guyana]] a few days later and was captured there. He was charged with the murder of Skerritt and Benson, but was never tried for the latter crime.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;UPS (17 May 1975) "Militant is Hanged in Trinidad After Long Fight for Clemency." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; A witness at his trial claimed that Skerritt was a member of Malik's "[[Black Liberation Army]]" and had been killed by him because he refused to obey orders to attack a local police station. Malik was found guilty and sentenced to death.   The Save Malik Committee, whose members included [[Angela Davis]], [[Dick Gregory]], [[Kate Millet]] and others, including the well known "radical lawyer" [[William Kunstler]], who was paid by [[John Lennon]],&lt;ref name=harry/&gt; pleaded for clemency, but Malik was hanged in 1975.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Other members of the group were tried for Benson's murder.  It was asserted that Benson had been shown an open grave and was then pushed in it and hacked at by Michael X with a [[machete]] on her neck.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (22 August 1972), "Michael X Doomed in Trinidad Murder." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Under the name Michael Abdul Malik, Michael X was the author of ''From Michael Freitas to Michael X'' ([[André Deutsch]], 1968). It was ghost written by [[John Stevenson (writer)|John Stevenson]]. Michael X also left behind fragments of a novel about a romantic black hero who wins the abject admiration of the narrator, a young English woman named Lena Boyd-Richardson. Inspecting the hero's bookshelf, Lena Boyd-Richardson is impressed at finding ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'': "I discover that he not only have (sic) the books but actually reads and understands them I was absolutely bowld (sic), litterally. I took a seat, and gazed upon this marvel, Mike."&lt;ref name=didion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barfoot, C. C., and Theo d' Haen, ''Shades of Empire in Colonial and Post-colonial Literatures: In Colonial and Post-colonial Literatures'', Rodopi, 1993, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Michael X is the subject of the essay "Michael X and the Black Power Killings in Trinidad" by [[V. S. Naipaul]], collected in ''The Return of Eva Perón and the Killings in Trinidad'' (1980), and is also believed to be the model for the fictional character Jimmy Ahmed in Naipaul's 1975 [[novel]] ''[[Guerillas (book)|Guerrillas]]''.

Michael X is a character in ''[[The Bank Job]]'' (2008), a dramatisation of [[Baker Street robbery|a real-life bank robbery]] in 1971. The film claims that Michael X was in possession of indecent photographs of [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] and used them to avoid criminal prosecution by threatening to publish them. He was played by [[Peter de Jersey]].

Michael X and his trial are the subject of a chapter in [[Geoffrey Robertson]]'s legal memoir ''The Justice Game'' (1998).

Michael X plays a part in ''Make Believe: A True Story'' (1993), a memoir by [[Diana Athill]].

''Michael X'' is the eponymous title of a play, by the writer [[Vanessa Walters]], that takes the form of a 1960s Black Power rally and was performed at [http://www.carnivalvillage.org.uk/ The Tabernacle Theatre], [[Powis Square, London|Powis Square]], London W11 (Notting Hill), in November 2008.

Michael X (played by [[Adrian Lester]]) is portrayed in a scene opposite [[Jimi Hendrix]] in the film ''[[All Is By My Side]]'' based on Jimi's early years in the music industry.

Muhammad Ali gave his bloody boxing shorts that he wore when he fought Henry Cooper to Michael Abdul Malik, and is referred to as a black militant from Trinidad in "The Greatest - My Own Story" by [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Richard Durham]]

'''NIMBY''' (an [[acronym]] for the phrase "'''Not In My Back&lt;!-- Do Not Remove This Space.--&gt;  &lt;!--It is correct, and otherwise would be NIMB, which would clearly be wrong--&gt;Yard'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/nimby |title= Cambridge Dictionaries Online - meaning of NIMBY |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Nimby |title= Oxford Dictionaries - definition of Nimby |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''Nimby''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/nimby |publisher= Macmillan Dictionary |title= Definition of Nimby |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a characterization of opposition by residents to a proposed development in their local area. It often carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them, and that they would tolerate or support it if it was built further away. The residents are often called '''Nimbys''', and their viewpoint is called '''Nimbyism'''.

Examples of projects likely to be opposed include any sort of [[housing development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/london-mayor-election/mayor-of-london/10984944/Boris-Johnson-Nimbies-pretend-to-care-about-architecture-to-block-developments.html |title= Boris Johnson: Nimbies pretend to care about architecture to block developments |author=Matthew Holehouse |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cycling infrastructure|bicycle]] and [[Pedestrian crossing|pedestrian]] [[Sidewalk|infrastructure]], [[skyscraper]]s, [[homeless shelters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://digitalissue.ocweekly.com/article/News/1800742/223650/article.html |title= Anywhere but here |date= 28 August 2015 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |author= Andrew Galvin |newspaper= OC Weekly |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160130210045/http://digitalissue.ocweekly.com/article/News/1800742/223650/article.html |archive-date= 30 January 2016 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[oil well]]s, [[chemical plant]]s, [[industrial park]]s, [[military base]]s, [[fracking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/04/fracking-resistance-southern-nimbys-minister |title= Fracking will meet resistance from southern nimbys, minister warns |author= Patrick Wintour |date= 4 August 2013 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wind turbines]], [[desalination plant]]s, [[Landfill|landfill sites]], [[Incineration|incinerators]], [[power plant]]s, [[Quarry|quarries]], [[prison]]s,&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web |url= http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nimby |title= Dictionary and Thesaurus - Merriam-Webster |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pub]]s, [[Strip club|adult entertainment clubs]], [[Music venue|concert venues]], [[Gun shop|firearms dealers]], [[Cell site|mobile phone masts]], [[Transmission Tower |electricity pylons]], [[abortion clinic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/24/what-north-dakota-and-mississippi-reveal-about-anti-choice-nimbyism-and-hypocrisy/ |title=What North Dakota and Mississippi Reveal About Anti-Choice NIMBYism and Hypocrisy |first=Amanda |last=Marcotte |work=RH Reality Check |date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orphanage|children's homes]], [[Nursing home care|nursing homes]], [[youth hostel]]s, [[Stadium|sports stadiums]], [[shopping mall]]s, [[retail park]]s, [[Rail transport|railways]], [[road]]s, [[airport]]s, [[Port|seaports]], [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste repositories]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/business/businessspecial3/07nuke.html?_r=0 |title= Radioactive Nimby: No one wants nuclear waste |author= James Kanter |date=7 November 2007 |newspaper= The New York Times |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weapons of mass destruction|storage for weapons of mass destruction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13176440.Trident_removal_is_a_Nimby_position/ |title= Trident removal is a Nimby position |date=24 August 2014 |accessdate= 23 January 2016 |newspaper= The Herald |author=Mick Common |location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannabis dispensaries in the United States|cannabis dispensaries]], [[Cannabis shop|recreational cannabis shops]] and the accommodation of persons applying for asylum, refugees (e.g. of war) and displaced persons (e.g. Jews during/after [[the Holocaust]]).

The NIMBY concept may also be applied to people who advocate some proposal (e.g., budget cuts, tax increases, layoffs, immigration or energy conservation) but oppose implementing it in a way that might affect their lives or require any sacrifice on their part.

==Claimed rationale==
Developments likely to attract local objections include:

* Infrastructure development, such as new roads and [[motorway service areas]], [[light rail]] and [[rapid transit|metro]] lines, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, airports, [[power plant]]s, retail developments, sales of public assets, [[Electric power transmission|electrical transmission lines]], [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]], [[landfill]]s, [[sewage treatment|sewage outfalls]] and [[prison]]s;
* The extraction of mineral resources including ore, aggregates and hydrocarbons from [[mining|mines]], [[quarries]] and [[oil well]]s or [[gas well]]s, respectively;
* [[renewable energy]] generators, such as [[wind farm]]s and [[solar panel]]s;
* businesses trading in goods perceived as [[immoral]], such as [[pornographic film|adult video]], [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] [[liquor store|stores]], and [[medical cannabis|medical]] [[marijuana|cannabis]] [[dispensaries]];
* accommodations perceived as primarily benefitting disadvantaged people, such as [[subsidized housing]] for the [[poverty|financially disadvantaged]], [[supportive housing]] for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]], [[halfway house]]s for drug addicts and [[criminal]]s, and [[homeless shelter]]s for those with [[homeless|no fixed address]];
* services catering to certain stigmatised groups (for example, [[addiction|injection drug users]]), such as [[methadone clinic]]s, [[syringe exchange programme]]s, [[drug detoxification]] facilities, [[supervised injection site]]; 
* large-scale developments of all kinds, such as [[big-box store]]s and housing [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]s.

The claimed reasons against these developments vary, and some are given below.

* ''Increased traffic:''  More jobs, more housing or more stores correlates to increased traffic on local streets and greater demand for parking spots. Industrial facilities such as warehouses, factories, or [[landfill]]s often increase the volume of truck traffic.
* ''Harm to locally owned [[small business]]es:''  The development of a big box store may provide too much competition to a locally owned store; similarly, the construction of a new road may make the older road less travelled, leading to a loss of business for property owners. This can lead to excessive relocation costs, or to loss of respected local businesses.
* ''Loss of residential property value:''  Homes near an undesirable development may be less desirable for potential buyers. The lost revenue from property taxes may, or may not, be offset by increased revenue from the project.
* ''[[Environmental pollution]] of land, air, and water:''  Power plants, factories, chemical facilities, [[crematorium]]s, [[sewage treatment facilities]], airports, and similar projects may, or may be claimed to, contaminate the land, air, or water around them. Especially facilities assumed to smell might cause objections.
* ''[[Light pollution]]:''  Projects that operate at night, or that include security lighting (such as street lights in a parking lot), may be accused of causing light pollution.
* ''[[Noise pollution]]:''  In addition to the noise of traffic, a project may inherently be noisy. This is a common objection to [[Windmill syndrome|wind power]], [[Mitigation of aviation's environmental impact#Methods of mitigating aviation's noise emissions|airports]], roads, and many industrial facilities, but also stadiums, [[music festival|festivals]], and [[nightclub]]s which are particularly noisy at night when locals want to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518102034/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |archivedate=18 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Visual blight and failure to "blend in" with the surrounding architecture:''  The proposed project might be ugly or particularly large, or cast a [[shadow]] over an area due to its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2014/2/20/10141252/hundreds-fret-about-superscrapers-shadows-as-extell-rebuts|title=Hundreds Fret About Superscrapers' Shadows As Extell Rebuts|first=|last=Curbed|date=20 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Loss of a community's [[new urbanism|small-town feel]]:'' Proposals that might result in new people moving into the community, such as a plan to build many new houses, are often claimed to change the community's character.
* ''Strain of public resources and schools:''  This reason is given for any increase in the local area's population, as additional school facilities might be needed for the additional children, but particularly to projects that might result in certain kinds of people joining the community, such as a [[group home]] for people with disabilities, or immigrants.
* ''Disproportionate benefit to non-locals:'' The project appears to benefit distant people, such as investors (in the case of commercial projects like factories or big-box stores) or people from neighboring areas (in the case of regional government projects, such as airports, highways, sewage treatment, or landfills).
* ''Increases in crime:'' This is usually applied to projects that are perceived as attracting or employing low-skill workers or racial minorities, as well as projects that cater to people who are thought to often commit crimes, such as the mentally ill, the poor, and drug addicts. Additionally, certain types of projects, such as [[Bar (establishment)|pubs]] or [[medical marijuana]] dispensaries, might be perceived as directly increasing the amount of crime in the area.
*''Risk of an (environmental) disaster'', such as with drilling operations, chemical industry, [[dams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esydBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=dam&amp;f=false|title=Nimby Is Beautiful: Cases of Local Activism and Environmental Innovation Around the World|first1=Carol|last1=Hager|first2=Mary Alice|last2=Haddad|date=30 March 2015|publisher=Berghahn Books|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; or nuclear power plants.
* ''Historic areas:'' The affected area is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], because of its many older properties that are being preserved as such.

Generally, many NIMBY objections are guessed or feared, because objections are more likely to be successful before the construction start. It is often too late to object to the project after its completion, since new additions are unlikely to be reversed.
As hinted by the list, protests can occur for opposite reasons. A new road or shopping center can cause increased traffic and work opportunities for some, and decreased traffic for others, harming local businesses.

People in an area affected by plans sometimes form an organization which can collect money and organize the objection activities. NIMBYists can hire a lawyer to do formal [[appeal]]s, and contact media to gain public support for their case.

==Origin and history==

The word appears in a June 1980 newspaper article from [[Virginia]], with the origin of the phrase explanained thus: {{quote|Some call it the Nimby Syndrome.  That's Nimby, as in "Not-in-my-back-yard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Daily Press |location=Newport News, VA |date=1980-06-29 |issue=181 |volume=85 |page=1 |title=No One Wants Backyard Nuclear Dump |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24587650/nimby_1980/ |first=Ernie |last=Gates  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The phrase '"not in my back yard" syndrome', without the acronym, is found from February of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=The 'not in my back yard' syndrome is a compound of fears about health, safety, and environmental quality |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/enviroviews2n6/page/4 |title=Hazardous Wastes |first=Gillian |last=Sniatynski |work=Environment Views |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=February-March 1980  |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' earliest citation is a ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' article from November 1980, although even there the author indicates the term is already used in the hazardous waste industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/nimby.asp|title=NIMBY - Word Spy|first=Word|last=Spy|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/1106/110653.html|title=Hazardous waste|first=Emilie Travel|last=Livezey|date=6 November 1980|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept behind the term, that of locally organized resistance to unwanted land uses, is likely to have originated earlier. One suggestion is it emerged in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorino, Al. (22 March 2011)  [http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5384/do-you-have-control-over-nimbyism/ "Do You Have Control Over NIMBYism?"] ''Biomass Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the term was popularized by British politician [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], who was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for the Environment]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Comedian [[George Carlin]] used the term in a comedy skit, implying that people had already heard of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43Egm0j_p1A |title=George Carlin on N.I.M.B.Y. |publisher=''YouTube'' |format=video |accessdate=25 April 2012 |quote=We &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sic}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; got somethin' in this country (you've heard of it) -- it's called NIMBY -- n-i-m-b-y -- Not In My BackYard!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIMBY acronym has also been used by social scientists since the early 1980s to describe the resistance of communities to the siting of controversial facilities and land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last= Borell |first= Klas |last2= Westermark |first2= Åsa |date= 31 October 2016 |title= Siting of human services facilities and the not in my back yard phenomenon: a critical research review |journal= Community Development Journal |doi= 10.1093/cdj/bsw039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
''NIMBY'' and its derivative terms ''NIMBYism'', ''NIMBYs'', and ''NIMBYists'', refer implicitly to debates of development generally or to a specific case. As such, their use is inherently contentious. The term is usually applied to opponents of a development, implying that they have narrow, selfish, or myopic views. Its use is often [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1968870.ece You can’t park here: it’s my retreat, says ‘Nimby’ Clooney] (''[[The Times]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not in My Neighborhood===
The term ''Not in My Neighborhood'' (or ''NIMN'') is also frequently used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Hull

Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=1566638437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIABY===
Opposition to certain developments as inappropriate anywhere in the world is characterised by the acronym ''NIABY'' ("Not In Anyone's Backyard"). The building of [[nuclear power plant]]s, for example, is often subject to NIABY concerns.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"&gt;[http://www.translationconference.com/2008_eload/droth_julia_en.pdf translationconference.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAMBI===
''NAMBI'' ("Not Against My Business or Industry") is used as a label for any business concern that expresses umbrage with actions or policy that threaten that business, whereby they are believed to be complaining about the principle of the action or policy only for their interests alone and not for all similar business concerns who would equally suffer from the actions or policies.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"/&gt; The term serves as a criticism of the kind of outrage that business expresses when disingenuously portraying its protest to be for the benefit of all other businesses. Such a labelling would occur, for example, when opposition expressed by a business involved in urban development is challenged by activists&amp;nbsp;– causing the business to in turn protest and appealing for support from fellow businesses lest they also find themselves challenged where they seek urban development. This term also serves as a rhetorical counter to NIMBY. Seen as an equivalent to NIMBY by those opposing the business or industry in question.

===BANANA===
''BANANA'' is an acronym for "Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything" (or "Anyone").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/23/opinion/l-absolute-banana-756593.html|title=Absolute Banana|date=23 December 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/152|title=From NIMBYs To DUDEs: The Wacky World Of Plannerese|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used to criticize the ongoing opposition of certain [[advocacy groups]] to [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/banana.asp BANANA] at Wordspy&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent opposition of some [[activist]]s to every instance of proposed development suggests that they seek a complete absence of new growth. The term is commonly used within the context of [[Land use planning|planning]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Sunderland City Council]] lists the term in their online dictionary of jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|title=Sunderland City Council|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508043826/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|archivedate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIBBY===
''PIBBY'' is an acronym for "Place In Blacks' Back Yard." This principle indicates that the people with social, racial, and economic privileges object to a development in their own back yards, and if the objectionable item must be built, then it should be built so that its perceived harms disproportionately affect poor, socially disadvantaged people. Economically disadvantaged people might not want to hire a lawyer to appeal the right way, or might have more immediate troubles than a new nearby construction project. The [[environmental justice]] movement has pointed out Nimbyism leads to [[environmental racism]]. [[Robert D. Bullard]], Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, has argued that official responses to NIMBY phenomena have led to the PIBBY principle.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James B.

===SOBBY===
''SOBBY'' is an acronym for  "Some Other Bugger's Back Yard" and refers to the state of mind which agrees that a particular project may be desirable and perhaps necessary – but only if it is placed somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walter|first1=Liz|title=Move over Yuppies - the Magpies have arrived|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/2014/03/05/move-over-yuppies-the-magpies-have-arrived/|website=dictionaryblog.cambridge.org|publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of debate==
Although often used rather pejoratively, the use of the concept NIMBY and similar terms have been critiqued. For instance, the term is frequently used to dismiss groups as selfish or ill-informed, yet these same groups may have virtues that are overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcclymont|first=Katie|last2=O'hare|first2=Paul|date=1 June 2008|title="We're not NIMBYs!" Contrasting local protest groups with idealised conceptions of sustainable communities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549830701803273|journal=Local Environment|volume=13|issue=4|pages=321–335|doi=10.1080/13549830701803273|issn=1354-9839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of development ===
Frequently argued debate points in favor of development include higher employment, tax revenue, marginal cost of remote development, safety, and environmental benefits. Proponents of development may accuse locals of [[egotism]], [[elitism]], parochialism, [[drawbridge mentality]], [[racism]] and anti-[[Multiculturalism|diversity]], the inevitability of criticism, and misguided or unrealistic claims of prevention of [[urban sprawl]]. If people who don't want to be disturbed see the general need of an establishment, such as an airport, they generally suggest another location. But seen from society's perspective, the other location might not be better, since people living there get disturbed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdner, A. &amp; Borell, K. 2003. Neighbourhood Reactions toward Facilities for Residential Care: A Swedish Survey Study. ''Journal of Community Practice'' 11(4):59-81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of local sovereignty ===
Those labeled as NIMBYs may have a variety of motivations and may be unified only because they oppose a particular project. For example, some may oppose any significant change or development, regardless of type, purpose, or origin. Others, if the project is seen as being imposed by outsiders, may hold strong principles of [[self-governance]], local [[sovereignty]], local autonomy, and [[Municipal home rule|home rule]]. These people believe that local people should have the final choice, and that any project affecting the local people should clearly benefit themselves, rather than corporations with distant investors or central governments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Impact of Corporations on the Commons'', Address by Mary Zepernick at the Harvard Divinity School's Theological Opportunities Program, 21 October 2004, [http://www.poclad.org/?pg=Articles&amp;show=a041021.txt poclad.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Still others may object to a particular project because of its nature, e.g., opposing a nuclear power plant over fear of radiation, but accepting a local [[waste management]] facility as a municipal necessity.

==Examples==

===Canada===

====Nova Scotia====
In July 2012, residents of Kings County rallied against a bylaw, developed over three years of consultation and hearings, allowing wind generators to be constructed nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delaney |first=Gordon |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/114564-which-way-does-the-wind-blow |title=Which way does the wind blow? |work=The Chronicle Herald |date=7 July 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar theme arose in September 2009, where residents there rallied against a wind generator in Digby Neck, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contrarian.ca/2009/09/09/nimby-neck/ |title=NIMBY Neck – updated : Contrarian |publisher=Contrarian.ca |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, residents of Lawrencetown, NS openly opposed a cell tower being built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/01/25/ns-lawrencetown-tower-petition.html |title=Cell tower opposed in Lawrencetown |publisher=CBC News |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed development of downtown Dartmouth in August 2012 was also contested by residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Croucher |first=Philip |url=http://metronews.ca/news/halifax/352477/public-hearing-thursday-for-planned-downtown-dartmouth-development/ |title=Public hearing Thursday for planned downtown Dartmouth development &amp;#124; Metro |publisher=Metronews.ca |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, some residents of Lunenburg County opposed wind farms being built in the area, saying, "It's health and it's property devaluation" and "This is an industrial facility put in the middle of rural Nova Scotia. It does not belong there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/03/05/ns-south-canoe-wind-project.html |title=Lunenburg County debates province's largest wind farm |publisher=CBC News |date=5 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, some residents of the community of Blockhouse opposed the building and development of a recycling plant, referred to by one business owner as a "dump."

In China there were many famous cases of nail houses, including one property holdout who had expressways built around and completely encircled his apartment building in Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Varinsky | first=Dana | title=The owners of these defiant 'nail houses' in China refuse to give in to developers | website=Business Insider | date=2016-08-20 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-chinese-nail-houses-2016-8 | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=China's 'nail houses': The homeowners who refused to budge | website=CNN | date=2015-05-19 | url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/asia/gallery/china-nail-houses/index.html | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
When Christian Zheng Sheng College, a correctional school for young drug addicts, opened in 1998, several people called it an eyesore. In June 2009, residents of Mui Wo voiced objection when they announced they are planning to move their campus into an empty school building there.

===Italy===
The [[No TAV]] opposition to the [[Turin–Lyon high-speed railway]] is often characterized as a NIMBY movement.

===Japan===
The Muraiken Undō or [[No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement]], was a government funded Japanese public health and social movement which began between 1929 and 1934.

In 2001, when the leprosy prevention law was ruled unconstitutional, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Welfare, and the National Diet published statements of apology to leprosy patients and their families. Several prefectural governors made apologies at public sanatoriums.

Two famous incidents where NIMBY's ruled over Greater Tokyo interests. [[Shinkansen]] have been extensively engineered to mitigate impacts of [[tunnel boom]] due to complaints by nearby residents, such that Japan is the only country with such strict regulations (and accompanying financial burdens) on tunnel and aerodynamic designs.  This is one of the key reasons there are so many Shinkansen trainset designs that have been developed.

==== Narita Airport ====
One is the farmers of [[Narita International Airport]], the metropolis' only international link to the outside world, who resisted since 1974 any tiny bit of land allocation.  Originally the plan for the airport also includes a [[Narita Shinkansen|high speed railway]] line that was scrapped.  The NIMBYs additionally prevented extension of the congested airport's very short 2nd runway (unusable for anything but short haul [[Narrow-body aircraft]]) until the late 2000s, when finally cross town [[Haneda Airport]] was opened to international traffic as additional runways on landfill were completed at many billions of dollars of extra costs, as the 2nd runway was lengthened to 2,500 meters.  The 2nd Narita runway still runs short of its original 1974 blueprints and impacts airport operational capacity.

==== Odakyu Double Tracking ====
[[Odakyu Electric Railway]], now providing transit along a corridor with 5 million people living in walking distance of its rail and feeder bus service area&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;, was originally built prewar era, and as the city of Tokyo's population ballooned rail demand in suburbs exploded.  By 1960s, [[Pusher (railway station attendant)|''oshiya'' pushers]] were required to squash people into packed trains, and Odakyu Railway sought to expand its two-track lines to four&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"&gt;https://japantoday.com/category/features/kuchikomi/How-do-railways-figure-out-congestion-on-their-trains-&lt;/ref&gt;, thus allowing more passing trains and faster run times as well as less crowding and congestive wait and hold of trains.  NIMBY residents aside the line in [[Setagaya]] ward fought off attempts by the railway to acquire land, Odakyu did not want to make a scene so they attempted to buy land one by one by offering high prices.  The Setagaya Residents' opposition set the stage for a long-term and remarkable NIMBY cases in the courts and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;https://science-train.com/w/Odakyu_Electric_Railway/History.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1993, after 3 decades of trying, it was apparent this plan was failing, and the company decided to go for an multi-billion dollar solution: tunneling two lines underground, and then adding back two new lines stacked on top, to make 4 tracks in each direction for 12 stations and 10.4 km, instead of acquiring the land.&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;  The company's decision began in 1993 and completed in 2004 for 1 critical section, meanwhile, for the 2nd smaller section, this same decision was made in 2003 with project completion finally approaching fruition in March 2018, nearly 6 decades later.&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="odakyu"&gt;http://www.odakyu.jp/ir/shared/pdf/annual/2015/fukufuku.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ashtead, Surrey====
In the affluent [[England|English]] village of [[Ashtead]], [[Surrey]], which lies on the outskirts of [[London]], residents objected in 2007&lt;ref name="ylg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/epsomnews/display.var.1558300.0.0.php|title=No heroes in my backyard|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the conversion of a large, [[Pound sterling|£]]1.7&amp;nbsp;million residential property into a family support centre for relatives of wounded British service personnel.

====High Speed 2====
Particularly in the run up to the final decision on the route of the high-speed railway known as [[High Speed 2]], BBC News Online reported that many residents of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies were launching objections to the HS2 route based on the effects it would have on them, whilst also showing concerns that HS2 is unlikely to have a societal benefit at a macro level under the current economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12037578|title=The farm lying in the path of the new rail route|date=20 December 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12002171|title=Tory vs Tory on high speed rail|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Labour MP [[Natascha Engel]]—through whose constituency the line will pass—offered a "passionate defence of nimbyism" in the House of Commons, with regards to the effects the line would have on home- and business-owning constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/chan24.pdf|date=26 June 2013|speaker=[[Natascha Engel]]|house=House of Commons|column_start=378|column_end=380|volume=565|no=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; HS2 has also been characterised by residents of the [[Chilterns]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] making arguments against the supposed lack of a business case for the line, often as a smokescreen for NIMBYism. On 17 March 2014, it was announced that Camden's NIMBYs were successful in their campaign to derail the HS1–HS2 link railway.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26604074&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heathrow Airport====
In November 2007 a consultation process began for the building of a new third runway and a sixth terminal and it was controversially&lt;ref name="Ref_2009"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/01/15/heathrow.third.runway/index.html | work=CNN | title=Britain: Third Heathrow runway approved despite opposition - CNN.com | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved on 15 January 2009 by UK Government ministers.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7829676.stm|title=BBC News - Go-ahead for new Heathrow runway|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was then cancelled on 12 May 2010 by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron Government]].&lt;ref name=Cancelled&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8678282.stm|title=BBC News - Heathrow runway plans scrapped by new government|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport is owned by CAFCO (Coventry) Limited, a joint venture between Howard Holdings plc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardholdings.com|title=Howardholdings.com|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Convergence-AFCO Holdings Limited (CAFCOHL), and in June 2007 had its application to build permanent terminal and passenger facilities turned down by the UK government due to public pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copybook.com/airport/news/shock-rejection-hits-plan-for-coventry-airport-terminal|title=Shock Rejection Hits Plan for Coventry Airport Terminal|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/grounded-another-victory-in-battle-to-curb-airport-growth-456650.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Herbert | title=Grounded: Another victory in battle to curb airport growth | date=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/WDC/Your-Council/News/Warwick+District+Council+Archived+News/News+-+2008/Coventry+Airport.htm Warwickdc.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181429/http://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/WDC/Your-Council/News/Warwick+District+Council+Archived+News/News+-+2008/Coventry+Airport.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/tm_objectid=16571762&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50002&amp;headline=brum-airport-s-opposition-is--naked-commercialism--name_page.html|title=Birmingham Post politics news plus reports council and Government issues affecting Birmingham, the Black Country and the West Midlands|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:suGb6LcN8gwJ:www.aqconsultants.co.uk/AQC-CMS/media/PDF-Documents/Capability-Statement.Airports.pdf+3rd+runway+at+coventry+airport&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShltQpXsU8ET_abP8jJYMebaxew1BLV4mY5TVPrj1B0ymmwhrTDIo9tE_eYcnpiE3aBP1HiBo4TbpTFkiivscukBgxuF476Tjsjv4zJ_YMDT9dujQIl8lIVm0OT9yBX9P8sg7_E&amp;sig=AHIEtbQgH2dFnu1eDY4UVX5eUPVyT550uQ Docs.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=132195|title=Breaking News - Coventry Airport Goes Bust And Shuts - House prices and the economy|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wimbledon, London====

The [[London Borough of Merton]] did not have enough school places for local children who would be reaching school age in 2012 and 2013. Almost all local schools had expanded, but the NIMBY group "Save Our Rec" opposed the expansion of Dundonald school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307070255/http://www.merton.gov.uk/council/getinvolved/consultation/dundonald_public_consultation_leaflet.pdf|title=Dundonald Primary School and Dundonald Park.

===United States===
Research shows that NIMBYism is bipartisan in the United States, with both conservatives and liberals opposing new housing developments in their localities. White neighborhoods and cities tend to favor more restrictive housing development policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/upshot/home-ownership-nimby-bipartisan.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&amp;smtyp=cur|title=The Bipartisan Cry of ‘Not in My Backyard’|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in ''[[Perspectives on Politics]]'' found that "individuals who are older, male, longtime residents, voters in local elections, and homeowners are significantly more likely to participate" in local government, and that "these individuals overwhelmingly (and to a much greater degree than the general public) oppose new housing construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4kzph3ynal3xai/ZoningParticipation_Perspectives_Final.pdf?dl=0|title=Who Participates in Local Government?

According to a 2017 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes available for rent to extremely low income (ELI) households in the United States.  As a result, seventy-one percent of ELI households are forced to spend over half of their income on housing costs leading to severe financial burdens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/Gap-Report_2017.pdf|title=The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/assessing-the-severity-of-rent-burden-on-low-income-families-20171222.htm|title=Assessing the Severity of Rent Burden on Low-Income Families|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, while the need for more affordable housing is evident, opposition from “Not-in-my-backyard” or NIMBY activists present significant challenges to affordable housing developments, resulting in costly design changes, construction delays, and permit denials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|title=Democracy in Action?: NIMBY as Impediment to Equitable Affordable Housing Siting|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that proactive outreach and communication by affordable housing developers and proponents through the leveraging of social marketing and positive messaging can overcome common NIMBY barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beben|first=Robert|title=The Role of Social Marketing in Overcoming the NIMBY Syndrome|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rockne|first=Anna|title=Not in My Backyard: Using Communications to Shift "NIMBY" Attitudes about Affordable Housing|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/198187/ARockne%20Capstone%206.28.18.pdf?sequence=1|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
A small number of residents (mostly farmers) in [[Hanford, California]] and surrounding areas are opposed to the [[California High-Speed Rail Authority]] building high-speed rail near farmland, citing that it will bring environmental and economic problems.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Wealthy residents of southern Orange County, CA defeated a local measure that proposed to convert the decommissioned El Toro Marine Base into a commercial airport, claiming that the airport would be "unsafe" during landings and take-offs as well as create air quality issues. The real issue was the FAA planned the flight paths for the airport over expensive neighborhoods of the south Orange County and residents feared that their property values would decrease.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The airport proposal, however, was strongly supported by Northern Orange County residents. The defeat of the local measure resulted in the creation of the [[Orange County Great Park]].

National, state and local environmentalists, historic preservationists and long time residents of South [[Pasadena, California]] have been successfully opposing the completion of the highly controversial State Route 710 through the cities of Los Angeles (El Sereno), South Pasadena and Pasadena for over 60 years. There has been a federal injunction in place for 41 years stopping construction of the surface freeway. USC and UCLA urban and transportation planning students study this 80-year-old controversy because it is a classic example of sustained grass-roots opposition to a government proposal.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Now and for over a decade, a struggle has been brewing in [[San Francisco, California]] between the voting public and the influx of young professionals and tech workers. With no room to expand, construction companies can only build up in order to meet the increasing housing demand. However, NIMBYism has prevented high rise construction from spreading in San Francisco, citing restrictions on buildings' shadows and the dramatic changes proposed to the waterfront skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dineen|first=J.K.|title=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2013/07/nimbys-are-back-sf-builders-face.html|work=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|publisher="Biz Journals"|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition argues that new construction will increase the supply of luxury housing without creating affordable housing, thus raising the average rent while by attracting a wealthier population to the city of San Francisco and forcing middle and lower income families out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sankin|first=Aaron|title=8 Washington Luxury Waterfront Condo Development Project Vote Likely To Make It Onto November Ballot|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/8-washington_n_1690575.html|accessdate=29 January 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 2017, 15 housing bills were signed into law by [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] to combat the state's [[California housing shortage|housing shortage]]. Many of these bills are considered direct attempts to reduce the ability of private citizens to prevent housing projects from going forward, even being referred to by some as "Anti-NIMBY" bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meyersnave.com/legislatures-year-housing-produces-broad-package-bills-stimulate-affordable-housing-construction/|title=The Legislature's "Year Of Housing" Produces Broad Package of Bills to Stimulate Affordable Housing Construction - Meyers {{!}} Nave|website=www.meyersnave.com|language=en-US|access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-housing-legislation-signed-20170929-htmlstory.html|title=Gov.

====Florida====
Similar to the situation in Nantucket Sound, Mass., a minority of residents in [[St. Lucie County]], Florida have vehemently opposed the construction of wind turbines in the county. The construction of the wind turbines was strongly supported by over 80% of county residents according to a 2008 [[Florida Power and Light]] (FPL) poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617010520/https://www.palmbeachpost.com/search/content/tcoast/epaper/2008/04/03/m1b_slwind_0402.html|title=Survey supports turbines, FPL says|last=Quinlan|first=Paul|date=2008-04-03|website=The Palm Beach Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the power company proposed building the turbines in a location on a beach near a prior existing nuclear power plant owned by the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the 1980s, a agency known as the Palm Beach County Expressway Authority was formed to develop a series of east/west highways to take people from suburban Palm Beach County into downtown [[West Palm Beach]]. This was done in anticipation of [[population growth]] that would happen over the next decades in Palm Beach County that would bring in more traffic. Many neighbors in areas such as Westgate and Lake Belvedere Estates strongly opposed this plan citing it would wipe out their neighborhoods. Ultimately the plan was revised to create [[Florida State Road 80|SR-80]] Boulevard into an express like roadway by eliminating traffic lights and overpassing other local roadways.

====Illinois====
In 1959, when [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]] officials learned that a developer building a neighborhood of large new homes planned to make houses available to [[African Americans]], they issued a stop-work order. An intense debate began about racial integration, property values, and the good faith of the residents, community officials and builders. For a brief time, Deerfield was spotlighted in the national news as "the Little Rock of the North."&lt;ref name="ros001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosen | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Rosen (author) |author2=David Rosen  | title = But Not Next Door | publisher = Astor-Honor Inc | year = 1962 | isbn = 0-8392-1007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of integration were denounced and ostracized by residents. Eventually, the village passed a referendum to build parks on the property, thus putting an end to the housing development. Two model homes already partially completed were sold to village officials.&lt;ref name="ros001" /&gt; Otherwise, the land lay dormant for years before it was developed into what is now Mitchell Pool and Park and Jaycee Park. The first black family did not move into Deerfield until much later, and in years since Deerfield has seen a greater influx of minorities, including Jews, Asians, Greeks and others. This episode in Deerfield's history is described in ''But Not Next Door'' by Harry and David Rosen, both residents of Deerfield.

==== Massachusetts ====
Opposition to two proposed freeways within the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|MA Route 128]] beltway road around Boston—the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] and the routing of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts]] into downtown Boston via the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]]—were opposed from their proposals during the 1950s era, and finally cancelled by the actions of then-Governor [[Francis Sargent]] in 1970. The [[MBTA Orange Line]] heavy rail rapid transit line's southern route was eventually re-located along much of the Southwest Corridor right-of-way for the cancelled I-95's roadbed in the late 1980s, when the Orange Line's [[Washington Street Elevated]] tracks were torn down at the time.

Some residents and businesses of [[Cape Cod]], [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Nantucket Island]] have opposed construction of [[Cape Wind]], a proposed offshore [[wind farm]] in [[Nantucket Sound]]. Proponents cite the environmental, economic, and [[energy security]] benefits of clean, [[renewable energy]], while opponents are against any obstruction to the views from oceanfront vacation homes and tourist destinations based in the region.

====Minnesota====
In the late 1990s a proposal for [[commuter rail]] on the [[Dan Patch Corridor]] between [[Minneapolis]] and [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]] was studied. In 2002, due to opposition from neighborhoods along the corridor, two state representatives from the suburbs of [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]] and [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]] passed a legislative ban not allowing further study, discussion, funding, and construction of the project. While the ban is still in place despite numerous attempts to repeal it, the two suburbs that sponsored the ban are now open to the proposal. [[Lakeville, Minnesota|Lakeville]] and [[St. Louis Park]] remain opposed to the project and repealing the ban.

====New York====
In [[Long Island]], various electrification and expansion projects of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) were substantially delayed due to the protests of people living near the railroad. For example, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] has proposed to build a [[Third Track Project|third track]] on the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] from [[Floral Park station]] to [[Hicksville station]] in order to increase capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/News/2008/MainLineCorridorImprovements.pdf|title=MTA Long Island Rail Road East Side Access and Third Track – Main Line Corridor Improvements|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=4 July 2018|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rather | first=John | title=Third-Track Project Finds Its Nemesis | website=The New York Times | date=10 July 2005 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/nyregion/thirdtrack-project-finds-its-nemesis.html | access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most communities along the route supported [[grade crossing]] eliminations as part of the project, there was fierce opposition for building a third track from the villages of [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]], [[New Hyde Park, New York|New Hyde Park]], and [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], which said the construction and the resulting increased train service will reduce the quality of life in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |title=Floral Park Mayor To Address LIRR Expansion |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322080533/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=22 March 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |title=Residents: MTA/LIRR Needs to Get on Right Track |author=Carisa Keane |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=New Hyde Park Illustrated News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195104/http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |archivedate=27 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |title=Village Meets With LIRR On "Third Track" Project |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112195001/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=12 January 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third track project was suspended indefinitely in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/14lirrli.html |title=Third-Track Plan Isn’t Dead, L.I.R.R.

In [[Port Washington, New York]], a dispute broke out between the town of [[North Hempstead, New York|North Hempstead]] and the LIRR over a proposed yard expansion at [[Port Washington station]]. To expand the yard, a parking lot belonging to the town would need to be reduced in size, but a local councilperson stated that the addition of the tracks "will completely ruin the character of the town."&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/lirr-plan-would-run-more-trains-to-nyc-1.5263966 |title=LIRR plan would run more trains to NYC |publisher=Newsday |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LIRR was able to expand the yard without the agreement of North Hempstead by tearing up 140 parking spaces of its own parking lot, also adjacent to the station.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt;

Community opposition also led to the cancellation of a proposed extension of the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]] (carrying the {{NYCS trains|Astoria}}) to [[LaGuardia Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2003/0716/Front_Page/002.html|title=N Train Extension To LaG Scrapped|last=Toscano|first=John|date=July 16, 2003|newspaper=Queens Gazette|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007-06-27/Features/Flashback_To_1999_001.html|title=Flashback To 1999 &amp;#124; www.qgazette.com &amp;#124; Queens Gazette|date=June 27, 2007|publisher=www.qgazette.com|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, opposition has killed any proposal to build a [[Long Island Sound link|bridge or tunnel across the Long Island Sound]] with some believing it will harm their communities with an influx of unwanted traffic as well as concerns regarding the environment and the number of homes that would be cleared as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Steve|last2=Herman|first2=Ralph|last3=Willinger|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Schlictman|first4=Paul|title=Overview: Oyster Bay-Rye Bridge (I-287, unbuilt)|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/oysterbay-rye/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overengineering''' (or '''over-engineering''') is the act of designing a product to be more robust or have more features than necessary for its intended use, or for a process to be unnecessarily complex or inefficient.

Overengineering is often done to increase a [[factor of safety]], add function, or overcome perceived design flaws that most users would accept. Overengineering can be desirable when safety or performance is critical (e.g. in aerospace vehicles), or when extremely broad functionality is required (e.g. diagnostic tools), but it is generally criticized in terms of [[value engineering]] as wasteful of resources such as materials, time and money. As a [[design philosophy]], it is the opposite of the [[minimalist]] ethos of "less is more" and a violation of the [[KISS principle]].

Overengineering generally occurs in high-end products or specialized markets. In one form, products are ''overbuilt'' and have performance far in excess of expected normal operation (a city car that can travel at 300&amp;nbsp;km/h, or a home video recorder with a projected lifespan of 100 years), and hence are more expensive, bulkier, and heavier than necessary. Alternatively, they may become ''overcomplicated'' &amp;ndash; the extra functions may be unnecessary, and potentially reduce the [[usability]] of the product by overwhelming [[end user]]s.

Overengineering can decrease the [[productivity]] of the design team because of the need to build and maintain unwanted features.

A related issue is [[market segmentation]] &amp;ndash; making different products for different market segments. In this context, a particular product may be more or less suited (and thus considered over- or under-engineered) for a particular market segment.

== Cultural references ==
A story about very precise engineering is given in the 1858 story ''[[s:The Deacon's Masterpiece|The Deacon's Masterpiece or, the Wonderful "One-hoss Shay": A Logical Story]]'' by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], which tells of a carriage ([[one-horse shay]])
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;That was built in such a logical way
It ran a hundred years to a day,
And then,
...
went to pieces all at once, --
All at once, and nothing first, --
Just as bubbles do when they burst.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because it had been engineered so that no single piece failed first – no piece was over-engineered relative to the others, and they thus all collapsed at the same time.

A similar quote by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] claimed "the perfect [[Auto racing|race car]] crosses the finish line in first place and immediately falls into pieces."{{Citation needed|reason=Need reliable source to confirm Porsche said this.|date=March 2018}}

A modern example is [[Juicero]], a wi-fi "smart" juicing press. But after its release, [[Bloomberg News]] published a story that showed that the juice packs could be squeezed by hand faster than the press, and that hand-squeezing produced juice that was indistinguishable in quantity and quality from the output of the machine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/silicon-valley-s-400-juicer-may-be-feeling-the-squeeze|title=Silicon Valley’s $400 Juicer May Be Feeling the Squeeze|date=2017-04-19|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10911">The '''Page playoff system''' is a [[playoff format]] used primarily in [[softball]] and [[curling]] at the championship level, the [[Pakistan Super League]], and the [[Indian Premier League]] [[cricket]] tournament.  Teams are [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seed]]ed using a [[round-robin tournament]] and the top four play a mix of a [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] and [[double-elimination tournament]] to determine the winner. It is identical to a four-team [[McIntyre System]] playoff, first used by the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] in Australia in 1931, originally called the '''[[Page–McIntyre system]]''', after the VFL delegate, the [[Richmond Football Club]]'s Secretary, Percy "Pip" Page, who had advocated its use.

==History==
The Page playoff system was used at the Australian Rugby League Championship 1954-1972. In Australia, its most notable use today is in netball, having been adopted by [[Suncorp Super Netball]] when it began play in 2017.

The system has been used since 1990 by the [[International Softball Federation]] and its successor, the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], for the [[Women's Softball World Championship]] and from 1996 to 2008 at the [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=ISF&gt;International Softball Federation. [http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/technical_venue_man.pdf Technical &amp; Venue Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025144555/http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/technical_venue_man.pdf |date=2006-10-25 }} ([[PDF]]).  Retrieved March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first use in curling was by the [[Canadian Curling Association]] in the [[1995 Labatt Brier|1995 Labatt]] [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]],&lt;ref name=LFP&gt;Dalla Costa, Morris (March 3, 2006).

''[[London Free Press via Canoe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the men's championship, and was adopted the next year at the [[1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts|1996]] [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Scott Tournament of Hearts]], the women's championship.&lt;ref name=1996Scott&gt;Soudog's Curling History Site. [http://soudogcurling.tripod.com/STOH/1996.html 1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts].  Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It gained acceptance and in 2005 the [[World Curling Championships]] started using it, but it has not yet been adopted in curling at the [[Olympic Games]].

The format is used in the [[Indian Premier League]] cricket tournament since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Premier League]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The format has also been used in some much lower-key, internet gaming events, such as chess&lt;ref name=Chess&gt;Fischer Random Chess Email Club.  [http://frcec.chess960.info/FischerCup.htm FRCEC's Annual Championship Tournament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110081449/http://frcec.chess960.info/FischerCup.htm |date=2006-01-10 }}.

Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The system requires teams to be [[ranking|ranked]] in some way, as the top two teams have an advantage over the bottom two.  This is usually accomplished through a round-robin tournament, which eliminates all but the top four teams.

===Round-robin===
A standard round-robin tournament is used, in which all teams play each other once.  Because the [[Triangular number|number of total games]] increases [[Quadratic growth|quadratically]] with respect to the number of teams, scheduling too many teams will result in an unwieldy number of games, particularly when there are a limited number of [[playing surface]]s ([[ice rink|curling rink]]s usually only have four [[Curling#Playing surface|sheet]]s).  Therefore, the number of teams is usually capped at around a dozen; if this is not possible or desirable, teams may be separated into groups playing separate round-robins and either having the top teams combining for the Page playoff or playing separate ones in each group and having the winners play each other after.

===Page playoff system===
The system was invented in Australia in the early 1930s and adopted soon after by the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League).  The top four teams advance to the playoffs, which are played over three rounds with one team being eliminated in each round.  {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The format progresses as follows:
*In Game 1, the third- and fourth-placed teams play against each other. The loser is eliminated.
*In Game 2, the first- and second-placed teams play against each other. The winner qualifies directly for the final.
*In Game 3, the winner of Game 1 plays against the loser of Game 2. The loser is eliminated.
*Game 4 (the final) is then played between the winners of Games 2 and 3.

This system gives the top two teams a double chance, in that they can lose their first game and still go on to win the title, producing a similar though not identical effect to a [[double-elimination tournament]].  This gives the top two teams a significant advantage over the next two, since winning the title from third or fourth place requires winning one more game than winning from first or second, and also requires defeating every other team in the playoffs. Additionally, the higher ranked team in any pairing (which, in the final, is automatically the team which won Game 2) will play as the [[home team]] to provide an additional advantage; in the case of curling teams, where teams rarely play national or international tournaments at their home rink, the advantage is that the first-placed team is given the [[Curling#Last rock (or Hammer)|hammer]] (last rock) in the first end, which is a reasonable advantage between comparably skilled teams.

In the 2008 World Women's Curling championship, a fifth match was added to the format: a bronze medal playoff match, which was played between the two teams which did not qualify for the final (the losers of Games 1 and 3). This game is normally scheduled between Games 3 and 4. Previously, the bronze would have automatically been awarded to the team which lost Game 3, so this game provides a chance for the loser of Game 1 to still receive a medal. This was also introduced at the national level at the [[2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] and the [[2011 Tim Hortons Brier]]. The bronze medal game was heavily criticized for being "meaningless" in part because simply winning a "medal" does not carry the same sort of prestige it does in the Olympic Games. The bronze medal game was eliminated prior to the 2018 Canadian championship curling season.

====Names of matches====
In Australia, Games 1 and 2 are known as ''Semi-Finals''; Game 3 is called the ''Preliminary Final'', and the final is known as the ''Grand Final''. To distinguish between the two Semi-Finals, which are different in nature, the match between 3rd and 4th is known either as the ''First Semi-Final'' or the ''Minor Semi-Final''; and the match between 1st and 2nd is known either as the ''Second Semi-Final'' or the ''Major Semi-Final''.

In Curling, Games 1 and 2 are usually known as the ''Page Playoffs'' (and Game 2 is usually played first, to give the higher-ranked team more rest before Game 3); Game 3 is called the ''Semi-Final'', and the final is known by that name. However, some sources, in order to distinguish between Games 1 and 2, refer only to Game 2 as a ''Page Playoff'' while referring to Game 1 as the ''Quarter-Final.''

In India, Game 1 is known as the ''Eliminator'', Games 2 and 3 are called ''Qualifiers'', and the final is known by that name.

{{alphabet}}
The '''Paleohispanic scripts''' are the writing systems created in the [[Iberian peninsula]] before the [[Latin alphabet]] became the dominant script. Most of them are unusual in that they are [[semi-syllabary|semi-syllabic]] rather than purely [[alphabetic]], despite having supposedly developed, in part, from the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. 

Paleohispanic scripts are known to have been used from the 5th century BCE — possibly from the 7th century, in the opinion of some researchers — until the end of the 1st century BCE or the beginning of the 1st century CE, and were the main scripts used to write the [[Paleohispanic languages]]. Some researchers conclude that their origin may lie solely with the Phoenician alphabet, while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] may have had also a role.

==Scripts==
The Paleoiberian scripts are classified into three major groups: southern, northern, and Greco-Iberian, with differences both in the shapes of the glyphs and in their values. 

Inscriptions in the southern scripts have been found mainly in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. They represent only 5% of the inscriptions found, and mostly read from right to left (like the Phoenician alphabet). They are:

* the [[Espanca script]] (known from a single tablet, and the only attestation of an alphabetical order);
* the Tartessian or [[Southwest script|Southwestern script]], also known as ''South Lusitanian''; 
* the [[Southeastern Iberian script]], also known as ''Meridional''.

Inscriptions in the northern scripts have been found mainly in the NE of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. They represent 95% of the inscriptions found, and mostly read from left to right (like the Greek alphabet). They are:

* the [[Northeastern Iberian script]], also known as ''Levantine'';
** Dual variant
** Non-dual variant
* the [[Celtiberian script]]
**Western variant
**Eastern variant. 

The [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]] was a direct adaptation of the Ionic variety of the [[Greek alphabet]], and only found  in a small region on the [[Mediterranean]] coast in the modern provinces of [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]] and [[Murcia (province)|Murcia]].

==Typology==
Excepting the Greco-Iberian alphabet, and to a lesser extent the Tartessian (southwestern) script, Paleoiberian scripts shared a distinctive [[Linguistic typology|typology]]:  They behaved as a [[syllabary]] for the [[plosive]]s and as an [[alphabet]] for the rest of consonants. This unique [[writing system]] has been called a ''[[semi-syllabary]]''.

In the syllabic portions of the scripts, each plosive sign stood for a different combination of consonant and vowel, so that the written form of ''ga'' displayed no resemblance to ''ge'', and ''bi'' looked quite different from ''bo''. In addition, the original format did not distinguish [[voice (phonetics)|voiced from unvoiced]] plosives, so that ''ga'' stood for both /ga/ and /ka/, and ''da'' stood for both /da/ and /ta/. 

On the other hand, the continuants ([[fricative consonant|fricative]] sounds like /s/ and [[sonorant]]s like /l/, /m/, [[trill consonant|trills]], and vowels) were written with simple alphabetic letters, as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]. 

Over the past few decades, many researchers have come to believe that one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (/d/~/t/) and [[velar consonant|velar]] (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see [[northeastern Iberian script]].) If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.

===Tartessian===

The [[Southwest script|Tartessian script]] is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic  semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a plosive was determined by the following vowel, as in a  semi-syllabary, the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. (See [[Tartessian language]] for an example.) This redundant typology re-emerged in a few late (2nd and 1st century BCE) texts of [[northeastern Iberian script|northeastern Iberian]] and [[Celtiberian script|Celtiberian]] scripts, where vowels were once again written after plosives. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, with essentially syllabic glyphs followed by the letter for the corresponding vowel; others treat it as a redundant alphabet, with the choice of an essentially consonantal character decided by the following vowel.&lt;ref name=Hoz&gt;''Hoz, Javier de (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is analogous to the [[Old Persian cuneiform script]], where vowels were most often written overtly but where consonants/syllables were decided by the vowel about half the time, and, to a very limited extent, to the [[Etruscan alphabet]], where most syllables based the consonant /k/ shared neither consonant nor vowel letter: Only the combinations CE, CI, KA, and QU were permitted. (This Etruscan convention is preserved in the English, not only in ''qu'' for ''queen,'' but also the letter names ''cee, kay, cue/qu''.)

== Origins ==

The paleoiberian semi-syllabaries clearly derive ultimately from an [[alphabet]] or alphabets circulating in the [[Mediterranean]], but it is not known whether that was the [[Phoenician alphabet]] alone, or if archaic varieties of the [[Greek alphabet]] also played a role. 

The only known full Paleoiberian signary, on the undated [[Espanca script|Espanca tablet]] (not completely readable, but clearly related to the southwestern and southeastern scripts), follows the Phoenician/Greek order for the first 13 of its 27 letters: Α Β Γ Δ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Π? {{lang|grc|ϻ}} Τ. The fact that southern paleohispanic /e/ appears to derive from the Phoenician letter ‘ayin, which gave rise to Greek Ο, while southern iberian /o/ derives from another letter or was perhaps invented,&lt;ref name=espanca&gt;[http://www.webpersonal.net/jrr/espanca_en.htm Ramos, ''A Palæo-Iberian Alphabet: Espanca's Stele''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103082735/http://www.webpersonal.net/jrr/espanca_en.htm |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the development of vowels in paleoiberian semi-syllabaries was independent of the Greek innovation. However, the order of what appears to be /u/ directly after Τ, rather than at the place of {{lang|grc|Ϝ}}, has suggested to some researchers a Greek influence. (In addition, the letter for /e/ in northeast Iberian resembles Greek Ε rather than the southeast Iberian letter.) The two [[sibilants]], S and S', are attested, but there is one sign too few to account for a full 15-sign syllabary and all four of the letters M, M', R, and R' (not all of which can be positively identified with letters from the tablet), suggesting that one of ems or ars shown in the charts to the right is only a graphic variant. 

The obvious question about the origin and evolution of these scripts is how a purely alphabetic script was changed into, or perhaps unconsciously reinterpreted as, a partial syllabary. It may be instructive to consider an unrelated development in the evolution of the [[Etruscan alphabet]] from Greek: Greek had three letters, Γ, Κ, and {{lang|grc|Ϙ}}, whose sounds were not distinguished in Etruscan. Nonetheless, all three were borrowed, becoming the letters C, K, and Q. All were pronounced /k/, but they were restricted to appear before different vowels — CE, CI, KA, and QU, respectively, — so that the consonants carried almost as much weight in distinguishing these syllables as the vowels did. (This may have been an attempt to overtly indicate the vowel-dependent [[allophony]] of Etruscan /k/ with the extra Greek letters that were available.) When the Etruscan alphabet was later adapted to [[Latin]], the letter C stood for both /k/ and /g/, as Etruscan had had no /g/ sound to maintain the original sound value of Greek Г. (Later a stroke was added to C, creating the new Latin letter G.). 

Something similar may have happened during the evolution of the Paleoiberian scripts. If writing passed from the Phoenicians through the Tartessians, and the [[Tartessian language]] did not have a /g/ or a /d/, that would explain the absence of a distinction between /g/ and /k/, /d/ and /t/ in the southeastern Iberian and later northeast Iberian scripts, despite it being clear that these were distinct sounds in the [[Iberian language]], as is clearly attested in the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]] and later use of the Latin alphabet. In [[Tartessian script]], vowels were always written after the plosives, but they were redundant — or at nearly so — and thus it seems they were dropped when the script passed to the [[Iberians]]. 

Among the [[velar consonant]]s, ''ka/ga'' of southeastern Iberian and the southwestern script derives from Phoenician/Greek Γ, ''ke/ge'' from Κ, and ''ki/gi'' from {{lang|grc|Ϙ}},&lt;ref name=espanca/&gt; while ''ko/go'' (perhaps coincidentally) resembles Greek Χ (pronounced {{IPA-el|kʰ|}}). Phoenician/Greek labial letter Β was the source of southwestern ''be'', southeastern ''ba''; the use of Π is uncertain but may have been the source of ''bi.'' (If Greek was used as a secondary source, Greek Φ ({{IPA|[pʰ]}}) would also have been available.) For the [[alveolar consonant|alveolars]], Δ was the source of ''tu/du,'' Τ of ''ta/da,'' and Θ of ''ti/di.''&lt;ref name=espanca/&gt;

'''Pars destruens'''/'''pars construens''' (''lat''.) is in common parlance about different parts of an [[argumentation]]. The negative part of [[criticism|criticizing]] views is the pars destruens. And the positive part of stating one's own position and [[argument]]s is the pars construens.

The distinction goes back to [[Francis Bacon]] and his work [[Novum Organum]], 1620. There he puts forth his inductive method that has two parts. A negative part, ''pars destruens'', that removes all prejudices and errors. And the positive part, ''pars construens'', that is about gaining knowledge and truth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11169">For a [[plane curve]] ''C'' and a given fixed point ''O'', the '''pedal equation''' of the curve is a relation between ''r'' and ''p'' where ''r'' is the distance from ''O'' to a point on ''C'' and ''p'' is the perpendicular distance from ''O'' to the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to ''C'' at the point. The point ''O'' is called the ''pedal point'' and the values ''r'' and ''p'' are sometimes called the ''pedal coordinates'' of a point relative to the curve and the pedal point. It is also useful to measure the distance of ''O'' to the normal &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; (the ''contrapedal coordinate'') even though it is not an independent quantity and it relates to &lt;math&gt;(r,p)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;p_c:=\sqrt{r^2-p^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Some curves have particularly simple pedal equations and knowing the pedal equation of a curve may simplify the calculation of certain of its properties such as curvature. This coordinates are also well suited for solving certain type of force problems in [[classical mechanics]] and [[celestial mechanics]].

==Equations==

===Cartesian coordinates===
For ''C'' given in [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]] by ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and with ''O'' taken to be the origin, the pedal coordinates of the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') are given by:&lt;ref&gt;Yates §1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{x\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+y\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The pedal equation can be found by eliminating ''x'' and ''y'' from these equations and the equation of the curve.

The expression for ''p'' may be simplified if the equation of the curve is written in [[Homogeneous polynomial#Homogenization|homogeneous coordinates]] by introducing a variable ''z'', so that the equation of the curve is ''g''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The value of ''p'' is then given by&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the result is evaluated at ''z''=1

===Polar coordinates===
For ''C'' given in [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] by ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(θ), then

:&lt;math&gt;p=r\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Tangential angle#Polar tangential angle|polar tangential angle]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{dr}{d\theta}\tan \phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The pedal equation can be found by eliminating θ from these equations.&lt;ref&gt;Yates p. 166, Edwards p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, from the above we can find that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right|=\frac{r p_c}{p},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; p_c:=\sqrt{r^2-p^2} &lt;/math&gt; is the "contrapedal" coordinate, i.e. distance to the normal. This implies that if a curve satisfies an autonomous differential equation in polar coordinates of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(r,\left|\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right|\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
its pedal equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(r,\frac{rp_c}{p}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Example====
As an example take the logarithmic spiral with the spiral angle α:
:&lt;math&gt;
r=a e^{\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} \theta}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dr}{d\theta}= \frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} a e^{\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} \theta}=\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha} r,
&lt;/math&gt;
hence 
:&lt;math&gt; \left|\frac{d r}{d \theta}\right|=\left|\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}\right| r, &lt;/math&gt;
and thus in pedal coordinates we get
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{r}{p}p_c=\left|\frac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}\right| r, \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad |\sin\alpha| p_c=|\cos\alpha| p,&lt;/math&gt;
or using the fact that &lt;math&gt; p_c^2=r^2-p^2&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
:&lt;math&gt; p=|\sin\alpha|r.&lt;/math&gt;

This approach can be generalized to include autonomous differential equations of any order as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Blaschke Proposition 1&lt;/ref&gt; A curve ''C'' which a solution of an ''n''-th order autonomous differential equation (&lt;math&gt;n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) in polar coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; f\left(r,|r'_{\theta}|,r''_{\theta},|r'''_{\theta}|\dots,r_\theta^{(2j)},|r_\theta^{(2j+1)}|,\dots, r_\theta^{(n)}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[pedal curve]] of a curve given in pedal coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt; f(p,p_c, p_c p_c',p_c (p_c p_c')',\dots, (p_c\partial_p)^n p)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the differentiation is done with respect to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Force problems===
Solutions to some force problems of classical mechanics can be surprisingly easily obtained in pedal coordinates.

Consider a dynamical system:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot x=F^\prime(|x|^2)x+2 G^\prime(|x|^2){\dot x}^\perp,&lt;/math&gt;

describing an evolution of a test particle (with position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot x&lt;/math&gt;) in the plane in the presence of central &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and Lorentz like &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; potential. The quantities:

:&lt;math&gt; L=x\cdot \dot x^\perp+G(|x|^2), \qquad c=|\dot x|^2-F(|x|^2), &lt;/math&gt;

are conserved in this system.

Then the curve traced by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is given in pedal coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\left(L-G(r^2)\right)^2}{p^2}=F(r^2)+c,&lt;/math&gt;

with the pedal point at the origin. This fact was discovered by P. Blaschke in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Blaschke Theorem 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
As an example consider the so-called [[Kepler problem]], i.e. central force problem, where the force varies inversely as a square of the distance:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{x}=-\frac{M}{|x|^{3}}x, &lt;/math&gt;

we can arrive at the solution immediately in pedal coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L^2}{p^2}=\frac{2M}{r}+c, &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the particle's angular momentum and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to its energy. Thus we have obtained the equation of a conic section in pedal coordinates.

Inversely, for a given curve ''C'', we can easily deduce what forces do we have to impose on a test particle to move along it.

==Pedal equations for specific curves==

===Sinusoidal spirals===
For a [[sinusoidal spiral]] written in the form 
:&lt;math&gt;r^n = a^n \sin(n \theta)&lt;/math&gt;
the polar tangential angle is 
:&lt;math&gt;\psi = n\theta&lt;/math&gt;
which produces the pedal equation
:&lt;math&gt;pa^n=r^{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The pedal equation for a number of familiar curves can be obtained setting ''n'' to specific values:&lt;ref&gt;Yates p. 168, Edwards p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirals===
A spiral shaped curve of the form
:&lt;math&gt;r = c \theta^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
satisfies the equation
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dr}{d\theta}=\alpha r^{\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;
and thus can be easily converted into pedal coordinates as 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p^2}=\frac{\alpha^2 c^{\frac{2}{\alpha}}}{r^{2+\frac{2}{\alpha}}}+\frac{1}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Epi- and hypocycloids===
For an epi- or hypocycloid given by parametric equations
:&lt;math&gt;x (\theta) = (a + b) \cos \theta - b \cos \left( \frac{a + b}{b} \theta \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y (\theta) = (a + b) \sin \theta - b \sin \left( \frac{a + b}{b} \theta \right),&lt;/math&gt;
the pedal equation with respect to the origin is&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^2=a^2+\frac{4(a+b)b}{(a+2b)^2}p^2&lt;/math&gt;
or&lt;ref&gt;Yates p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p^2=A(r^2-a^2)&lt;/math&gt;

==Biography==

Hüttner was born in [[Oskarshamn]], [[Småland]] on 11 February 1967. His father Bengt, who was Jewish, died in a car accident in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platform.fi/2002/huttner/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930024533/http://www.platform.fi/2002/huttner/index.html |archivedate=2009-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was brought up by his Protestant mother with his sister. He moved around Sweden until the age of 24 when he moved to [[Berlin]] to study. His life has since been marked by [[nomadism]] and constant movement where travel and international dialogues are core to his life and practice.&lt;ref&gt;"Med världen som arbetsplats," Anders Olofsson, Konstperspektiv p.24-27; April 2002; Malmö, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[London]] and [[Los Angeles]] until he created his base in Paris in 2002. Hüttner was one of the founders of the non-profit galleries [[Konstakuten]] in Stockholm (1996–2001) and [[The Hood Gallery]] in Los Angeles (2001–2003),&lt;ref&gt;Springhill Institute Report on Activities, p.110, The Springhill Institute, Birmingham, UK, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-9556107-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former was one of the first artist initiated galleries in the country and was important in creating a culture of self-organisation of artists in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;"How do we Keep on Meeting?," 9-10 Ottobre 1999, Oreste at The Venice Biennale, Italy, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He is also one of the founders of the residency programs Norrköping AIR &lt;ref&gt;http://norrkopingair.blogspot.ch/&lt;/ref&gt; and initiator of the experimental research group [[Vision Forum (art organisation)|Vision Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;The Invisible Generation ed.

Hüttner's work investigates [[impermanence]] as a global principle, especially how ideas of permanence and purity are used to perpetuate social, political and economical structures&lt;ref&gt;[http://theinclusion.davidrobertsartfoundation.com/post/39924481600/per-huttner-shares-an-interview-and-his-essay-never Interview with the artist on David Roberts Art Foundation blog]&lt;/ref&gt; and how that influences human communication and interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalartmuseum.de/site/guest_author/323 |title=OuUnPo and Globalisation on Global Art and the Museum website |access-date=2012-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014132634/http://www.globalartmuseum.de/site/guest_author/323 |archive-date=2013-10-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work often deals with transformation, change or various forms of transgressions of boundaries or borders.&lt;ref&gt;Intrude ART VS Per Hüttner, p.54-55, Intrude Art, Issue 04, 2008, published by [[Shanghai Zendai Museum of Modern Art]] {{cite web |url=http://www.intrude366.com/en-US/intrude366/Project.aspx?articleid=254 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713050530/http://www.intrude366.com/en-US/intrude366/Project.aspx?articleid=254 |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist is inspired by French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt; and particularly interested in how the relationship between larger political, economical and social structures affect the individual and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Muzyczka, Shanghai Global Times, Monday December 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His work dialogues with the history of [[performance art|performance]]&lt;ref&gt;"Filling the City with Dreams", errors, deceits, mistakes no 3, 2008, p.72-82, Cneai, Chatou, France {{ISBN|978-2-912483-60-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explores the genre in innovative ways by provoking the [[curiosity]] and [[imagination]] of the visitor as well as by reflecting on notions about [[time]], [[knowledge]] and the human body.&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt;

In the late 1980s and 1990s much of Hüttner's installations used [[computer]]s, [[video]]&lt;ref&gt;Springhill Institute Report on Activities, p.32-39, The Springhill Institute, Birmingham, UK, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-9556107-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[new media]].&lt;ref&gt;"Labyrinthen i Gdansk," [[Daniel Birnbaum]], MAMA, p.30-31, September 1994, Stockholm, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first artists to create installations that used computers as a sculptural element and at the same time allowing them to present vast and complex [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;Reflektionen und Reaktionen, p.42, published by Karl Hofer Gesellschaft, Berlin 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The artist also used contemporary [[medical science]] to develop work based on research on the [[brain|human brain]] at the ''[[Pitt Rivers Museum]]'' in [[Oxford]], [[England]] - looking at how the brain remains in a constant state of change and regeneration. He also created exhibitions, publications and lectures with [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[Elias Arnér]] that dealt with the relationship between [[art]], [[science]] and the [[human body]] in [[Stockholm]]. In [[Begrepp - En samling|Begrepp - En Samling]] (Concepts a Collection) they brought together artists and scientists to dialogue about [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] questions.&lt;ref&gt;"Elias Arnér and Per Hüttner," Tom Sandqvist, [[Siksi]], January 1993, Helsinki, Finland&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s Hüttner took his interdiscplinary experiences and implemented these into a series of exhibitions investigating the relationship between the [[art object]] and the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner "It's good to Be an Artist Again" p.211 Yugoslav Biennial of Young artists Vrsac 2004, Published by Centre for Contemporary Arts - Belgrade [https://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=wikipedia&amp;q=isbn%3A8684273013 The book on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he co-curated an exhibition at [[Nylon (gallery)|Nylon]] with [[Goshka Macuga]] and [[Gavin Wade]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Brown, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ ''3 in 1 Curatorial Mutiny, Part 4'', ''Frieze'', Issue 60, June - August 2001.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203192526/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ |date=2008-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy exhibitions that dealt with these issues and that engaged the audience&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett, "Creative Explorations New Approaches to Identities and Audiences", p. 119-20.

Parallel to this activity Hüttner created a photography project entitled "Jogging in Exotic Cities" where the artist went jogging repeatedly in far away cities that remain exotic to a western audience.&lt;ref&gt;Tank Book, Thames &amp; Hudson; 2002; London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; In the photographs we see the artist dressed in white clothes&lt;ref&gt;"TalePiece," Caroline Smith, [[Creative Camera]], p.50-51, April–May 1999, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; as he makes his way through bustling cities like [[Chennai]], [[Mexico City]] and [[Lusaka]].&lt;ref&gt;"Artists on the Move," Duncan McLaren, [[Contemporary (magazine)]], p.56-61; June–August 2002, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; The project remains one of Hüttner's most well-known to date.

In 2004 he developed the performative aspects in the above-mentioned project and tied it back to a research about the limits of reality and [[documentary photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artreview.com/profiles/blog/show?id=1474022%3ABlogPost%3A3003 Interview with Hüttner in Art Review]&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a series of photographs where he created shrines of commemoration in busy street corners of urban centres around the world.&lt;ref name="Francesca Pagliuca p. 102"&gt;"Per Hüttner", Francesca Pagliuca, [[Tema Celeste]] 117, p. 102, 2006, Milano, Italy&lt;/ref&gt; These impromptu sculptures suggested that an accident or act of violence had been committed in that specific place (while in fact they were fabricated by the artist). The work provoked complex discussions about differences and similarities between documentary traditions and the fictional.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao yao you, Catalogue de 15e Biennale d'image, April 2008, Nancy, France - published by Gérard Louis&lt;/ref&gt; This investigation into the very fabric of reality has moved to the forefront in the artist's mature work about impermanence and change. In the catalogue text to his 2006 exhibition ''Xiao Yao You'' that displayed a large body of the work at the [[Guangdong]] Museum of Art in [[Guangzhou]] the curator, Zhang Wei, writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ceaseless movement is not a way of gaining ever more exotic knowledge of the world; it is rather a way of cleaning out and rediscovering the self. This is what I see in Per’s work. When I face his images, the reality presented in them seems less a true physical reality than an invisible psychological one. I see a negotiation and dialogue between the artist’s inner and outer worlds. In this psychological landscape, he describes his worries, his pursuit of human sentiment, and his insistent rejection of a stylized or superficial life. It makes me think of the [[China|Chinese]] philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuang Zi]]'s idea of xiao yao you or "moving carelessly". This philosophy does not only detail how to move freely across physical space, but is also a metaphor for how humans can transcend different kinds of obstacles and achieve a freedom of the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Wei, ''Xiao Yao You'', ''Xiao Yao You'', p. 33, Guangdong Museum of Art, 2006. {{ISBN|978-91-631-9345-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The journey into the human soul was further developed in another photographic series from 2006-07 entitled [[Democracy and Desire]]. The images were primarily shot at night with very long exposure times.&lt;ref name="Tundro p.48-50"&gt;"Tundro, znaczy wolnosc" Marta Eloy Cichocka, Fotograficzny Biuletyn 09/2006 (58), p.48-50, Poland&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the individual and its search for personal liberty from social conventions again comes to the forefront in the dreamlike photography.&lt;ref&gt;"Joggaren har tagit en vilopaus", Anna Brodow, Svenska Dagbladet, Kultur s.9, May 12, 2007, Sweden. Online link (in Swedish) here [http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/konst/joggaren-har-tagit-en-vilopaus_227043.svd]&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue text to the exhibition the work is discussed. In a typical style of the artist, it is hard to decipher who the author of the give text is and  it even appears that the texts in different languages are written by different authors:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The uninhibited mental and/or physical space is very individual and extremely hard to define. But it is even more complicated, because this freedom can never be safe-guarded by consumerism, legislation or democracy {{Sic|hide=y|any|more|expected=any more}} than the self-confidence that feeds it can be defended by a law. As artists it is our prime responsibility to fight for the right to retain and enjoy this liberty for ourselves and others. This means that we need to have an extremely grounded belief in ourselves and the work that we do. Humanity will always be engaged in a battle to safeguard this freedom and maybe that is also a good definition of what an artist is – a confident defender of the aspects of the soul that cannot be defended any other way. It has always been like that throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner''Democracy and Desire'', p. 52, ''Democracy and Desire'', 2007, Published by Vacio 9 and The Romanian Cultural Institute. {{ISBN|978-91-633-0548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 2007, Hüttner has returned both to a dialogue with science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookworks.org.uk/asp/detail.asp?uid=book_2857B08F-6565-44BB-9F12-A3F912BA0C99&amp;sub=new Hüttner's contribution to "Has Man A Function in Universe?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218000209/http://www.bookworks.org.uk/asp/detail.asp?uid=book_2857B08F-6565-44BB-9F12-A3F912BA0C99&amp;sub=new |date=2009-02-18 }} {{ISBN|978-1-870699-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to working with video. In a sequel to [[Begrepp - En samling|Begrepp - En Samling]] from 1992, Hüttner and Arnér created a project entitled [[(In)Visible Dialogues]] which focused on a series of conversations between artists and scientists at [[Konstakademien]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref name="(In)visible Dialogues"&gt;[[(In)visible Dialogues]], Ed. E. Arnér and P. Huttner, Published by Dent-de-Leone. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also returned to these issues in a less direct way in solo exhibitions in France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstaspekte.de/index.php?tid=55572&amp;action=termin Press release at Kunstaspekte]&lt;/ref&gt; China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinasia.com/galleryDetail.php?view=7&amp;catID=0&amp;galleryID=551&amp;eventID=4342 Press release at Art in Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; England&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt; and Sweden. Installations such as "Do not Go Gentle",&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Delancey, Les Mutations Actives de Per Hüttner, p. 40-41, Novo Numéro 7, 03 2010, ISSN 1969-9514. Online version (in french) here [http://issuu.com/media.pop/docs/novo_n_7?mode=embed&amp;layout=skin.issuu.com/v/light/layout.xml]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Quantum Police"&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt; and "Imminent"&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition organized in collaboration with Sweden's participation in the Shanghai World Expo 2010.[http://www.swedenexpo.cn/en/events/details/event/142/]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; all depict eccentric people engaged in obsessive research. The work compels the visitor to reflect on whether it is meaningful to draw a line between reality and fiction.&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt; In her long text about the latter exhibition, the curator [[Cecilia Canziani]] shows how both the problematic of the singular and the collective, as well as myth and its ability influence reality, is highlighted in the artist's work:&lt;ref name="The Imminent Interviews"&gt;Cecilia Canziani, The Imminent Interviews - Per Hüttner, Fei Contemporary Art Center, Shanghai and Vision Forum 2010, {{ISBN|978-91-978934-4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In [[Plato|Plato’s]] [[Symposium]], perhaps the best known of his dialogues, [[Aristofanes]] recounts that once upon a time, human beings had two heads, four arms, four legs, they were complete, a whole, a unity. Because of their arrogance they were punished by [[Zeus]] and divided in two halves: men and women. Since then, we look for completion in the other, and such- arguably - along as being a [[metaphor]] of love, also serves as a symbol of the [[dialectic]] between singularity and collectivity that informs the political organisation of society. In "Imminent" it is not just the narrative that is fragmented, but also the characters and their multiplied personae. Different actors are cast in the same role, sometime one character is transformed into another, reminding us of the quest for unity that Plato describes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Quantum Police project, the above-mentioned problematic is taken even further. Here, the artist mixes (stolen or found?) police evidence material with interviews and fictional texts that describe elaborate conspiracy theories involving the police both in Europe and China.&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt; Delving deeper into questions of authenticity, the artist has also staged events that cross the boundaries of academic presentations, guided tours, and performance art. These have taken place at institutions like MACRO in [[Rome]], [[CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux|CAPC]] in [[Bordeaux]], [[Rockbund Art Museum]] in Shanghai, [[Tate Britain]] and [[Hayward Gallery]]&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt; in London and as part of experimental projects like [[The invisible generation (art project)|The Invisible Generation]]&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation"&gt;The Invisible Generation, ed. Gerrie van Noord, design Marie Proyard, Published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the international research group [[OuUnPo]].&lt;ref name="OuUnPo 2013"&gt;OuUnPo[RTO], edited by Claudia Squitieri and Samon Takahashi, texts by OuUnPo, designed by Åbäke published by Dent-de-Leone and Vision Forum, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the video work, where the sound is subdued, Hüttner often uses music in the recent performances and installations in order to purposefully create paradoxical and misleading timelines.&lt;ref&gt;A Score for an Entire City, Don't Look Back, ed. U. Ferm and M. Ångerman, Platform, Vasa, Finland 2011, {{ISBN|978-952-67484-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These investigations into time, [[Time|duration]] and the impermanent nature of knowledge have further been developed in an ongoing collaborative research with the Turkish writer/curator [[Fatos Üstek]] that started like a creative writing exchange in the Anglo-Austrian magazine [[Nowiswere]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowiswere.com/issues/issue-7/ Nowiswhere issue 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowiswere.com/issues/issue8/ Nowiswhere issue 8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowiswere.com/issues/issue-9/ Nowiswhere issue 9]&lt;/ref&gt; and that has led to interventions in museums like the [[Wacoal Art Center]] in [[Tokyo]] and [[Tate Modern]] in London&lt;ref&gt;Jean Matthee, p. 47-48 Space Matters, leaflet published by Tate Modern and NTNU’s Faculty of Architecture and Fine Art, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in public spaces in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Porto]],&lt;ref name="OuUnPo 2013"/&gt; [[Yokohama]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="The Quantum Police" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5617">An official system of weights and measures was established{{cn|date=February 2015}} in the ancient 
[[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] under the Achaemenid dynasty (550-350 BCE). The shekel and mina ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A shekel or mina weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. The talent was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage. Some related units were used in Persia in the 19th century, and are still used in contemporary Iran.

===Volume===
The ''shekel'' and ''mina'' ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A ''shekel'' or ''mina'' weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. Note that the values given for the ''mina'' do not match the definitions.

: 1 ''shekel'' = 8.3 ml (approximately 1 cubic ''aiwas'').
: 1 profane ''mina'' = 50 ''shekel'' = 500 ml (approximately 27 cubic ''aiwas'').
: 1 sacred ''mina'' = 60 ''shekel'' = 600 ml (approximately 1 cubic ''dva'').
: 1 talent (volume) = 60 profane ''mina'' = 25 liters (approximately 1  cubic ''trayas'').

===Weight===
The '''talent''' was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage (bullion, bulk coin), rather than an individual coin. Seven [[Babylonia]]n talents equalled ten Attic talents, according to a list of the revenues of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II of Persia)]] recorded in [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Book III, 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Burn, Andrew R. |title=Persia and the Greeks: the defence of the West, c. 546-478 BC |publisher=Duckworth |location=[London] |year=1984 |pages=123–126 |isbn=0-7156-1765-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''𐎣𐎼𐏁''' (karša) or '''𐎣𐎼𐏁𐎹𐎠''' (karšayā) is a unit of weight equal to 10 Babylonian ''shekels'' or 1/6 Babylonian ''mina'' weighing approximately 83g.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum No. 91117 Inscribed weight; http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=367895&amp;partId=1&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''phase diagram''' in [[physical chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[mineralogy]], and [[materials science]] is a type of [[chart]] used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct [[phase (matter)|phases]] (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) occur and coexist at [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]].

== Overview ==
Common components of a phase diagram are ''lines of equilibrium'' or ''phase boundaries'', which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple phases can coexist at equilibrium.  Phase transitions occur along lines of equilibrium.

[[Triple point]]s are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium intersect.  Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist.  For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium ({{val|273.16|ul=K}} and a partial vapor pressure of {{val|611.657|ul=Pa}}).

The [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid state. The [[liquidus]] is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a "[[slurry]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Predel |first=Bruno |last2=Hoch |first2=Michael J. R. |last3=Pool |first3=Monte |year=2004 |title=Phase Diagrams and Heterogeneous Equilibria: A Practical Introduction |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |isbn=3-540-14011-5}}&lt;!-- Reference 1 covers most of the article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Working fluids]] are often categorized by on the basis of the shape of their phase diagram.

== Types ==

=== 2-dimensional diagrams ===
[[Image:Phase-diag2.svg|thumb|310x310px|A typical phase diagram. The solid green line applies to most substances; the dotted green line gives [[Water (molecule)#Density of water and ice|the anomalous behavior of water]].  The green lines mark the [[freezing point]] and the blue line the [[boiling point]], showing how they vary with pressure.]]The simplest phase diagrams are pressure–temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as [[water (molecule)|water]]. The [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] correspond to the [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The phase diagram shows, in pressure–temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]].

The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point.  The open spaces, where the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is [[analytic function|analytic]], correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical behavior, where [[phase transition]]s occur, which are called '''phase boundaries'''.

In the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Papon |first2=J. |last2=Leblond |first3=P. H. E. |last3=Meijer |title=The Physics of Phase Transition : Concepts and Applications |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |isbn=3-540-43236-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is known as a [[supercritical fluid]]. In water, the critical point occurs at around ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = {{convert|647.096|K|C}}, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = {{convert|22.064|MPa|atm|abbr=on}} and ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 356&amp;nbsp;kg/m³.&lt;ref&gt;The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam [http://www.iapws.org/relguide/fundam.pdf "Guideline on the Use of Fundamental Physical Constants and Basic Constants of Water"], 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the liquid–gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid–liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same [[symmetry group]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

For most substances, the solid–liquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the phase diagram has a positive [[slope]] so that the melting point increases with pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is [[Density|denser]] than the liquid phase.&lt;ref name=Whitten&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitten |first1=Kenneth W. |last2=Galley |first2=Kenneth D.  |last3=Davis |first3=Raymond E. |date=1992 |title=General Chemistry. |edition=4th |page=477 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance's [[intermolecular forces]]. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid–gas phase changes.&lt;ref name=Dorin&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemistry : The Study of Matter Prentice |last1=Dorin |first1=Henry |last2=Demmin |first2=Peter E. |last3=Gabel |first3=Dorothy L. |edition=Fourth |pages=266–273 |isbn=0-13-127333-7 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Water is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive network of [[hydrogen bond]]ing which requires a greater separation of water molecules.&lt;ref name=Whitten/&gt; Other exceptions are [[antimony]] and [[bismuth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Averill |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Eldredge |first2=Patricia |date=2012 |title=Principles of General Chemistry |chapter=11.7 Phase Diagrams |chapter-url=https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s15-07-phase-diagrams.html |publisher=Creative Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrucci |first1=Ralph H. |last2=Harwood |first2=William S.  |last3=Herring |first3=F. Geoffrey |date=2002 |title=General Chemistry. Principles and Modern Applications |edition=8th |page=477 |publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the slope dP/dT is given by the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation|Clapeyron equation]] for fusion (melting)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laidler |first1=Keith J. |last2=Meiser |first2=John H. |date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |pages=173-4 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}T} = \frac{\Delta_{fus} H}{T\,\Delta_{fus} V}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ΔH&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat of fusion which is always positive, and ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume change for fusion. For most substances ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is positive so that the slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is negative so that the slope is negative.

====Other thermodynamic properties====
In addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams.  Examples of such thermodynamic properties include [[specific volume]], [[specific enthalpy]], or specific [[entropy]].  For example, single-component graphs of temperature vs. specific entropy (''T'' vs. ''s'') for water/[[steam]] or for a [[refrigerant]] are commonly used to illustrate [[thermodynamic cycle]]s such as a [[Carnot cycle]], [[Rankine cycle]], or [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle.

In a [[two-dimensional graph]], two of the thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical axes. Additional thermodynamic quantities may each be illustrated in increments as a series of lines - curved, straight, or a combination of curved and straight. Each of these '''iso-'''lines represents the thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.

The critical point is at the top of the dome. Liquid water is to the left of the dome. Steam is to the right of the dome. The blue lines/curves are '''isobars''' showing constant pressure. The green lines/curves are '''isochors''' showing constant specific volume. The red curves show constant quality.]]

===3-dimensional diagrams===
[[File:pVT 3D diagram.png|thumb|200px|''p''–''v''–''T'' 3D diagram for fixed amount of pure material]]
It is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three thermodynamic quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zemansky |first1=Mark W. |last2=Dittman |first2=Richard H. |year=1981 |title=Heat and Thermodynamics |edition=6th |at=Figs. 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 10-10, P10-1 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0-07-072808-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Web applet: [http://biomodel.uah.es/Jmol/plots/phase-diagrams/ 3D Phase Diagrams for Water, Carbon Dioxide and Ammonia]. Described in {{cite journal |last1=Glasser |first1=Leslie |last2=Herráez |first2=Angel |last3=Hanson |first3=Robert M. |year=2009 |title=Interactive 3D Phase Diagrams Using Jmol |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=566 |doi=10.1021/ed086p566}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (''T'') on one axis, pressure (''p'') on a second axis, and specific volume (''v'') on a third.  Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a ''p''–''v''–''T'' diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a '''triple line''' is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram.

For water, the 3D ''p''–''v''–''T'' diagram is seen here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=David |first1=Carl |title=Verwiebe's "3-D" Ice phase diagram reworked |url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/chem_educ/94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An [[orthographic projection]] of the 3D ''p''–''v''–''T'' graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the standard 2D pressure–temperature diagram. When this is done, the solid–vapor, solid–liquid, and liquid–vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line.

===Binary mixtures===
Other much more complex types of phase diagrams can be constructed, particularly when more than one pure component is present. In that case, [[concentration]] becomes an important variable.  Phase diagrams with more than two dimensions can be constructed that show the effect of more than two variables on the phase of a substance. Phase diagrams can use other variables in addition to or in place of temperature, pressure and composition, for example the strength of an applied electrical or magnetic field, and they can also involve substances that take on more than just three states of matter.
[[Image:Brosen ironcarbon.svg|thumb|250px|left|The iron–iron carbide (Fe–Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C) phase diagram. The percentage of carbon present and the temperature define the phase of the iron carbon alloy and therefore its physical characteristics and mechanical properties. The percentage of carbon determines the type of the ferrous alloy: iron, steel or cast iron]]
[[Image:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|right|250px|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]

One type of phase diagram plots temperature against the relative concentrations of two substances in a [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[mixture]] called a ''binary phase diagram'', as shown at right. Such a mixture can be either a [[solid solution]], [[eutectic point|eutectic]] or [[peritectic]], among others. These two types of mixtures result in very different graphs. Another type of binary phase diagram is a ''boiling-point diagram'' for a mixture of two components, i. e. [[chemical compound]]s. For two particular [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components at a certain pressure such as [[atmospheric pressure]], a boiling-point diagram shows what [[vapor]] (gas) compositions are in [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|equilibrium]] with given liquid compositions depending on temperature.  In a typical binary boiling-point diagram, temperature is plotted on a vertical axis and mixture composition on a horizontal axis.
[[Image:Binary Boiling Point Diagram new.svg|thumb|250px|right|Boiling-point diagram]]

A simple example diagram with hypothetical components 1 and 2 in a non-[[Azeotrope|azeotropic]] mixture is shown at right.  The fact that there are two separate curved lines joining the boiling points of the pure components means that the vapor composition is usually not the same as the liquid composition the vapor is in equilibrium with. See [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium#Boiling-point diagrams|Vapor–liquid equilibrium]] for more information.

In addition to the above-mentioned types of phase diagrams, there are thousands of other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a liquid. There is also the [[peritectoid]], a point where two solid phases combine into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase transforms into two solid phases during cooling, is called the eutectoid.

A complex phase diagram of great technological importance is that of the [[iron]]–[[carbon]] system for less than 7% carbon (see [[steel]]).

The x-axis of such a diagram represents the concentration variable of the mixture. As the mixtures are typically far from dilute and their density as a function of temperature is usually unknown, the preferred concentration measure is [[mole fraction]]. A volume-based measure like [[molarity]] would be inadvisable.

===Crystals===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphic]] and [[Polyamorphism|polyamorphic]] substances have multiple [[crystal]] or [[amorphous]] phases, which can be graphed in a similar fashion to solid, liquid, and gas phases.

A similar diagram may be found on the site Water structure and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html Water structure and science] Site by Martin Chaplin, accessed 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Mesophases===
Some organic materials pass through intermediate states between solid and liquid; these states are called [[mesophase]]s. Attention has been directed to mesophases because they enable [[display device]]s and have become commercially important through the so-called [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystal]] technology. Phase diagrams are used to describe the occurrence of mesophases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chandrasekhar |first1=Sivaramakrishna  |author-link= Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar |year=1992 |title=Liquid Crystals |edition=2nd |pages=27–29, 356 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-41747-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8772">In [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], a '''potential gradient''' is the local [[derivative|rate of change]] of the [[potential]] with respect to displacement, i.e. spatial derivative, or gradient. This quantity frequently occurs in equations of physical processes because it leads to some form of [[flux]].

==Definition==

===One dimension===

The simplest definition for a potential gradient ''F'' in one dimension is the following:&lt;ref&gt;Essential Principles of Physics, P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, {{ISBN|0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{\phi_2-\phi_1}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ϕ''(''x'')}} is some type of [[scalar potential]] and {{math|''x''}} is [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] (not [[distance]]) in the {{math|''x''}} direction, the subscripts label two different positions {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and potentials at those points, {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''ϕ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''ϕ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''ϕ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. In the limit of [[infinitesimal]] displacements, the ratio of differences becomes a ratio of [[differential of a function|differentials]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{{\rm d} \phi}{{\rm d} x}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The direction of the electric potential gradient is from x1 to x2.

===Three dimensions===

In [[three dimensional space|three dimensions]], [[Cartesian coordinates]] make it clear that the resultant potential gradient is the sum of the potential gradients in each direction:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{e}_x\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + \mathbf{e}_y\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} + \mathbf{e}_z\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

where {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[unit vector]]s in the {{math|''x, y, z''}} directions. This can be compactly written in terms of the [[gradient]] [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] {{math|∇}},

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

although this final form holds in any [[curvilinear coordinate system]], not just Cartesian.

This expression represents a significant feature of any [[conservative vector field]] {{math|'''F'''}}, namely {{math|'''F'''}} has a corresponding potential {{math|''ϕ''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Vector Analysis (2nd Edition), M.R. Spiegel, S. Lipcshutz, D. Spellman, Schaum’s Outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Stokes' theorem]], this is equivalently stated as

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla\times\mathbf{F} = \boldsymbol{0} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

meaning the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]], denoted ∇×, of the vector field vanishes.

==Physics==

===Newtonian gravitation===

In the case of the [[gravitational field#classical mechanics|gravitational field]] {{math|'''g'''}}, which can be shown to be conservative,&lt;ref&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is equal to the gradient in [[gravitational potential]] {{math|Φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = - \nabla \Phi. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are opposite signs between gravitational field and potential, because the potential gradient and field are opposite in direction: as the potential increases, the gravitational field strength decreases and vice versa.

===Electromagnetism===
{{main|Maxwell's equations|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field}}
In [[electrostatics]], the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} is independent of time {{math|''t''}}, so there is no induction of a time-dependent [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}} by [[Faraday's law of induction]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \boldsymbol{0} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which implies {{math|'''E'''}} is the gradient of the electric potential {{math|''V''}}, identical to the classical gravitational field:&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;- \mathbf{E} = \nabla V. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In [[electrodynamics]], the {{math|'''E'''}} field is time dependent and induces a time-dependent {{math|'''B'''}} field also (again by Faraday's law), so the curl of {{math|'''E'''}} is not zero like before, which implies the electric field is no longer the gradient of electric potential. A time-dependent term must be added:&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, {{ISBN|81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;- \mathbf{E} = \nabla V + \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''A'''}} is the electromagnetic [[vector potential]]. This last potential expression in fact reduces Faraday's law to an identity.

===Fluid mechanics===

In [[fluid mechanics]], the [[velocity field]] {{math|'''v'''}} describes the fluid motion. An [[irrotational flow]] means the velocity field is conservative, or equivalently the [[vorticity]] [[pseudovector]] field {{math|'''ω'''}} is zero: 

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla\times\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows the [[velocity potential]] to be defined simply as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \nabla\phi&lt;/math&gt;

==Chemistry==

{{main|Electrode potentials}}

In an [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[half-cell]], at the interface between the [[electrolyte]] (an [[ion]]ic [[solution]]) and the [[metal]] [[electrode]], the standard [[electric potential difference]] is:&lt;ref&gt;Physical chemistry, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0-19-855148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi_{(M,M^{+z})} = \Delta \phi_{(M,M^{+z})}^{\ominus} + \frac{RT}{zeN_\text{A}}\ln a_{M^{+z}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' = [[gas constant]], ''T'' = [[temperature]] of solution, ''z'' = [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]] of the metal, ''e'' = [[elementary charge]], ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Avogadro constant]], and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;+z&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]] of the ions in solution. Quantities with superscript ⊖ denote the measurement is taken under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]. The potential gradient is relatively abrupt, since there is an almost definite boundary between the metal and solution, hence the interface term.&lt;!---What is this sentence trying to say!??---&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2013}}

==Biology==

In [[biology]], a potential gradient is the net difference in [[electric charge]] across a [[cell membrane]].

==Non-uniqueness of potentials==

Since gradients in potentials correspond to [[Field (physics)|physical field]]s, it makes no difference if a constant is added on (it is erased by the gradient operator {{math|&amp;nabla;}} which includes [[partial differentiation]]). This means there is no way to tell what the "absolute value" of the potential "is" – the zero value of potential is completely arbitrary and can be chosen anywhere by convenience (even "at infinity"). This idea also applies to vector potentials, and is exploited in [[classical field theory]] and also [[gauge field theory]].

Absolute values of potentials are not physically observable, only gradients and path-dependent potential differences are. However, the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]] is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect which illustrates that non-zero [[electromagnetic potential]]s along a closed loop (even when the {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} fields are zero everywhere in the region) lead to changes in the phase of the [[wave function]] of an electrically [[charged particle]] in the region, so the potentials appear to have measurable significance.

==Potential theory==

[[Field equation]]s, such as Gauss's laws [[Gauss's law|for electricity]], [[Gauss's law for magnetism|for magnetism]], and [[Gauss's law for gravity|for gravity]], can be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}= X \rho&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ρ''}} is the electric [[charge density]], [[magnetic monopole|monopole]] density (should they exist), or [[mass density]] and {{math|''X''}} is a constant (in terms of [[physical constant]]s [[Gravitational constant|{{math|''G''}}]], [[Vacuum permittivity|{{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], [[Vacuum permeability|{{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}]] and other numerical factors).

Scalar potential gradients lead to [[Poisson's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot (\nabla\phi)= X \rho \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nabla^2 \phi = X \rho&lt;/math&gt;

A general [[potential theory|theory of potentials]] has been developed to solve this equation for the potential. The gradient of that solution gives the physical field, solving the field equation.

'''Rape by gender''' classifies types of [[rape]] by the [[sex or gender]] of both the rapist and the victim. This scope includes both rape and [[sexual assault]] more generally. Most research indicates that rape affects women disproportionately, with the majority of people convicted being men; however, since the broadening of the definition of rape in 2012 by the [[FBI]], more attention is being given to [[male rape]], including females raping males.

Since only a small percentage of acts of [[sexual violence]] are brought to the attention of the authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=26309&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=675|title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=UN Secretary General's Database on Violence Against Women|date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182537/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=26309&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=675|archivedate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rds.homeoffice.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110314171826/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-14 |title=A gap or a chasm?

In a 2000 research article from the [[Home Office]], in England and Wales, around 1 in 20 women (5%) said that they had been raped at some point in their life from the age of 16 beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r159.pdf Rape and sexual assault of women: findings from the British Crime Survey].

In 2011, the US  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that "nearly 20% of all women" in the [[United States]] suffered attempted rape or rape sometime in their life. More than a third of the victims were raped before the age of 18.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite news|title=Nearly 20% of women in the US are raped or suffer attempted rape at some point in their lives, a US study says.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16192494|accessdate=15 December 2011|newspaper=BBC World|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NISVS2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf | title=National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010 Summary Report | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape of females by males===

Many rapes by males against females are unreported because of "fear of reprisal from the assailant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimevictimservices.org/page/sexassault/76 |title=(CVS) |publisher=Crime Victim Services |accessdate=2013-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615195527/http://www.crimevictimservices.org/page/sexassault/76 |archivedate=2013-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of "shame...and deep-seated cultural notions that the woman is somehow to blame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/studyg/rape.html |title=Rape and Sexual Assault |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the University of Surrey estimate that approximately 1 in 7 rapes by males against females are reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/mediacentre/press/2009/16532_between_7090_rapes_thought_to_go_unreported_and_94_of_reported_cases_dont_end_in_a_conviction.htm |title=Between 70-90% rapes thought to go unreported …and 94% of reported cases don’t end in a conviction - University of Surrey - Guildford |publisher=Surrey.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy [[Pregnancy from rape|may result from rape]]. The rate varies between settings and depends particularly on the extent to which [[non-barrier contraceptives]] are being used.

A 2005 survey by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault (CALCASA) concluded that one in three lesbian-identified participants had been sexually assaulted by a woman.

A CDC study found that, in the US, 1 in 71 men had been raped or suffered an attempt within their lifetime. The same study found that approximately 1 in 21 or 4.8% men in a survey had been made to penetrate someone else, usually an intimate partner or acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Black, M.C., Basile, K.C., Breiding, M.J., Smith, S.G., Walters, M.L., Merrick, M.T., Chen, J., &amp; Stevens, M.R.

Male sexual assault is also prevalent on US college campuses. On US campuses, 1 in 16 men are survivors of sexual assault.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although the rate of male sexual assault is relatively high, many do not file reports due to the misconception of sexual assault being a women’s issue due to “preconceived notions about both sexual violence and gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jmm.sagepub.com/content/12/3/275.full.pdf+html|title=Sign In|website=jmm.sagepub.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some cases when men will speak up about being a survivor, such as in the documentary ''[[The Hunting Ground]],'' which is about the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses in the US and the failure of college administration to adequately deal with it.

===Rape of males by males===
Rape by males against males has been heavily [[Social stigma|stigmatized]]. According to psychologist Dr. Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims reported a lack of services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male rape victims left to suffer in silence|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s244535.htm|date=February 9, 2001|accessdate=2007-05-30|publisher=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies argue that male-male [[Prison rape|prisoner rape]], as well as female-female prisoner rape, are common types of rape which go unreported even more frequently than rape in the general population.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] [https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report7.html#_1_48 No Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons.

Male victims of sexual abuse by females&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1023/A:1022456626538| title=Men's Reports of Nonconsensual Sexual Interactions with Women: Prevalence and Impact| author=Barbara Krahé|author2=Renate Scheinberger-Olwig |author3=Steffen Bieneck | journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior| volume=32| issue=5| year=2003| pages=165–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; often face social, political, and legal [[double standard]]s.&lt;ref name="Denov"&gt;{{cite book|author=Myriam S. Denov|title=Perspectives on female sex offending: a culture of denial|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3565-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases in the United States have received increased attention and sparked awareness within the population. Sometimes referred to as "made to penetrate" cases (by the CDC and the NISVS), male rape victims are forced to engage in penetration of the female without proper consent. In many cases, the male victims are [[drug facilitated sexual assault|under the influence of drugs]] or being held in life-threatening positions. The case of Cierra Ross'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/06/cierra-ross-charged-raping-man_n_3882608.html Cierra Ross, Chicago Mom, Charged With Raping Man At Gunpoint], Huffington Post, September 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; sexual assault of a man in Chicago gained national headlines and Ross was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and armed robbery with a bail set at $75,000. A similar case includes James Landrith, who was made to penetrate a female acquaintance in a hotel room while incapacitated from drinking, along with his rapist citing the fact that she was pregnant to advise him not to struggle, as this might hurt the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/09/living/chris-brown-female-on-male-rape/ |title=Against his will: The reality of male rape |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2014-01-11 |date=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landrith|first1=James A.|title=I've Got the T-Shirt and the Trauma Response to Go With It|url=https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/ive-got-the-t-shirt-and-the-trauma-response-to-go-with-it/|website=The Good Men Project|date=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the 1970s [[Mormon sex in chains case]] brought increased awareness of the possibility of female-on-male rape. A young [[Mormon missionary]] named Kirk Anderson went missing in 1977, in [[Ewell]], [[Surrey]], after being abducted from the steps of a church [[meetinghouse]].&lt;ref name=ECBC&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture |first= Fatima |last= Fernandes |article= Sex scandals |editor= Peter Childs and Mike Storry |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp;amp; Francis]] |isbn= 978-0-415-14726-2 |pp=489}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Anderson made a report to the police that he had been abducted and imprisoned against his will. He said that while chained to a bed, Joyce Bernann McKinney attempted to seduce him, and then raped him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_10152074 |title= Cloned-dog owner is '70s fugitive |first= Jennifer |last= Dobner |newspaper= [[The Denver Post]] |agency= ([[Associated Press|AP]]) |date= 2008-08-10 |accessdate= 2014-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bone2008&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4481742.ece |title= Missing years in Bernann McKinney's strange journey from Mormon sex case to clones called Booger |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]] |date= 2008-08-08 |last1= Bone |first1= James |first2= Dominic |last2= Kennedy |accessdate= 2009-02-22 |place= London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StPetersburgTimes1&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[St. Petersburg Times]] |date= 2008-08-13 |page= A1 |title= Corrections }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SacramentoBee1&gt;{{cite news |title= Setting it straight|date=2008-08-13 |page= A2 |newspaper= [[The Sacramento Bee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/i-dress-my-dog-in-a-pumpkin-costume---is-that-a-gateway-to-madness/article1349792/ |title= I dress my dog in a pumpkin costume - is that a gateway to madness? |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |first= Rebecca |last= Dube |date= August 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; News coverage was extensive, in part because the case was considered so anomalous, having involved the rape of a man by a woman.&lt;ref name=Delano1978&gt;{{cite book |last= Delano |first= Anthony |year= 1978 |title= Joyce McKinney and the Manacled Mormon |place= London |publisher= Mirror Books |isbn= 085939140X |oclc= 4525404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinney fled to the US, extradition was not pursued by Britain, and the English court sentenced McKinney ''in absentia'' to a year in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/columnists/2008/01/29/a-mormon-a-beauty-queen-and-manacles-91466-20404168/|title=A Mormon, a beauty queen and manacles...|work=[[South Wales Echo]]|date=2008-01-29|last=O'Neill|first=Dan|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the then-[[Sexual Offences Act 1956]], due to the victim's gender, technically no crime of rape was committed, though indecent assault of a man applied.&lt;ref name=OPSI1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1956/cukpga_19560069_en_2|title=Sexual Offences Act 1956 (c.69), section Intercourse by force, intimidation, etc|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some male victims, including [[Hermesmann v. Seyer|underage children]], have been forced to pay child-support to their attacker when their rapist conceives a baby as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/06/us/court-tells-youth-to-support-child-he-fathered-at-age-13.html | title=Court Tells Youth to Support Child He Fathered at Age 13 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2016-03-20 |date=1993-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/male-statutory-rape-victim-nick-olivas-must-pay-child-support-2014-9 | title=Arizona Is Requiring A Male Statutory Rape Victim To Pay Child Support | publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=2016-03-20 |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-22/features/9612220045_1_pay-child-support-child-support-behalf |title=Statutory Rape Victim Ordered To Pay Child Support |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2016-03-20 |date=1996-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several widely publicized cases of female-on-male [[statutory rape]] in the United States involved school teachers engaging in sexual intercourse with their underage students. Each of the 50 states has laws regarding the [[age of consent]], but all have it set at 16, 17 or 18. These laws make any sexual encounters between adults and minors under the age of consent sexual assault (see [[Mary Kay Letourneau]] and [[Debra Lafave]]).

==Career==
Egan qualified as a solicitor in 1990&lt;ref name="LawSociety"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/person/11192/richard-william-egan|title=The Law Society: Richard William Egan |date=20 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined [[Tuckers Solicitors]], [[law firm]] based in [[London]], where he became a partner in 2001.&lt;ref name="TuckersSolicitors02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.tuckerssolicitors.com/staff/richard-egan/|title=Tuckers Solcitors: Richard Egan |date=20 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work is focused mainly on criminal defense.&lt;ref name="TuckersSolicitors02"/&gt;

==Experience==
Egan is a member of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association and Association of Military Court Advocates and Justice.&lt;ref name="TuckersSolicitors02"/&gt; He has gathered local attention in [[London]] for his aggressive defense style and was one of those who contended that solicitor advocates should be entitled to wear the same wig and gown in court as [[barrister]]s.&lt;ref name="DailyMail01"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2844868/How-army-meaning-meddlers-drove-troubled-mother-kill-three-children-Court-papers-reveal-unbearable-pressure-Tania-Clarence.html|title=Richard Egan, reading from a statement outside the Old Bailey |date=20 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable cases===
Egan's work has included acting for:
* [[Lotfi Raissi]], Algerian pilot who allegedly instructed four of the hijackers who crashed the plane into the Pentagon on [[September 11]]. The prosecution case was that Raissi qualified in the [[United States]] as a pilot in 1997, attending the same Arizona flight school as four of the hijackers involved in the attacks September 11.&lt;ref name="Telegraph01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Logica pair plead guilty to insider dealing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1363691/Arab-pilot-seeks-bail-as-FBI-asks-for-time.html| accessdate=20 August 2017 |publisher=Telegraph|date=20 August 2017|ref=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raissi was acquitted after trial.&lt;ref name="theguardian03"&gt;{{cite news|title='Hound of Hounslow' trader Navinder Singh Sarao hires legal experts ahead of US extradition fight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/22/lotfi-raissi-algerian-pilot-case| accessdate=20 August 2017 |date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Risus: The Anything RPG''''' is a rules-light generic [[role-playing game]] (RPG) written, designed and illustrated by [[S. John Ross (game designer)|S. John Ross]] of Cumberland Games and Diversions.&lt;ref name="gamegrene"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamegrene.com/node/113|title=The Homebrew Review, #2: Risus| year = 2001| publisher=Gamegrene.com|accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGnet"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_4955.html| title=Risus: The Anything RPG (review)| last = Bullock| first = Larry| year = 2001| publisher=[[RPGnet]]|accessdate=2003-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PnP"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&amp;creatorid=1019| title=S.

It was first published online in 1993. Earlier versions of the game were titled '''''GUCS: The Generic Universal Comedy System''''' (a parody of ''[[GURPS]]'') and were distributed privately beginning in 1989.

== History ==
''Risus'' ([[Latin]] for “laughter”) is a comedy game&lt;ref name="RPGnet"/&gt; (often described by its creator as a "joke game") and uses a cliché (character class) system&lt;ref name="gamegrene"/&gt; inspired by the broad "career scale" skills in [[Greg Gorden]]'s ''[[DC Heroes|DC Heroes RPG]]'' ([[Mayfair Games]]), and later influenced by [[Atlas Games]]' ''[[Over the Edge (role-playing game)|Over the Edge]]''. The core systems of ''Risus'' owe their largest debt to the ''[[Ghostbusters (role-playing game)| Ghostbusters RPG]]'' published by [[West End Games]], and to ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'' by [[Ken St. Andre]]. The game itself also cites ''[[GURPS]]'' as an influence, along with ''[[FUDGE]]'', another free RPG released to the web a year earlier. Several more recent games have been, in turn, influenced by ''Risus.''

Despite the game's small size and admittedly joking nature, there are more than 30 fan-authored websites devoted to ''Risus,'' some including several rules variants, simple worldbooks, and wholly rewritten adaptations of the game. ''Risus'' itself has been translated into Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="cumb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm| title=Risus: The Anything RPG homepage |accessdate=2003-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 2003, Cumberland Games began to support the free game with commercial supplements, beginning with the ''Risus Companion'' and the founding of the International Order of Risus.  An example of another commercial product is ''A Kringle in Time'', "an adventure about saving Christmas from ancient evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ogrecave.com/reviews/kringle.shtml| title= A Kringle in Time (review)|last=Katz|first=Demian| publisher=www.ogrecave.com|accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New Risus'' won the 2001 inaugural [[RPGnet]] award for ''Best Free RPG''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/awards05dec01.html| title=RPGnet 2001 Award Results| publisher= [[RPGnet]] |accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Risus Companion''==

''The Risus Companion'' is the first commercial supplement of ''Risus''. S. John Ross wrote and published&lt;ref name="PnP" /&gt; the ''Risus Companion'' on the 10th anniversary of ''Risus'' on the [[World Wide Web]], in order to provide a foundation for ''Risus'' as a commercial venture. ''Risus'' itself remains free of charge, allowing ''Risus'' fans the option to support ''Risus'' if they choose and be materially rewarded for doing so. The ''Risus Companion'' is an electronic document in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] form, made available to all members of the International Order of Risus.

==International Order of Risus==

The '''International Order of Risus''' is the official fan club of ''Risus''. The Order is, according to their own charter, dedicated to promoting ''Risus'' and to "imposing our iron will upon an unsuspecting universe."

'''Samatva''' ([[Sanskrit]]: समत्व, also rendered ''samatvam'' or ''samata'') is the Hindu concept of [[equanimity]].&lt;ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', [[Georg Feuerstein]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its root is ''sama'' (सम) meaning – equal or even.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Reader 2|author=Heiko Kretschmer|page=353|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XFe5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA353&amp;dq=samatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=if8HVYD3J5HhuQTwxoKYAw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=samatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Sāmya'' - meaning equal consideration towards all human beings - is a variant of the word.
==Description==
''Samatva'' occupies a high place in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' where it means even-mindedness or what would be called in English ''[[equanimity]]''. [[Krishna]] in the context of metaphysical knowledge refers to equanimity when he tells [[Arjuna]] that all feelings are transitory and fleeting, तांस्तितिक्षस्व therefore ignore them  for they have to be endured (II.14) and that the wise are न व्यथयन्ति not tormented  by these feelings (II.15). He once again refers to even-mindedness in the context of ''svadharma'' when Arjuna is told not to waver in the performance of his duty or shirk his duty, and to treat alike victory and defeat, gain and loss etc., for then he will not incur sin (II.31-38). Therefore, Arjuna is told  –

: योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्ंग त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय |
: सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ||

: "Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga." – [[Bhagavad Gita]] (II.48)

This ''[[Śloka|sloka]]'' delineates the process of practicing [[Karma yoga]] which is a part of human nature and promotes tranquility. Man reaches the ultimate state of unshakable stability through the constant practice of indifference to success and failure of actions. Action with selfish motive does not result in even-mindedness. In the context of Karma yoga, Krishna tells Arjuna that the sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision (समदर्शिनः) all beings of all castes and creed because the Atman is present in all bodies without any distinction (V.18), and affirms that – इहैव तैर्जितः सर्गो येषां साम्ये स्थितं मनः that those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death to be established in the Eternal (V.19). And, that –

: आत्मौपम्येन सर्वत्र समंपश्यति योऽर्जुन |
: सुखं वा यदि वा दुःखं स योगी परमो मतः ||

: "He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, in both, their happiness and their distress, O Arjuna."  -  [[Bhagavad Gita]] (VI.32)

Then for that yogi there remains nothing in this world which has a separate identity from him, and no pain whatsoever; conscious of all such experiences but not affected by them he works for the uplift of others. Thus, Krishna harmonizes ''Śreyas'' (personal salvation) and ''Lokasamgraha'' (good of the society) by linking ''Śreyas'' with 'even-mindedness' and ''Lokasamgrah'' with 'equal vision'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Message of the Gita|author=Satya P.

[[Chinmayananda Saraswati|Swami Chinmayananda]] while commenting on [[Isha Upanishad]] (6), which speaks about the wise man beholding all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, gives the meaning of ''samatva'' as – the sameness of mind, inward tranquillity. The phrase 'All Beings' refers to the highest cosmic manifestation, and the phrase 'the Self in all beings' refers to Pure Consciousness, the inmost [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of all embodied souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isavasya Upanishad|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=104|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-4LVKbEi7JgC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=samatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gP0HVdifGIyeuQTd6oHoBw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=samatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of ''Niśkāmakarma'' or the ideal of desire-less and motiveless action, does not bind the yogi to act’s consequences at the individual level; the yogi stays contented and even indifferent towards those very consequences; he knows that actions are not to be renounced, the fruits of actions alone are to be renounced. Once repulsion and action are removed what remains is "''samatva''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Karma|author=Shrinivas Tilak|publisher=Centre for Cultural Studies|page=131|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1xXDHLlNYIC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=samatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gP0HVdifGIyeuQTd6oHoBw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=samatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of [[Jainism]] consider the practice of ''samtava'' as ''[[Sādhanā]]'' because it is real human nature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prakrit Jain Institute Research Bulletin 3|page=42|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xd5jAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=samatva&amp;dq=samatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gP0HVdifGIyeuQTd6oHoBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA }}&lt;/ref&gt; they do not view ''samtava'' and ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' as two varied aspects, according to them these two are interdependent, steadiness of the mind is reached by thinking about ''maitri'' (universal friendship), ''pramoda'' (emphasizing goodness), ''karuna'' (universal compassion) and ''madhyastha'' (indifference to sin of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=F2IgY5FTrgoC&amp;pg=PT353&amp;dq=samatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gP0HVdifGIyeuQTd6oHoBw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=samatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahavira]] had told Gautama that the nature of the soul is equanimity (''Bhagavatisutra'' (9.386). Therefore, one who has ''samatva'' as his essential nature is called ''samayasāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian Perspective on the World’s Religions|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=15|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2A0lg1xRehIC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=samatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=if8HVYD3J5HhuQTwxoKYAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=samatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gandhian aesthetics, ''samatva'', understood as unity, equality, equanimity, balance and harmony in different perspectives, is the very essence of 'Sarvodya ideology'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gandhian Aesthetics|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=97|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dstUBU3bo4gC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=samatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fwAIVZS3OI7JuATIyID4BA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=samatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7332">Self-evaluation is the process by which the self-concept is socially negotiated and modified. It is a scientific and cultural truism that self-evaluation is motivated. Motives influence the ways in which people select self-relevant information, gauge its veracity, draw inferences about themselves, and make plans for the future. Empirically-oriented psychologists have identified and investigated Three cardinal self-evaluation motives (or self-motives) relevant to the development, maintenance, and modification of self-views.
These are [[self-enhancement]], [[self-assessment]] and [[self-verification]].

==Types==

===Self-Enhancement===
{{main|Self-enhancement}}
The ''[[self-enhancement]] motive'' is the motive to improve the [[positivity effect|positivity]] of one's [[self-concept]], and to protect the [[self]] from negative information (we search for positivity and avoid [[negativity effect|negativity]]). This motive influences people's self-evaluations.&lt;ref name="dsss" /&gt;

For instance, people process information important to the self in a selective manner, focusing on information that has favourable implications to the self and discarding information with unfavourable implications. People also choose to compare themselves socially to others so as to be placed in a favourable position.&lt;ref name="multiply" /&gt; By doing this, people seek to boost the (self-evaluated) positivity of themselves or to decrease its negativity, hence increasing their levels of [[self-esteem]] with the aim of having others see them as more socially desirable.&lt;ref  name="thineownself" /&gt;

===Self-Assessment===
{{main|Self-assessment}}
The ''[[self-assessment]] motive'' is based on the assumption that people want to have an accurate and objective evaluation of the self.&lt;ref name="thineownself"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedikides|first1=C|last2=Strube|first2=M|title=Self-Evaluation: To Thine Own Self Be Good, To Thine Own Self Be Sure, To Thine Own Self Be True, and To Thine Own Self be Better|volume=29|year=1997|pages=209–269|issn=0065-2601|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this goal, they work so as to reduce any uncertainty about their abilities or [[trait theory|personality traits]].&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;Sedikides, C. (1993). Assessment, enhancement, and verification determinants of the self-evaluation process. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''65''', (2), 327–338.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feedback]] is sought to increase the accuracy and objectivity of previously formed self-conceptions. This is regardless of whether the new information confirms or challenges the previously existing self-conceptions.&lt;ref name="dsss" /&gt;

===Self-Verification===
{{main|Self-verification}}
The ''[[self-verification]] motive'' asserts that what motivates people to engage in the self-evaluation process is the desire to verify their pre-existing self-conceptions,&lt;ref name="assessment"/&gt; maintaining consistency between their previously formed self-conceptions and any new information that could be important to the self (feedback)&lt;ref name="thineownself"/&gt; By doing this, people get the sense of control and predictability in the social world.&lt;ref name="dsss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In some of the literature, other motives appeared, namely the self-improvement motive, but they are not mentioned in this articles due to a lack of consensus about their existence.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==

===Self-Enhancement===
The ''self-enhancement motive'' states that people want to see themselves favourably. It follows that people should choose tasks with a positive [[valence (psychology)|valence]], regardless of [[diagnosticity|task diagnosticity]] (this motive is more active in presence of tasks high in diagnosticity of success than in presence of tasks high in diagnosticity of failure).&lt;ref name="multiply"&gt;Sedikides, C. and Strube, M. J. (1995). The multiply motivated self. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', '''21''', 1330–1335.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks that disclosure a failure and negative feedback are considered less important than tasks with an outcome of success or positive feedback. As a result, the former are processed faster and more thoroughly, and remembered better than the latter.&lt;ref  name="thineownself"/&gt;

Each [[motivation|motive]] originated a different type of reaction (cognitive, affective or behavioural). The self-enhancement motive creates both affective and cognitive responses. Affective responses result in negative feedback leading to less positive affect then positive affect. This is moderated by trait modifiability, in the sense that we can find the former event to be especially true for unmodifiable traits. On the other hand, cognitive responses lead to favourable feedback being judged as more accurate, but only in the case of modifiable traits.&lt;ref name="dsss" /&gt;

===Self-Assessment===
The ''self-assessment motive'' postulates that people want to have an accurate view of their abilities and [[trait theory|personality traits]]. Hence, when evaluating the self people tend to preferably choose tasks that are high in [[diagnosticity]] (people want to find out about their uncertain self-conceptions). This is found even when the diagnosis leads to a disclosure of failure (i.e., regardless of task valence).

The responses generated by the self-assessment motive are behavioural responses, which becomes evident by the fact that people choose to receive feedback on their performance (they prefer tasks for which feedback is available,  opposed to tasks with unavailable feedback). This pattern is emphasized when the trait is considered to be modifiable.&lt;ref name="dsss" /&gt;

===Self-Verification===
The ''self-verification motive'' asserts that people want to verify their previously existing beliefs about the self. No preference regarding the task valence is apparent. Regarding task diagnosticity, people seek knowledge about their certain self-conceptions to a greater extent than they do for their uncertain self-conceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F. (ed.). (1999). ''The self in social psychology''. Philadelphia: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive responses guide the self-verification motive partially depending on their previously formed self-concept. That is, when a certain trait is present, positive feedback regarding this trait is judged to be more accurate than unfavourable feedback; but when in the presence of the alternative trait, there isn’t any difference in the judgement of the feedback accuracy. However, this pattern is conditional on perceived trait modifiability.&lt;ref name="dsss"&gt;Dauenbeimer, D. G., Stablberg, D., Spreemann, S., and Sedikides, C. (2002). Self-enhancement, self-verification, or self-assessment: the intricate role of trait modifiability in the self-evaluation process. ''Revue internationale de psychologie sociale'', '''15''', (3-4), 89-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-verification motive resulted in cognitive responses to traits considered to be unmodifiable, but not to traits considered modifiable. In the former, positive feedback is considered more accurate than negative feedback, when in the presence of the trait. On the other hand, negative feedback is viewed as more accurate than positive feedback in the presence of the alternative trait.&lt;ref name="dsss" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">A '''serious case review''' (SCR) in England is held after a child or vulnerable adult dies or is seriously injured under circumstances where abuse or neglect are thought to have been involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-protection-system/england/serious-case-reviews/ |title=Child protection in England - Serious case reviews|newspaper= |date=2015  |author=NSPCC |accessdate= 29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to learn lessons to help prevent future similar incidents. Similar procedures in other countries of the UK are called child practice reviews in Wales, case management reviews in [[Northern Ireland]], and significant case reviews in Scotland. An SCR should be held if abuse or neglect is suspected to have been involved, a child has died or been seriously harmed and if there are concerns about the way organisations or professionals worked together to safeguard the child.

==Procedure==
The [[Local Safeguarding Children Board]]s (LSCB) follow [[Statute|statutory]] guidance &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/419595/Working_Together_to_Safeguard_Children.pdf Working together to safeguard children: a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, Department for Education (DfE), HM Government, London, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; for conducting a serious case review in which the different professionals and organisations  involved and the family are represented. The SCR should be completed within six months.

An SCR may also be commissioned following the death or injury of a vulnerable adult. For example, in 2010 [[Warwickshire County Council]] commissioned an SCR following the death of 27-year old Gemma Hayter, because "a vulnerable adult had died and abuse or neglect is known or
suspected to be a factor in the death; and the case gives rise to concerns about the way in which local professionals and/or services work together to safeguard vulnerable adults".&lt;ref&gt;Warwickshire Safeguarding Adults Partnership, [http://apps.warwickshire.gov.uk/api/documents/WCCC-779-97 Serious Care Review: the Murder of Gemma Hayter], accessed 4 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17372">The '''social construction theory of ADHD''' argues that [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is not necessarily an actual [[pathology]], but that an ADHD [[diagnosis]] is a [[socially constructed]] explanation to describe behaviors that simply do not meet prescribed [[social norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parens E, Johnston J |title=Facts, values, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): an update on the controversies |journal=Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1|year=2009 |pmid=19152690|pmc=2637252 |doi=10.1186/1753-2000-3-1 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of the social construct theory of ADHD seem to regard the disorder as genuine, though over-diagnosed in some cultures. These proponents cite as evidence that the [[DSM IV]], favored in the United States for defining and diagnosing mental illness, arrives at levels of ADHD three to four times higher than criteria in the [[ICD 10]], the diagnostic guide favored by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="Singh I 2008 957–64"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh I |title=Beyond polemics: science and ethics of ADHD |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=957–64 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19020513 |doi=10.1038/nrn2514 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular proponent of this theory, [[Thomas Szasz]], has argued that ADHD was "invented and not discovered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chriss, James J.|title=Social control: an introduction |publisher=Polity |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |page=230 |isbn=0-7456-3858-9 |oclc=|doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Szasz, Thomas Stephen |title=Pharmacracy: medicine and politics in America |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |year=2001 |page=212|isbn=0-275-97196-1 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ADHD as a social construct==

Psychiatrists [[Peter Breggin]] and Sami Timimi oppose pathologizing the symptoms of ADHD. [[Sami Timimi]], who is an [[National Health Service|NHS]] child and adolescent psychiatrist, argues that ADHD is not an objective 'disorder'&lt;ref name=TimimiTaylor2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Timimi |first1=Sami |last2=Taylor |first2=Eric |date=January 2004 |title=In Debate: ADHD is best understood as a cultural construct |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=184 |issue=1 |pages=8–9 |doi=10.1192/bjp.184.1.8 |pmid=14702221 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/184/1/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that western society creates stress on families which in turn suggests environmental causes for children expressing the symptoms of ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;Timimi, S. &amp; Begum, M. (2006). Critical Voices in Child and Adolescent Mental Health. London: [[Free Association Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that parents who feel they have failed in their parenting responsibilities can use the ADHD label to absolve [[culpability|guilt]] and [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]].

A common argument against the medical model of ADHD asserts that while the traits that define ADHD exist and may be measurable, they lie within the spectrum of normal healthy human behaviour and are not dysfunctional. However, by definition, in order to diagnose with a mental disorder, symptoms must be interpreted as causing a person distress / espec. maladaptive.  In America, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) requires that "some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings" and that "there must be clear evidence of significant impairment in social, school, or work functioning" for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=7721{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this view, in societies where passivity and order are highly valued, those on the active end of the active-passive spectrum may be seen as 'problems'. Medically defining their behaviour (by giving labels such as ADHD and ADD) serves the purpose of removing blame from those 'causing the problem'. Controversy over the social constructionist view comes from a number of studies that cite significant psychological and social differences between those diagnosed with the disorder, and those who are not. However, the specific reasons for these differences are not certain, and this does not suggest anything other than a difference in behavior. Studies have also shown [[neurological]] differences, but whether this signifies an effect rather than a cause is unknown. Such differences could also be attributed the drugs commonly prescribed to people with this disorder. Studies have also been able to differentiate ADHD from other psychiatric disorders in its symptoms, associated features, 
life course, and comorbidity.&lt;ref name=TimimiTaylor2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Taylor E. |author2=Chadwick O. |author3=Heptinstall E. | year = 1996 | title = Hyperactivity and conduct problems as risk factors for adolescent development | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 1213–1226 | doi = 10.1097/00004583-199609000-00019 | pmid = 8824065 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E., Sandberg, S., Thorley, G., et al.

Gerald Coles, an educational psychologist and formerly an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the University of Rochester who has written extensively on literacy and learning disabilities, asserts that there are partisan agendas behind the educational policy-makers and that the scientific research that they use to support their arguments regarding the teaching of literacy are flawed. These include the idea that there are neurological explanations for learning disabilities. Gerald Coles argues that school failure must be viewed and treated in the context of both the learning environment and the child's individual abilities, behavior, family life, and social relationships. He then presents a new model of learning problems, in which family and school environments are the major determinants of academic success. In this "interactive" paradigm, the attitudes and methods of education are more important than inherent strengths or deficits of the individual child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gerald |last1=Coles |date=15 January 1989 |title=The Learning Mystique: A Critical Look at "Learning Disabilities" |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0449903513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

===Questioning the pathophysiological and genetic basis of ADHD===
{{Dablink|See also: [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Cause|Causes]]{{·}} [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]{{·}} [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies#ADHD as a biological illness|ADHD as a biological illness]]}}
Some social constructionist theories of ADHD reject the dominant medical opinion that ADHD has a distinct pathophysiology and genetic components.  The 'symptoms' of ADHD also happen to be morally questionable attributes, this is why the symptoms are described as 'inappropriate'.  Many social constructionists trenchantly question deterministic views of behaviour, such as those views sometimes put forth within behavioural/abnormal psychology and the biological sciences.

Currently, the [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology|pathophysiology]] of ADHD is unclear; although research has found evidence of differences in the brain between ADHD and non-ADHD patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/brain-matures-a-few-years-late-in-adhd-but-follows-normal-pattern.shtml Brain Matures a Few Years Late in ADHD, But Follows Normal Pattern] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523083043/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/brain-matures-a-few-years-late-in-adhd-but-follows-normal-pattern.shtml |date=2009-05-23 }} NIMH Press Release, November 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lou HC, Andresen J, Steinberg B, McLaughlin T, Friberg L |date=Jan 1998 | title = The striatum in a putative cerebral network activated by verbal awareness in normals and in ADHD children | url = | journal = Eur J Neurol | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 67–74 | doi = 10.1046/j.1468-1331.1998.510067.x | pmid = 10210814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/gene-predicts-better-outcome-as-cortex-normalizes-in-teens-with-adhd.shtml Gene Predicts Better Outcome as Cortex Normalizes in Teens with ADHD] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523083322/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/gene-predicts-better-outcome-as-cortex-normalizes-in-teens-with-adhd.shtml |date=2009-05-23 }} NIMH Press Release, August 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dougherty DD, Bonab AA, Spencer TJ, Rauch SL, Madras BK, Fischman AJ |title=Dopamine transporter density in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9196 |pages=2132––33 |year=1999 |pmid=10609822 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dresel SH, Kung MP, Plössl K, Meegalla SK, Kung HF |title=Pharmacological effects of dopaminergic drugs on in vivo binding of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 to the central dopamine transporters in rats |journal=European journal of nuclear medicine |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=31–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9396872 |doi=10.1007/s002590050191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17113158"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coccaro EF, Hirsch SL, Stein MA |title=Plasma homovanillic acid correlates inversely with history of learning problems in healthy volunteer and personality disordered subjects |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=149 |issue=1–3 |pages=297–302 |year=2007 |pmid=17113158 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, such as Jonathan Leo and David Cohen who reject the characterization of ADHD as a disorder, contend that the controls for stimulant medication usage were inadequate in some lobar volumetric studies which makes it impossible to determine whether ADHD itself or [[psychotropic]] medication used to treat ADHD is responsible for decreased thickness observed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Philip |last2=Lerch |first2=Jason |last3=Greenstein |first3=Deanna |last4=Sharp |first4=Wendy |last5=Clasen |first5=Liv |last6=Evans |first6=Alan |last7=Giedd |first7=Jay |last8=Castellanos |first8=F.

From a biological/genetic point of view, ADHD is said to be highly heritable and twin studies suggest genetics are a factor in about 75% of ADHD cases,.&lt;ref name="Barkley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.continuingedcourses.net/active/courses/course003.php|title=Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Nature, Course, Outcomes, and Comorbidity|last=Barkley|first=Russel A.|accessdate=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the genetic connection is questionable. Dr. Joseph Glenmullen states, "no claim of a gene for a psychiatric condition has stood the test of time, in spite of popular misinformation. Although many theories exist, there is no definitive biological, neurological, or genetic [[etiology]] for 'mental illness'."&lt;ref&gt;Glenmullin, Joseph (2000). Prozac Backlash. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 192-198&lt;/ref&gt;  His critics argue that  ADHD is a [[Heterogeneous#Locus .28Non-allelic.29 Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] disorder&lt;ref name="Barkley"/&gt; caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors and thus cannot be modeled accurately using the single gene theory. Authors of a review of ADHD etiology have noted: "Although several genome-wide searches have identified chromosomal regions that are predicted to contain genes that contribute to ADHD susceptibility, to date no single gene with a major contribution to ADHD has been identified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

===Sudbury model of democratic education schools' alternative===
Describing current instructional methods as [[wikt:homogenization|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the  [[Sudbury school]]s' [[democratic education]] approach in which children, by enjoying personal freedom thus encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions, learn at their own pace rather than following a chronologically-based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

Timimi's view has been seriously criticized by [[Russell Barkley]] and numerous experts in ''Child and Family Psychology Review'' (2005).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} In any case, it has been shown that Chinese and Indonesian clinicians give significantly higher scores for hyperactive-disruptive behaviors than did their Japanese and American colleagues when evaluating the same group of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=E.

The '''southeastern Iberian script''', also known as '''Meridional Iberian''', was one of the means of written expression of the [[Iberian language]], which was written mainly in the [[northeastern Iberian script]] and residually by the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]]. About the relation between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, it is necessary to point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs; however it is clear that they had a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script derives from southeastern Iberian script. In fact, the southeastern Iberian script is very similar, both considering the shape of the signs or their values, to the [[Southwest script|Southwestern script]] used to represent an unknown language usually named [[Tartessian language|Tartessian]]. The main difference is that southeastern Iberian script does not show the vocalic redundancy of the syllabic signs. Unlike the [[northeastern Iberian script]] the decipherment of the southeastern Iberian script is not yet complete, because there are a significant number of signs on which scholars have not yet reached a consensus. Although it is believed that the southeastern Iberian script does not show any system to differentiate between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] [[occlusive]]s, unlike the [[northeastern Iberian script]], a recent paper (Ferrer i Jané 2010) defends the existence of a dual system also in the southeastern Iberian script.

==Typology and variants==
All the [[paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic value for the [[occlusives]], and monophonemic value for the rest of the [[consonants]] and [[vowels]].  From the [[writing systems]] point of view they are neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]]; rather, they are mixed scripts that normally are identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. There is no agreement about how the [[paleohispanic scripts |paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]] originated; some researchers conclude that their origin is linked only to the [[Phoenician alphabet]], while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] exercised some influence.

==Location of findings==
The inscriptions that use the southeastern Iberian script had been found mainly in the southeastern quadrant of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]: eastern [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]], [[Albacete]], [[Alicante]], and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. The southeastern Iberian inscriptions were made on different object types ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], silver and [[ceramic]] recipients, [[lead]] plaques, stones, etc.), but they number around 50 and represent more or less only 2% of the total found. Between them there are the lead plaque from Gador ([[Almeria]]) and the lead plaque from La Bastida de les Alcuses ([[Moixent]], [[València]]). The inscriptions that use this script almost always use the right to left direction of writing. The oldest inscriptions in southeastern Iberian script date to the 4th century BCE, and the modern ones date from the end of the 2nd century BCE.

{{cquote|The relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied. Its objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time referred to by the datum is a very different thing from the conterminous of the past and future which philosophy denotes by the name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a part of the past—a recent past—delusively given as being a time that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named the specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the past, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time measured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively to human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past, the specious present, the real present, and the future. Omitting the specious present, it consists of three ... nonentities—the past, which does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their conterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to us in the fiction of the specious present.&lt;ref name="JamesW" /&gt;}}

The concept was further developed by [[philosopher]] [[William James]].&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  James defined the specious present to be "the prototype of all conceived times... the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible". [[C. D. Broad]] in "Scientific Thought" (1930) further elaborated on the concept of the specious present, and considered that the Specious Present may be considered as the temporal equivalent of a sensory datum.

Finally, the claim of what precisely is being affirmed, in affirming the 'existence' of the specious present, is difficult to clarify. Philosophical theories of time do not usually interpret time to be in any unique way a production of human phenomenology, and the claim that we have some faculty by which we are aware of successive states of consciousness is trivially true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience|title=The Experience and Perception of Time|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18019">'''Strangulation''' in the context of [[domestic violence]] is a potentially lethal form of [[assault]]. Unconsciousness may occur within seconds of strangulation and death within minutes. Strangulation can be difficult to detect and until recently{{when|date=December 2015}} was often not treated as a serious crime. However, in many jurisdictions strangulation is now a specific criminal offense, or an aggravating factor in assault cases.

==Differences from choking==

Although sometimes the words are used interchangeably, "strangulation" and "choking" are not the same thing. Choking is when air flow is blocked by food or a foreign object in the trachea – something that can be addressed by the [[Heimlich maneuver]]. Strangulation, by contrast, is defined by reduced air flow and/or blood flow to or from the brain via the intentional external compression of blood vessels or the airway in the neck.  Notably, however, many victims of strangulation refer to the assault as "choking".

Manual strangulation (i.e., gripping the throat with one’s hands) is the most common method of strangulation in intimate partner violence, although ligatures (e.g., belts, scarves) are sometimes used.

==Epidemiology==

A systematic review of 23 articles based on 11 surveys in 9 countries (N=74,785, about two-thirds of whom were women) found that 3.0% to 9.7% of women reported that they had at some time been strangled by an intimate partner.&lt;ref name="Sorenson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E | year = 2014 | title = A systematic review of the epidemiology of nonfatal strangulation, a human rights and health concern | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 104 | issue = 11| page = e54-e61 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302191 | pmid=25211747}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 0.4% to 2.4% – with 1.0% being typical – reported that they had experienced it in the past year, and women were between 2 times and 14 times more likely to be strangled by an intimate partner than were men.&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt;

The most recent national survey in the U.S. that asked about strangulation by an intimate partner asked 16,507 adults (55% of whom were women) if a partner had tried to hurt them by choking or suffocating them. A total of 9.7% responded that a partner had done so at some point in their lifetime; 0.9% reported that it had happened during the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Black MC, Basile KC, Breiding MJ., et al.

Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011. https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of strangulation appears to be decreasing in Canada, the only country with multiple cross-sectional surveys that measure strangulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=The elevated risk for violence against cohabiting women: A comparison of three nationally representative surveys of Canada |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=809–832 |doi=10.1177/1077801208320368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major study of surviving victims of strangulation assault found that 99% of the 300 victims in criminal cases involving "choking" were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Strack G, McClane G, Hawley D |title=A review of 300 attempted strangulation cases – Part I: Criminal legal issues |journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine |year=2001 |volume=21 |pages=303–309 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, a meta-analytic review of gender differences in physical aggression against a heterosexual partner concluded that ". ..'choke or strangle' is very clearly a male act, whether based on self- or partner reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Archer J |title=Sex differences in physically aggressive acts between heterosexual partners: a meta-analytic review |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=2000 |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=651–680 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 |pmid=10989615}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion was reached in a 2014 multi-nation review: "…women are more likely than men to report that they were strangled by an intimate partner."&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt;

A series of studies conducted in Canada found the same gender discrepancy and reported that strangulation by an intimate is more common among disabled persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Partner violence against women with disabilities: prevalence, risk, and explanations |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2006 |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=805–822 |doi=10.1177/1077801206292681}}&lt;/ref&gt; cohabiting (vs. married) persons,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Understanding women's heightened risk of violence in common-law unions: Revisiting the selection and relationship hypotheses |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2004 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=626–651 |doi=10.1177/1077801204265017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those in a step- (vs. biological) family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Male partner violence against women in stepfamilies: an analysis of risk and explanations in the Canadian milieu |journal=Violence Vict |year=2004 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=17–36| doi=10.1891/vivi.19.1.17.33239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who had been abused by an intimate partner reported higher rates of strangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Barrett BJ, St. Pierre M |title=Variations in women’s help seeking in response to intimate partner violence: findings from a Canadian population-based study |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=47–70 |doi=10.1177/1077801210394273 |pmid=21199809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Macmillan R, Gartner R |title=When she brings home the bacon: Labor-force participation and the risk of spousal violence against women |journal=J Marriage Fam |year=1999 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=947–958 |doi=10.2307/354015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangulation is sometimes fatal. According to a large U.S. case control study, prior strangulation is a substantial and unique predictor of attempted and completed homicide of women by a male intimate partner. The study showed that the odds of becoming an attempted homicide victim increased 7-fold and the odds of becoming a homicide victim increased 8-fold for women who had been strangled by their partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glass N, Laughon K, Campbell JC |title=Non-fatal strangulation is an important risk factor for homicide of women |journal=J Emerg Med |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=329–335 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2007.02.065|display-authors=etal|pmc=2573025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When over three dozen other characteristics of the victim, perpetrator, and incident were taken into account, however, strangulation no longer was a unique predictor.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Campbell JC, Webster D, Koziol-McLain J |title=Risk factors for femicide in abusive relationships: results from a multisite case control study |journal=Am J Public Health |year=2003 |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=1089–1097 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1089|display-authors=etal|pmc=1447915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strangulation is so common in battering (50% or more battered women report that they've been strangled) that it doesn't differentiate abuse in which the victim survives or dies.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

==Experience of strangulation==

Strangulation has been likened to drowning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Kristie A. | last2 = Joshi | first2 = Manisha | last3 = Sorenson | first3 = Susan B. | title = "Do you know what it feels like to drown?": strangulation as coercive control in intimate relationships | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 124–137 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0361684313488354 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0361684313488354 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&amp;context=spp_papers Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Home page |url=http://www.ortnercenter.org/ | website = ortnercenter.org | publisher = Evelyn Jacobs Ortner Center on Family Violence, University of Pennsylvania }}&lt;/ref&gt; have likened non- or near-fatal strangulation to water boarding,&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt; which is widely considered a form of torture.

A special issue of the ''Domestic Violence Report'' devoted to the crime of strangulation states: "Many domestic violence offenders and rapists do not strangle their partners to kill them; they strangle them to let them know they can kill them—any time they wish. Once victims know this truth, they live under the power and control of their abusers day in and day out."&lt;ref name="Domestic Violence Report"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Law reform targets the crime of strangulation |journal=Domestic Violence Report |date = August–September 2014 |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=81–100 |url=http://www.civicresearchinstitute.com/nfjca.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.civicresearchinstitute.com/pdfs/DVR1906.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

Strangulation can produce minor injuries, serious bodily injury, and death. Evidence of the assault can be difficult to detect because many victims may not have visible injuries and/or their symptoms may be nonspecific.

Victims may have internal injuries, such as laryngo-tracheal injuries, digestive tract injuries, vascular injuries, neurological system injuries and orthopedic injuries. Clinical symptoms of these internal injuries may include neck and sore-throat pain, voice changes (hoarse or raspy voice or the inability to speak), coughing, swallowing abnormalities, and changes in mental status, consciousness and behavior. Neurological symptoms may include vision changes, dimming, blurring, decrease of peripheral vision and seeing "stars" or "flashing lights."

==Laws==

For many years across the country, prosecutors have failed to treat non- and near-fatal strangulation assaults as serious crimes, largely due to the lack of physical evidence.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Because of involvement of the medical profession, specialized training for police and prosecutors, and ongoing research, strangulation has become a focus of policymakers and professionals working to reduce intimate partner violence and sexual assault..&lt;ref name="Robert Lee Bolton III, Strangulation as a Felony Offense: A New Penalty Under W.

==Improving detection and intervention==

Starting in 1995, the work of Gael Strack and Casey Gwinn in San Diego has helped identify and address challenges in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting strangulation and suffocation offenses in intimate partner violence, sexual assault, elder abuse, and child abuse cases.  In 2011, Strack and Gwinn created the Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention, the most comprehensive training program in the United States for the documentation, investigation, and prosecution of non and near-fatal strangulation assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention. |url=http://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have published multiple state-specific books to guide the investigation and prosecution of non and near-fatal strangulation assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Strack G, Gwinn C. |title=On the edge of a homicide: Strangulation as a prelude |journal=Criminal Justice |year=2011 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=32–36 |url=  https://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/file-library/on-the-edge-of-homicide-strangulation-as-a-prelude-strack-and-gwinn-2011-pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published appellate opinions have begun to proliferate across the United States as courts are upholding felony strangulation convictions even with minimal external visible injury to the victims.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The importance of multi-disciplinary responses by doctors, nurses, advocates, police officers, and prosecutors has become clear in properly identifying, treating, investigating, and prosecuting strangulation assaults.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

'''Supererogation''' ([[Latin|Late Latin]]: ''supererogatio'' "payment beyond what is due or asked", from ''super'' "beyond" and ''erogare'' "to pay out, expend", itself from ''ex'' "out" and ''rogare'' "to ask") is the performance of more than is asked for; the action of doing more than [[duty]] requires. In [[ethics]], an act is '''supererogatory''' if it is good but not morally required to be done. It refers to an act that is more than is necessary, when another course of action—involving less—would still be an acceptable action. It differs from a duty, which is an act wrong not to do, and from acts morally neutral. Supererogation may be considered as performing above and beyond a normative course of duty to further benefits and functionality.

==In Catholicism==
In the [[theology]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], "works of supererogation" (also called "acts of supererogation") are those performed beyond what God requires. For example, in [[1 Corinthians 7]], [[Paul the Apostle]] says that while everyone is free to marry, it is better to refrain from marriage and remain celibate to better serve God. The Roman Catholic Church holds that the [[counsels of perfection]] are supererogatory acts, which specific [[Christian]]s may engage in above their moral duties. Similarly, it teaches that to determine how to act, one must engage in reasonable efforts to be sure of what the right actions are; after the reasonable action, the person is in a state of [[vincible ignorance|invincible ignorance]] and guiltless of wrongdoing, but to undertake more than reasonable actions to overcome ignorance is supererogatory, and praiseworthy.

According to the classic teaching on [[indulgence]]s, the works of supererogation performed by all the saints form a treasure with God, the "[[treasury of merit,]]" which the church can apply to exempt [[repentance (Christianity)|repentant]] sinners from the works of [[penance|penitence]] that would otherwise be required of them to achieve full reconciliation with the church.

==In Protestantism==
[[Martin Luther]]'s opposition of this teaching seeded the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Church of England]] denied the doctrine of supererogation in the fourteenth of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], which states that works of supererogation

&lt;blockquote&gt;
cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer_(ECUSA)/Historical_Documents_of_the_Church/Articles_of_Religion Book of Common Prayer (ECUSA)/Historical Documents of the Church/Articles of Religion. XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Protestant movements followed suit, such as in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-articles-of-religion-of-the-methodist-church The Methodist Articles of Religion/Doctrinal Standards of The United Methodist Church/Articles of Religion. XI. Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
A [[Muslim]] must complete a minimum of the [[Salah#The Five Daily Prayers|five daily prayers]], each typically lasting an average of 5 to 10 minutes. Supererogatory prayers beyond these are known as [[Nafl prayer|nafl]] prayers, and praying them is considered to bear additional reward. There are also several other supererogatory acts in [[Islam]], such as fasting outside of the month of [[Ramadhan]], or giving [[sadaqah]] (charity, consisting of simple acts of kindness to financial assistance) that is not obligatory.

==Discussion==
Whether an act is supererogatory or obligatory can be debated. In many schools of thought, donating money to [[Charitable organization|charity]] is supererogatory. In other schools of thought that regard some level of charitable donation to be duty (such as with the [[tithe]] in [[Judaism]], [[zakat]] in Islam, and similar standards in many Christian sects), only exceeding a certain level of donation (e.g. going above the common 2.5%-of-capital-assets standard in zakat) would count as supererogatory.

In [[criminal law]], it may be observed that state prohibitions on killing, stealing, and so on derive from the state's duty to protect one's own citizens. However, a nation state has no duty to protect the citizens of an adjacent nation from crime. To send a [[peacekeeping]] force into another country would be — in the view of the nation doing it — supererogatory.

Some schools of ethics do not include supererogatory acts. In [[utilitarianism]], an act can only be better because it would bring more good to a greater number, and in that case it becomes a duty, not a supererogatory act. The lack of a notion of supererogation in utilitarianism and related schools leads to the [[demandingness objection]], arguing that these schools are too ethically demanding, requiring unreasonable acts.

'''The Committee for Equal Justice''' (also known as the '''Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor''') was an organization founded with the goal of assisting black women reclaim their bodies against [[sexual violence]] and [[interracial rape]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielle L. McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance--a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power (New York: Vintage Books, 2011) 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recy Taylor]] and [[Rosa Parks]] founded the committee in 1944 after six white men kidnapped and raped Taylor, an [[African-American]] woman, as she left her [[Abbeville]], [[Alabama]] church.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Theoharis, The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks (Boston: Beacon Press, 2013) 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's case garnered heavy media coverage. With this attention came national support, which led to what the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' called the "strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade."&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 22. &lt;/ref&gt; Committee members formed eighteen chapters &lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 26. &lt;/ref&gt; across the United States, and included such figures as [[WEB DuBois]], [[Mary Church Terrell]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], [[John Sengstacke]] and [[Langston Hughes]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Close to midnight on September 3, 1944, six white male assailants stopped [[Recy Taylor]], Fannie Daniels, and West Daniels as they returned home from church in [[Abbeville, Alabama]]. The assailants claimed that they recognized Taylor, and that she was wanted for a crime. Taylor had been with the Daniels all day, and thus could not have been involved in the crime as they claimed. At gun and knife point, they kidnapped Taylor, drove her to a secluded area and raped her. Following the assault, they left Taylor to stumble home blindfolded. Taylor’s father and a deputy sheriff found her; she then described the car to the deputy. The Sheriff’s Department identified [[Hugo Wilson]] as the driver, and took him into custody. Wilson named the other men involved in the assault, and the Department released him. Taylor and her husband filed charges, but the all-white [[grand jury]] dismissed the case on October 4, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Atwater, "$600 To Rape Wife? Ala. Whites Make Offer To Recy Taylor Mate!: Victim of White Alabama Racists," The Chicago Defender (National edition) Jan 27, 1945; "Alabama Authorities Ignore White Gang's Rape of Negro Mother," The Worker, November 19, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[Rosa Parks]] traveled to Abbeville, Alabama after hearing about Taylor’s assault. The threat of police intervention prompted Parks to meet Recy Taylor, her husband, and her daughter in a secluded cabin. After Deputy Sheriff Lewey Corbitt ended their secret meeting, Parks recorded Taylor’s notes of the assault and brought them to African-American activists in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 5-6. &lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on years of activism in which she defended the [[Scottsboro Boys]], fought against the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and joined the [[NAACP]], Rosa Parks allied with the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]] to publicize Taylor’s case.
	
Rosa Parks gathered the support of E.D. Nixon (the Head of the Alabama [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]), Rufus A. Lewis (funeral home director and [[Alabama State]] football coach), and E.G. Jackson (editor of [[Alabama Tribune]]) and formed the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Danielle L. At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance- a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power. New York: Vintage Books, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1945, the case had gained national attention, and the Committee established branches established in New York, and expanded to Denver, Chicago and Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Atwater, "$600 To Rape Wife? Ala. Whites Make Offer To Recy Taylor Mate!: VICTIM OF WHITE ALABAMA RAPISTS," The Chicago Defender (National edition) Jan 27, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Leadership===

In her role as secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, Rosa Parks traveled throughout Alabama collecting testimonies and documenting racially motivated crimes, such as police brutality, unsolved murders, voter intimidation, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon coming across Taylor’s story, Parks and other prominent activists, supported by national labor unions, African-American organizations and women’s groups launched a defense team, initially called the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor. Many well-known activists at the time signed on to the committee, including E.D. Nixon, E.G. Jackson, W.E.B. DuBois, Mary Church Terrell, [[Charlotte Hawkins Brown]], Ira De A. Reid, [[John Sengstacke]], [[Countee Cullen]], Langston Hughes, Lillian Smith, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Henrietta Buckmaster.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions===

The Committee for Equal Justice spearheaded the campaign for securing justice for Recy Taylor. The Committee sent delegates to Abbeville, Alabama to investigate the crime. The Committee led a publicity campaign to illuminate the prevalence of white attacks on black women.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign targeted Alabama Governor [[Chauncey Sparks]], who previously supported laws that hindered Blacks’ from registering to vote. Letters and petitions poured into Sparks’ office demanding that he take action against Taylor’s assailants. Newspapers across the country covered the story of Recy Taylor’s assault.&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Jury Won't Reopen Recy Taylor Case," The Chicago Defender, October 6, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; After a considerable amount of public pressure, Governor Sparks reluctantly agreed to launch a special grand jury investigation.&lt;ref&gt;"To Probe Attack on Ala. Woman," The Afro-American, December 23, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; The grand jury acquitted all of the assailants.&lt;ref&gt;"Recy Taylor Group Seeks Indictment," The Afro American, February 3, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pushback/backlash===

[[J.B. Matthews]], a staffer for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] vilified The Committee for Equal Justice. Matthews claimed that communists led the committee, who were using the campaign to exploit the rape of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  While some members of the committee were communists, the Committee was a platform for civil rights and included many non-communists too. Additionally, some local whites claimed that Taylor was a prostitute whose true intent was to start a race war. Consequently, she received death threats and her house was firebombed.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gordy, "Recy Taylor: A Symbol of Jim Crow's Forgotten Horror," The Root, February 9, 2011, http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2011/02/recy_taylor_a_symbol_of_jim_crows_forgotten_horror.2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact===

Although there were no indictments in Recy Taylor’s case, the Committee for Equal Justice’s nonviolent activism created a foundation for the formal civil rights movement. [[Sikivu Hutchinson]], author of “White Nights, Black Paradise” assessed the significance of the Committee for Equal Justice and Recy Taylor by saying, “Her case became a major catalyst for black women’s civil rights resistance and the intersectional connection between sexual violence and state violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Sikivu Hutchison, “Recy Talyor and the Atrocious Legacy of All-White Juries.” The Huffington Post, 10 Nov. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars assert that this case illuminates the important roles African American women played during the civil rights movement, which is often eclipsed in history books by the contributions of male figures such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King]].

==Legacy==

The Committee for Equal Justice successfully brought national attention to sexual assault of black women that was widespread in the South. The Committee for Equal Justice empowered women to report acts of sexual violence directly to the NAACP, in addition to writing letters to the Justice Department.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the Committee for Equal Justice like Rosa Parks and E. D. Nixon later went on to form the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]]. The activists who comprised the committee were responsible for the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery Bus Boycotts]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, At the Dark End of the Street, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Rosa Parks described her activism in Montgomery as being inspired by her work with the Committee for Equal Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis, The Rebellious Life, 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Alabama governor Robert Bentley signed a resolution passed by the Alabama state legislature apologizing to Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gourdy, "Recy Taylor Speaks on Alabama Apology," The Root, May 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''time-saving bias''' describes people's tendency to misestimate the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) speed. In general, people underestimate the time that could be saved when increasing from a relatively low speed (e.g., 25&amp;nbsp;mph or 40&amp;nbsp;km/h) and overestimate the time that could be saved when increasing from a relatively high speed (e.g., 55&amp;nbsp;mph or 90&amp;nbsp;km/h). People also underestimate the time that could be lost when decreasing from a low speed and overestimate the time that could be lost when decreasing from a high speed.

== Examples ==

In one study, participants were asked to judge which of two road improvement plans would be more efficient in reducing mean journey time. Respondents preferred a plan that would increase the mean speed from 70 to 110&amp;nbsp;km/h more than a plan that would increase the mean speed from 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;km/h, although the latter actually saves more time (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 1).

In another study drivers were asked to indicate how much time they feel can be saved when increasing from either a low (30&amp;nbsp;mph) or high (60&amp;nbsp;mph) speed (Fuller et al., 2009). For example, participants were asked the following question: "You are driving along an open road. How much time do you feel you would gain if you drove for 10 miles at 40&amp;nbsp;mph instead of 30&amp;nbsp;mph?" (Fuller et al., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;14). Another question had a higher starting speed (60&amp;nbsp;mph) and two other questions asked about losing time when decreasing speed (from either 30 or 60&amp;nbsp;mph).

Results supported the predictions of the time-saving bias as participants underestimated the time saved when increasing from a low speed and overestimated the time saved when increasing from a relatively high speed. In addition, participants also misestimated the time lost when decreasing speed: they generally underestimated the time lost when decreasing from a low speed and overestimated the time lost when decreasing from a relatively high speed (Fuller et al., 2009).

[[File:Time-saving-bias.svg|thumb|Time savings from extra 10 mph decrease as speed increases]]
The physical formula for calculating the time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, gained when increasing speed is:

&lt;math&gt;t = c D(v_1^{-1} - v_2^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is constant and used to transform between units of measurement, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time gained, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance traveled and &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; are the original and increased speeds, respectively. This formula shows that the relationship between increasing speed and journey time is curvilinear: a similar speed increase would result in more time saved when increasing from a low speed compared to a higher speed. For example, when increasing from 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;mph the time required to complete 10 miles decreases from 30 to 20 minutes, saving 10 minutes. However, the same speed increase of 10&amp;nbsp;mph would result in less time saved if the initial speed is higher (e.g., only 2 minutes saved when increasing from 50&amp;nbsp;mph to 60&amp;nbsp;mph). Changing the distance of the journey from 10 miles to a longer or shorter distance will increase or decrease these time savings, but will not affect the relationship between speed and time savings.

Svenson (2008) suggested that people’s judgments of time-savings actually follow a Proportion heuristic, by which people judge the time saved as the proportion of the speed increase from the initial speed. Another study suggested that people might follow a simpler difference heuristic, by which they judge the time saved based solely on the difference between the initial and higher speed (Peer, 2010b, Study 3). It seems that people falsely believe that journey time decreases somewhat linearly as driving speed increases, irrespective of the initial speed, causing the time-saving bias. Although it is still unclear what is the dominant heuristic people use to estimate time savings, it is evident that almost none follow the above curvelinear relationship.

== Consequences in driving ==

Drivers who underestimated the time saved when increasing from a low speed or overestimated the time lost when decreasing from a high speed, overestimated the speed required for arriving on a specific time and chose unduly high speeds, sometimes even exceeding the stated speed limit (Peer, 2010a). Similarly, drivers who overestimated the time saved when increasing from a high speed underestimated the speed required for arriving on time and chose lower speeds (Peer, 2011).

== Consequences in other domains ==

The time-saving bias is not limited to driving. The same faulty estimations emerge when people are asked to estimate savings in patients’ waiting time when adding more physicians to a health care center (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 2) or when estimating an increase in the productivity of a manufacturing line by adding more workers (Svenson, 2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">In [[rhetoric]] and [[ethics]], "'''two wrongs make a right'''" and "'''two wrongs don't make a right'''" are phrases that denote [[norm (philosophy)|philosophical norms]]. "Two wrongs make a right" has been considered as a [[fallacy]] of [[relevance]], in which an allegation of wrongdoing is countered with a similar allegation. Its [[antithesis]], "two wrongs don't make a right", is a [[proverb]] used to rebuke or renounce wrongful conduct as a response to another's transgression.

==History==
The phrase "two wrongs infer one right" appears in a poem dated to 1734, published in ''[[The London Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|chapter=Poetical Essays in NOVEMBER, 1734 
|page=600
|title=[[The London Magazine|The London Magazine: Or, Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer]], Volume 3
|editor=C. Ackers for J. Wilford
|year=1734
|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA600#v=onepage&amp;q=orient%20star&amp;f=false
}}
{{Quotation|
&lt;poem&gt;An orient star led, thro' his blind-
 Side, to a prize his eye of mind:
 The lightning said, its he; in Spight
 Of fate '''two wrongs infer one right'''.
 let fly; well shot! thanks to my Spark;
 A blind boy, once, has cleft the mark.&lt;/poem&gt;
|''The Moral'' (translated—origin?—in [[Hudibrastic]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
This is an [[informal fallacy]] that occurs when [[:wikt:assume|assuming]] that, if one wrong is committed, then another wrong will cancel it out.

*Speaker A: You shouldn't embezzle from your employer. It's against the law.
*Speaker B: My employer cheats on their taxes. That's against the law, too!

If Speaker B believes in the maxim "the law should be followed," then his [[Enthymeme|unstated premise]] is that [[Crime|breaking the law]] (or [[tort|the wrong]]) is justified, as long as the other party also does so. Yet if Speaker B believes the maxim "it is acceptable to break the law to wrong those who also break the law" he is committing no logical fallacy. From the conversation above, it is impossible to know which Speaker B believes.

This fallacy is often used as a [[ignoratio elenchi|red herring]], or an attempt to change or distract from the issue. For example:
*Speaker A: President Williams lied in his testimony to Congress. He should not do that.
*Speaker B: But you are ignoring the fact that President Roberts lied in his Congressional testimony!

Even if President Roberts lied in his Congressional testimony, this does not establish a [[precedent]] that makes it acceptable for President Williams to do so as well. (At best, it means Williams is ''no worse than'' Roberts.) By invoking the fallacy, the contested issue of [[Lie|lying]] is ignored.

The ''[[tu quoque]]'' fallacy is a specific type of "two wrongs make a right". Accusing another of [[Hypocrite|not practicing what they preach]], while appropriate in some situations, does not in itself invalidate an action or statement that is perceived as contradictory.

==Criticism==
Common use of the term, in the realm of [[business ethics]], has been criticized by scholar Gregory S. Kavka writing in the ''Journal of Business Ethics''. Kavka refers back to philosophical concepts of [[retributive justice|retribution]] by [[Thomas Hobbes]]. He states that if something supposedly held up as a moral standard or common social rule is violated enough in society, then an individual or group within society can break that standard or rule as well since this keeps them from being unfairly disadvantaged. As well, in specific circumstances violations of social rules can be defensible if done as direct responses to other violations. For example, Kavka states that it is wrong to deprive someone of their property, but it is right to take property back from a criminal who takes another's property in the first place. He also states that one should be careful not to use this ambiguity as an excuse recklessly to violate ethical rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kavka | first1 = G. S. | title = When two ?wrongs? Make a right: an essay on business ethics | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 2 | pages = 61–66 | year = 1983 | doi = 10.1007/BF00382714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative journalist [[Victor Lasky]] wrote in his book ''It Didn't Start With Watergate'' that while two wrongs don't make a right, if a set of immoral things are done and left unprosecuted, this creates a [[legal precedent]]. Thus, people who do the same wrongs in the future should rationally expect to get away as well. Lasky uses as an analogy the situation between [[John F. Kennedy]]'s wiretapping of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (which led to nothing) and [[Richard Nixon]]'s actions in [[Watergate]] (which Nixon thought would also lead to nothing).&lt;ref&gt;''It Didn't Start With Watergate''. [[Victor Lasky]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two wrongs don't make a right ==
'''Two wrongs don't make a right''' is a [[proverb]] that contradicts this fallacy &amp;ndash; a wrongful action is not a practical or morally appropriate way to correct or cancel a previous wrongful action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8461">The '''Welsh Not''' (also '''Welsh Knot''', '''Welsh Note''', '''Welsh Stick''', '''Welsh Lead''' or '''Cwstom''') was an item used in [[Wales|Welsh]] schools in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries to stigmatise and punish children using the [[Welsh language]].

==Usage==
{{quote box|

''"Endeavoured to compel the children to converse in English by means of a piece of wood. Offenders to be shut in after school hours."''

|source=Extracts from the Llansantffraid board school log book.
8th February, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welsh Not |url=https://pilgrim.ceredigion.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|align=right|width=40%}}
Typically "The Not" was a piece of wood, a ruler or a stick, often inscribed with the letters "WN". This was given to the first pupil to be heard speaking Welsh. When another child was heard using Welsh, "The Not" was taken from its current holder and given to the latest offender. Whoever was in possession of "The Not" was encouraged to pass it on to any of their Welsh-speaking classmates by informing the teacher that they had caught someone else speaking Welsh. The pupil in possession at the end of the day was subjected to a [[flogging]] or other punishment (some reports suggest the punishment was administered at the end of the week, or at the end of each lesson).&lt;ref name="BBC not"/&gt;

===Effects===
The effect of "The Not" was to stigmatise the use of the Welsh language among children, and engender the idea that [[English language|English]], as the preferable [[medium of instruction]], was the language of moral progress and opportunity.

Although this was never official government policy, the practice and wider social changes of the nineteenth century saw many Welsh speakers come to view the speaking of Welsh as a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="BBC not"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/language_education.shtml|title=Welsh and 19th century education|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{quote box|

''"Cannot get the children from the habit of talking in Welsh; the school as a whole is backward in English."''

|source=Extracts from the log book of the British School, Aberaeron. Written by the head teacher.
5th November, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welsh Not |url=https://pilgrim.ceredigion.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|align=left|width=40%}}
===Origin===
The use of "The Not" was recorded as early as the 18th century, and there is strong evidence of numerous incidents in both Anglican and Nonconformist schools throughout [[Carmarthen]], [[Ceredigion]] and [[Meirionnydd]], it was commonly known as the 'cwstom', the 'Welsh stick' or the 'Welsh lead' (if a lump of [[lead]] was used).&lt;ref&gt;The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widespread Use and Cultural Impact===
{{quote box|

''"Among other injurious effects, this custom has been found to lead children to visit stealthily the houses of their school-fellows for the purpose of detecting those who speak Welsh to their parents, and transferring to them the punishment due to themselves."''

|source=Extracts from Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales. |date=1847 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/reportsofcommiss00greaiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|align=right|width=40%}}
The most frequent use of the Welsh Not in schools appears to be in the first decades following the publication of the government's [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales]] in 1847.

The reports noted that schools in Wales were inadequate, with English monoglot teachers and English textbooks in use in areas where the children spoke only Welsh. It concluded that the Welsh as a race were "ignorant", "lazy" and "immoral", and that one of the main causes of this was the continuing use of the "evil" Welsh language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales. |date=1847 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/reportsofcommiss00greaiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reports had great influence in Wales, becoming known as ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' (the Treachery of the Blue Books) among Welsh speakers, and supporting the removal of Welsh as a moral endeavour. In linking the Welsh language with low educational standards and poor morality, the report also highlighted the effective use of the "Welsh Not" and, while it did not officially endorse it's use, it popularised the method as an effective tool for educators throughout Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/SEW00004b/frames?part=body&amp;div=19&amp;locale=en&amp;mode=reference|title=Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales|chapter=Part 3: North Wales, comprising Anglesey, Carnarvon, Denbigh, Flint, Meirioneth and Montgomery - Report|page=19|author=|year=1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Use===
{{quote box|

''"The speaking of Welsh in school was strictly forbidden; any boy or girl guilty of the offence was given the Welsh Not, which he or she handed on to the next offender, the unfortunate one who held the Welsh Not at the end of the school session becoming the scapegoat who bore the punishment for the sins of all. Mother, being a lively child, was in frequent possession of the Welsh Not, but was never allowed to pay the penalty; a chivalrous boy cousin always asked for it in Welsh and took the punishment himself."''

|source= Account of the writer's mothers experiences in [[Welsh Outlook]], May 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Welsh Outlook |date=May 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|align=left|width=40%}}

The use of the "Welsh Not" appears to have decreased with the introduction of [[compulsory education]] in the later decades of the 19th century. After the [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] were absorbed by the [[county councils]] following the [[Local Government Act 1888]], instruction in Welsh became the norm in [[primary schools]] in Welsh-speaking areas. However, incidents of the "Welsh Not" were still reported.&lt;ref&gt;John Davies, ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1994, {{ISBN|0-14-014581-8}}, p 455&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Morgan Edwards]] describes his experience of the Welsh Not in school in [[Llanuwchllyn]] in his book ''Clych Atgof''.

[[Susan Jones]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]], claimed in 2010 that the use of the Welsh Not, including [[caning]] as the punishment, persisted in some schools in her constituency until "as recently as the 1930s and 1940s".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/comment/newsid_8734000/8734105.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=A bevy of maidens|date=29 June 2010|last=Lowther|first=Ed|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman in a village in [[Wrexham Maelor]] stated that the Welsh Not was in use in her school in the 1940s. In 2018 Gwyn James, then living in another Wrexham Maelor village, and a monoglot Welsh speaker as a child, was reported to have had the board placed around his neck in school in the 1930s for not using English in the classroom.
