==History==
Established in 1941, the bank was founded as ''NV Nederlandsch Indische Spaar En Deposito Bank'' in [[Bandung]], Indonesia. The bank was one of the largest savings bank at the time of establishment and in 1967, it became a [[commercial bank]] providing corporate banking services as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifcextapps.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/651aeb16abd09c1f8525797d006976ba/3e4c4ae7ec228f80852576ba000e25fd?opendocument|title=NISP Bank II|publisher=IFC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the bank was then renamed to ''PT Bank Nilai Inti Sari Penyimpan (Bank NISP)''. It was among the first banks in Indonesia selected to channel government subsidized credits, to participate in government saving programs, and to issue bank guarantees for government projects. In 1972, Bank NISP entered into a joint agreement with Daiwa Perdania Bank, a joint venture between Daiwa Bank of Japan and Indonesian partners. Bank NISP later became a shareholder of Daiwa Perdania Bank. The bank subsequently became a licensed foreign exchange bank in 1990, and a publicly listed bank on the Indonesian Stock Exchange in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listofcompanies.co.in/bank-ocbc-nisp-tbk/|title=BANK OCBC NISP TBK|publisher=List of Companies|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997 to 2008: Joint venture and acquisition by OCBC===
In 1997, Bank NISP entered a joint venture with OCBC Indonesia, with the opening of PT Bank OCBC-NISP, with an initial paid-up capital of 150 billion rupiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19970405-1.2.26.3.aspx|title=OCBC opening Indon joint venture bank|publisher=The Business Times, 5 April 1997, Page 14|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, OCBC has been buying shares from shareholders within the bank and also from President Director and CEO, Parwati Surjaudaja, who sold 22.5% of her shares to OCBC in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/1026569/Family-banking-Indonesian-style.html#.VkhOSd8rJPM|title=Family banking, Indonesian-style|publisher=Institutional Investor|date=April 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, OCBC Bank had become the main shareholder in Bank NISP and the bank was renamed Bank OCBC NISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/The+Business+Times/Story/A1Story20090622-150204.html|title=Local banks looking to Indonesia for growth |publisher=AsiaOne |date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 to present: Merger with OCBC Indonesia===
In 2011, OCBC NISP merged with OCBC Indonesia, where OCBC Indonesia was dissolved without going through liquidation. The combined entity would operate under the name of Bank OCBC NISP, and a total of Rp 47.6 trillion in combined assets after the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/11/10/ocbc-nisp-ocbc-indonesia-merger-approved.html|title=OCBC NISP, OCBC Indonesia merger approved|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date= November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonifacio Global City''' (also known as '''BGC''', '''Global City''', or '''The Fort''') is a financial and lifestyle district in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]. It is located {{convert|11|km|abbr=on}} south-east of the center of [[Manila]]. The district experienced commercial growth following the sale of military land by the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA). The entire district used to be the part of the main [[Philippine Army]] camp.

It is under the administration of the city government of [[Taguig]]. The local governments of [[Makati]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] also claims jurisdiction.

In February 7, 1995, Bonifacio Land Development Corporation (BLDC) started planning a major urban development—Bonifacio Global City. BLDC made a successful bid to become BCDA's partner in the development of the district. The [[Ayala Corporation]] through Ayala Land, Inc., and Evergreen Holdings, Inc. of the Campos Group purchased a controlling stake in BLDC from [[Metro Pacific]] in 2003. BCDA and the two companies now control Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation, which oversees the master planning of Bonifacio Global City.

{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:FortMcKinley.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Philippine Scouts]] at Fort McKinley (called today Fort Bonifacio) firing a 37-mm antitank gun in training]]
During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]], the US government acquired a 25.78 square kilometre property within what was then disputed area between Makati, Taguig and Pateros for military purposes. This area (TCT dated 1902) was turned into a camp then known as [[Fort William McKinley]] after the 25th US president, [[William McKinley]]. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the US bestowed to the Republic of the Philippines all rights of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of their military bases. On May 14, 1949, Fort McKinley was turned over to the [[Philippine government]] by virtue of US Embassy Note No. 0570.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/b-ph-ust000011-0178.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the AFP leadership of Gen. Alfonso Arellano, Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taguig.gov.ph/portal/contents/about_Taguig/barangays/west_rembo_r.html Barangay West Rembo Profile]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, [[Andres Bonifacio]], whose father, Santiago Bonifacio, was a native of Taguig (then part of the Province of Manila / Tondo).

On December 9, 1937 the Deed of Absolute sale executed by the owner, Don Anacleto Madrigal Acopiado in favor of the American Government covering the area of 100 hectares, portion of Bicutan, Taguig, annotated at the back of TCT No. 408. During the American Commonwealth, it was converted to a Military base, named Fort McKinley. It was during the presidency of the late President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]' administration when Fort McKinley was renamed Fort Bonifacio and transferred to Makati. Taguig got the jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio after winning the case against Makati in filed in the Pasig Regional Trial Court in 1993. Makati appealed the ruling, but the Pasig RTC in 2011 still sided with Taguig, saying that Fort Bonifacio including the -EMBO Baranggays are all part of Taguig. Makati then asked the Court of Appeals to review the case. The Court of Appeals overturned the Pasig Regional Trial Court's decision and reverted jurisdiction of the BGC in favor of Makati. As of date, Taguig has filed a Motion of Reconsideration at the Court of Appeals seeking to revert the decision. Status quo (meaning the latest ruling) remains with Makati. Taguig currently has de facto control over the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/320707/news/nation/rich-get-richer-makati-gains-while-taguig-loses-fort-boni-in-court-decision |author=Mark Merueñas|title=Rich get richer: Makati gains while Taguig loses Fort Boni in court decision |publisher=GMA News Online |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 7, 1995, Bonifacio Land Development Corporation, a consortium led by [[Metro Pacific]], made a successful bid to become BCDA's partner in the development of Bonifacio Global City (BGC), the Home of Passionate Minds.

==Fort Bonifacio dispute==
[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|Contested territory between [[Makati]] and [[Taguig]] which includes Bonifacio Global City]]

The city governments of [[Makati]] and [[Taguig]] have recently fought over the jurisdiction of Fort Bonifacio because of the area's growth potential. A portion of the base, including the Libingan ng mga Bayani and the American Cemetery, lies within Taguig, while the northern portion where the Global City development is centered was considered part of Makati. A 2003 ruling by a judge in the Pasig Regional Trial Court upheld the jurisdiction of Taguig over the entirety of Fort Bonifacio, including the Bonifacio Global City and Pinagsama.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205080132/http://elibrary.supremecourt.gov.ph/decisions.php?doctype=Decisions%20%2F%20Signed%20Resolutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd646f43d0ea63cd Supreme Court E-Library - G.R.

===Ruling===
The Supreme Court on June 27, 2008 per [[Leonardo Quisumbing]], dismissed the suit of the [[Makati]], seeking to nullify Special Patents 3595 and 3596 signed by [[Fidel Ramos]] conveying to the Bases Conversion and Development Authority public land in Fort Bonifacio, [[Taguig]] City. Due to a pending civil case filed by the Taguig City government asking the court to define its territorial boundaries, Makati cannot halt Taguig from collecting taxes on land located in Fort Bonifacio because it does not have any other sufficient source of sufficient income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police2_june30_2008 |title=Court junks Taguig’s suit to nullify Ramos patents|website=www.manilastandardtoday.com|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/june2008/163175.htm ''Pateros v Taguig'', G.R.

===Reclaim by Pateros===
The municipality of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], the only municipality in [[Metro Manila]] and located near Fort Bonifacio, claims that its original land area was not its present land area of 2.10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but 1,040 hectares (10.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) including Fort Bonifacio, particularly Barangays Comembo, Pembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Cembo, South Cembo and Pitogo which are now part of Makati City and Bonifacio Global City, Aranai, Ususan and Palar, Pinagsama which was made part of Taguig, based on documents and official maps obtained from some libraries and offices including USA Library of Congress and USA Archives. ("Susi ng Pateros Newsletter", 2000)

Pateros' decrease in territory was accounted to a cadastral mapping in Metro Manila conducted in 1978. The late Pateros Mayor Nestor Ponce challenged the map through an objection letter dated June 23, 1978. In January 1986, former President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 2475 which stated that Fort Bonifacio is in [[Makati]] and it's open for disposition. Because of that, a boundary dispute arose which moved Pateros to request a dialogue about that with then Municipal Council of [[Makati]] in 1990. Pateros also filed a complaint against Taguig at the Makati RTC in 1996 but the trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The case was moved to the Court of Appeals in 2003, but was denied. The same case was moved to the Supreme Court in 2009, and it was denied again.&lt;ref&gt;"Susi ng Pateros Newsletter", 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court Decision===
The Supreme Court, on June 16, 2009, per Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura denied Pateros’ petition against Taguig but ruled out that the boundary dispute should be settled amicably by their respective legislative bodies based on Section 118(d) of the Local Government Code.&lt;ref&gt;Panaligan, R. 2009, June 22. [http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/207737/sc-wants-ft-bonifacio-land-dispute-settled-amicably "SC wants Ft. Bonifacio land dispute settled amicably"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},
 {{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} mb.com.ph; accessed July 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to the decision, Pateros invited Taguig to a council-to-council dialogue on October 8, 2009. Four meetings were held and at the fourth dialogue on November 23, 2009, a joint resolution was made stating that Taguig is requesting a tripartite conference between Pateros, [[Taguig]] and [[Makati]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Court of Appeals Decision===
On August 5, 2013, after just a year and a half, the 20-year-long battle was decided in a 37-page decision that was written by Justice Marlene Gonzales-Sison of the Court of Appeals. It says that jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio has reverted to Makati from Taguig. The Court upheld the constitutionality of Presidential Proclamations 2475 and 518, both of which confirmed that portions of the aforementioned military camps are under the jurisdiction of Makati. The decision also cited the fact that voters from the barangays that are subject of the dispute between Makati and Taguig have long been registered as voters of Makati, thus bolstering the former's jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio. However, Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano maintained that this decision was not yet final and executory, and asked Justice Gonzales-Sison to recuse from the case as it was discovered that her family has close ties with the Binays of Makati.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Status quo remains===
On August 22, 2013, the Taguig city government filed a Motion for Reconsideration before the Court of Appeals's Sixth Division affirming its claim on Fort Bonifacio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/taguig-reaffirms-claim-over-fort-bonifacio |title=Taguig City files a Motion for Reconsideration|website=www.taguig.gov.ph| accessdate= July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the filing of the said Motion for Reconsideration, Taguig's jurisdiction forces itself over Fort Bonifacio. According to Taguig's legal department, jurisprudence and the rules of procedure in the country's justice system all say that the filing of a motion for reconsideration suspends the execution of a decision and puts it in limbo.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Supreme Court's Second Decision===
On August 1, 2016, in a 27-page decision by the Second Division of the Supreme Court, the decision sought Makati government found guilty of direct contempt for abusing the legal processes over the jurisdiction of BGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Makati guilty of direct contempt over BGC row with Taguig|last=Torres-Tupas|first=Tetch|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801669/makati-guilty-of-direct-contempt-over-bgc-row-with-taguig|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=August 1, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decision, recognition of Taguig's jurisdiction===
On October 3, 2017, the Court of Appeals upheld its final decision in favor of the city government of Taguig and not Makati. The SC also sought Makati guilty of forum shopping after simultaneously appealing the Pasig RTC ruling and filing a petition before the CA, both seeking the same relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CA: Taguig owns BGC, not Makati|last=Ramos|first=Marlon|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/943180/ca-taguig-owns-bgc-not-makati|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=November 6, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It’s final: BGC belongs to Taguig|last=Punay|first=Edu|url=http://www.philstar.com/metro/2017/11/06/1756019/its-final-bgc-belongs-taguig|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=November 6, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Busy work''' (also referred to as '''make-work''' and '''busywork''') can refer to activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has no actual value.  Busy work also occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines busywork as "work that usually appears productive or of intrinsic value but actually only keeps one occupied." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/busywork|title=Definition of BUSYWORK|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of education, busy work allows students to work independently, to test their own knowledge and skills, and to practice using new skills [[Learning|learned]] in the educational setting.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"&gt;(1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=n2BMAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Plans for busy work - Boston Primary Teachers' Association - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It can consist of various types of [[schoolwork]] assigned by a teacher to keep students occupied with activities involving learning and cognition while the teacher focuses upon another group of students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The functionality of busy work is associated with levels of interest students have with the content of the work, levels of enjoyment students have in performing the work, how purposeful the work is, and how accomplishment of the work is perceived by students.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt; The perceived results of the work by students is significant: when students feel that they've succeeded in accomplishing a functional task, it's congruent with learning and the attainment of new skills.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;

Busy work can also be used to keep the students occupied with educational tasks during idle times, such as instances when time in school remains but the day's curriculum has already concluded.&lt;ref name="BostonPTA"/&gt;  This application of busy work to consume idle time was common in [[primary education]], but the need for work to have educational content, rather than existing just to consume time, is now preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=475 |chapter=Busy work |author=[[Paul Monroe]] |title=A Cyclopedia of Education |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busy work has historical precedent in [[primary education]]. Conditioning students to believe that busy work carries the same value as progressive work can lead to students maintaining this belief later in life, carrying it through to the workplace.

==Business and work settings==
[[File:Lightmatter paperwork.jpg|thumb|The constant processing of [[wikt:paperwork|paperwork]] can be a form of busy work, particularly in situations when it is a lower priority compared to other tasks.]]
In business and work settings, people may engage in busy work simply to appear like they're being busy and productive, with the primary goal of actually simply maintaining an ''appearance'' of activity in efforts to protect their employment status (to avoid [[termination of employment|termination]] or sanctions).&lt;ref name="Slack"&gt;(2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3AuP7HV14SYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency - Tom DeMarco - Google Books &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously-designated less important work. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results.&lt;ref name="Slack"/&gt; Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization's plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2012/01/19/why-busy-work-doesnt-work/ | title=Why Busy Work Doesn't Work | publisher=Forbes Magazine | date=January 19, 2012 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kotter, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.

==Military settings==
Busy work is used in armed forces to keep servicemembers from becoming bored, inactive and idle.  Tasks of this sort include [[military parade|drill]], memorizing regulations, getting haircuts, [[spit and polish]]ing footwear and other cleaning chores such as [[holystone|scrubbing the deck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=356 |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Daily Life in America: The War of Independence and antebellum expansion and reform, 1763-1861 |author=Randall M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">The '''clear craze''' was a marketing fad in the late 1980s and 1990s. In beverages, clarity was equated with purity and freedom from artificial dyes and manufacturers of household items released clear versions of their products.

==Drinks==
Following the trend of "light" drinks with fewer calories and artificial flavors, many companies released "clear" versions of their products. [[Crystal Pepsi]] was promoted as having no preservatives and no caffeine, although the previous Pepsi also did not have preservatives, and a caffeine-free version was already available. Soon after, [[Coca-Cola]] released [[Tab Clear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/283798159/|title=15 Feb 1993, 35 - The Morning Call at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beer industry also became involved. In Aug 1992, [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] announced [[Zima (drink)|Zima]], a clear, carbonated malt beer and in 1993, [[Miller]] released [[Miller Clear]], a clear variant of their beer to mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/289539607|title=27 Jun 1993, 5 - The News Leader at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal hygiene==
[[Gillette]] released versions of their deodorants and shaving creams in a clear gel form which is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/283798411|title=15 Feb 1993, 42 - The Morning Call at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appliances==
[[File:Game Boy Play It Loud! Transparent American Edition.png|thumb|upright|Play It Loud! Nintendo Game Boy, an example of clear craze design]]
Since the introduction of [[Plexiglas]] in the late 1930s, devices have been made with clear shells to expose the electromechanical components inside. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], a [[Pontiac straight-6 engine|139 Pontiac Deluxe Six]] engine with a clear Plexiglas body was on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/5826306/see-through-1939-pontiac-sells-for-308000|title=See-through 1939 Pontiac sells for $308,000|first=Tom|last=Joslin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/06/ghost-car-pontiac-auction_n_891319.html|title=Ghost Car -- A 1939 Plexiglas Pontiac Deluxe Six -- To Be Auctioned|date=6 July 2011|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peaking in the 1960s and 1970s, transparent-shelled devices fell out of fashion until the clear craze in the late 80s. Following the [[breakup of the Bell System]] in the mid 80s, a surge of manufactures began creating phones, many of them transparent and having flashing neon lights when the phone rang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/280969072|title=26 Apr 1990, 13 - The Daily Journal at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up into the 90s, the trend continued with transparent watches, staplers, calculators and handheld gaming devices including the [[Nintendo Game Boy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/123648156|title=8 Oct 1996, Page 30 - Arizona Republic at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

'''''Contra proferentem''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "against [the] offeror"),&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Black's Law Dictionary]]|edition=9th|editor-last1=Garner|editor-first1=Bryan A.|editor-link1=Bryan A. Garner |first=Henry C. |last=Black |authorlink=Henry Campbell Black |location=St. Paul, MN |publisher=[[West Publishing]] |year=2009 |type=Print. |isbn=0-314-19949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "interpretation against the draftsman", is a [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] of [[contract]]ual interpretation providing that, where a promise, agreement or [[contractual term|term]] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], the preferred meaning should be the one that works against the interests of the party who provided the wording.&lt;ref name="r2d206"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Law Institute|title=Restatement (Second) of Contracts|year=1981|publisher=American Law Institute Publishers|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|volume=2|chapter=The Scope of Contractual Obligations|at=§ 206|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is often applied to situations involving standardized contracts or where the parties are of unequal [[bargaining power]], but is applicable to other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is not, however, directly applicable to situations where the language at issue is mandated by law, as is often the case with [[insurance contract]]s and [[bill of lading|bills of lading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind this rule is to encourage the drafter of a contract to be as clear and explicit as possible and to take into account as many foreseeable situations as it can.

Additionally, the rule reflects the court's inherent dislike of [[Standard form contract|standard-form take-it-or-leave-it contracts]] also known as contracts of adhesion (e.g., standard form insurance contracts for individual [[consumer]]s, residential leases, etc.). The [[court]] perceives such contracts to be the product of bargaining between parties in unfair or uneven positions. To mitigate this perceived unfairness, [[legal system]]s apply the doctrine of ''contra proferentem''; giving the benefit of any doubt in favor of the party upon whom the contract was foisted.  Some courts when seeking a particular result will use ''contra proferentem'' to take a strict approach against insurers and other powerful contracting parties and go so far as to interpret [[Contractual Term|terms]] of the contract in favor of the other party, even where the meaning of a term would appear clear and unambiguous on its face,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} although this application is disfavored.

''Contra proferentem'' also places the cost of losses on the party who was in the best position to avoid the harm. This is generally the person who drafted the [[contract]]. An example of this is the insurance contract mentioned above, which is a good example of an adhesion contract. There, the insurance company is the party completely in control of the terms of the contract and is generally in a better position to, for example, avoid contractual forfeiture. This is a longstanding principle: see, for example, [[California Civil Code]] §1654 (“In cases of uncertainty ... the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist"), which was enacted in 1872. Numerous other states have also codified the rule.

The principle has also been codified in international instruments such as the [[UNIDROIT]] Principles and the [[Principles of European Contract Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6124">'''Dala Modu''' was an important  [[Sierra Leonean]] [[Susu people|Susu]] [[trade]]r and [[translation|translator]] between the [[British Colonial]] Government and the local chiefs in the interior in the early decades of the British Colony in [[Sierra Leone]]. His efforts helped in resolving a number of conflicts between the colonial and interior rulers. His reputation as a major commercial force was enhanced in the process, and he built up the prominent Soso community around Lungi in the Kafu Bullom country.

==Early life==
Dala Modu was born in 1770 in [[Wonkafong]], [[Sumbuya]] near [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]] into a family of [[Merchant|traders]]. His father, Fenda Modu, had been advisor to the King of Sumbuya and Headman of Wonkafong. Although born in Guinea, he was raised in [[Freetown]]. Dala Modu first came to [[Freetown]] at the age of four years, with his father in 1774. Desirous of fostering his commercial contacts with the new colony, Fenda Modu sent his son Dala Modu with fifty followers in 1795 to settle on the outskirts of Freetown. The town Dala Modu built up there, named [[Dalamodiya]] after him, quickly became a commercial centre, and he became landlord for many traders from the interior, mostly from his own Soso ethnic group. Dala Modu was welcomed by the [[United Kingdom|British]], who were also keen on developing the trade with the interior on which the colony's survival depended. In [[Freetown]] Dala Modu learned English and studied the colony's monetary system and weights and measures.

==Career==
Dala Modu's business activities became very extensive, involving colony officials, both [[Europe]]an and [[Africa]]n, and the local traders, for whom he acted as agent. He became the primary landlord to visiting traders from the distant interior, giving them advice and assistance on how to get the best out of their trade goods in the [[colony]]. In this process, he developed close contacts with the Freetown merchants to whom he directed the interior traders.

Dala Modu became the local agent to the European firm of [[Macaulay and Babington]] in 1826. The European agent of that Company, [[Kenneth Macaulay (colonialist)|Kenneth Macaulay]], was a close associate of Dala Modu when he acted as governor in that year. Modu organised the felling and processing of timber for the company from his base at [[Lungi, Sierra Leone#History|Madina]] on the [[Bullom]] Shore, where he had lived since 1806. This was done with a large band of servile labour he retained there. For the 1826 season alone, he received £1,000 as partial payment. In 1834, many [[gold]] traders from the interior came to the colony through him, bringing him much wealth in broker's fees.

Dala Modu used his wealth and business contacts to build for himself a prominent position in the relations between the colony officials and the local rulers in the interior. He was helped in this by his powerful family connections in the Northern River areas (north of the [[Scarcies]]), where his family owned parts of the major trading islands. These came in handy in treaties of cession he negotiated in 1818 and 1825 with the colonial government, which was eager to use these islands, like Matacong and the Isles de Los, as customs posts.

But Dala Modu's personal qualities of diplomacy undoubtedly played a major role in winning the favoured position he came to enjoy. As early as 1802, soon after the rebellion of the Nova Scotian settlers in the colony, Dala Modu was instrumental in convincing the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] chiefs to withdraw their support for the rebels and to hand over the leaders of the uprising to the British. But, in 1806, he was accused of slave trading and other charges. When called to answer these charges, he appeared in Muslim robes rather than the European dress he was used to wearing in Freetown. This angered the British authorities, who proceeded to expel him from the colony. Dala Modu then moved to [[Madina, Port Loko District|Madina]] on the Bullom Shore from where he continued his business activities. It was there that he built up the [[Sosso]] community with migrants coming from the interior. Dala Modu thus because effectively the King of [[Kaffu Bullom Chiefdom|Kafu Bullom]] and [[Loko Masama]], but his influence extended as far as the Port Loko areas. In fact, he became ruler of Rokon on the Rokel in 1837.

The colonial government in Freetown soon realized that it needed Dala Modu's services in settling disputes in the interior. From 1818, when he arranged the cession of the Isles de Los to the British, he started receiving an annual payment from them. Between 1820 and 1841, Dala Modu arranged peace talks on a number of occasions to settle local disputes the Colony Government felt were inhibiting trade. These included the rebellion on the north [[Rokel]] in 1835, and the [[Temne people|Temne]]/[[Loko people|Loko]] war in 1836. Though he did not get along well with some of the governors, succeeding ones were quick to realise his worth and do business with him. Governor [[Henry Dundas Campbell]] visited him in 1835 and was struck by his intelligence and affluent style of living.

When Dala Modu died, over eighty [[cattle|cows]] were slaughtered during his funeral ceremonies, attended by British and African officials from the colony and by many local chiefs from the interior. Dala Modu was among the first indigenous entrepreneurs to take advantage of the new business opportunities arising after the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]] of the [[slave trade]].

This is different from [[data warehouse]]s that focuses on structured data, such as tabelarized sales reports.

On the other hand, '''Document Warehouse for SAP''' is also a [[FileNet]]'s commercial software that enables [[SAP AG|SAP]]'s business applications to access document images stored by FileNet.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7506-7816-X"&gt;{{cite book

'''Elio Fiorucci'''  (10 June 1935 – 19 July 2015) was an Italian fashion designer and the founder of the [[Fiorucci]] fashion label.

Beginning in retailing at the age of 14, he later created a fashion brand that had worldwide success during the 1970s and 1980s, including becoming a key label of the [[disco]]-scene. The retail environments he created were destinations, rather than simply places to buy clothes; his New York store was known by some as the daytime [[Studio 54]] and gave space to artists and creatives – including [[Andy Warhol]].

Fiorucci is credited with designing and popularising stretch jeans, and for transforming the fashion scene. [[Giorgio Armani]] described him as a revolutionary, adding: "He was always ready to take some risks to really understand his time".&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Elio Fiorucci was born in [[Milan]] and was one of six children, two of them boys.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family escaped to the countryside during the [[world War II|war]], returning afterwards to continue running the family shoe shop and manufacturing business.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiorucci started working in his father's shop when he was 14, becoming a full-time worker there at 17.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Fiorucci created his first successful design – a brightly coloured waterproof overshoe. The design was featured in the Italian magazine ''[[Amica (magazine)|Amica]]'' and earned him enough money to go travelling. His travels included a visit to London, then [[Swinging London|a hotbed of young fashion]], and he was said to have been surprised and also influenced by the dynamic retailing approaches found in [[Carnaby Street]] and [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he would say: "That creative chaos represented a new deal, free from the pressures of formal dressing and elegance".&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch of retail brand==
After returning to Milan, he opened his first shop in 1967.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was located in the Galleria Passarella and targeted a much younger clientele than was typical for Italian retailing of the time. Fiorucci stocked London designers such as [[Ossie Clark]], as well as the typical [[hippie]] uniform of [[Afghan Coat|Afghan coat]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store became an eclectic mix of eccentricities – everything from rag rugs and kettles to hair products and clothing.&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exotic market-style approach he'd seen in Kensington Market was added to, with Fiorucci using the fashion inspiration he'd gained in his travels to places such as [[Mexico]] and [[Ibiza]], as well as being inspired by the London scene.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He created his own label in 1970.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was considerably older than his target market – the teenage and young shopper – he employed young fashion scouts internationally to report back on what young people were wearing and discover different products and designs that could be incorporated into his manufacturing. The distinctive logo he chose for Fiorucci was two less than saintly looking Victorian cherubs in sunglasses.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing he manufactured was affordable and often kitsch – such as bright coloured T-shirts featuring his trademark cherub motif or [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters.&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The store was distinctively different and radical for the time and grew to become what Fiorucci himself would describe as: "an amusement park of novelties". A second store opened in Milan's Via Torino – it included a fast-food restaurant and became a place for young people to see and be seen. By this stage, Fiorucci had financial backing from the Montedison group.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York store==
In 1976, the Fiorucci brand was taken to New York, with a retail store on [[59th Street (Manhattan)|East 59th Street]]. Its interior was part designed by [[Ettore Sottsass]] and it became part of the ascendent disco culture – the opening party was held at Studio 54 and Fiorucci chartered a jumbo jet to fly in his Italian guests.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his Milan stores, this became a place for people to hang out and the store offered free [[espresso]] and music from resident DJs – it became known as the daytime Studio 54 because of the disco crowd that gathered there.&lt;ref name="DT 22072015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elio Fiorucci, fashion designer – obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11756005/Elio-Fiorucci-fashion-designer-obituary.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiorucci became friendly with [[Andy Warhol]] and gave him a free office in the store in order to set up ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''. Warhol described the store as fun, saying: "That's all I ever wanted, all plastic".&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorucci also offered wall space to artist [[Keith Haring]] and gave [[Concession (contract)|retail concessions]] to designers [[Anna Sui]] and [[Betsey Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous patrons included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Onassis]] and [[Cher]], and the teenage [[Marc Jacobs]] also spent time there.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion and change of ownership===
The expansion, which had begun in 1975, continued apace. By 1984, the brand had stores on London's [[King's Road]] and LA's [[Rodeo Drive]], as well as branches in Sydney, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Its Milan store would attract up to 10,000 visitors on a Saturday at the peak of its success.&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, Elio Fiorucci's reach appeared unstoppable – he said: "we were never wrong" – but he struggled to manage the company's financial affairs.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] bought Montedison's share in the company, selling it on to Aknofin six years later. Also in 1986, the New York store was forced to close, followed by other international outlets and the company went into [[Administration (law)|administration]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fiorucci label was sold to the Carrera jeans label, which sold it on in 1990 to the Japanese firm Edwin International.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La rep"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Redazione|title=Milano, Elio Fiorucci morto in casa per un malore: col suo stile pop rivoluzionò la moda|url=http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/07/20/news/milano_il_mondo_della_moda_e_in_lutto_elio_fiorucci_trovato_morto_nella_sua_casa-119468707/|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[La Repubblica]]|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorucci retained creative control under Edwin, but the relationship was not smooth.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original Fiorucci store in Milan closed in 2003.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The New York store closed in the same year, having moved downtown and – in post [[9/11]] New York – become a space that sponsored and supported new artists. [[AndrewAndrew]] used the shop to launch their careers.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later activities===
After the Fiorucci brand, Elio Fiorucci launched a new  fashion label [[Love Therapy]], which included jeans, hoodies, clothes and accessories.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giovanni Orso|title=VISTI DA VICINO: Elio Fiorucci|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[L'Eco di Bergamo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Love Therapy orfana.

==Brand influence and legacy==
It has been said that garments were the least important part of Fiorucci's success. Instead, it was the retail ambience and branding – he was an early adopter of the outrageous advertising campaign and even had the stickers for one [[monokini]] campaign seized by the Italian police.&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most significant introductions was in jeans, which he cut close to the body and to fit women's shape. From 1982, his denims incorporated [[lycra]], and he also made jeans in other materials, including [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skintight – almost spray-on – look he created was said to have been inspired by the sight of women in Ibiza in wet jeans; Fiorucci, having noted that they fitted women's bodies better when wet, decided to recreate the effect, and his designs left little to the imagination.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped to popularise animal prints in 1970s and early '80s fashion – his trademark was leopard-print – although he himself was a vegetarian and never used leather in his jeans or other garments.&lt;ref name="Time Plucinska"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plucinska|first1=Joanna|title=The King of Stretch Jeans, Elio Fiorucci, Has Passed Away|url=http://time.com/3965345/elio-fiorucci-stretch-jeans-obituary/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Time|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 21072015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiorucci – a life in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/jul/21/fiorucci-a-life-in-pictures|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiorucci's influence on the disco scene was strong; his New York art director also styled the then rising star [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at the brand's 15th anniversary party in Studio 54, it was Madonna who agreed to jump out of the birthday cake.&lt;ref name="DT 22072015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elio Fiorucci, fashion designer – obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11756005/Elio-Fiorucci-fashion-designer-obituary.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiorucci's brand had a name check – alongside [[Halston]] and [[Gucci]] – in the [[Bernard Edwards]] and [[Nile Rodgers]] song "He's the Greatest Dancer", a disco anthem sung by [[Sister Sledge]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Horwell 240715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwell|first1=Veronica|title=Elio Fiorucci obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/24/elio-fiorucci|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An obituary on the BBC Radio 4 programme ''[[Last Word]]'' (first broadcast on 18 August 2015) interviewed fashion curator at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] Sonnet Stanfill, who suggested Elio Fiorucci helped to make fashion a lot less formal – transforming jeans into fashion that could be worn day or evening. She added that his design skills encompassed not just fashion but also retail environment and marketing materials, which combined to make the garments more compelling. Graphic designer [[Terry Jones (i-D)|Terry Jones]] suggested that his approach had a direct influence on fashion brands that followed, such as [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] and [[Moschino]].&lt;ref name="BBC R4 Last Word"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanfill|first1=Sonnet|title=Last Word|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b065061q|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=BBC Radio 4|ref=begins 19.33|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the flamboyance of the clothes and retail environments he created, Fiorucci's personal style was restrained – typically sweater and trousers – and he told ''[[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]]'' in 1976, in an interview about the opening of his Manhattan store that he was: "a merchant, not a man of fashion".&lt;ref name="WWD Turra"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turra|first1=Alessandra|title=Italian Fashion World Mourns Elio Fiorucci|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/elio-fiorucci-dead-at-10189772/|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=WWD|date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married twice and had three daughters.&lt;ref name="FT Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Rachel|title=Elio Fiorucci, designer and retailer, 1935-2015|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6277046-3214-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3iu44iKaU|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">'''Erwin Meister''' is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] businessman who, with his partner [[Edwin Bollier]], formed the company [[Mebo Telecommunications]] in 1969. They bought a Norwegian freighter, renamed it ''[[Mebo II]]'', and converted it into an [[offshore radio]] station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mebocom-defilee.ch/ceocities/mebo.htm The trouble of a Swiss firm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio North Sea==
''[[Mebo II]]'' operated off the coasts of the [[Netherlands]] and [[England]] from 1970 to 1974, when it broadcast as ''[[Radio North Sea International]]'' (RNI). After both countries having enacted legislation outlawing the supply of [[offshore radio]] stations, Meister and Bollier leased the RNI vessel to [[Libya]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offshore-radio.de/fleet/mebo2.htm Marine Offences Act, 1974] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054038/http://www.offshore-radio.de/fleet/mebo2.htm |date=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lockerbie bombing==
Because a Mebo timing device was alleged to have been used to trigger the bomb that destroyed [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie]], [[Scotland]] on 21 December 1988 killing 270 people, Erwin Meister was summoned to give evidence in week 8 of the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|Lockerbie trial]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021105041308/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/5260/week8.html Meister and Bollier testify at the Lockerbie trial]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Wilhelm "Fritz" von Frantzius''' was a German-born American businessman and millionaire.

==Life and career==
Von Frantzius was born on May 17, 1865 in Sawdin, [[West Prussia]] to parents Arthur and Ida (Ehlert) von Frantzius.&lt;ref name=will&gt;''F. von Frantzius Dies; Left $11,250,000.'' (1917, January 9). New York Times, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Marlenwerder and Graudenz in West Russia from 1872 to 1885. He worked for three years in Berlin as a clerk of export and commission for the firm Ostberg &amp; Loeser.

In 1888, von Frantzius came to the United States. He worked as a bookkeeper for Lipps &amp; Button Silk Mills from 1888-1889, for Matthiessen &amp; Hegeler Zinc Co. from 1889-1892, for Siemens &amp; Halske Electric Co. from 1892-1893 and for J. F. Wollen-sac from 1893-1896. He then worked in the real estate business with S. E. Gross and Sam Brown Jr. from 1896 until he became a banker and broker in 1899 at the firm Von Frantzius &amp; Krusemarck.  In 1901 He began working with Ben Marcuse at the firm Von Frantzius &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=Marquis&gt;Marquis, A. N. (1911). ''The book of chicagoans: A biographical dictionary of leading living men of the city of chicago.'' Chicago: A.N. Marquis &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 1900 in Berlin, von Frantzius was selected as the Councilor of the Foreign Office and Councilor of the High Court for the [[International Court of Arbitration]] at The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;''German Arbitrators Selected.'' (1900, December 10). New York Times, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He married Margarete Sieber on September 28, 1893, and they had two children, Hans Peter and Anne-Marie.&lt;ref name=Marquis/&gt; On June 23, 1913 von Frantzius married his second wife, the Australian dancer [[Saharet]], with whom he had long been obsessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hat-archive.com/Saharet.htm Saharet] at the History of Australian Theatre Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; He made her vow to give up dancing forever, and she agreed to the condition.&lt;ref&gt;''To dance or to marry?'' (1913, June 23). New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she stayed with him for only four days before she ripped up the marriage contract and left for Europe to pursue her career.

Von Frantzius published a book in 1914, in response to an article written by [[Brander Matthews]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. (1914, September 20). ''Germans as exponents of culture.'' New York Times,	p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was originally titled ''Germans as Exponents of Culture'' but later editions were titled ''[[The Book of Truth and Facts]]''.

Von Frantzius died on January 8, 1917 in Chicago from heart disease.  His estate was worth an estimated $11,250,000 at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=will/&gt;

== Defence interests ==
Roos undertook national service in Sweden, where he attained the rank of Major in the reserve with the third cavalry regiment of the Swedish Armed Forces. He has provided advice to various governments, helping to shape their defence innovation and research strategies. He has also taught at the [[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Professor Goran Roos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defencesa.com/about-defence-sa/defence-sa-advisory-board/professor-goran-roos|title=Professor Goran Roos|website=www.defencesa.com|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Roos has made a number of contributions to debate regarding the Future Submarine project. For example, he has asked whether Australia's sovereign capability could be compromised if its next fleet of submarines is built off-shore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Keane is wrong: we should build subs in Australia |url = http://www.crikey.com.au/2014/09/11/keane-is-wrong-we-should-build-subs-in-australia/|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has questioned whether a foreign manufacturer would be willing to hand over its intellectual property if it were awarded the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Professor Goran Roos says any developed nation would keep the best subs to itself and give us second best |work= The Advertiser |author= Tory Shepherd |date= 17 October 2014 |url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/professor-goran-roos-says-any-developed-nation-would-keep-the-best-subs-to-itself-and-give-us-second-best/story-fni6uo1m-1227093221869 |accessdate = 2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roos has also published articles on the economic cost of an off-shore build, questioning the Federal Government's apparent eagerness to purchase submarines from another country, rather than committing to building them in South Australia.&lt;ref name="Submarines"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Government in a rush to make the wrong decision on submarines |url = https://theconversation.com/government-in-a-rush-to-make-the-wrong-decision-on-submarines-33544 |accessdate = 2015-06-19 |first = Goran |last = Roos |date= 31 October 2014 |work= The Conversation }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written at least six articles on the topic for ''The Conversation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Goran Roos Articles |url = https://theconversation.com/profiles/goran-roos-116975/articles |website = The Conversation |accessdate = 2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Roos supported students of the South Australian Defence Industry Leadership Program (SADILP) in the preparation of a paper entitled "A Nuclear Future for South Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dtc.org.au/Portals/0/SADILP%202013%20Nuclear%20Industry%20Concept%20Paper.pdf |title=A Nuclear Future for South Australia |last=Dametto|first=Fil |last2=Galeano|first2=Michele |date=2014-01-17 |website= www.dtc.org.au |publisher= Defence Teaming Centre |pages=3–15 |access-date=2017-01-25 |last3=Krause|first3=David |last4=Ross|first4=Heidi |last5=Paior|first5=Jon}}{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Roos' expenditure of public funds during his work as a State Government contractor attracted some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Taxpayers fund Government consultant Goran Roos’ lavish meals, fines and wines |author= David Nankervis |date=21 November 2014 |work= The Advertiser |url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/taxpayers-fund-government-consultant-goran-roos-lavish-meals-fines-and-wines/story-fni6uo1m-1227131327870 |accessdate = 2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Opposition claimed that Roos had spent almost $40,000 during the period October&amp;ndash;November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Goran Roos |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-22/goran-roos/5911266 |website = ABC News |date= 22 November 2014 |accessdate = 2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Government rejected the controversy, calling it "petty payback from the Liberal Party" following Roos' involvement in the submarine debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Economic expert's taxpayer-funded expense claims 'excessive', SA Opposition says |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-22/economic-expert-expense-claims-excessive-opposition-says/5911256 |date= 22 November 2014 |website = ABC News |accessdate = 2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hossein Hedayati''' is an [[Iran]]ian [[Tycoon|business tycoon]] who most notably purchased [[Steel Azin F.C.]] and invested into [[Persepolis F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persianleague.com/the-news/1-latest-news/7162-gahar-was-transformed-into-steel-azin.html |title=Gahar was transformed into Steel Azin |publisher=PersianLeague.com |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
Hedayati gained popularity among a large group of [[Football (soccer)|football]] fans in Iran, after joining the board of directors at [[Persepolis F.C.]] which saw him invest large sums of money into the Persian giants. He is also the owner of [[Steel Azin F.C.]], since 2007. While always a controversial figure for his unknown background, there has never been a doubt about his influence on Iranian football. After his takeover of [[Ekbatan FC]] he transformed a struggling [[Azadegan League]] side, into a dominant force in the [[Persian Gulf Cup]]. That team also included [[Ali Karimi]] who was often the cause of trouble at the club. Following a dispute with the then team [[CEO]], Sardar Hajilou, Ali Karimi was punished for an indefinite time. Hedayati did not want to kick him out of the club due to their friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/news/14/asia/2010/08/15/2072098/steel-azin-fc-sack-midfielder-ali-karimi-for-refusing-to Aug 15, 2010 6:00:00 PM]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually though, the player's contract was terminated, but the clubs downfall continued. The Ali Karimi ordeal was only a small issue at a club which was known for causing a media stir and six weeks before the end of the season, a team which included players like [[Mehdi Mahdavikia]] was relegated from the [[Persian Gulf Cup]].

His investments were seen as advertisement and sort of an audition, before a looming privatization of [[Persepolis F.C.]]. It never materialized though, and he soon left the board of directors, sighting "strategic differences" with fellow members. [[Steel Azin F.C.]] was later relegated from the premier league. Often dubbed as the "Abramovich of Iran", Hedayati, purchased [[Malavan F.C.]] in 2012, but gave up control before the season was over. During the same year, he made a takeover bid for [[Gahar Zagros F.C.|Gahar Zagros]], which caused for controversy, as he would become the owner of two teams in the same league. He later withdrew the offer. He is still regarded as one of the top candidates to take over [[Persepolis FC]] should it become available.

The '''International Association of Financial Executives Institutes''' ('''IAFEI''') is the premier global society of financial executives. Founded in 1969, it connects financial executives around the world with a global membership of more than 15,000 senior level finance executives, mainly [[chief financial officer]]s across 18 national institutes. It is an international, [[non-profit]] and non-political [[professional association]] domiciled in Switzerland with its secretariat in the Philippines ([[Makati City]]).

== Aims ==
IAFEI promotes networking opportunities for member institutes and their individual members, to build a wider understanding of financial practices throughout the world and the furtherance of their international compatibility and evolution, and the promotion of ethical considerations and best practices of [[financial management]] throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iafei.org/bylaws.html By-laws] at the association website&lt;/ref&gt;

IAFEI works to advance the finance profession through the activities of its technical working committees, through hosting and partnering with global, regional and national conferences, and through a number of expert publications including the ''IAFEI Quarterly'', a digital journal of record.

The [[IAFEI World Congress]] is held annually since 1969. The congresses rotate among continents each year and are organized by the responsible national member institute on behalf of IAFEI. The 43rd IAFEI World Congress was held in conjunction with the 6th CFO Summit Emerging Europe &amp; CIS in October 2013 in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="Congress website"&gt;[http://43iafeiworldcongress.pl/ Congress website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103093611/http://43iafeiworldcongress.pl/ |date=2013-11-03 }} (in Polish, partly in English)&lt;/ref&gt; The 44th IAFEI World Congress was to be held on October 2014 in [[Manila]], hosted by the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finex.org.ph/news/256-presidents-notes-february-2013 President's Notes from February 2013] at the FINEX website&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The First International Congress of Financial Executives took place 1969 in [[Marbella]], Spain and was hosted by the Spanish institute for finance executives (AEEF). At this event a new head organization for national institutes was created, with a legal situs in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="WHU"&gt;Frederik Niklas Kuhn, ''Elite Role and Context: The Construction of the CFO in the German Business Field'', Institute of Management Accounting and Control, WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management, Pressel, Remshalden 2011, [http://api.edoweb-rlp.de/fedora/objects/edoweb:4406561/datastreams/data/content p 35]&lt;/ref&gt; At the second world congress ([[Brussels]] in 1970), 55 representatives of 15 member institutes finalized the creation of the association. IAFEI was founded by the financial executives institutes of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Spain, United Kingdom and the combined institutes of the United States of America and Canada (today: [[Financial Executives International (FEI)|FEI - Financial Executives International]]), which played a key role.&lt;ref name="WHU"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">The '''International Society for Labour and Social Security Law''' is an international association whose purpose is to study [[Labour law|labour]] and social security law at the national and international level, to promote the exchange of ideas and information from a comparative perspective, and to encourage collaboration among academics, lawyers, and other experts within the fields of labour and social security law.

Founded in 1958, the ISLSSL is composed of national affiliates whose members are scholars, union and management lawyers, judges, government officials, arbitrators, industrial relations and human resources specialists, and others interested in promoting international exchange of ideas and information and in developing collaboration among experts in the fields of labor, employment and employee benefits law.

The current members of the Executive Committee are Steven L. Willborn (Chair), George Nicolau, Vice-Chair, and Alvin L. Goldman, Secretary-Treasurer.

For many of those active in issues in the workplace, the internationalization of labor law and relations is becoming a reality.  To highlight just a few areas in this field of growing attention to the global legal landscape, those in academia work on issues of comparative labor and employment law, union lawyers consider international aspects of comprehensive corporate campaigns in support of the objectives of their clients, and management attorneys are increasingly called upon to give advice on the international ramifications of the employment policies of their employer clients. 

==World Congress==
The ISLSSL conducts a World Congress every three years and Regional Congresses (open to registrants from all regions) during the interim years. These meetings allow members both to combine travel with expanded understanding of how labor and employment law operate elsewhere and explain their system to others. ISLSSL conferences also facilitate development of new personal contacts and promote important scholarship, education and training in the fields of comparative and international labor law, employment law, and related fields. 

In recent years, ISLSSL World Congresses were convened in Jerusalem in 2000, in Montevideo in 2003, in Paris in 2006, in Sydney, Australia in 2009 and in Santiago, Chile in 2012. A World Congress will be hosted in Cape Town, South Africa in 2015. 

==Regional branches==
The ISLSSL maintains several regional branches. Recent Western Hemisphere Regional Congresses have been held in Lima, Peru; Querétaro, Mexico; and in the Dominican Republic. Recent Asian Regional Congresses were hosted in Manilla and Taipai, and recent European Regional Congresses were held in Stockholm, Bologna, Sevilla (2011) and Dublin (2014). In addition, the U.S. Branch sponsored a one day conferences in Chicago in May 2005 and in Philadelphia in 2012.

==Publications==
The U.S. Branch of the ISLSSL and the [[University of Illinois]] College of Law publish ''The Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal'', a quarterly law journal which publishes articles in the field of comparative and transnational labor and employment law. The journal publishes comparative analysis articles on labor law, employment policy, labor economics, worker migration, and social security issues. Many articles focus on legal systems in developing countries or post-colonial nations with emerging or new legal systems. The target audience for the journal is academics, practicing attorneys, policy makers, students, workers and labor movement officials and activists. The journal's stated policy is to make the publication readable and of practical value to officials in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cllpj.law.illinois.edu/ ''Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed 06.21.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 he became Assistant Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Minnesota]], Associate Professor of Sociology in 1980 and Professor of Sociology from 1986 to 2001. From 1989 to 2001 he was also Professor of Strategic Management and Organization at the University's [[Curtis L. Carlson School of Management]].

== Work ==

=== Interorganizational relations ===
In the 1985 article "Interorganizational Relations" in the ''Annual Review of Sociology,'' Galaskiewicz outlined the field of study on interorganizational relations. He identified three fields:&lt;ref name="Ga 1985, 281"&gt;Galaskiewicz (1985, p. 281)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Resource procurement]] and allocation
* [[Political advocacy]], and 
* [[Organizational legitimation]].

In the literature on interorganizational relations on resource procurement and allocation, Galaskiewicz further explained "analysts have focused on power dependency and the problems of overcoming environmental uncertainty. In studying interorganizational Relations within arenas of political advocacy, students have paid special attention to coalition formation and efforts at collective action. In studying interorganizational relations within arenas of organizational legitimation, analysts have examined organizational efforts at identifying with highly legitimate community and/or societal symbols."&lt;ref name="Ga 1985, 281"/&gt;

=== Social network analysis ===
In their 1986 "Advances in social network analysis," Galaskiewicz and [[Stanley Wasserman]] address:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the issue of how effectively to apply the latest developments in social network analysis to behavioural and social science disciplines. Topics examined include: ways to specify the network contents to be studied; how to select the method for representing network structures; how social network analysis has been used to study interorganizational relations via the resource dependence model; how to use a contact matrix for studying the spread of disease in epidemiology; and how cohesion and structural equivalence network theories relate to studying social influence. The book also offers some statistical models for social support networks.&lt;ref&gt;Galaskiewicz and Wasserman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6745">The term "'''knowledge commons'''" refers to information, data, and content that is collectively owned and managed by a community of users, particularly over the Internet. What distinguishes a knowledge commons from a [[commons]] of shared physical resources is that digital resources are [[Rivalry (economics)|non-subtractible]]; that is, multiple users can access the same digital resources with no effect on their quantity or quality.&lt;ref name="ostrom"&gt;{{cite book |title= Understanding Knowledge as a Commons - From Theory to Practice |url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EQM07412.pdf|last= Hess |first= Charlotte |author2=Ostrom, Elinor  |year= 2007 |publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-262-08357-7 |pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual background ==

The term 'commons' is derived from the medieval economic system ''[[the commons]]''. Today, the knowledge commons act as a frame of reference for a number of domains, including [[open education|Open Educational]] resources such as the MIT [[OpenCourseware]], free digital media such as Wikipedia, [[Creative commons]]–licensed art, open-source research,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua M. Pearce, "[https://www.academia.edu/1861756/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability Open Source Research in Sustainability]", ''Sustainability: the Journal of Record'', '''5'''(4), pp. 238-243, 2012. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/sus.2012.9944 DOI] [https://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1867941/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability free and open access]&lt;/ref&gt; and open scientific collections such as the [[Public Library of Science]] or the [[Science Commons]], [[Free Software]] and [[Open Design]]. According to research by Charlotte Hess and [[Elinor Ostrom]],&lt;ref name="ostrom"/&gt; the conceptual background of the knowledge commons encompasses two intellectual histories: first, a European tradition of battling the enclosure of the "intangible commons of the mind",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle |first1=James |year=2003 |title=The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain |journal=Law and Contemporary Problems |publisher= |volume=66 |issue=1-2 |pages=33–74 |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/66LCPBoyle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123190230/http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/66LCPBoyle/ |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened by expanding intellectual property rights and privatization of knowledge. Second, a tradition rooted in the United States, which sees the knowledge commons as a shared space allowing for free speech and democratic practices, and which is in the tradition of the town commons movement and commons-based production of scholarly work, [[open science]], open libraries, and collective action.&lt;ref name="ostrom"/&gt;

The production of works in the knowledge commons is often driven by [[collective intelligence]] respectively the wisdom of crowds and is related to knowledge communism as it was defined by [[Robert K. Merton]], according to whom scientists give up [[intellectual property rights]] in exchange for recognition and esteem.

Ferenc Gyuris argues, that it is important to distinguish "information" from "knowledge" in defining the term "knowledge commons". He argues that "knowledge as a shared resource" requires that both information must become accessible and potential recipients must become able and willing to internalize it as 'knowledge'. ''"Therefore, knowledge cannot become a shared resource without a complex set of institutions and practices that give the opportunity to potential recipients to gain the necessary abilities and willingness"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gyuris |first1= Ferenc |year= 2014 |title= Basic education in communist Hungary. A commons approach |journal= International Journal of the Commons |publisher= |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |pages= 531–553 |url= http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/458/401 |doi=10.18352/ijc.458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyleft ==

A main principle of the knowledge commons is that the traditional "[[copyright]]" is being replaced by "[[copyleft]]". Copyleft licenses grant licensees all necessary rights such as right to study, use, change and redistribute—under the condition that all future works building on the license are again kept in the commons.
The most popular applications of the 'copyleft' principle are the [[GNU]] Software Licenses (GPL, LGPL and GFDL by Free Software Foundation) and the [[share-alike]] licenses under [[creative commons]].

He was Jewish, and having been sent to [[Auschwitz]] in 1942, served as the [[concentration camp]]'s ''tatowierer'' ([[tattooist]]) until the camp was liberated near the end of [[World War II]]. He did not speak publicly about his wartime experiences until after the death of his wife in 2003 due to fears of being perceived as a Nazi collaborator.&lt;ref name="Obit G"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Heather|title=Obituary: Lale Sokolov|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/10/obituaries.mainsection|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prasad|first1=Ritu|title=The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-42568390|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in Korompa, [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now Krompachy&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;, [[Slovakia]]), on 28 October 1916&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;. In April 1942, Sokolov was part of the transport of Jewish prisoners to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; Upon arrival, he was tattooed with the number 32407.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; He was set to work constructing housing blocks for the expanding camp but soon became ill with [[typhoid]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Having recovered, he became the assistant to Pepan, the then ''tetovierer'' ([[tattooist]]) of the camp.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Pepan "disappeared" roughly four weeks later and Sokolov took over as the ''tetovierer''.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; As such, he joined the [[Politische Abteilung]] and had an [[SS]] officer assigned to monitor him.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; His job meant he was "a step further away from death than the other prisoners", and he received a number of benefits such as a single room, extra rations, and free time when his work had been completed.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; 

Lale met Gisela "Gita" Furman in July 1942 while tattooing an all-female group of new arrivals:&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; he tattooed Gita with the number 34902.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He had used his relatively privileged position to keep her alive by sending her extra food and messages through his personal guard, and having her "moved to a better work station".&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He was also involved in trading [[contraband]] (including jewellery) that given to him by fellow prisoners with locals in return for food and provisions.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Two days before the liberation of Auschwitz by [[Red Army|Soviet troops]] (on 27 January 1945), Sokolov was moved to the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; He escaped that concentration camp, and returned to his native place, then part of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Knowing only Gita Fuhrmannova's name, he went to [[Bratislava]], the main entry point for returning survivors, to search for her.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; After weeks of searching, she stepped out into the street in front of his horse.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; The couple married in 1945, and he changed his surname from [[Eisenberg (surname)|Eisenberg]] to the more Russian-sounding [[Sokolov (surname)|Sokolov]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He then opened a factory in [[Bratislava]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; During this time, he was involved in collecting money in support of the creation of the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; This activity and the nationalisation of industry by the country's communist government, resulted in him being imprisoned and having his business seized.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He was soon released and the couple emigrated to Australia in 1948.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;

In Australia, Sokolov and his wife settled in [[Melbourne]] and opened up a clothing factory.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; Their only child, Gary, was born in 1961.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Though his wife visited Europe a number of times, Sokolov never returned.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Following Gita's death in 2003, he finally felt able to speak about his war-time experience having feared that he would be perceived as a [[Kapo (concentration camp)|collaborator]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He would be interviewed by Heather Morris over the next three years, and she would write a book about his life which was published in 2018.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He died in 2006, and is survived by his son.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

[[Tan Sri]] [[Datuk|Dato]]' ''' Loh Boon Siew''' ({{zh|c=駱文秀|p=Luò Wénxiù}}; 1915 – 1995) also known as “Mr Honda”, was a [[Penangite]] [[tycoon]] and the first sole distributor of [[Honda]] [[motorcycle]]s in [[Malaysia]].

==Early life==
Boon Siew was born in [[Hui'an County]], [[Fujian]], [[China]]. He spent his childhood collecting pig dung (used as fuel) to make a living. Aged 12, he arrived in [[Penang]] from China with five friends, among them Loh Poh Heng and Loh Say Bee. He could speak only [[Hokkien]] and had virtually no formal education. He worked as an apprentice car mechanic upon his arrival.

==Business==
At age 18, Boon Siew purchased 11 buses using his $2,000 in savings. He reconditioned the buses and sold them for $12,000. Next, he used the money he earned to buy another 39 buses. In 1942, during World War II, his money was confiscated by the invading Japanese army.  After World War II ended in 1945 and the Japanese were defeated, he started selling bicycles, tires and [[motorcycle accessories]], and soon he expanded his business to [[used car]]s, transports and buses.

In the 1950s, Boon Siew went into property development with his friends Say Bee and Poh Heng by building residential villas in Taman Saw Kit in Penang. His work is continued by his Boon Siew Group.

Boon Siew arranged to meet with Mr. [[Soichiro Honda]], the [[Honda Super Cub]]'s creator, and quickly convinced him to set up a Honda subsidiary in Malaysia.

The first Malaysian Honda showroom was set up on Pitt Street in Penang, very near the home of Boon Siew. The Japanese Honda Motor Co Ltd soon appointed Boon Siew the sole distributor for Honda motorbikes in the country, as the first 50 units of Honda 4-stroke Cub were being imported into Malaysia.

A factory was built in Penang to assemble the Honda Cub and the Honda motorcycle assembled in Malaysia was renamed the ''Boon Siew Honda''. The Honda Cub became the best selling motorcycle in Malaysia and Boon Siew was recognised as the first person to bring the Honda Cub motorcycles into [[Southeast Asia]]. The popular Cantonese word ''[[Cub 仔]]'' (transcribed as "kapchai" in informal Malay), which means "small (Honda) Cub" and is now a generic for small [[underbone]] motorcycles in Malaysia, originates from the Honda Cub.

Boon Siew also played a role in the brief merger between [[Kwong Wah Yit Poh]] and [[The Star (Malaysia)]] in 1974, and helped with the establishment of the [[Lam Wah Ee Hospital]] and the Penang Old Folks Home.

He died at the age of 79 on 16 February 1995. To memorialize his contributions to the automotive industry, a road called ''Jalan Loh Boon Siew'' was named after him in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]].

'''Medivir''' is a Swedish [[biotech]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish pharma firm Medivir partners GVK Bio for drug research|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/swedish-pharma-firm-medivir-partners-gvk-bio-for-drug-research/articleshow/47694003.cms|website=The Economic Times|accessdate=1 December 2016|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medivir focuses its research focus on [[oncology]] and particularly on innovative pharmaceuticals that meet substantial unmet medical needs. The pharmaceutical development work is conducted both in-house and through partnerships, usually with global pharmaceutical companies. 
Medivir has a leading expertise in the design of [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s and in the science of [[nucleotide]]s and [[nucleoside]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medivir website|url=http://www.medivir.com/|website=Medivir|accessdate=13 December 2016|date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Medivir is listed on the [[Nasdaq Stockholm]] Mid Cap List.

==Oncology==
In 2016 Medivir announced that it would focus its research on cancers of [[orphan drug|high unmet medical need]], where existing therapies are not very successful and there is a great opportunity to provide real benefit to patients who have few treatment options. Some cancer types of particular interest to Medivir include [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] (HCC), [[glioblastoma multiforme]] (GBM) and [[pancreatic cancer]], which are all highly aggressive diseases with poor treatment options and very low overall survival rates on the best current treatments today. HCC is a liver cancer derived from [[hepatocyte]] cells. HCC is one of the most common cancers worldwide and late stage HCC has a mean overall survival of only 9–11 months on the best available treatment today. Medivir motivated the transition from its origin in [[retroviral drug]]s to oncology by it being a logical extension of their expertise in liver disease from earlier work on [[hepatitis C]] to this area.

==Notable ongoing projects==
*Remetinostat, [[Histone deacetylase inhibitor|HDAC inhibitor]] for [[Cutaneous T cell lymphoma]].
*Birinapant, [[Diablo homolog|SMAC mimetic]] for [[neoplasm|solid tumours]].
*Miv-711 [[Cathepsin K]] inhibitor for [[osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medivir portfolio on website|url=http://www.medivir.com/our-projects|website=Medivir|accessdate=25 May 2018|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Philip Kwok Chi-kuen''', [[Silver Bauhinia Star|SBS]], [[Justice of Peace|JP]] ({{zh-t|郭志權}}; born 6 December 1938) is a Hong Kong businessman and politician.

==Biography==
Kwok was born on 6 December 1938 to Kwok Lam-po and Sylvia Li Yuet-sheung.&lt;ref name="webb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kwok, Philip Chi Kuen 郭志權|work=Webb-site Who's Who Database|url=https://webb-site.com/dbpub/natperson.asp?p=2488}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Kwok Chuen, was the founder of the [[Wing On|Wing On Company]], one of the major Chinese department stores, while his mother, Sylvia Li, was the daughter of Li Shek-pang, the founder of the Li family, one of the [[four big families of Hong Kong]].

Kwok was educated at the [[St. Paul's Co-Educational College]] and graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with a bachelor's degree of science in Physics. He later obtained master and doctoral degrees in Physics in [[Harvard University]]. He worked as a researcher at the [[IBM]] after his studies.

He returned to Hong Kong to help his family business at Wing On in 1970 and became the chairman of the company in 1983. During the Hong Kong dollar crisis in 1985, the [[Wing On Bank]] was bailed out by [[Hang Seng Bank]]. For this reason Kwok resigned from the chairman of the company and remained as director.

He was an appointed member of the [[Urban Council]] and was the vice-chairman of the [[Progressive Hong Kong Society]] headed by the then member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive]] and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Councils]] [[Maria Tam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=香港勱進會開始招會員|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po|page=5|date=27 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, he was appointed by the Beijing government to the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee]] and became its vice-chairman. He formed the [[Group of 89]], a conservative faction consisting of businessmen and professionals who advocated for a slower pace of democratisation in the committee.

He first joined the [[New Hong Kong Alliance]] headed by [[Lo Tak-shing]] in 1989 but soon quit the party over the controversy of the political model of the SAR government after 1997.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|pages=222–7|title=Elections and Political Mobilisation: The Hong Kong 1991 Direct Elections|url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/1372/1/U074586.pdf|first=Pang-kwong|last=Li|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he co-founded the [[Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong]], a conservative pro-business party with other Group of 89 members including [[Hu Fa-kuang]] where he became the founding vice-chairman. He was appointed [[Hong Kong Affairs Adviser]] in 1993.

Kwok is appointed member of the Council of the [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hong Kong Gazette|url=http://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20050903/egn20050903297.pdf|work=Hong Kong Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was made [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1979. In 2003, he was awarded [[Silver Bauhinia Star]].&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt;

==Personal life==
He is also an honorary non-voting member of the [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]] and chairman of the Shotokan Karate International of Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt; He currently resides at the Holly Court, 1 Holly Road, [[Happy Valley, Hong Kong]].

Kwok is married to Maxine Kwok Li Yuen-kwan, daughter of Dr. Li Shu-pui and [[Ellen Li]]. He has four children, Jason, Desmond, Renee and Edwin.&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt;

'''PreTesting Company''' is a full-service [[Market research]] company founded in 1985 that specializes in print, television, and radio ad [[copy testing]].

==History==
PreTesting Company was founded in 1985 by American inventor and market researcher Lee Weinblatt. After beginning his career at Perception Research, Weinblatt started Telcom Research, a company that manufactured recorders that used an infrared beam to track a viewer as he watched a commercial in a research setting. Weinblatt sold the company in 1983.&lt;ref name=NYT1990&gt;Andrews, Edmund L. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D8163BF931A15754C0A966958260 "Technology;  Delving Into the Consumer Unconscious"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 22, 1990. Accessed December 23rd, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Weinblatt started PreTesting Company in order to provide advertising companies with insights into the effectiveness of their print, radio, and TV ads.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Philip H. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E1EFC3B5F167493C0A91789D85F438785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22lee%20weinblatt%22%20teaneck&amp;st=cse "Advertising; Approaches to Personnel Search"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 2, 1977. Accessed July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The company tests subjects in situations where they are unaware of how - and why - they're being tested, ensuring authentic, unbiased results. &lt;ref name=LATIMES1990&gt;Horowitz, Bruce [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-15/business/fi-300_1_advertising-research "Advertising Message Often Lost in the Medium, Researchers Say"], ''[[LA Times]]'', May 15th, 1990. Accessed December 23rd, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saccadic Eye Movement==
PreTesting Company’s most advanced innovation to date has been a recording device that tracks movements of the eye, called [[saccade]]s. Through saccadic eye tracking, Pretesting Company can determine not only where a viewer is looking as he’s watching an ad, but also how visually stimulating the ad is.&lt;ref name=CNNMONEY&gt;Wasserman, Todd [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/03/01/8401029/ "An Eyeball Test for Better Ads"], ''[[CNN]]'', April 3rd, 2007. Accessed December 23rd, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These results can help companies gauge whether their ads are visually stimulating enough to keep the viewers attention, or in contrast, whether they're so visually stimulating that no actual information is absorbed. &lt;ref name=CNNMONEY/&gt;

[[File:Purchase Order Request Form.jpg|thumb|An example of a purchase order request from a [[travel agent]].]]
A '''purchase order''' ('''PO''') is a [[Trade|commercial]] document and first official offer issued by a [[buyer]] to a [[vendor (supply chain)|seller]], indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. It is used to control the purchasing of products and services from external suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Dobler
 | first = Donald W
 |author2=Burt, David N
  | title = Purchasing and Supply Management, Text and Cases
 | edition = Sixth
 | year = 1996
 | publisher = McGraw-Hill
 | location = Singapore
 | pages = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchase orders can be an essential part of [[enterprise resource planning]] system orders.

The issue of a purchase order does not itself form a [[contract]]. If no prior contract exists, then it is the [[Offer and acceptance#Acceptance|acceptance]] of the order by the seller that forms a [[contract]] between the buyer and seller.

== Overview ==
Companies use purchase orders for several reasons. Purchase orders allow buyers to clearly and explicitly communicate their intentions to sellers. They may also help a purchasing agent to manage incoming orders and pending orders. Sellers are also protected by POs in case of a buyer's refusal to pay for goods or services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.loyno.edu/purchasing/purchase-order-benefits|title=Purchase Order Benefits|publisher=[[Loyola University New Orleans]]|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purchase orders provide benefits in that they streamline the purchasing process to a standard procedure. Commercial lenders or [[financial institution]]s may provide financial assistance on the basis of purchase orders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are various [[trade finance]] facilities that almost every financial institution allows business people to use against purchase orders such as:

# Before shipment credit facility
# Post shipment credit facility
# Trade finance facility
# Foreign bill purchase credit facility
# Bill retirement credit facility
# Order confirmation
# Followup

The purpose of purchase orders is to procure materials for direct consumption or for stock, procure services, cover customer requirements using external resources, or procure a material that is needed in plants from an internal source (Long distance intra-plant stock transfers). They may also place once-only procurement transactions and optimize purchasing by taking full advantage of negotiated conditions or for optimal utilisation of existing transport capacities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Creating a purchase order is typically the first step of the [[Purchase-to-pay|purchase to pay process]] in an [[ERP system]]. Purchase orders may require a [[Stock keeping unit|SKU code]]. Within an ERP system, a purchase order can be created manually, and may require confirmation or changes via editing. Within an ERP system (such as in [[SAP SE|SAP]]), manually creating a purchase order within the system may look something like "Logistics -&gt; Materials Management -&gt; Purchasing -&gt; Purchasing Order -&gt; Create" and providing a Transaction Code. This document type will be chosen from the screen. A vendor code lookup may need to be selected for a purchase order steps, as well as things like organization group and company code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.sap.com/2015/08/14/sap-erp-user-manual-of-purchase-order/|title=SAP ERP User Manual of Purchase Order {{!}} SAP Blogs|website=blogs.sap.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal ==
Although a typical purchase order may not contain contract language (in fact most contain little more than a list of the goods or services the buyer desires to purchase, along with price, payment terms, and shipping instructions), the purchase order is a specially regarded instrument regulated by the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] or other similar law which establishes a purchase order as a contract by its nature. Yet despite the nature of the purchase order as a contract, it is common to accompany the acceptance of a purchase order with a legal document such as the terms &amp; conditions of sale, which establish specific or additional legal conditions of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requisition Order and Purchase Order|url=https://www.digitalpurchaseorder.com/requisition-order-and-purchase-order/|publisher=DPO|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]] states that purchase orders should generally be issued on a fixed-price basis, but provision is also made for unpriced purchase orders to be issued where "it is impractical to obtain pricing in advance of issuance of the purchase order".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%2013_3.html FAR - Subpart 13.3—Simplified Acquisition Methods], accessed 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formats ==

===Electronic purchase orders===
Many purchase orders are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over the [[Internet]]. It is common for electronic purchase orders to be used to buy goods or services of any type online.

There are lots of names/terms for Electronic Purchase Orders. It is sometimes known as: E-Procurement, E-Purchasing, E-Purchase Requisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zaharasoftware.com/procurment-purchase-order-software/|title=Procurement Vs Purchasing - Why you need Purchase Order Software|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are normally all referring to Electronic Purchase Orders.

===''Non-electronic purchase orders''===
''The record of purchase order in most business firms are still on paper and thus there is a need for proper purchase order format. Many users wish to have professional formatting for purchase orders for several reasons. A company may wish to have a strong understanding of purchase transactions or to know the basic requirements of purchase order. It may also make it part of business documentation, which makes the process easier while keeping record of all transactions and to have good impression on the client or customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aztemplates.org/purchase-order-template.html/|title=MS Word Format for Purchase Order|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">'''SMART''': SCOTLAND is a high profile innovation support grant scheme in Scotland aimed at small and medium-sized firms. It supports commercially viable projects which represent a significant technological advance for the UK sector or industry concerned.

The SMART grant supports technology development through:

* Technical and Commercial [[Feasibility Study|Feasibility Studies]]. These should involve early stage [[R&amp;D]], the outcome of which will enable informed decisions on the technical and commercial feasibility of a new [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Business process|process]].
* Research and Development Projects that aim to develop a pre-production prototype of a new product or process.

==Criteria==
Applicants must be based in [[Scotland]] or planning to set up in Scotland and must meet the [[European Community]] definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise which in summary means they must:

* have less than 250 employees (full-time equivalent world-wide, including partners and executive directors) and have either
* an annual [[Revenue|turnover]] not exceeding EUR 50 million  and/or
* an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.

Awards are judged according to technological, intellectual property, financial and commercial aspects of the application as well as the management expertise available to the business. In addition other aspects such as the project's implications on society such as environmental impact, [[sustainability]] and [[health and safety]] may be taken into account.

==History==

The grant was launched in Scotland as SMART in 1999 and by April 2007 grants had been given to almost 400 businesses across Scotland amounting to some £14.7 million funding.[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2006/01/26121910] In April 2007 SMART was relaunched [http://www.ettc.co.uk/news/detail.asp?newsid=4354] as  the "SMART:SCOTLAND" Programme .

'''Shlomo Eliahu''' ({{lang-he|שלמה אליהו}}, born 18 January 1936) is an [[Israel]]i businessman, billionaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forbes Staff|title=Profile of Shlomo Eliahu in Forbes' 2011 Billionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/shlomo-eliahu/|work=Forbes Magazine|publisher=Forbes.com LLC|accessdate=5 December 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] between 1978 and 1981.

==Biography==
Born in [[Baghdad]] in 1936, Eliahu made [[aliyah]] to Israel in 1950 with his parents and eight siblings. After initially being based in a [[ma'abara]] at Beit Lid, his family moved to Kiryat Shalom.

Shortly after immigrating he started working for [[Migdal (company)|Migdal]]. After being sacked in 1953, he began working for Binyan as an insurance agent. He was exempted from [[national service]] in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] as he had suffered from [[polio]], and in 1955 started an independent insurance company in the Shapira neighbourhood of [[Tel Aviv]]. In 1966 he established the Eliyahu insurance company, which initially dealt only with car insurance, before expanding to other forms of insurance.

In 1977 he joined the new [[Democratic Movement for Change]] (Dash) party, and won a place on its Knesset list. Although he failed to win a seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]], he entered the Knesset on 15 February 1978 as a replacement for [[Meir Zorea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=9 Knesset Members in the Ninth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; When the party split later in 1978, he joined the [[Democratic Movement (Israel)|Democratic Movement]].

On 8 July 1980 Eliahu and [[Shafik Assad]] left the Democratic Movement to establish [[Ahva (political party)|Ahva]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits amongst Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were later joined by [[Akiva Nof]], both Nof and Assad left the party by the end of the Knesset session, leaving Eliahu as its only member. The party did not run in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981 elections]], and Eliyahu lost his seat.

Today Eliahu owns a large stake in [[Bank Leumi]] and 23% of the [[Union Bank of Israel]]. According to [[Forbes]], in 2011 he was ranked as Israel's 12th richest person with a net worth of $1.1 billion (USD).&lt;ref name=F&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/shlomo-eliahu/] Forbes, 11 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He is divorced with four children.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

The '''South Asian Regional Trade Union Council (SARTUC)''' is a [[federation]] of [[national trade union center]]s whose geographic scope covers South Asia. SARTUC's mission is to promote workers' rights within its member nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurn.info/topic/trade/icftu_0604.pdf International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

The South Asian Regional Trade Union Council was formed in January 1988 by some of the affiliates of the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (now the [[ITUC]]) in countries belonging to the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC)—[[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The Indian trade union center [[Indian National Trade Union Congress]] and [[Hind Mazdoor Sabha]], were the founding members of SARTUC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-old.itcilo.org/actrav/english/calendar/2001/A3_2380/work/Country_reports/india.doc Pijush Chakraborty.

'''Thomas Kavaningilamo 'Tom' Alweendo''' (born 17 March 1958 in Omusheshe, [[Oshana Region]]) is a [[Namibia]]n businessperson and politician who has been Minister of Mines and Energy since 2018. In 2003, he became the first Namibian [[Governor of the Bank of Namibia]] when he replaced [[Jafaar bin Ahmad]] of [[Malaysia]]. From the mid-1990s until 2001, he was head of [[Air Namibia]].

Alweendo earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[South Africa]] and a [[Master of Business Administration]] from the [[University of Wales]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Alweendo, Thomas K. | publisher = [[Parliament of Namibia]] | accessdate=9 March 2018  | url=http://www.parliament.na/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;id=964:alweendo-tom-a&amp;catid=104&amp;Itemid=1479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Governor of the Bank of Namibia, he maintained the [[Namibian dollar]]'s linkage with the [[South African rand]]. He also raised concerns about increasing amounts of government debt and questioned whether expenditures on education produced better results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=14 Tom Alweendo] Namibia Institute for Democracy  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611171207/http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=14 |date=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Alweendo was appointed to lead the National Planning Commission. When [[Hage Geingob]] took office as President in March 2015, he confirmed him in this post, now named Minister in the Presidency in charge of the National Planning Commission.&lt;ref name=Costly&gt;{{cite news | title=Costly Democracy | last1=Immanuel | first1=Shinovene | last2=Mongudhi | first2=Tileni | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=20 March 2015 | pages=1–2 | url=http://www.namibian.com.na/indexx.php?id=24690}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Cabinet reshuffle in February 2018, Alweendo became Minister of Mines and Energy, swapping positions with [[Obeth Kandjoze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=President reshuffles Cabinet—Vice President relieved of duties | last=Matthys | first=Donald | newspaper=[[Namibia Economist]] | date=8 February 2018 | url=https://economist.com.na/32603/general-news/president-reshuffles-cabinet-vice-president-relieved-of-duties/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tournament In Management and Engineering Skills''' ('''TIMES''') is the only European-wide business case competition of its kind, and has been organised since 1994.

The European case study competition TIMES was created in 1994 by Andreas Swahn, Vice President of Activities for ESTIEM as project manager. After having visited the London School of Economics in 1993 and the case competition CHAMP (Challenge in Management Perspectives). The first competition was organised with semi-finals in Stockholm (Sweden), Braunschweig (Germany), Lisbon (Portugal) and St. Petersburg (Russia). The final was held in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) and the team of Stockholm became the first winner of TIMES. The qualifying case for all students the first year was related to LKAB and steel production processes. The semi-final case was with Ericsson Mobile and about optimizing investment for mobile masts. The final in Eindhoven consisted of two cases, the first was from the Rotterdam Port and the second case in cooperation with Philips Electronics.

Today, it is considered a prestigious and highly acclaimed case study competition. Two qualification rounds are required to be selected for participation in the TIMES Final. Before reaching this final stage, all the participants first take part in a local qualification round at their home university after which the winning teams are allowed to take part in one of the Semi-Finals, which are organised in six locations in different parts of Europe. The Final brings together the best teams to compete on three case studies. In between the intense competition days, participants are offered the opportunity of visiting sponsoring organisations as well as learning about the host country through visits and presentations.

TIMES is the flagship project of [[ESTIEM]], that has established an extensive network covering 32 countries and 81 universities, reaching as many as 70,000 students. Every year the tournament attracts around 250 top teams being challenged in their management and engineering skills and competing for the title of “Industrial Engineering and Management Students of the Year”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6365">In larger school systems, a head teacher principal is often assisted by someone known as a vice-principal, deputy principal, or assistant principal. Unlike the principal, the vice-principal does not have quite the decision-making authority that the principal carries. Although they still carry nearly the same authority among students, vice-principals do not have the same power on the board. Experience as an assistant principal is often a prerequisite for advancement to a principalship.

==Job description==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Assistant principals aid the principal in the overall administration of the school. Some assistant principals hold this position for several years to prepare for advancement to principal jobs; others are career assistant principals. They are primarily responsible for scheduling student classes, ordering textbooks and supplies, and coordinating transportation, custodial, cafeteria, and other support services. They usually handle student discipline and attendance problems, social and recreational programs, and health and safety matters. They also may counsel students on personal, educational, or vocational matters. With the advent of site-based management, assistant principals are playing a greater role in ensuring the academic success of students by helping to develop new curricula, evaluating teachers, and dealing with school-community relations—responsibilities previously assumed solely by the principal. The number of assistant principals that a school employs may vary, depending on the number of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010–11 Edition |chapter=Education Administrators |chapter-url=https://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos007.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219002203/https://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos007.htm |archive-date=19 February 2012 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], [[United States Department of Labor]] |access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Education==
Most schools require elementary, middle, and high school principals to have a master’s degree in education administration or leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Management/Elementary-middle-and-high-school-principals.htm#tab-4 Elementary, Middle, and High School Principals : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most principals also have experience as teachers. [[Master's degrees]] in educational administration are offered at a number of [[universities]] around the [[United States]] including the [[University of North Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unt.edu/pais/grad/geadm.htm UNT | Graduate Studies | College of Education | Masters of Educational Leadership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ball State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/distance/academics/programs/graduate/masters/maedadmin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215092536/http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/distance/academics/programs/graduate/masters/maedadmin |date=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drexel University]], [[Ashland University]], [[Northeastern University]], and the [[University of Scranton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Master of Science in Educational Administration|url=http://www.uscranton.com/online-educational-administration/|publisher=[[University of Scranton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==
In American schools, it is often his or her duty to handle matters such as student discipline, parent conference meetings, asset inventory and ordering, school improvement planning, bus and lunch supervision, and teacher observations. Additionally, assistant principals frequently serve as testing coordinators, training staff on procedures related to standardized assessment, as well as accounting for testing materials.{{Or|date=December 2007}} In addition to these duties, assistant principals are instructional leaders.

Most importantly however, in the event that something happens to the principal, such as an extended leave of absence, the assistant principal would act as the interim principal. Because of this, many see this position as a stepping-stone to the larger role of principal and is often used as such.  In most schools, the vice principal forgoes all teaching duties in order to address broader educational issues.

In the United Kingdom, most secondary schools have Assistant Principals (or traditionally known as Assistant Head Teachers), with the Vice-Principals (or traditionally known as Deputy Head Teachers) managing them. Their duties vary from school to school; however, usually Assistant Principals and Vice-Principals support school initiatives in maintaining standards, behavior, Key Stages 3–5, teaching and exam timetabling, inclusion, the curriculum and student learning, and overall accountability in the school. They can also carry out performance appraisals and teacher observations.  Furthermore, principals/head teachers/headmasters/headmistresses are beginning to have more autonomy on how they will structure their school's senior leadership team and what each member's role will be. These additional roles that are found in English secondary schools can lead to senior leadership/administrative teams to be as large as 8–12 people, depending on the school's size and its demographics (e.g., Head Teacher, 2–4 Deputy Head Teachers, 3–8 Assistant Head Teachers). In contrast to the US, most Assistant Head Teachers and Deputy Head Teachers teach 1–2 courses on top of their administrative duties.

'''Waste Industries''' is a provider of non-hazardous [[solid waste]] and [[recycling]] collection, transfer, and disposal company in the southeast United States. The company has over 1.9 million service points.

The company is dedicated to creating a better world through its Full Circle Project. In 2007, Waste Industries also began the process of reducing its number of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] trucks with compressed natural gas powered trucks.

On October 10, 2018, the company announced its intentions to merge with a Canadian company for an undisclosed amount. The company will continue to operate as Waste Industries in the US and will be headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article219777470.html?#emlnl=Breaking_Newsletter&amp;id=c25vd2Nvb2w3NzZAZ21haWwuY29t|title=Raleigh’s Waste Industries merging with Canadian company|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
Waste Industries was created as a waste disposal firm in 1970 by [[Lonnie Poole Jr.]] who used funds from the sale of his Ohio home and borrowed money from Gregory Poole, Owner of a local construction company, to create the company.  The initial idea of Waste Industries stemmed from market research Poole conducted, while concepting a new mobile [[landfill]] [[compactor]] while he was living in Ohio. His compactor idea failed, but Poole soon discovered his calling, and started Waste Industries in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/waste-industries-usa-inc/ North Carolina History Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years, of stagnation, the company grew in the 1970s and quickly expanded past Wake county and the city of Raleigh. By 1980 the company had reached ten million dollars in revenue and soon after, they named their first employee, Jim Perry, as President and Chief Operating Officer.

In 1997, with an estimated revenue of $100 million, Waste Industries went public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=442466 Nasdaq Filing]&lt;/ref&gt; The company continued to grow that year with an estimated 20 branches, 11 transfer stations and 4 recycling facilities under its belt.

In 2000 Waste Industries went through a tech revolution and updated its website. With the website upgrade they also became the first company on the east-coast to incorporate [[e-billing]] for waste pick-up customers. 
In 2008, the company went private again and experienced a restructuring in its management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/waste-industries-usa-inc-announces-agreement-to-go-private-for-38-00-per-share-808189 ThomasNet News]&lt;/ref&gt; Vern Poole, son of original owner Lonnie Poole and long-time company leader, would become Chairman and CEO and would create his personal board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2008/12/29/daily24.html Triangle Business Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Yorston would later become Chief Operating Office,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste360.com/personnel-moves/waste-industries-names-yorston-chief-operating-officer Waste 360 News]&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Grissiom Chief Financial Officer, and Lisa Inman Senior Vice President and General Counsel.

In 2010, [[North Carolina State University]] unveiled a wall display highlighting original Waste Industries founder Lonnie Poole as well as the progress Waste Industries has made over the years as it has grown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poole.ncsu.edu/index-exp.php/news/article/poole-college-installs-wall-display-to-honor-benefactor-lonnie-c.-poole-jr NC State University Board]&lt;/ref&gt;  Poole is a longtime supporter of NC State and provided major investments to create their graduate business degree programs after switching schools to get his MBA due to the lack of a program upon his graduation from NC State with his bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/education/story/8792708/ WRAL News]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the company was valued at $570 million with over 1600 employees.

On October 10, 2018, the company announced it was going to be sold off to a Canadian Company, [[GFL Environmental]], for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article219777470.html?#emlnl=Breaking_Newsletter&amp;id=c25vd2Nvb2w3NzZAZ21haWwuY29t|title=Raleigh’s Waste Industries is being sold to Canadian company|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Full Circle Project==
In 2014, Waste Industries created the Full Circle Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/polkfishwrap/news/local/waste-industries-gives-to-local-organizations/article_64224b22-a8c2-11e5-9578-e331948f61f8.html North Georgian News]&lt;/ref&gt; The Full Circle Project allows employees and customers to give to their favorite non-profit through Waste Industries. To date, Waste Industries has given close to $1 million in non-profit donations.

The '''Yale Entrepreneurial Society''' (YES) is a student-run [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[501(c)(3)]] organization dedicated to encouraging [[entrepreneurship]] and business development in the [[New Haven, Connecticut]] area.  YES was founded in 1999 by [[Yale]] undergraduates Sean Glass and Miles Lasater.  Its social entrepreneurship program—focused on not-for-profit and socially responsible organizations—was founded the same year, with efforts led by fellow student David Pozen.  Today, YES members include Yale [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]], professional students, and faculty, as well as several hundred Yale alumni around the world.

The Yale Entrepreneurial Society's mission is the following:
# Create and foster a community of entrepreneurs at Yale; promote the belief that entrepreneurial principles can be applied to any endeavor
# Offer resources helpful to students at any level of engagement with entrepreneurship
# Offer educational and networking opportunities to foster new venture creation; teach the [[lean startup]] model
# Organize campus and regional events to encourage innovation at Yale
# Publish information concerning new, events and opportunities through the magazine

== Yale Venture Challenge ==
The Yale Venture Challenge was previously known as Y50K. It is held annually in April, and awards up to $25,000 in grants to student entrepreneurs. The competition involves a 10-minute pitch and a 5-minute Q&amp;A in front of a panel of judges.

The Y50K was YES's annual business plan competition. The competition ran annually after its inception in 2000.  Each year, a total of $50,000 in [[Grant (money)|grants]] were given away to new businesses in the Yale community.  In 2004, a [[biotechnology]] category was added to the usual two categories of competition, [[social entrepreneurship]] and for-profit.  The Y50K also had a strategic alliance with [[StudentBusinesses.com]] that allows the competition to be conducted completely online. In the early 2010s Y50K was changed to YVC, open only to students at Yale University.

==Elevator Pitch Competition==
The Elevator Pitch Competition promotes idea generation and presentation from any student in the Yale community. Pitches are no longer than three minutes, so this competition is accessible to more students since a fully hashed-out business plan is not required. [[Barry Nalebuff]] has traditionally been the judge for this competition. Past winners include Ovote, Prepd, and Junzi Kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = welcome|url = http://www.junzi.kitchen/#bings|website = junzi kitchen|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Yale Entrepreneurial Magazine==
The [[yaleentrepreneur.com|Yale Entrepreneurial Magazine]], published and supported by the Yale Entrepreneurial Society, is Yale's only [[magazine]] of [[entrepreneurship]].  First published in 2001, the YE went out of publication in 2003 until being relaunched in the fall of 2013 by Nicole Clark and Aaron Lewis.

== Speakers ==
YES brings notable entrepreneurs and successful businessmen and women to speak at Yale's campus. Past speakers include: 
* [[Warren Buffett]], business magnate
* [[Evan Spiegel]], founder of [[Snapchat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Snapchat CEO talks innovation, growth|url = http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/11/07/snapchat-ceo-talks-innovation-growth/|website = yaledailynews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional events==
YES hosts a variety of events throughout the year to highlight entrepreneurship at Yale and in the greater New Haven and Connecticut regions.  While venues vary from year to year, common events usually include YES New York, YES Boston, and the Innovation Summit (hosted in New Haven). Students annually visit tech companies and startups in New England including [[Google]], [[Etsy]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Spotify]], [[Rent the Runway]], and [[Venture for America]]. The organization has also held events in [[Silicon Valley]].

'''Yousif bin Abdulrahman Al-Hassan Al-Fakhro''' (Arabic: يَوسف بن عَبدالرحمن بن عَبدالله آل حسن آل فخرو) (lived 1871–1952), also known as '''Yousif Al Oud''', was one of the most prominent and wealthiest [[businessman|businessmen]] in [[Bahrain]].

He was known to finance the government of Bahrain at the time and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army.

He was one of the few businessmen that filled in to establish the first school in Bahrain in 1919, [[Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifiya]].

==Children==
He had five sons:
* Ahmed (died 1979)
* Mohammad (died 1989)
* Abdulla (died 2001)
* Ibrahim (died 2001)
* [[Ali bin Yousif Fakhro]] (died 2008)
