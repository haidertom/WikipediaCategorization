'''Abaporu''' (from [[Tupi language]] "abapor'u", abá (man) + poro (people) + 'u (to eat), "the man that eats people") is an oil painting on canvas by the [[Brazil]]ian painter [[Tarsila do Amaral]], executed in 1928 as a birthday present to the writer [[Oswald de Andrade]], her husband at the time.

It is considered the most valuable painting by a Brazilian artist, having reached the value of $1.4 million, paid by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] collector [[Eduardo Costantini]] in an auction in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.christies.com/auction/department/id/35/?KSID%3D523d1dd1498ad408aada0b3754073473 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212093745/http://m.christies.com/auction/department/id/35/?KSID=6367e1ef5d2e7ddc8de8c48c96d549a1 |archivedate=2013-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently displayed at the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires (Spanish: Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires, [[MALBA]]) in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121127121902/http://www.malba.org.ar/web/coleccion_obra.php?idobra=46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition: ''one man, the sun and a cactus'' – inspired Oswald de Andrade to write the Anthropophagite Manifesto and consequently create Anthropophagic Movement, intended to "swallow" European culture and turn it into something culturally very [[Brazil]]ian.

== The Painting ==
[[Tarsila do Amaral|Tarsila]] described the subject of the painting as  "a monstrous solitary figure, enormous feet, sitting on a green plain, the hand supporting the featherweight minuscule head. In front a cactus exploding in an absurd flower."&lt;ref&gt;Amaral, Aracy A. ''Tarsila: Sua Obra e Seu Tempo'', São Paulo, Tenenge, 1986 p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; This "monstrous"  figure is, in fact, human. An unadorned, undressed, sexless, and ageless human whose anatomy has been distorted.  Beginning with a huge foot and hand at the bottom of the picture, the figure slowly shrinks to a tiny head at the top.

The background of the painting suggests a natural setting. Here, earth is depicted as a simple small green mound upon which the subject sits. The vegetation is represented  by a cactus at the right of the figure and a golden sun or flower which crowns the composition. The sky is a plain pale blue background.

The style of Abaporu can be traced back to the [[France|French]] modernists, specially [[Fernand Léger]], who taught Tarsila in [[Paris]] in 1924. However, the closest resemblance of Abaporu can be found in the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Joan Miró]], who also painted a figure with an oversized foot in 1924.

== Provenance ==

After Tarsila's death in 1973, the painting passed to [[Pietro Maria Bardi]]'s art gallery, who sold it to the art collector Érico Stickel. In 1984 the painting was purchased by the amount of $250 thousand by Raul de Souza Dantas Forbes, who then auctioned the painting at [[Christie's]] [[New York City]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.br/istoe-temp/edicoes/1993/artigo70233-1.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306192606/http://www.terra.com.br/istoe-temp/edicoes/1993/artigo70233-1.htm |archive-date=2014-03-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Afternoon''''' is a [[feminist]] play written in 1883 by [[Ouida]]. It features a man, Earl L'Estrange, who marries a peasant girl, Claire Glyon. L'Estrange grows disillusioned with her and it seems she drowned herself. However, twenty years later he falls in love with a reclusive artist famous for her work, which turns out to be Claire herself, who has not drowned at all. For the remainder of the play, Claire and her friend Laura mock L'Estranger with biting wit, and he in turn eventually concedes that he had not valued his wife as he should have.

Lee was born in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire]] and attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1899 and subsequently qualified as a solicitor before becoming a director of the Sheffield cutlery manufacturers Walker &amp; Hall. He was a territorial officer with the [[Sherwood Foresters]] from 1903 and on the outbreak of [[World War One]] was mobilised with his regiment and sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1916 he served as a Major in Dublin where the Foresters suffered heavy losses during the [[Easter Rising]] and was awarded the DSO. He was then transferred to the HQ of the British Expeditionary Force as a Lieutenant-Colonel where he was appointed military censor. He had several well-recorded disputes with war artists, particularly [[William Orpen]] and [[Christopher Nevinson]] whose ''Paths of Glory'' Lee attempted to censor. Nevinson, however, still exhibited the work at a London exhibition in 1918 with a piece of brown paper across it bearing the word "Censored". Lee was awarded an OBE for his war work.&lt;ref name=IWMpaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20211|title=''Paths of Glory'' by CRW Nevinson |year=|accessdate=6 May 2017|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the war, Lee returned to Sheffield and his cutlery firm. In 1932 he served as [[Master Cutler]] &lt;ref&gt;http://925-1000.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=43796&lt;/ref&gt; of the Company of Cutlers. Lee, who had become a friend of William Orpen continued the friendship until Orpen's death in 1931 and was responsible for commissioning Orpen to paint [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] in 1923 on behalf of [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] of which Lee was a committee member..&lt;ref name="Upstone"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Upstone|publisher=Imperial War Museum &amp; Philip Wilson Publishers|year=2005|title=William Orpen: Politics Sex &amp; Death |ISBN=0 85667 596 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's personal papers were donated to the [[Imperial War Museum]] after his death, by his son Peter Murray Lee who had served as an intelligence officer in World War Two.

'''''The Battle of Orsha''''' is a painting of the [[Battle of Orsha]], which was fought on September 8, 1514 between the allied forces of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Jagiellon Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (to the right hand side of the painting) against the [[Vasili III]]'s army of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] (left) as part of the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]].

The painting, the only work of its kind in Polish Renaissance painting, is in the [[National Museum in Warsaw]]. The anonymous "Master of the Battle of Orsha" was probably one of the court painters-cartographers, from his technique and style probably an artist from the circle of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. Meticulous details suggest the artist was himself a witness to the battle. There is a self-portrait of the artist as an unarmed figure in German costume (near bottom, right of centre), sitting on a tree stump on the bank of the [[Dnieper river]], looking at the battle, while framing his fingers to compose a view.

According to one hypothesis the author of the picture was the German artist [[Hans Krell]], court painter of [[Louis II of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=120|title=Polish Commonwealth Treasures: On the History of Polish Collecting from the 13th Century to the Late 18th|author1=Dorota Folga-Januszewska |author2=Andrzej Rottermund |author3=Lech Majewski |publisher=Wydawca Bosz |year=2008 |isbn=8387730815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
The image shows a [[bird's eye view]] of several stages of the battle; the same characters appearing in different places - Hetman [[Konstanty Ostrogski]] is shown three times. Details of equipment and weapons and portraits of the commanders have been recreated realistically and with great accuracy, showing, among others, such scenes as emptying water from armor after crossing the river. Some scenes verge on the grotesque; others emphasize the cruelty of the battle.

The image has not been preserved in its entirety. Careful analysis suggests that it was initially taller and included the horizon. Its asymmetrical composition suggests that 1/5 of the width was trimmed from the left. The two conflicting columns of heavy infantry, presumably once the center of the image, are now shifted to the left. The established date of the image is 1520-1534.

The '''Bishop Arts District''' is a small shopping and entertainment district in north [[Oak Cliff]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]), near the intersection of Bishop Street and Davis Street.  Bishop Arts is immediately southwest of [[Downtown Dallas]].

== About ==
The area was originally developed as warehouses and shops in the 1920s.  In the 1930s, a trolley stop along Davis became Dallas' busiest trolley stop.  The district began a decline in the mid-60's through the beginning of the 80's. The reasons for the decline included the rise of the shopping mall, the loss of sizable tenants such as Astor theater and Goodier Cosmetics, neighborhood demographic changes and finally the fact that buses began to replace streetcars making trolley stops like Bishop and Seventh useless.

In the fall of 1984, Jim Lake saw a bargain in the now run down storefronts and began buying up property. He said, "Hopefully we'll make money on this in the future, but in the first three to five years I'm gonna feed it." Lake said of his decision to buy the property, "I just thought it needed saving." As a sign of his commitment, Lake provided, rent-free for a year, space for a police storefront. This was an important element in the area's security and sense of community. Continuing through the 1990s and 2000s, renovations have taken place to transform the two city blocks into a walkable, urban environment, although the surrounding area has yet to undergo revitalization. Murals, brick pavers, and other street elements have polished the rough look of the warehouses and have made the area a popular leisure and dining destination.&lt;ref name="bishopartsdistrict.com"&gt;[http://www.bishopartsdistrict.com Bishop Arts District] - Main page.  Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area culture has continued to mature with the expanding Oak Cliff Film Festival, which has garnered media attention from Texas Monthly and New York Times.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/us/dallas-has-its-own-indie-film-scene-and-now-a-festival.html] - News Article. Retrieved 13 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the district is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[North Bishop Avenue Commercial Historic District]].

The ordinary '''Bondi–Metzner–Sachs (BMS) group''' B is the common asymptotic [[symmetry group]] of all radiating, [[Asymptotically flat spacetime|asymptotically flat]], Lorentzian [[spacetime]]s. This means that B is currently the best candidate for the universal symmetry group of [[General Relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/33/1/028/meta |title=Generalizations of the BMS group and results}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally proposed in 1962 by H. Bondi, M. G. van der Burg, and A. W. Metzner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5803.pdf |title=Notes on the BMS group in three dimensions: I. Induced representations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Convent Thoughts''''' is a painting by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Charles Allston Collins]] which was created between 1850 and 1851. Collins sent it to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1851 where it was exhibited.

The painting shows a nun contemplating a [[passion flower]] symbolising the crucifixion of Christ. She is standing in a walled garden full of minutely detailed flowers. In her left hand she holds an [[illumination (manuscript)|illuminated]] [[missal]], held not as though she had been reading it but so as to show us the Annunciation and the Crucifixion. Her costume shows that she is a novice, presumably meditating on her final vows.

The flowers were painted in the Oxford garden of [[Thomas Combe]], an early collector of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and the model was his housemaid, Frances Sarah Ludlow, later Mrs Brucker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stsepulchres.org.uk/burials/brucker_william.html Friends of St Sepulchre's Cemetery]. Retrieved 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Combe bought the painting; in 1894 he bequeathed his art collection to the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]] and ''Convent Thoughts'' remains in the Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objects/paintings/WA1894.10.php Charles Alston Collins (1828 - 1873) ''Convent Thoughts''] Ashmolean. Retrieved 27 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Collins was never formally a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, he was in sympathy with their aims and painted in their immensely detailed style. ''Convent Thoughts'' has a place in the history of Pre-Raphaelitism, because the tide of opinion, initially hostile, was to some extent turned by a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on 13 May 1851 from the influential critic [[John Ruskin]] praising the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Academy exhibition, in particular ''Convent Thoughts'', about which he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I happen to have a special acquaintance with the water plant ''Alisma Plantago'' ... and as I never saw it so thoroughly or so well drawn, I must take leave to remonstrate with you, when you say sweepingly that these men 'sacrifice ''truth'' as well as feeling to eccentricity.' For as a mere botanical study of the Water Lily and ''Alisma'', as well as of the common lily and several other garden flowers, this picture would be invaluable to me, and I heartily wish it were mine."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, John. ''Collected Works'' ed. E.T.Cook and Alexander Wedderburn. London, George Allen, vol. XII p.321&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a curious footnote to this story, it has recently been pointed out&lt;ref&gt;Deas, Elizabeth. "The Missing Alisma: Ruskin's Botanical Error". ''Journal of Pre-Raphaelite Studies'' (Fall 2001): 4-13&lt;/ref&gt; that there is in fact no ''[[Alisma|Alisma Plantago]]'' in the picture.

'''Dia Art Foundation''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that initiates, supports, presents, and preserves art projects. It was established in 1974 as the Lone Star Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Russeth (October 23, 2009), [http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/33035/philippe-vergne-on-the-future-of-dia/?printer_friendly=1 Philippe Vergne on the Future of Dia] ''ARTINFO''.&lt;/ref&gt; by Philippa de Menil, the daughter of Houston arts patron [[Dominique de Ménil|Dominique de Menil]]&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt; and an heiress to the [[Schlumberger]] oil exploration fortune; art dealer [[Heiner Friedrich]], Philippa's husband; and Helen Winkler, a Houston art historian.&lt;ref name="Remains of the Dia"&gt;[[Bob Colacello]] (September 1996), [http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1996/09/colacello199609 Remains of the Dia] ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dia wanted to support projects "whose nature or scale would preclude other funding sources."&lt;ref name="nyt1989"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/03/arts/to-get-his-museum-opening-in-92.html?pagewanted=all |title=To Get His Museum, Opening in '92| date=October 3, 1989 | work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-08-24 | first=Grace | last=Glueck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Dia", taken from the Greek word meaning "through," was chosen to suggest the institution's role in enabling artistic projects that might not otherwise be realized.

Dia holds a major collection of work by artists of the 1960s and 1970s, on view at [[Dia:Beacon]] that opened in the [[Hudson Valley]] in 2003. Dia also presents exhibitions and programs at Dia:Chelsea in New York City, located at 535, 541 and 545 West 22nd Street. In addition to its exhibition spaces at Dia:Beacon and Dia:Chelsea, Dia maintains and operates a constellation of commissions, long-term installations, and site-specific projects, notably focused on land art, nationally and internationally. Dia's permanent collection holdings include artworks by artists who came to prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, including [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Agnes Martin]], and [[Andy Warhol]]. The art of this period represented a radical departure in artistic practice and is often large in scale; it is occasionally ephemeral or site-specific.

Currently, Dia commissions, supports, and presents site-specific installations and long-term exhibitions of work by these artists, as well as those of younger generations.

==History==
Founded in 1974 as the Dia Art Foundation, it first patronized a group of artists that included [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Marian Zazeela]].&lt;ref name="Remains of the Dia"/&gt; They got stipends, studios, and archivists in anticipation of one-man museums that Dia planned for several of them.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[[Michael Kimmelman]] (September 15, 1996), [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/arts/at-dia-fresh-wounds-and-a-fresh-start.html At Dia, Fresh Wounds and a Fresh Start] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Philippa's husband, Francesco Pellizzi, was on the original six-member board, and Dominique and Christophe de Menil were on the advisory council. Starting in 1979, the foundation hired architect [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]] and started looking for reinforced-concrete structures suitable for showing art.&lt;ref name="Remains of the Dia"/&gt; Gluckman helped locate Dia's present Chelsea building on West 23rd Street for a planned [[Cy Twombly]] museum, a performance space for [[Robert Whitman]] on West 19th Street, and the Mercantile Exchange on Harrison Street for Young and Zazeela. In 1980, Dia opened the Masjid Al-Fara, a Sufi [[mosque]]&lt;ref&gt;Anne Barnard (August 13, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/nyregion/14mosque.html In Lower Manhattan, 2 Mosques Have Firm Roots] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; replete with Flavin light works and living quarters for [[Muzaffer Ozak]], in a former firehouse at 155 Mercer Street.&lt;ref name="Remains of the Dia"/&gt;

The financial difficulties during the 1980s reduced Dia's annual expenditures from $5&amp;nbsp;million in 1984 to 1.2&amp;nbsp;million in 1987, accompanied by Heiner Friedrich's departure and the end of Philippa de Menil's financial support though she continued to hold a position on Dia's board.&lt;ref name="brink1"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/arts/dia-foundation-back-from-brink-opens-new-center.html?pagewanted=all | title=Dia Foundation, Back From Brink, Opens New Center| work=The New York Times | date= October 7, 1987| accessdate=2009-08-28 | quote= But under Mr. Friedrich's direction, Dia's ambitions proved grandiose, and it overreached financially. Now he no longer has a role in Dia and, although Mrs. Friedrich is a member of the board, she no longer makes financial contributions. | first=Grace | last=Glueck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippa de Menil's mother, [[Dominique de Menil]], stepped in, ousted Friedrich and installed Ashton Hawkins, an executive vice president at the [[Metropolitan Museum]], as Dia's chairman. Along with Hawkins, the new board members included Lois de Menil, [[John C. Evans]], future United States Supreme Court justice [[Stephen Breyer]], [[Margaret Douglas-Hamilton]], and [[Herbert Brownell Jr.|Herbert Brownell]].&lt;ref name="Remains of the Dia"/&gt; The board then hired as director Charles Wright and curator Gary Garrels. The mosque was removed from 155 Mercer Street. La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela had to leave the Harrison Street building, which was then sold for $5.5&amp;nbsp;million. By the end of 1987, real-estate and art sales had brought in about $17 million to pay the debt and start an endowment. The foundation was renamed the Dia Center for the Arts and a program of poetry readings, performances, lectures and publications was begun.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries==
{{main article|Dia:Beacon}}
Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries in [[Beacon, New York]], is located in a former printing plant built in 1929 by [[Nabisco]]. When it opened in 2003 with {{convert|160000|sqft|m2}} of exhibition space,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/09/arts/dia-center-to-open-a-museum-upstate.html&lt;/ref&gt; it became one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] museums to open in the United States since the [[Museum of Modern Art]] opened in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="patron"&gt;{{cite news| title= The Patron Gets a Divorce| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/magazine/14dia-t.html?pagewanted=all| work=The New York Times| date= October 14, 2007| accessdate=2009-08-25 | first=Joe | last=Nocera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is sited on {{convert|31|acre|ha}} on the banks of the [[Hudson River]], and is adjacent to {{convert|90|acre|ha}} of riverfront parkland.  It is {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of [[New York City]].

Each gallery was designed specifically for the art it contains. The space is limited to the works of 25 artists, including:
*[[Andy Warhol]]'s 1978–79 multipart work ''Shadows'', which wraps around the walls of a single big room;&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;
*selections from [[Dan Flavin]]'s series of fluorescent light ''monuments to V. Tatlin'' (1964–81), displayed in a room the size of a [[American football field|football field]];&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;
*[[Richard Serra]]'s monumental steel sculptures ''Torqued Ellipses''; and
*[[Michael Heizer]]'s ''North, East, South, West'' (1967/2002).
The museum's galleries of paintings by [[On Kawara]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Blinky Palermo]], and [[Robert Ryman]] receive reflected north light from more than {{convert|34000|sqft|sqm}} of skylights.

Dia collaborated with [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]] and architect OpenOffice to formulate the plan for the museum building and its exterior setting. The grounds include an entrance court, and parking lot with a grove of flowering fruit trees and a formal garden, both of which were designed by Irwin.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', it cost $50 million to build, with [[Leonard Riggio]] contributing at least $35 million of that amount; the remainder of the construction funds came from the [[Lannan Foundation]] ($10 million),  Ann Tenenbaum and her husband [[Thomas H. Lee (businessman)|Thomas H. Lee]] ($2.5&amp;nbsp;million), among others.&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;  As of 2007 its annual operating costs are about $3&amp;nbsp;million a year.&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;

==Dia:Chelsea==
[[File:0109TIARA P1000552.JPG|thumb|Former home of Dia:Chelsea and current site of the X Initiative arts project.]]

Dia's exhibition program in New York City began in 1987 with the opening of a four-story converted warehouse at 548 West 22nd Street, called the Dia Center for the Arts. In keeping with Dia's mandate, the exhibitions, at what would be later renamed Dia:Chelsea, focused on individual artists, and typically offered an artist an entire floor on which to develop a new project or create a focused presentation of existing work. The exhibitions were on view for about one year to allow extended viewing.

Among the many artists who created site-specific exhibition projects for Dia are [[Robert Gober]], [[Ann Hamilton (artist)|Ann Hamilton]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Juan Muñoz]], [[Jorge Pardo (architect)|Jorge Pardo]], [[Jessica Stockholder]], [[Diana Thater]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]]. Others, including [[On Kawara]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Robert Ryman]], and [[Robert Whitman]], presented existing work in focused installations that responded to Dia's mandate and site.

In October 1987, when Dia:Chelsea opened its main space,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Saltz|Saltz, Jerry]], [http://www.vulture.com/2010/03/saltz_remembering_dia_at_the_e.html "Remembering Dia, at the End of an Era"], ''vulture.com'', March 12, 2010. Retrieved 2015-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; it attracted about 16,000 to 17,000 visitors a year. Before it closed for renovations in February 2004, attendance had grown to about 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Carol Vogel|date=May 9, 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09dia.html|title=Dia Art Foundation Plans an Upscale Move|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the repairs needed prompted the foundation to sell the building for $38.55 million in December 2007.&lt;ref name="obs2007"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://observer.com/2007/12/dia-leaving-chelseagallery-granddaddy-sells-building-for-385-m/ | title=Dia Leaving Chelsea—Gallery Granddaddy Sells Building for $38.5 M.| publisher=[[The New York Observer]]| date= December 11, 2007 | accessdate=2015-10-01| quote=The museum, housed in a four-story brick building, closed for renovations in 2004 but never reopened due to the extent of repairs needed. [Dia's director, Jeffrey] Weiss said he was pleased by the high sales price, and said the money will be invested and likely used to purchase its next space.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dia began as an institution dedicated to supporting long-term projects by living artists, and for several years, it was trying to raise money to build a space for such endeavors in Manhattan, after outgrowing its two locations on West 22nd Street in Chelsea and closing them in 2004.&lt;ref name="Randy Kennedy 2014"/&gt; The foundation's board abandoned plans on opening a museum at the entrance to the [[High Line]] in 2006 after losing its longtime director, [[Michael Govan]], and its chairman and benefactor, [[Leonard Riggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/arts/design/25muse.html | title=Dia Art Foundation Calls Off Museum Project | work=The New York Times | date=October 25, 2006 | accessdate=July 8, 2009 | author=Carol Vogel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 Dia's Director, [[Philippe Vergne]], announced plans to reopen in Chelsea on West 22nd Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Carol Vogel|date=November 5, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/arts/design/06vogel.html|title=Dia Plans to Return to Its Chelsea Roots|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, after years of negotiations, Dia bought the former Alcamo Marble building at 541 West 22nd Street, located between its former space at No. 545 and its existing six-story building at No. 535, for $11.5 million.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 2012"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Carol Vogel|date=May 24, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/arts/design/dia-outlines-plan-for-building-in-chelsea.html|title=Dia Outlines New Plan for Building in Chelsea|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside, these three existing brick buildings will be woven together to create three interconnected galleries on the ground floor. According to plans, the new Dia, designed by architect [[Roger Duffy]], will include 15,670 square feet of gallery space and 3,625 square feet of rooftop for outdoor exhibitions like [[Dan Graham]]'s ''Rooftop Urban Park Project'' (1991), an architectural pavilion fashioned from two-way mirrored glass that was originally installed on the roof of No. 548.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 2012"/&gt;

In 2015, incoming Dia Director Jessica Morgan reactivated three properties already owned by Dia in Chelsea at 535, 541 and 545 West 22nd Street, including re-launching the space at 545 West 22nd Street with an exhibition of [[La Monte Young]] and [[Marian Zazeela]].&lt;ref&gt;Anny Shaw (September 29, 2015), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/dia-abandons-plans-for-new-building-in-chelsea/ Dia abandons previous plans for new building in Chelsea] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; From September 2016, [[Hauser &amp; Wirth]] took over the old four-story space at 548 West 22nd Street as a temporary home while constructing its new building at no. 542. To adapt the space, the gallery enlisted [[Annabelle Selldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin (June 9, 2016), [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/arts/design/hauser-wirth-gallery-to-take-over-former-dia-space-in-chelsea.html Hauser &amp; Wirth Gallery to Take Over Former Dia Space in Chelsea] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Dia announced a multi-year plan to revitalize it's programmatic sites, including the renovation of Dia's current spaces at West 22nd Street to create a unified, 32,500-square-foot facility, including 20,000 square feet of integrated, street-level exhibition and programming space across their three contiguous buildings. The new, renovated Dia:Chelsea will open in Fall 2020 and will present exhibitions, public programs and lectures, and will return Dia’s bookstore to Chelsea. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/arts/design/dia-art-foundation-manhattan-beacon.html|title=Dia to Revitalize Its Constellation of Sites|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diaart.org/about/press/dia-reveals-comprehensive-multi-year-plan-to-strengthen-mission-and-revitalize-its-constellation-of-sites-in-new-york/type/text|title=Dia {{!}} About {{!}} Dia Reveals Comprehensive, Multi-Year Plan to Strengthen Mission  And Revitalize its Constellation of Sites in New York|last=Foundation|first=Dia Art|website=www.diaart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership with the Hispanic Society==
While Dia was not operating in Chelsea in the early 2000's, it partnered with [[The Hispanic Society of America]]. Dia commissioned a series of projects by contemporary artists to be installed at the Hispanic Society's [[Beaux arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] complex, on Broadway at 155th Street in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan. The partnership provided a venue at which Dia could present special projects accompanied by Dia publications and educational programs and enabled the Hispanic Society to engage a new audience. This multi-year collaboration began in the fall of 2007 with a new project by artist [[Francis Alÿs]] titled ''Fabiola'', and in late 2008 Dia presented [[Zoe Leonard]]: ''Derroetero''.

==Collections and installations==

===Permanent collection===
Over Dia's first ten years, its founders assembled a collection of a select group of artists. Among those whose work was commissioned and collected at that time are [[Joseph Beuys]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Imi Knoebel]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Whitman]], and [[La Monte Young]]. In 1979 the Lone Star Foundation (now the Dia Art Foundation) acquired ''Shadows'' (1978–79), the monumental painting installation by [[Andy Warhol]] consisting of 102 canvases, as a single entity from the artist during its inaugural exhibition at the Heiner Friedrich Gallery in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirshhorn.si.edu/info/press.asp?key=90&amp;subkey=536 "Andy Warhol: Shadows", September 25, 2011 - January 15, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710093421/http://hirshhorn.si.edu/info/press.asp?key=90&amp;subkey=536 |date=July 10, 2012 }} [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Dia gave the [[Menil Collection]] in Houston six of its best works by Twombly in anticipation of the Twombly Gallery that opened there in 1995.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 2013"&gt;Carol Vogel (June 27, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/arts/design/dia-foundation-to-sell-works-to-start-acquisition-fund.html Dia Foundation to Sell Works to Start Acquisition Fund] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the opening of [[Dia:Beacon]], Dia augmented its core collection with focused acquisitions. The first of these was made in 1997, when Board Chairman [[Leonard Riggio]] and his family gave the Foundation three sculptures from [[Richard Serra]]'s ''Torqued Ellipses'' series (1996–97), sculptures created for an exhibition at Dia:Chelsea; it was the first acquisition for Dia's permanent collection in over ten years, a $2 million purchase made by Riggio.&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt; With support from the [[Lannan Foundation]], the artists themselves, and others, the collection has expanded with gifts, purchases, and long-term loans of works by other artists from that same generation—[[Bernd and Hilla Becher]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Hanne Darboven]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[On Kawara]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Robert Smithson]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]]—as well as additional works by artists already represented.

In recent years, Dia has focused on broadening its collection to spotlight a more diverse and international mix of artists. Female artists who have been added to the permanent collection include [[Mary Corse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/blog/mary-corse-and-dorothea-rockburne-get-their-due-at-dia-beacon|title=Mary Corse and Dorothea Rockburne get their due at Dia: Beacon|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Nancy Holt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/design/dia-sun-tunnels-nancy-holt-land-art.html|title=Dia Acquires ‘Sun Tunnels,’ Its First Piece of Land Art by a Woman|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Dorothea Rockburne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/blog/mary-corse-and-dorothea-rockburne-get-their-due-at-dia-beacon|title=Mary Corse and Dorothea Rockburne get their due at Dia: Beacon|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Michelle Stuart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diaart.org/program/exhibitions-projects/michelle-stuart-exhibition|title=Dia {{!}} Program {{!}} Michelle Stuart|last=Foundation|first=Dia Art|website=www.diaart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anne Truitt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/02/02/dia-art-foundation-acquires-anne-truitt-works/|title=Dia Art Foundation Acquires Anne Truitt Works|last=Battaglia|first=Andy|date=2017-02-02|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, Dia acquired work by [[Kishio Suga]] and [[Lee Ufan]], bringing seminal work from the 1960s [[Mono-ha]] movement in Japan into the collection to promote greater understanding of work being made internationally during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/07/10/dia-art-foundation-acquires-works-by-lee-ufan-and-kishio-suga/|title=Dia Art Foundation Acquires Works by Lee Ufan and Kishio Suga|last=Twersky|first=Carolyn|date=2017-07-10|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diaart.org/about/press/dia-art-foundation-adds-works-by-lee-ufan-and-kishio-suga-to-its-collection/type/text|title=Dia {{!}} About {{!}} Dia Art Foundation Adds Works by Lee Ufan and Kishio Suga to Its Collection|last=Foundation|first=Dia Art|website=www.diaart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Robert Ryman]], a key Dia artist, donated 21 of his works to the institution, making Dia's Ryman holdings unparalleled in any other public collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diaart.org/about/press/dia-art-foundation-receives-historic-gift-from-robert-ryman-and-the-greenwich-collection-ltd/type/text|title=Dia {{!}} About {{!}} Dia Art Foundation Receives Historic Gift from Robert Ryman and The Greenwich Collection, Ltd.|last=Foundation|first=Dia Art|website=www.diaart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the Dia Art Foundation for the first time auctioned off 18 works at [[Sotheby's]], including pieces by [[Cy Twombly]] and [[Barnett Newman]], for $1.3 million.&lt;ref name="Remains of the Dia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Randy Kennedy 2013"&gt;Randy Kennedy (November 12, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/arts/design/dias-auction-of-artworks-is-to-proceed.html Dia's Auction of Artworks Is to Proceed] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the foundation announced its plan to sell another group of paintings and sculptures — including pieces by Twombly, Chamberlain and [[Barnett Newman]] — at Sotheby's, this time hoping to raise at least $20 million for an acquisition budget&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 2013"/&gt; and to pay for 30 works that have been on long-term loan to Dia from the Lannan Foundation.&lt;ref name="Randy Kennedy 2013"/&gt; In response, founders Heiner Friedrich and Fariha de Menil filed suit in [[New York Supreme Court]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=rf6z7BUxWPyOWxyia0TSuQ==&amp;system=prod FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 11/07/2013] [[New York Supreme Court]].&lt;/ref&gt; seeking an [[injunction]] against the foundation and Sotheby's while raising the possibility that some of the works might not be legally owned by Dia but constitute long-term loans from the Friedrichs.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy (November 7, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/nyregion/2-founders-of-dia-sue-to-stop-art-auction.html 2 Founders of Dia Sue to Stop Art Auction] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lawsuit was dropped shortly after,&lt;ref name="Randy Kennedy 2013"/&gt; and the consigned works raised $38.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Kazakina and Philip Boroff (November 14, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-14/warhol-crash-steve-cohen-s-richter-lift-sotheby-s-sale.html Warhol 'Crash', Steve Cohen's Richter Lift Sotheby's Sale] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term and affiliated projects===
Michael Govan, the former director of Dia under whose direction Dia:Beacon was constructed, estimates that before Philippa de Menil's family forced her to sharply cut back on funding&amp;mdash;an act precipitated by the [[1980s oil glut]]'s effect on the Schlumberger fortune&amp;mdash;Dia spent "at least $40 million" on a series of installations that Dia continues to maintain.&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt;

Among those 1970s and early 1980s projects are works by [[Walter De Maria]], including ''[[The Lightning Field]]'' (1977),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningfield.org/ Walter De Maria ''The Lightning Field'']&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Quemado, New Mexico]]; and ''The New York Earth Room'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthroom.org/ Walter De Maria ''The New York Earth Room'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Broken Kilometer'' (1979),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brokenkilometer.org/ Walter De Maria ''The Broken Kilometer'']&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]]. In addition, Dia maintains the Dan Flavin Art Institute, a former church in [[Bridgehampton, New York]] converted in the 1980s into an installation of works by [[Dan Flavin|Flavin]].&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt; The installation of work by [[Donald Judd]] and John Chamberlain, in [[Marfa, Texas]], was begun by Judd; Dia gave the project $4 million between 1980 and 1986, before cutting off the financial support due to Dia's financial crisis; a lawsuit threatened by Judd led to the establishment of the [[Chinati Foundation]]  with support from Dia.&lt;ref name="brink2"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/arts/dia-foundation-back-from-brink-opens-new-center.html?pagewanted=all | title=Dia Foundation, Back From Brink, Opens New Center| work=The New York Times | date= October 7, 1987| accessdate=2009-08-28 | quote= Dia had supported the installation from 1980 to 1986 with more than $4 million.

Under this arrangement, Dia has contributed its art and real-estate interests in Marfa, along with nearly $800,000 over five years to complete certain projects. | first=Grace | last=Glueck}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dream House'', a sound and light installation by LeMont Young and Marian Zazeela, located in New York City, was also initiated with Dia's support in the late 1970s.   Since 1987 Dia has sited several long-term projects in New York City, including [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[7000 Oaks|7000 Eichen]] (7000 Oaks)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diaart.org/ltproj/7000/ Joseph Beuys ''7000 Oaks''] from the Dia Art Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt; an installation of trees paired with basalt columns along West 22nd Street. This continues a project the artist began with Dia's sponsorship at Documenta 7, in Kassel, Germany, in 1982.

In 1999 Dia acquired Robert Smithson's ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1970),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiraljetty.org/ Robert Smithson ''Spiral Jetty'']&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Great Salt Lake]], Utah, as a gift from the estate of the artist. [[Max Neuhaus]]'s ''Times Square'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diaart.org/ltproj/neuhaus/ Max Neuhaus ''Times Square''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706234525/http://www.diaart.org/ltproj/neuhaus/ |date=2009-07-06 }} from the Dia Art Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt; a sound work installed on a pedestrian island in [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]] joined Dia's collection in 2002. Originally created in 1977, it was decommissioned in 1992 and reactivated in 2002. In 2018, Dia acquired [[Nancy Holt]]'s ''Sun Tunnels'' (1973-76) in [[Great Basin Desert]], Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diaart.org/about/press/dia-acquires-sun-tunnels-by-nancy-holt/type/text|title=Dia {{!}} About {{!}} Dia Acquires Sun Tunnels by Nancy Holt|last=Foundation|first=Dia Art|website=www.diaart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Dia continues its involvement with the development of [[Michael Heizer]]'s long-term work ''City'', in eastern [[Nevada]], and [[James Turrell]]'s ''Roden Crater'' project in the [[Painted Desert (Arizona)|Painted Desert]] in Arizona, which was begun in the 1970s with Dia's support. Dia has also collaborated with other institutions in realizing long-term projects, including [[The Andy Warhol Museum]], [[Pittsburgh]] (opened in 1994), and the [[Cy Twombly]] Gallery, [[Houston]] (opened 1995), both of which were created in part with gifts from Dia's permanent collection.

==Programs==

===Artists' Projects for the Web===
In 1995 as part of its efforts to explore new sites for the presentation of contemporary art, Dia initiated a series of internet commissions, thereby becoming one of the first arts organizations to foster artists' use of the internet as a medium. Its collection of web projects, which is available on its website, at www.diaart.org, includes works by [[Francis Alÿs]], [[David Claerbout]], [[Diller + Scofidio]], [[Molissa Fenley]], [[Susan Hiller]], [[Glenn Ligon]], [[Komar &amp; Melamid]], [[Feng Mengbo]], [[Lisi Raskin]], [[Allen Ruppersberg]], Shimabuku, [[Gary Simmons (artist)|Gary Simmons]], [[Stephen Vitiello]], [[Ezra Johnson]], [[Rosa Barba]], and Barbara Bloom.

===Public programs===
Dia's public programs are integral to its efforts to make the arts of our time accessible to a broad and diverse audience. Programming at [[Dia:Beacon]] includes a series of year-long temporary exhibitions as well as public programs designed to complement the collection and exhibitions, including monthly Gallery Talks, music performances by St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, and Community Free Days for neighboring counties. Since 2001 Dia has worked with the [[Beacon City Schools]] to develop an Arts Education Program that serves area students at all education levels, making Dia's collection a valuable resource to students and their teachers and families.

Programs in New York City include the Artists on Artists lecture series, which focuses on the work of artists in Dia's collection and exhibition programs, as well as periodic performances and other special events. Dia's collaboration with the Hispanic Society includes additional educational programs for local schools, as well as lectures and other public programs.

===Publications===
Dia's publication program produces books in conjunction with selected exhibitions, scholarly volumes on the permanent collection, and other program-related publications, audio works on CD, and multimedia works.

==Management==

===Funding===
The Dia Art Foundation is a tax-exempt [[charitable organization]]. Current programs are supported in part by funds from the members of the Board of Trustees, foundations (such as the Lannan Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts), and other friends of the institution. As of 2013, Dia' endowment stands at around $55 million.&lt;ref name="sothebys.com"&gt;Ted Loos (October 18, 2013), [http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/sothebys-at-auction/2013/10/dia-goes-back-to-the-future.html Sotheby's Magazine: Dia Goes Back To The Future] [[Sotheby's]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Board of Trustees===
Among others, the Dia Art Foundation's board includes collectors Frances Bowes and Howard Rachofsky.&lt;ref name="sothebys.com"/&gt; Under new director Jessica Morgan's leadership, the Greek shipping magnate [[George Economou (shipbuilder)|George Economou]], Ra Hee Hong Lee, Irene Panagopoulos, [[Jane Skinner]] and [[James Murdoch]] joined.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Bowley and Judith H.

'''Domain name scams''' are types of [[Scams in intellectual property|Intellectual property scams]] or [[confidence scam]]s in which unscrupulous [[domain name registrar]]s attempt to generate revenue by tricking businesses into buying, selling, listing or converting a domain name.  The [[Office of Fair Trading]] in the United Kingdom has outlined two types of domain name scams which are "Domain name registration scams" and "Domain name renewal scams".&lt;ref name=oft&gt;{{cite web|title=Domain name scams|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/business-advice/protect-your-business-from-scams/types/domain|work=Types of business scams|publisher=[[Office of Fair Trading]]|accessdate=27 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010102229/http://www.oft.gov.uk/business-advice/protect-your-business-from-scams/types/domain|archivedate=10 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Tim|title=Three domain name scams|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/07/12/three_domain_name_scams/|accessdate=27 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Register]]|date=12 July 2002&lt;!-- 15:31 GMT--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain slamming ==
{{anchor|slamming}}
'''Domain slamming''' (also known as unauthorized transfers or domain name registration scams) is a scam in which the offending [[domain name registrar]] attempts to trick domain owners into switching from their existing registrar to theirs, under the pretense that the customer is simply renewing their subscription to their current registrar. The term derives from [[telephone slamming]].

=== Prevention ===
In 2004, [[ICANN]], the domain name governing body, made changes to its policy for transferring domains between registrars. They introduced a single protective measure that can help prevent unauthorized transfers: [[domain locking]]. Critics, although advising owners to apply the new feature, said that this was an "unnecessary and customer-unfriendly change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rohde|first=Laura|title=ICANN domain transfer policy takes effect|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/icann-domain-transfer-policy-takes-effect-409|accessdate=22 July 2011|newspaper=[[InfoWorld]]|date=November 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lake|first=Matt|title=Why it's easier than ever to lose your domain|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6028_7-5581289-1.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|newspaper=[[CNET]]|date=November 22, 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211003443/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6028_7-5581289-1.html|archivedate=11 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== False offers to buy, or to find buyers ==
Scam methods may operate in reverse, with a stranger (not the registrar) communicating an offer to buy a domain name from an unwary owner.  The offer is not genuine, but intended to lure the owner into a false sales process, with the owner eventually pressed to send money in advance to the scammer for appraisal fees or other purported services.  By mimicking aspects of the legitimate sales process and agencies, the scheme appears genuine in the early stages. The prospect of an easy, lucrative sale disarms the owner's normal suspicion of an unsolicited offer from a stranger with no earnest value.  Since an actual transfer through the registration system is never involved, legal safeguards built into the official transfer process provide no protection.

== Fake trademark protection ==
Although less common than domain slamming, another domain name scam primarily coming from registrars based in China involves sending domain owners an e-mail claiming that another company has just attempted to register a number of domains with them which contain the targeted domain owner's trademark or has many keyword similarities to their existing domain name. Often, these domains will be the same as the one(s) owned by the targeted individual but with different TLDs (top-level domains). The scammer will claim to have halted the bulk registration in order to protect the targeted individual's intellectual property, and if the email recipient doesn't recognize the entity attempting to register these domain names, that they should respond immediately to protect their trademark. If the scam target does respond by email or by phone, the scammer will then try to get them to register these domain names for several years upfront with the registrar running this scam.&lt;ref name="pcw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/183803/beware_domain_registration_scams.html|title=Beware Domain Registration Scams|first=Amir|last=Lev|publisher=PCWorld Communications, Inc.|accessdate=2012-05-04|date=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variations of this type of scam include registrars that target their own existing customers with similar made-up threats of another entity trying to register the same domain as theirs under different TLDs. As well, some domainers are known to search for available TLDs for already registered domains, then emailing the owner of the registered domain and offering to sell the unregistered variations to him/her for a marked up amount. If the target agrees to the deal, the domainer will then purchase the domains on the spot for the regular $7~20 registration fee and immediately sell it back to the victim for a few hundred dollars.

== Timeline ==
This section outlines reported domain scams as a timeline of events, showing how they have evolved, the companies involved and the outcome of complaints.

* In 2001, the federal [[Competition Bureau]] (of Canada) issued a warning about documents that appeared to be invoices sent out by a business called the ''Internet Registry of Canada'' (a [[Brandon Gray Internet Services|Brandon Gray]] reseller{{Ref label|BrandonGray|1|a}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MARRON|first=KEVIN|title='Domain slamming' surfaces on the Web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/domain-slamming-surfaces-on-the-web/article1048676/|accessdate=12 July 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=Nov 6, 2002 &lt;!-- 9:03PM EST --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** "Complaints received by the Competition Bureau indicate that the mailings from the 'Internet Registry of Canada' give the impression that it is affiliated with the Government of Canada or that it is an officially sanctioned agency registering domain names in Canada. The 'Internet Registry of Canada' is not associated with any government agency," the Competition Bureau advisory stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charles|first=Bergeron|title=Competition Bureau Issues Warning to Canadians about Misleading Mailings for Internet Domain Name Registrations|url=http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00528.html|publisher=[[Competition Bureau]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824074521/http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00528.html|archivedate=2011-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[VeriSign]] was sued in 2002 for their actions in sending ambiguous emails informing people, often incorrectly, that their domain was about to expire and inviting them to click on a link to renew it. Renewing the domain resulted in the registration company being transferred to VeriSign from the previous registrar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/05/14/verisign_hit_with_slamming_lawsuit TheRegister.co.uk]: VeriSign hit with slamming lawsuit&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2002, the FTC shut down "TLD Network Ltd", "Quantum Management (GB) Ltd.", "TBS Industries Ltd." of London, England for selling bogus domain names ".USA", ".BRIT", which they deceptively marketed as usable suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/03/tld.shtm Federal Trade Commission: Court Shuts Down Website Selling Bogus Domain Names ".USA," ".BRIT," Deceptively Marketed as Useable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231621/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/03/tld.shtm |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  In April 2002, the FTC charged ''National Domain Name Registry'', ''Electronic Domain Name Monitoring'', ''Corporate Domain Name Monitoring'', and owner Darren J. Morgenstern, with making false and misleading statements to domain name holders whereby they duped consumers into needlessly registering variations of their existing domain names by deceptively contending that third parties were about to claim them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/04/morgenstern.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416014721/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/04/morgenstern.shtm |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2002, [[Register.com]] sued ''Domain Registry of America'' (a Brandon Gray reseller{{Ref label|BrandonGray|1|b}}), claiming the company illegally lured away thousands of customers by tricking them into transferring their domains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/Register.com-says-rival-duped-customers/2100-1024_3-955733.html Register.com says rival duped customers.

** In response to this, Alan Freeman, Relations Manager for ''DRoE'', said that the company - which also trades as ''Domain Registry of America'' and ''Domain Registry of Canada'' - had registered 1.1 million domains for customers and was registering between 5,000 and 7,000 new domains a day.&lt;ref name="droe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Tim|title=Domain Registry of Europe defends tactics, sues Tucows|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/07/17/domain_registry_of_europe_defends/|accessdate=12 July 2011|newspaper=The Register|date=17 July 2002&lt;!-- 12:58 GMT--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dovedale by Moonlight''''' is one of five paintings by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] which uses the picturesque valley of [[Dovedale]] as its subject. These paintings were sometimes made as pairs with one showing the view by day and the other by moonlight. Wright admitted that he had not observed this scene directly, "Moon lights &amp; fire lights are but a sort of work with me for I cant with impunity go out at night and study the former, &amp; the latter I have seen but once, and at a time too, when I thought not of painting such effects."&lt;ref name=oberlin2&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieseman|first=M.E.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby (English Derby 1734 – 1797) Dovedale by Moonlight, ca. 1784–85|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Wright.htm|work=Modern Landscapes|publisher=Allen Memorial Art Gallert|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Study for a painting of Dovedale.jpg|thumb|left|A preparatory sketch for these paintings (now in [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]). The unusual trees are said to be ''after'' [[Alexander Cozens]]. ]]

{{main|Dovedale}}
[[Dovedale]] is a very popular [[valley|dale]] in Staffordshire and Wright's home county of [[Derbyshire]]. Admired in Wright's time, it has been owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] since 1924 and made available to the many [[Peak District]] visitors.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshireuk.net/dovedale.html|title=Dovedale in Derbyshire and the Peak District|publisher=www.derbyshireuk.net|accessdate=21 October 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Dovedale is named for the [[River Dove, Central England|River Dove]] and it is {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} long.&lt;ref name=peak&gt;{{cite web|title=Dovedale Fact Sheet|url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/79235/factsheet12-dovedale.pdf|publisher=peakdistrict.gov.uk|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's paintings appear to be from nature, but in a letter of 1787 he said that he had observed moonlight and firelight only once at night and this was some time before he decided to create this series of paintings.&lt;ref name=oberlin2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=alchemist+wright+joseph#v=onepage&amp;q=alchemist%20wright%20joseph&amp;f=false|pages=87–88|isbn=978-0-7100-6284-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However his preparatory sketches show that he was using a mixture of studies and chance. The unusual reversal of light and shade in the trees in the sketch of Dovedale is said to be after using techniques created by the Russian born [[Alexander Cozens]]. Wright owned paintings by Cozens who taught his students to paint landscapes. He told them to create blots on paper and then use these as inspiration for the composition.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner |first=Christopher |title=The Deliberate Accident |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue21/blotsturner.htm |publisher=The Tate |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903112235/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue21/blotsturner.htm |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are no known Derbyshire landscapes by Wright that are dateable before 1786. One of the problems is that many of Wright's paintings are dated by consulting Wright's accounts in his notebook. In the case of his English landscapes this has proved challenging. It is known that some of the Dovedale pictures are some of his earliest English landscapes.
Wright frequently repeated a popular subject in his paintings as he did with his [[Virgil's Tomb (Joseph Wright paintings)|Virgil's Tomb]] pictures and his [[The Blacksmith's Shop|Blacksmith's Shop]] paintings. In this case he made five very similar paintings. The version at Oberlin College was painted in 1785 to 1786 and sold to [[Edward Miller? Mundy (fl. 1786)|Edward Mundy]] of [[Shipley Hall]].&lt;ref name=oberlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieseman|first=M.E.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby (English Derby 1734 – 1797) Dovedale by Moonlight, ca. 1784–85|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Wright.htm|work=Modern Landscapes|publisher=Allen Memorial Art Gallert|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college obtained it in 1951. There is a matching painting to this which is a similar view but in daylight. That painting is still in Derbyshire at [[Parwich Hall]] which is in a small village close to Dovedale.
Wright also did a daylight view of Dovedale in 1787 which he gave to the industrialist [[Josiah Wedgwood]] out of respect for his patronage on the arts. This painting is now in the [[Wedgwood Museum]].&lt;ref name=jw&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Wright (1734–97)|url=http://www.wedgwoodmuseum.org.uk/learning/discovery_packs/pack/pack/2436/chapter/2780|publisher=The Wedgwood Museum|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two other paintings of Dovedale were sold to [[Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet|Sir Brooke Boothby bt.]] of [[Ashbourne Hall]], who had helped Wright when he put on the first one-man exhibition in London.&lt;ref name="liver"&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/featuredartists/josephwrightderby/ Joseph Wright of Derby], Liverpool Museums, accessed 25 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Boothby also purchased two views of nearby Matlock, two paintings of bridges in Rome as well as an unusual 1781 portrait of himself lying by a brook holding a book by [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=alchemist+wright+joseph#v=onepage&amp;q=alchemist%20wright%20joseph&amp;f=false|page=127|isbn=978-0-7100-6284-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early planning work for Exhibit Columbus began in late 2014, and the project was officially launched on 5 May 2016 in Columbus as a program of Heritage Fund—The Community Foundation of Bartholomew County. It receives funding from a number of local and regional individuals, foundations, and corporations.

===100 Variations===
An exhibition was created in the fall of 2014 as a pilot project that featured designer [[Jonathan Nesci]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khemsurov|first1=Monica|title=Jonathan Nesci in Conversation With Matt Olson of RO/LU - Sight Unseen|url=http://www.sightunseen.com/2014/10/jonathan-nesci-in-conversation-with-matt-olson-of-rolu/|accessdate=21 October 2016|work=Sight Unseen|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created 100 unique tables for an installation in front of [[First Christian Church (Columbus, Indiana)|First Christian Church]].  This exhibition, "100 Variations," was produced by Indianapolis-based curator, Christopher West with support from the Haddad Foundation, the Columbus Area Visitors Center, and the Columbus Museum of Art and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chocolate, Baroque &amp; Design - October 2, 2014|url=http://www.wfyi.org/programs/the-art-of-the-matter/radio/chocolate-baroque-and-design-october-2-2014|accessdate=30 July 2016|work=WFYI Public Media|issue=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the tables was made by Noblitt Fabricating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=Jonathan Nesci Making his Mark in Columbus|url=http://www.patternindy.com/2014/10/07/jonathan-nesci-making-his-mark-in-columbus/|website=Pattern|accessdate=20 October 2016|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Columbus, Indiana under the leadership of Curt Aton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=Curt Aton|journal=Pattern|date=Fall 2015|issue=8|page=62|url=http://www.patternindy.com/previous-issues/|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic identity===
The Chicago-based graphic design firm, Thirst, was hired in 2016 to create the Exhibit Columbus identity with the goal of creating a system that was aligned with [[Paul Rand]]'s designs in Columbus, along with [[Alexander Girard]]'s work at the [[Miller House and Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibit Columbus - Work - Thirst|url=http://3st.com/work/exhibit-columbus#1|website=Thirst|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This identity was immediately recognized with an award from the Society of Typographic Artists, and has gone on to considerable critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibit Columbus - STA100|url=http://100.sta-chicago.org/portfolio-item/exhibit-columbus/|website=STA100|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity was primarily created by [[Rick Valicenti]], a 2006 [[List of AIGA medalists|AIGA medalist]] and a 2009 [[National Design Awards|National Design Award]] winner.

===The J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize===
The Miller Prize was created to honor [[J. Irwin Miller]] and his wife Xenia S. Miller, two of the twentieth century’s greatest patrons of architecture, design, and art, and a "family whose visionary commitment to community remains unparalleled." The Miller Prize is the center piece of Exhibit Columbus. In 2016 ten designers were paired at one of the five sites in a competition to see which team would be selected by a jury for the opportunity to build an installation in conversation with the past while exploring the future of design and fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exhibit Columbus to feature new J.

'''Exhumed''' is an American [[death metal]] band from [[San Jose, California]] that is currently signed to [[Relapse Records]] and centered around guitarist/vocalist Matt Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/music/matt-harvey-on-forming-exhumed-we-were-the-angriest-fifteen-year-olds-of-all-time-5691673|title=Matt Harvey on forming Exhumed: "We were the angriest fifteen-year-olds of all time"|last=Murphy|first=Tom|date=2013-12-13|website=Westword|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has released seven albums and eight split 7" singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/262864-Exhumed|title=Exhumed|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were formed in 1990, went on hiatus in 2005, and reformed in 2010.

==Background==

===Early history (1990–2000)===
Exhumed formed in 1990, when founding member Matt Harvey was 15 years old. Exhumed spent much of the ensuing decade releasing numerous demos, split CDs, and EPs. Harvey explained that he was influenced by [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[Impetigo (band)|Impetigo]], [[Repulsion (band)|Repulsion]] and [[Terrorizer (band)|Terrorizer]] as well as early albums by [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].&lt;ref name=metalblast&gt;{{cite web|last=Burkan|first=Jon|title=Exhumed (Matt Harvey &amp; Wes Caley) Interview|url=http://www.metalblast.net/2012/04/exhumed-matt-harvey-wes-caley-interview/|publisher=Metalblast|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band recorded their debut album ''[[Gore Metal (album)|Gore Metal]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Exhumed-Gore-Metal/release/8177602|title=Exhumed - Gore Metal|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album blended death metal and grindcore and influenced later bands who played the same type of music.&lt;ref name="Metal Storm"&gt;{{cite web|title = Metal Storm - The Categorization of Death Metal|author=Insineratehymn|publisher=Metal Storm|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/article.php?article_id=73|accessdate=25 March 2007|date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey said that ''Gore Metal'' was the album where Exhumed developed its vision, although he conceded that "we were still very loose and sloppy and didn't really have a handle on recording at all. Listening back to that record, I like most of the songs, but the production is awful sounding."&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abominator|first=Mike|title=Interview With Matt Harvey of Exhumed|url=http://www.metalmaniacs.com/2010/interview-with-matt-harvey-of-exhumed/|publisher=[[Metal Maniacs]]|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=23 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831052553/http://www.metalmaniacs.com/2010/interview-with-matt-harvey-of-exhumed/|archivedate=31 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey said the band recorded several songs for the album that were lost when producer [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]], then suffering from brain cancer and acting "erratically", was evicted from his studio in [[Oakland]].&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs" /&gt;

===Middle period and hiatus (2001–2009)===
This led to the band touring the United States and making several festival appearances. The band's line-up continued to change during and after the release of their second album, ''[[Slaughtercult]]'', in August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/slaughtercult-mw0000614837|title=Slaughtercult - Exhumed review|last=York|first=William|website=AllMusic|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey said that ''Slaughtercult'' was "the album where we came closest to achieving our goal – just a brutal, simple, direct group of songs that were very up-front and live sounding."&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs" /&gt; He further noted the band's pride over the lack of [[bass drum#Double bass drum|double bass]] on the album, in contrast to contemporary death metal trends.&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs" /&gt; In support of ''Slaughtercult'', the band did three US tours, and their first proper European tour, including co-headlining festivals like Fuck the Commerce and Obscene Extreme. The band also appeared at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival.

The band evolved further with their third album, ''[[Anatomy Is Destiny]]'' (2003), which added more sophisticated arrangements, production and instrumentation. Bassist Leon del Muerte replaced Bud Burke soon after the album was recorded. Harvey described the album as "a big step forward",&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs" /&gt; but retrospectively criticized the album for its lack of memorable choruses. He said of ''Anatomy Is Destiny'', "in many ways it's our best album, but in just as many, we missed the mark on a bunch of things."&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs" /&gt;

Co-founder and drummer Col Jones departed Exhumed in 2003, which affected the creative chemistry of the band. Harvey recalled, "After he (Jones) left it was a big adjustment. I was trying to run shit on my own creatively and logistically. The anatomy of the band just dissolved and everything fell apart."&lt;ref name="Hellbound" /&gt; As Harvey attempted to rebuild the line-up, Exhumed issued a double CD compilation of their early recordings titled ''Platters of Splatter''. After touring North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia, guitarist Mike Beams departed and new guitarist Wes Caley and drummer Matt Connell made their debut. Exhumed then completed recording an album of cover songs titled ''[[Garbage Daze Re-Regurgitated]]''. Harvey later explained that the album was intended as a "stopgap" album, although the band's subsequent hiatus put the band on hold longer than planned. Harvey later recalled:

{{bq|1=I was pretty burnt on Exhumed. The fact that the band hadn't really gotten any bigger from album to album, along with the ''Anatomy'' line-up falling apart were really frustrating, especially in light of how much work we had done. I felt like without Col in Exhumed, the band didn't really have any credibility any more, and I was just tired of teaching new people the songs and hoping that they would "get" where the band was coming from.&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs" /&gt;}}

During the hiatus, Harvey played in Dekapitator, Gravehill, and Scarecrow. Harvey, later remarking that "the passion for music didn't go away but my passion for Exhumed went away",&lt;ref name=Hellbound&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Justin M.|title=Matt Harvey of Exhumed:The Hellbound Interview|url=http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/06/matt-harvey-exhumed-interview/|publisher=Hellbound.ca|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to regret that the band's last recording would be a covers album and, feeling rejuvenated, decided to reform Exhumed to record a new studio album.&lt;ref name="Metal Maniacs" /&gt;

===Reunion (2010–present)===
In an interview conducted shortly after announcing that Exhumed would reform, Harvey remarked that "After a few years off and away from the death metal scene, I feel rejuvenated and ready to hack, maim and kill once again. I wanted this to be a continuation of what the band was doing and was on its way to doing, not a reunion or some weird nostalgia thing."&lt;ref name=GSA&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Chris|title=Exhumed Reform, Prepare To Crush Heads|url=http://gunshyassassin.com/news/exhumed-reform-prepare-to-crush-heads/|publisher=Gun Shy Assassin|accessdate=5 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116204000/http://gunshyassassin.com/news/exhumed-reform-prepare-to-crush-heads/|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the band recorded ''[[All Guts, No Glory]]''. The album line up was Harvey on guitars and high vocals, del Muerte on bass and low vocals, Caley on guitar and Danny Walker on drums. The musical approach taken on ''All Guts, No Glory'' was, according to Harvey, intentionally based on the band members' favoured elements of previous Exhumed records: "We all agreed that the period of Exhumed we liked the best was ''Slaughtercult'' and wanted to mix that with the technicality and melody of ''Anatomy''."&lt;ref name="MU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=70447|title=Gore Metal Gods Exhumed are Back from the Grave with a Reinvigorated Hunger for Blood and Guts Supremacy|last=Reviled|first=Joe|publisher=Metal Underground|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band toured extensively, although del Muerte and Walker left the band to complete [[Murder Construct]]'s debut album. They were replaced by Bob Babcock and Mike Hamilton ([[Deeds of Flesh]]), respectively.

In 2012, guitarist Caley was replaced by Bud Burke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=82774|title=Exhumed Announces Return Of Former Member Bud Burke|date=July 20, 2012|publisher=Metal Underground|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the band recorded ''[[Necrocracy]]'',&lt;ref name="Metal Underground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=85824|title=Exhumed Finishes Recording New Album To Be Released Next Year|date=October 26, 2012|publisher=Metal Underground|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released by [[Relapse Records]] on August 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=191232|title=EXHUMED To Release 'Necrocacy' In August|date=June 13, 2013|website=[[Blabbermouth]]|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey described the album as being "not quite as fast" as ''All Guts, No Glory''.&lt;ref name=Nefarious&gt;{{cite web|last=Heath|first=Stacey|title=NRP Interview: Matt Harvey of EXHUMED|url=http://nefariousrealm.com/homenew/?p=7817|work=Nefarious Realm|publisher=[[Nefarious Realm]]|accessdate=May 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917141207/http://nefariousrealm.com/homenew/?p=7817|archivedate=September 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2014, the band appeared on the season 3 premiere of ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Barchilon|first=Andrew|title=Seth Rogen; Asa Akira|date=2014-11-06|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123300/?licb=0.40258605498820543|last2=Sakurai|first2=Kitao|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 Matt Ferri replaced Rob Babcock on bass.

In 2015 Matt Ferri left and Ross Sewage rejoined the band on bass.

The band released their seventh album ''Death Revenge'' on October 13, 2017.

==Songwriting==
Over the years of their existence, Exhumed's approach to songwriting has become increasingly traditional in its structure and has been greatly influenced by Metal acts such as Visage. Main songwriter Matt Harvey said:

{{bq|1=On any song that we're writing, the first thing I think is, "Where's the chorus? What's the chorus? Where's the hook?" Then we've got something to build around. I'm very into the regular pop format of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus and variations thereof. To me, the chorus has to be the thing that grabs me and hooks me in – especially in death metal, because there's no vocal melody. Yeah, you've got riffs, but you have to have something to hook the listener in, to bring them back, to keep them listening again and again and again. That's really the goal, to create music that I would want to listen to five years later. For me, it's all about choruses and trying to write catchy songs.&lt;ref name=IO&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Cosmo|title=Interview: Exhumed|url=http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2011/07/interview-exhumed/|publisher=[[Invisible Oranges]]|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Lyrics==
Exhumed's lyrics focus on gore themes. However, the band uses this thematic lens in an allegorical fashion. Lyricist Matt Harvey said:

{{bq|1=One thing I like about gore is that it gives you a set of aesthetics to work with to use as an [[allegory]] or [[metaphor]]. Even as far back as the first album, a lot of the songs are metaphors for different things. We have songs about [[consumerism]] and songs about relationships and songs about politics. Instead of me coming off like a whiny bitch complaining about society, I'm able to put it across in a way that's really allegorical and has its own entertainment value without having any deeper context...the gore metaphor keeps me from becoming a preachy, pretentious douchebag.&lt;ref name=IO /&gt;}}

On ''Necrocracy'', Harvey wrote lyrics that applied the gore theme to political subject matter, such as a critique of American corporatism and consumerism.&lt;ref name="decibel interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Steward-Panko|first=Kevin|title=Gabbing with Matt Harvey, the one from Exhumed|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/uncategorized/gabbing-with-matt-harvey-the-one-from-exhumed/|work=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|accessdate=September 27, 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VIA Mini-ITX Form Factor Comparison.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Comparison of some common [[motherboard]] form factors]]
'''Form factor''' is an aspect of hardware [[design]] which defines and prescribes the size, shape, and other physical [[specification (technical standard)|specifications]] of components, particularly in [[consumer electronics]] and [[electronic packaging]].&lt;ref name="webopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/form_factor.html|website=Webopedia|publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtarget"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/form-factor|website=WhatIs.com|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form factor may represent a broad class of similarly sized components, or it may prescribe a specific standard.

==Evolution and standardization==
As electronic hardware has become smaller following [[Moore's law]] and related patterns, ever-smaller form factors have become feasible. Specific technological advances, such as [[PCI Express]], have had a significant design impact, though form factors have historically been slower to evolve than individual components. [[Standardization]] of form factors is vital for compatibility of hardware from different manufacturers.

==Trade-offs==
Smaller form factors may offer more efficient use of limited space, greater flexibility in the placement of components within a larger assembly, reduced use of material, and greater ease of transportation and use. However, smaller form factors typically incur greater costs in the [[design]], [[manufacturing]], and [[corrective maintenance|maintenance]] phases of the [[product lifecycle|engineering lifecycle]], and do not allow the same expansion options as larger form factors. In particular, the design of smaller form factor computers and network equipment must entail careful consideration of [[computer cooling|cooling]].&lt;ref name="sff_network"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=John|title=Passive Cooling – An Experiment|url=https://smallformfactor.net/reviews/passive-cooling-experiment|website=SFF Network|publisher=Minutiae|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[End user|End-user]] maintenance and repair of small form factor electronic devices such as mobile phones is often not possible, and may be discouraged by [[warranty]] [[voidable|voiding]] clauses; such devices require professional servicing—or simply replacement—when they fail.&lt;ref name="prowse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prowse|first1=David L.|title=CompTIA A+ Exam Cram: Mobile Device Hardware and Operating Systems|url=http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1926198|website=Pearson IT Certification|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Computer form factor]]s''' comprise a number of specific industry standards for [[motherboard]]s, specifying dimensions, [[power supply|power supplies]], placement of mounting holes and [[computer port (hardware)|ports]], and other parameters. Other types of form factors for computers include:
* [[Small form factor]] (SFF), a more loosely defined set of standards which may refer to both motherboards and [[computer case]]s. SFF devices include mini-towers and  [[home theater PC]]s.
* [[Pizza box form factor]], a wide, flat case form-factor used for computers and network switches; often sized for installation in a [[19-inch rack]].

* [[Disc form factors|Hard disk enclosure form factor]], the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive enclosure

===Mobile form factors===
* [[Laptop]] or notebook, a form of portable computer with a "clamshell" form factor.
* [[Subnotebook]], [[ultra-mobile PC]], [[netbook]], and [[tablet computer]], various form factors for devices which are smaller and often cheaper than a typical notebook.
* [[Form factor (mobile phones)|Mobile phone form factor]], comprising the size, shape, layout, and style of mobile phones. Broad categories of form factors include bars, [[flip (form)|flip phones]], and sliders, with many subtypes and variations of each.

The '''Hidebehind''' is a [[nocturnal]]&lt;ref&gt;Wyman, Walker D. Mythical Creatures of the USA and Canada.(River Falls, WI: Univ of Wisconsin Riverfalls Press,1978.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[fearsome critter]] from American folklore that preys upon humans that wander the woods,&lt;ref name="borkin"&gt;Botkin, B.A. The American People: Stories, Legends, Tales, Traditions and Songs. (New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, 1977) {{ISBN|1-56000-984-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was blamed for the disappearances of early loggers when they failed to return to camp.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=1126 Brown, C.E.

(New York: Doubleday, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; As its name suggests, the Hidebehind is noted for its ability to conceal itself. When an observer attempts to look directly at it, the creature hides again behind an object or the observer and therefore can't be directly seen: a feat it accomplishes by sucking in its stomach to a point where it is so slender that it can easily cover itself behind the trunk of any tree.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, Vance. We Always Lie to Strangers: Tall Tales from the Ozarks. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1951.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hidebehind uses this ability to stalk human prey without being observed and to attack without warning. Their victims, including [[lumberjack]]s who frequent the forests, are dragged back to the creature's lair to be devoured.&lt;ref name="borkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The creature subsists chiefly upon the intestines of its victim, and has a severe aversion to alcohol, which is considered a sufficient repellent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folklore.lumberwoods.com/pg23.htm  Tryon, Henry Harrington. Fearsome Critters. (Cornwall, NY: Idlewild Press, 1939)]&lt;/ref&gt; Tales of the Hidebehind may have helped explain strange noises in the forest at night. Early accounts describe hidebehinds as large, powerful animals, despite the fact that no one was able to see them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rose | first = Carol | title = Giants, Monsters, and Dragons: An Encyclopedia of Legend, Folklore, and Myth | publisher = W.W.

[[File:Brigitswell.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Brigid's Well]], near [[Buttevant]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]]]
A '''holy well''' or '''sacred spring''' is a [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] or other small body of water revered either in a [[Christian]] or [[Paganism|pagan]] context, sometimes both. The term ''holy well'' is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the [[folklore]] of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated [[legend]], the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the [[numen|numinous]] presence of its guardian spirit or Christian [[saint]], or a ceremony or [[ritual]] centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the [[hagiography]] of Celtic saints.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The term ''haeligewielle'' is in origin an [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] toponym attached to specific springs in the landscape;&lt;ref&gt;J. Harte, 'Holey Wells and other Holey Places', ''Living Spring Journal'', 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; its current use has arisen through folklore scholars, [[antiquarians]], and other writers generalising from those actual 'Holy Wells' which survived into the modern era. The term 'holy-hole' is sometimes employed.&lt;ref  name="ARoss"&gt;A. Ross, ''Pagan Celtic Britain'' (London: RKP), 1967, 107; Willy Worcestre, ''Itinerary'', ed. J. Harvey (Oxford: Clarendon), 1981, pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms '[[hole (disambiguation)|hole]]' and '[[holy]]' are [[etymon]]s.

==Culture and representation==
Holy wells in different forms occur in such a wide variety of cultures, religious environments, and historical periods that it is usually held that it is a universal human instinct to revere sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. J. &amp; C. Bord, ''Sacred Waters'' (London: Granada), 1985, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the fragmentary nature of the evidence, and the historical differences among cultures and nations, make it very hard to generalize.  While there are a few national studies of holy well lore and history, mainly concentrating on [[Ireland]] and the [[British Isles]], there is a need for more work examining other regions.

The earliest work specifically devoted to holy wells is [[Philip Dixon Hardy]]'s ''Holy Wells of Ireland'' (1836), a [[Protestant]] attack on [[Catholic]] observances at Irish wells bearing the names of Christian [[saints]], or otherwise considered sacred. By the later 19th century, the term had acquired its current usage: Robert Charles Hope's ''The Legendary Lore of the Holy Wells of England'' (1893), the first general survey of its kind, included a number of named wells which were not dedicated to saints (as well as some rivers and lakes with associated folklore, as Hope mentioned in his subtitle).

==Exegesis==
In [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] a [[nymphaeum]] or nymphaion ({{lang-el|νυμφαίον}}), was a [[monument]] consecrated to the [[nymph]]s, especially those of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]].

In England, there are examples of reverence for wells and springs at a variety of historical periods. The medieval traveller [[William Worcester|William of Worcester]] saw a 'holy-hole, or well' within the cave at [[Wookey]] ([[Somerset]]), a site of human habitation in the [[Palaeolithic]] era and the source of a river which had been the site of ritual activity.&lt;ref  name="ARoss"/&gt; The proximity of named springs to [[Neolithic]] or [[Iron Age]] monuments, such as the Swallowhead Springs, close to [[Silbury Hill]] ([[Wiltshire]]) or the Holy Well near Tadmarton Hill ([[Oxfordshire]]), suggests that reverence for such sites continued without a break. There is abundant evidence for the importance of wells and springs in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman period]], not just at temple complexes such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (Somerset), [[Chedworth]] ([[Gloucestershire]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Living Spring Journal'' '''2''', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and Blunsdon Ridge ([[Wiltshire]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | place = UK | url = http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9905&amp;L=wells-and-spas&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=4844 | title = Wells and Spas Archives | publisher = Jiscmail | date = May 1999 | issue = 46 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230839/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9905&amp;L=wells-and-spas&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=4844 | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; which have medicinal springs at their centre, but a variety of smaller sites, and at wells and ritual shafts used for [[Superstition|superstitious]] and sub-religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Merrifield, R. (1987) ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''. London: Batsford; pp. 23–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stinanswellirvine1.JPG|left|thumb|Saint Inans Well, Irvine, Scotland. Dated 839 AD.]]
Christianity strongly affected the development of holy wells in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Aside from the spring that issued from the staff of Moses and the Well of [[Beersheba]], there were already a number of sites mentioned in Jewish  and Christian folklore, including [[Moses]]' well near [[Mount Nebo]], visited by the fourth-century nun [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] and many other pilgrims. St [[Athanasius]]' Life of St [[Anthony the Great|Antony]], written about 356–62, mentions the well created by the desert hermit Antony. It is unclear how many Christian holy wells there may have been, as records are very fragmentary and often a well appears only once, making it impossible to tell when reverence for it began and when it ceased, but by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] England, for instance, probably possessed some hundreds. As they were closely linked with the cults of the saints, many wells in countries that converted to Protestant forms of Christianity fell into disuse and were lost, the Holy Well at [[Walsingham]] ([[Norfolk]]) being a good example, which, having been an integral element of the pilgrimage to the shrine of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the village, vanished completely. Nevertheless, this particular holy well at the [[Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham]] was restored nearby the original site and its water is known for its [[faith healing|healing]] properties, thus making it a popular site of Christian [[Christian pilgrimage|religious pilgrimage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Philip|title=Streams of Healing Grace|year=2017|publisher=Walsingham Review|language=English |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting of wells for therapeutic and entertainment purposes did not completely die out, however, as [[spa]]s became fashionable in the 17th century and later. Eventually [[antiquarians]] (from the 17th century) and folklorists (from the 19th) began to take notice of holy wells and record their surviving traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rattue, J. (1995) ''The Living Stream'' Woodbridge: Boydell, chapters 7, 8, and 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a hundred holy wells exist in [[Cornwall]], each associated with a particular saint, though not always the same one as the dedication of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Jenner|Jenner, Henry]] (1925) "The Holy Wells of Cornwall". In: ''Cornish Church Guide''. Truro: Blackford; pp. 249-257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mabel Quiller-Couch|Quiller-Couch, Mabel]] &amp; Lilian (1894) ''Ancient and Holy Wells of Cornwall''. London: Chas. J. Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several holy wells also survive in [[Turkey]], called ''ayazma'' in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁγίασμα}} (''hagiasma''), literally "holiness". Examples of ''hagiasmata'' are found in the [[Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of the Spring]] and the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]], both located in [[istanbul]].

==Historiographical controversies==
The [[Protestant Reformers]] of the 16th century often assumed that medieval Catholic practices embodied lingering remains of [[pagan]] religious practices, and thought of holy wells in that way.&lt;ref name="Carroll2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Michael P.|title=American Catholics in the Protestant Imagination: Rethinking the Academic Study of Religion|date=29 December 2010|publisher=JHU Press|language=English |isbn=9781421401997|page=1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affected the outlook of those who came to study holy well traditions later. The pioneers of folklore study took the view that the customs and legends they were recording were debased versions of pagan rites and myths. Thus it became standard to begin any account of holy wells with the statement that the Christian church had adopted them from the pagans and replaced the heathen gods with Christian saints, in order to win people over to the new religion more smoothly.

[[File:Dupath well cornwall.jpg|right|thumb|Dupath Well in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, J. Charles (1912), ''Porches &amp; Fonts.='' London: Wells Gardner &amp; Darton; p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Among the earliest enthusiasts for holy wells in modern times was the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movement, for whom wells formed part of '[[earth mysteries]]' study along with [[ley line]]s and ancient sites; the view that the Christians had 'stolen' holy wells from the pagan religions fitted in well with their position.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rattue, ''The Living Stream'' (Woodbridge: Boydell), 1995, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazines ''Wood and Water'' and ''[[Meyn Mamvro]]'', among others, helped shape this approach. During the early- and mid-1990s this viewpoint was under increasing attack crowned by the publication of [[Ronald Hutton]]'s ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'' (1991) which argued that the evidence for what constituted pre-Christian British religious practices, certainly outside Romano-British times, was next to nil.&lt;ref name="Hutton1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV-IQgAACAAJ|accessdate=25 March 2017|year=1991|publisher=B. Blackwell|language=English |isbn=9780631172888}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as wells themselves were concerned, the controversy emerged in the pages of ''Source'', the holy wells journal edited by Roy Fry and former [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] Tristan Gray-Hulse. A number of articles in the journal challenged long-standing myths about holy well history, and the editors published an exchange between the authors and Cheryl Straffon, editor of Cornish earth mysteries magazine ''Meyn Mamvro'', about the evidence for a particular Cornish well's supposed association with the Irish goddess [[Brigid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/ns3/ns3cs1.htm|title=The Search for Bride's Well|website=people.bath.ac.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124142915/http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/ns3/ns3cs1.htm|archivedate=2017-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eco-pagan movement has largely accepted the new historiographical approach,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} but occasionally rather more old-fashioned accounts of holy wells are published, for instance Gary Varner's ''Sacred Springs'' (2002).

A linked argument was over the nature of the influence of the [[Celt]]s on the well cult. The late Francine Nicholson, an independent student of Celtica, argued forcefully and controversially that the Celts had a unique sensitivity to sacred wells, but never elaborated this in any published work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0301&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;P=2193 WELLS-AND-SPAS Archives - January 2003 (#23)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230605/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0301&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;P=2193 |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, radically minded scholars have begun questioning the unity of concepts imposed by the term 'holy well'. In a paper in the ''Living Spring Journal'', Jeremy Harte distinguishes between early Anglo-Saxon 'holy wells' and those Christianised in the late Middle Ages, and argues 'apart from being venerated and being wet, they have little in common'; Harte has also stressed that limited evidence may mean that scholars are considerably overestimating the number of holy wells which were active at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0703&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;P=R924&amp;D=0&amp;H=0&amp;I=-3&amp;O=T&amp;T=0&amp;m=2725 Harte, op.cit.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230613/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0703&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;P=R924&amp;D=0&amp;H=0&amp;I=-3&amp;O=T&amp;T=0&amp;m=2725 |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival of modern interest==
[[File:St Peter's Well, Houston - view from the east &amp; opening.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St Peter's Well at Houstin in Scotland. A rare Scottish covered well.]]
In a sense, the restoration of holy wells began almost as soon as they were in decline, as a number became the subject of antiquarian interest and some were turned into garden features and put to other decorative uses. However, in more modern times wells have been restored as an expression of interest in the past, sometimes from [[Romanticism|romantic]] or religious motives, but mostly as a statement of continuity with the history of a particular community. A good example is St Osyth's Well at [[West Bierton]] ([[Buckinghamshire]]), 'restored' (and in the process rebuilt completely) by the Parish Council as part of a project marking [[Millennium]] Year in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rattue, ''Holy Wells of Buckinghamshire'' (High Wycombe: Umbra), 2003, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most active holy wells in Britain are those linked to Christian [[pilgrimages]], at Walsingham, [[Fernyhalgh]] ([[Lancashire]]) and [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] ([[Wales]]), or popular tourist sites (Bath, Somerset). The [[Chalice Well]] at [[Glastonbury]] (Somerset) is at the centre of a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]]- and [[New Age]]-orientated spirituality and retreat centre. Other wells, however, are often visited on an informal basis for religious or sightseeing reasons. New forms of holy well reverence continue to emerge now and again, notoriously the so-called Well of the [[Triple deities|Triple Goddess]] at [[Minster-in-Sheppey]] ([[Kent]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cassandraeason.co.uk/sacred_waters.htm Sacred waters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607191656/http://www.cassandraeason.co.uk/sacred_waters.htm |date=2007-06-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Channel 4's archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' was responsible for exposing the infamous archaeological fraud of [[Llygadwy]], a site which included an alleged holy well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2001llyg.html Channel 4 – ''Time Team''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227044755/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2001llyg.html |date=2011-02-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historiographically, the publication of Janet and Colin Bord's ''Sacred Waters'' (1985) was influential in reviving interest in the history and folklore of holy wells in Britain. The same year saw the foundation of the journal ''Source'' by Mark Valentine. Attempts to maintain a regular journal for the study of holy wells have been erratic (''Source'' enjoyed two runs from 1985–89 and 1994–98, and the web-based Living Spring has only had two issues to date) but postings on websites such as The Megalithic Portal show that there is still much interest in this category of ancient site.

==Case study: the necessity of vigilance in preservation of heritage==
Often unmarked on maps and undistinguished by archaeological features, holy wells are a uniquely vulnerable category of ancient site. They continue to be lost to [[farming]], drainage work, development or neglect. A recent instance is the [[desecration]] of St Bridget's Well at Rosepark, Balrothery (County [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]), destroyed by building work in 2003 despite being a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;Skyvova, P. ''Fingallian Holy Wells''. Swords, Dublin: Fingal County Libraries, 2005, pp. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and the destruction of a well at [[Rath Lugh]] during the construction of the [[N3 road (Ireland)|M3 Motorway]] in the [[Gabhra|Tara-Skryne Valley]], Ireland.

'''''Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot''''' is a 2012 non-fiction book by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Martin Dugard (author)|Martin Dugard]] about the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of the 35th [[President of the United States]] [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill O'Reilly to Pen Book on Kennedy Assassination|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-oreilly-john-f-kennedy-assassination-292017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=21 December 2012|first=Andy|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a follow-up to O'Reilly's 2011 book ''[[Killing Lincoln]]''. ''Killing Kennedy'' was released on October 2, 2012 through [[Henry Holt and Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JFK assassination gets the O'Reilly treatment|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2012/10/01/bill-oreilly-jfk-assassination/1591991/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=21 December 2012|first1=Bob|last1=Minzesheimer|date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In ''Killing Kennedy'' the authors narrate the events leading up to the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President Kennedy as well as the event's aftermath. O'Reilly and Dugard also focus on the element of the growing [[Cold War]], Kennedy's attempt to deal with the rise of [[Communism]], and the potential threat from organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Killing Kennedy' Is Intriguing|url=http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/history/info-10-2012/bill-oreilly-discusses-jfk-assassination.html|publisher=AARP Radio|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical response to ''Killing Kennedy'' was mixed, with ''[[The New York Times]] ''writing that the book was at times disappointing but that it "picks up strength as it heads for its date with destiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unabashed in the Face of Tragedy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/books/killing-kennedy-by-bill-oreilly-and-martin-dugard.html?_r=0/|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=7 December 2012|first=Janet|last=Maslin|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been criticized for a "lack of citation and occasional 'literary liberties'". For example, in the prologue, the authors write, "Kennedy is the youngest president ever elected. Eisenhower is the oldest."&lt;ref&gt;O'Reily &amp; Dugard, Killing Kennedy (2012), Prologue&lt;/ref&gt; While Kennedy was the youngest president ever elected at the time of his inauguration and remains so today, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was not the oldest ever elected even in 1961 at the time of Kennedy's inauguration. [[William Henry Harrison]] was the oldest president ever elected as of 1961. However, in 1961 at the end of his term Eisenhower was the oldest president to date, as Harrison died one month into his term at the age of 68 years 54 days. Eisenhower was 70 years 98 days old on the day of Kennedy's inauguration.

O'Reilly has stated that he and Dugard wrote the book to be "fun" and "to get people engaged with their country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill O'Reilly returns to presidential assassinations with his new book 'Killing Kennedy'|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2012/1004/Bill-O-Reilly-returns-to-presidential-assassinations-with-his-new-book-Killing-Kennedy|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold 118,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Riordan, O'Reilly Post Huge Debuts|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/54298-riordan-o-reilly-post-huge-debuts.html|work=publishersweekly.com|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=May 26, 2013|author=Publishers Weekly|authorlink=Publishers Weekly|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another passage where O'Reilly claims he was present outside the Florida home of alleged conspirator [[George de Mohrenschildt]] when he committed suicide has been shown by several sources to be false, as he was known not to be in the state at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O'Reilly Lied About Suicide Of JFK Assassination Figure, Former Colleagues Say|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/02/24/oreilly-lied-about-suicide-of-jfk-assassination/202655|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico-Mar2-2015" &gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">The '''Kilohana Art League''' was formed in 1894 as [[Honolulu]]’s first art association.  In May 1894, the woodcarver [[Augusta Graham]], the sculptor [[Allen Hutchinson]], and painters [[D. Howard Hitchcock]] and [[Annie H. Park]] created a forum where local artists could exhibit together and share ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Severson, 2002, pp. XXIV-XXV&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members included [[Alfred Richard Gurrey, Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Severson, 2002, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bessie Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thrum's Hawaiian Annual]], Honolulu, Thos. C. Thrum, 1900, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

“Kilohana’’ is a compound word derived from two [[Hawaiian language]] words: “''kilo''” meaning to observe carefully or to spy out, and “''hana''”, meaning work.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, C. T., 1896&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kilohana Art League was disbanded in 1913, and its funds were transferred to the [[Outdoor Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Severson, 2002, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leaf v International Galleries''''' [1950] 2 KB 86 is an [[English contract law]] case concerning [[misrepresentation]], [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]] and [[breach of contract]], and the limits to the [[equity (law)|equitable]] [[Equitable remedy|remedy]] of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]].

==Facts==
"[[Salisbury Cathedral]]" by [[John Constable]] was what Ernest Louis Leaf thought he was buying on 8 March 1944 from International Galleries. International Galleries said it was a Constable. Leaf paid £85. Five years later when he tried to auction it, Leaf was told that it was not a Constable. He claimed rescission of the contract against International Galleries, to get back his money.

==Judgment==
[[Denning LJ]] held that Mr Leaf was barred because too much time had lapsed. He held that in the event of lapse of too much time between the making of the contract and the decision to rescind, the right to rescind is lost. He held there was a mistake about the quality of the subject matter because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable, and that mistake was fundamental. But it was not enough to void the contract, because there was no mistake about the essential subject matter (a painting). The painter's identity was a term of the contract, which could either be classified as a condition (breach of which allows termination of the contract) or a warranty (which allows damages only). Here the painter's identity was a condition, but after hanging it in one's house for five years it is far too late to reject the painting for breach of condition.

{{Cquote|The question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to rescind the contract on the ground that the painting in question was not painted by Constable. I emphasize that it is a claim to rescind only: there is no claim in this action for damages for breach of condition or breach of warranty. The claim is simply one for rescission. At a very late stage before the county court judge counsel did ask for leave to amend by claiming damages for breach of warranty, but it was not allowed. No claim for damages is before us at all. The only question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to rescind.

The way in which the case is put by Mr. Weitzman, on behalf of the plaintiff, is this: he says that this was an innocent misrepresentation and that in equity he is, or should be, entitled to claim rescission even of an executed contract of sale on that account. He points out that the judge has found that it is quite possible to restore the parties to their original position. It can be done by simply handing back the picture to the defendants.

In my opinion, this case is to be decided according to the well known principles applicable to the sale of goods. This was a contract for the sale of goods. There was a mistake about the quality of the subject-matter, because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable; and that mistake was in one sense essential or fundamental. But such a mistake does not avoid the contract: there was no mistake at all about the subject-matter of the sale. It was a specific picture, "Salisbury Cathedral." The parties were agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter, and that is sufficient to make a contract: see ''[[Solle v Butcher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 K.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Solle v Butcher]]'' has been [[Mechanisms of the English common law|disapproved]] in ''[[The Great Peace]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a term in the contract as to the quality of the subject-matter: namely, as to the person by whom the picture was painted – that it was by Constable. That term of the contract was, according to our terminology, either a condition or a warranty. If it was a condition, the buyer could reject the picture for breach of the condition at any time before he accepted it, or is deemed to have accepted it; whereas, if it was only a warranty, he could not reject it at all but was confined to a claim for damages.

I think it right to assume in the buyer's favour that this term was a condition, and that, if he had come in proper time he could have rejected the picture; but the right to reject for breach of condition has always been limited by the rule that, once the buyer has accepted, or is deemed to have accepted, the goods in performance of the contract, then he cannot thereafter reject, but is relegated to his claim for damages: see s. 11, sub-s. 1 (c), of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]], and ''[[Wallis, Son &amp; Wells v Pratt &amp; Haynes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1910] 2 K. B. 1003 , [1911] A. C. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances in which a buyer is deemed to have accepted goods in performance of the contract are set out in s. 35 of the Act, which says that the buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods, amongst other things, "when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them." In this case the buyer took the picture into his house and, apparently, hung it there, and five years passed before he intimated any rejection at all. That, I need hardly say, is much more than a reasonable time. It is far too late for him at the end of five years to reject this picture for breach of any condition. His remedy after that length of time is for damages only, a claim which he has not brought before the court.

Is it to be said that the buyer is in any better position by relying on the representation, not as a condition, but as an innocent misrepresentation? I agree that on a contract for the sale of goods an innocent material misrepresentation may, in a proper case, be a ground for rescission even after the contract has been executed...

Although rescission may in some cases be a proper remedy, it is to be remembered that an innocent misrepresentation is much less potent than a breach of condition; and a claim to rescission for innocent misrepresentation must at any rate be barred when a right to reject for breach of condition is barred. A condition is a term of the contract of a most material character, and if a claim to reject on that account is barred, it seems to me a fortiori that a claim to rescission on the ground of innocent misrepresentation is also barred.}}

Jenkins LJ and Lord Evershed MR concurred.

* '''Summary'''
In essence, the court held that there was no breach of contract, no "operative mistake", but there WAS misrepresentation. However, after a period of five years the right to rescission had lapsed, leaving the claimant with no remedy at all.

{{Christian culture}}
'''Liturgical music''' originated as a part of [[religious]] [[ceremony]], and includes a number of traditions, both ancient and modern.  Liturgical music is well known as a part of [[Catholic Mass]], the [[Anglican]] [[Holy Communion]] service (or [[Eucharist]]) and [[Evensong]], the [[Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[liturgy]] and other Christian services including the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]. Such ceremonial music in the Judeo-Christian tradition can be traced back to both the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and [[synagogue]] worship of the [[Hebrews]].

The qualities that create the distinctive character of liturgical music are based on the notion that liturgical music is conceived and composed according to the norms and needs of the various historic [[liturgy|liturgies]] of particular [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s.

==Roman Catholic church music==

The interest taken by the Catholic Church in music is shown not only by practitioners, but also by numerous enactments and regulations calculated to foster music worthy of Divine service.&lt;ref name="Gietmann1911"&gt;{{Catholic| title      = Ecclesiastical Music | last = Gietmann | first = Gerhard | volume = 10 | year = 1911  | accessdate = 2007-05-17 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10648a.htm | inline = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary [[Catholic]] official church policy is expressed in the documents  of the [[Second Vatican Council]] ''[[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]'', the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on December 4, 1963 (items 112–121); and most particularly ''[[Musicam sacram]]'', the Instruction on Music In The Liturgy from the Sacred Congregation for Rites, on March 5, 1967.

While there have been historic disputes within the church where elaborate music has been under criticism, there are many period works by Orlandus de [[Lassus]], [[Gregorio Allegri|Allegri]], [[Tomás Luis de Victoria|Vittoria]], where the most elaborate means of expression are employed in liturgical music, but which, nevertheless, conform to every liturgical requirement while seeming to be spontaneous outpourings of adoring hearts (cf. [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] or [[polyphonic music]]). Besides [[plain chant]] and the polyphonic style, the Catholic Church also permits [[homophonic]] or figured compositions with or without instrumental accompaniment, written either in [[ecclesiastical]] [[Musical mode|modes]], or the modern major or minor keys. [[Gregorian chant]] is warmly recommended by the Catholic Church, as both polyphonic music and modern unison music for the assembly.&lt;ref name="Gietmann1911"/&gt;

Prior to the [[Second Vatican Council]], according to the [[motu proprio]] of Pius X (November 22, 1903), the following were the general guiding principles of the Church: "Sacred music should possess, in the highest degree, the qualities proper to the liturgy, or more precisely, sanctity and purity of form from which its other character of universality spontaneously springs. It must be holy, and must therefore exclude all profanity, not only from itself but also from the manner in which it is presented by those who execute it. It must be true art, for otherwise it cannot exercise on the minds of the hearers that influence which the Church meditates when she welcomes into her liturgy the art of music. But it must also be universal, in the sense that, while every nation is permitted to admit into its ecclesiastical compositions those special forms which may be said to constitute its native music, still these forms must be subordinated in such a manner to the general characteristics of sacred music, that no one of any nation may receive an impression other than good on hearing them.".&lt;ref name="Gietmann1911"/&gt; This was expanded upon by Pope [[Pius XII]] in his motu proprio ''[[Musicae sacrae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_25121955_musicae-sacrae_en.html Musicae sacrae]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The third incarnation of [[United States|American]] toy company [[Hasbro]]'s '''[[My Little Pony]]''' [[Toy|toyline]] and [[media franchise]] began in 2003. The revamped line of dolls was targeted to a younger audience than the previous lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hasbro Revamps My Little Pony to Draw Younger Girls|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-105890012.html|accessdate=9 August 2014|work=Marketing Week|date=10 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular era is often unofficially referred to as "Generation Three" or "G3" by collectors. Until the generation's end in 2009, there have been at least two minor revamps. A series of direct-to-video animated films (mostly produced by [[SD Entertainment]]) accompanied the line-up.

"Generation Three" is set in the fictional town of Ponyville, which is centered on Celebration Castle. Only Earth Ponies were released from 2003 to 2005, but in 2005 and 2006 Pegasus Ponies and Unicorn Ponies were respectively introduced.

Until late 2005, packaging came with Pony Points that were later used for exclusive mail orders. Unlike the "G1" line, the Pony Points had to be mailed in to order; a customer could not pay a flat fee and add points to it to lower the price. Some of the ponies available with the Pony Points program were Dazzle Surprise, Sunshimmer and Love Wishes. Other merchandise included posters or a play mat to put buildings on. The points program ended on 31 January 2006.

While the line was simultaneously released in the U.S. and Europe, there are a few ponies unavailable in the U.S., such as Winter Snow and some small, fairy-like ponies called Breezies who first appeared in the animated feature ''The Princess Promenade''. One of the most uncommon ponies in this third line was released by mistake in 2004. A Pinkie Pie with the words "2003 Licensing Show" embedded into her symbol was used to promote the My Little Pony toy line at the 2003 Spring Licensing Show, and were intended to be released only at that show in a limited edition of 300. Due to a packaging error, a few were packaged as regular ponies and sold in stores. Other limited-edition ponies have been the Pony Project promotional ponies and Rosey Posey, who was given to attendees at a charity dinner held by Hasbro.

;Ponyville figurines
The Ponyville figurines are fully molded plastic and smaller than the main "G3" line. Although they have their own playsets and accessories, many of the characters are the same as their larger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-MLP-Fleece-Throw-Blanket-50-by-60-Officially-Licensed-Hasbro-/171667200962 | title=My Little Pony MLP Fleece Throw Blanket 50" by 60" Officially Licensed Hasbro | accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Core 7|Core Seven|Generation 3.5|G3.5}}
;2008 and 2009 revamps
In 2008, the number of characters were reduced to seven: Pinkie Pie, Scootaloo, Toola-Roola, Rainbow Dash, Sweetie Belle, Cheerilee and Starsong; thus collectors referring the revamp as "Core 7". The following year in 2009, in a move referred by collectors as "Generation 3.5", Hasbro redesigned the characters to resemble Ponyville figurines.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

;Collector's edition after 2010
Recognizing the older fans of its line, Hasbro has released special collector ponies noticeably different from the regular "G3". While some had a general release as "Art Ponies", many are available through special events, such as the annual My Little Pony Collector's Convention and the [[San Diego Comic Con]]. These ponies are elaborately designed, such as the underwater-themed art pony which has fish and sea creatures printed all over its body, and come in matching display boxes. The 2011 SDCC pony is black and pink and has a [[kawaii]] skull instead of a "cutie mark". There is also a white pony available to customizers. Despite the redesign as "G3.5" and the advent of the "[[My Little Pony (2010 toyline)|G4]]" line, Hasbro continued the collector-themed "G3" ponies in their original poses.

==Media==
===Direct-to-video animated features===
Between 2003 and 2009, the ponies appeared in a series of [[direct-to-video]] shorts and feature-length films. Most of them were produced by [[SD Entertainment]]. These are set in yet another milieu, and feature the "G3" ponies:{{Citation needed |date=September 2014}}

The '''National Museum of Women in the Arts''' (NMWA), located in [[Washington, D.C.]], is "the only major [[museum]] in the world solely dedicated" to celebrating women's achievements in the visual, performing, and literary arts.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/about|title=About|publisher= National Museum of Women in the Arts|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and [[Wilhelmina Holladay]]. Since opening its doors in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nmwa.org/about/our-history|title=Our History - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum has acquired a collection of more than 4,500 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative art. Highlights of the collection include works by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Frida Kahlo]], and [[Élisabeth Louise Vigée-Le Brun]]. The museum occupies the old [[Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)|Masonic Temple]], a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The museum was founded to reform traditional histories of art.  It is dedicated to discovering and making known women artists who have been overlooked or unacknowledged, and assuring the place of women in contemporary art.  The museum's founder, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, and her husband Wallace F. Holladay began collecting art in the 1960s, just as scholars were beginning to discuss the under-representation of women in museum collections and major art exhibitions.  Impressed by a 17th-century Flemish still life painting by [[Clara Peeters]] that they saw in Europe, they sought out information on Peeters and found that the definitive art history texts referenced neither her nor any other woman artist.  They became committed to collecting artwork by women and eventually to creating a museum and research center.

The National Museum of Women in the Arts was incorporated in December 1981 as a private, non-profit museum, and the Holladay donation became the core of the institution's permanent collection.  After purchasing and extensively renovating a former Masonic Temple, NMWA opened in April 1987 with the inaugural exhibition American Women Artists, 1830–1930.  To underscore its commitment to increasing the attention given to women in all disciplines, NMWA commissioned Pulitzer Prize-winning composer [[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] to write ''Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra'' inspired by five paintings from the permanent collection, for an opening concert.  In November 1997, the Elisabeth A. Kasser Wing was opened, adding two new galleries, a larger museum shop, and a reception room. Currently, Director Susan Fisher Sterling heads a staff of more than 30 people.

{{Main|Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)}}
In 1983, NMWA purchased a landmark {{convert|78810|sqft}} former Masonic temple in the Renaissance Revival style to house its works.  After extensive renovations that included the addition of the two dramatic marble stairways linking the first floor and mezzanine, the museum opened to the public on April 7, 1987. The Elizabeth A. Kasser Wing opened November 8, 1997 making the entire facility {{convert|84110|sqft}}.

===Wilhelmina Cole Holladay===
{{main|Wilhelmina Cole Holladay}}
[[Wilhelmina Cole Holladay]] is the founder and chair of the Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Since her discovery that women artists have historically been omitted from collegiate art history texts, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay has made it her mission to bring to the forefront the accomplishments of women through collecting, exhibiting and researching women artists of all nationalities and time periods.

Holladay created individual committees of over 1,000 volunteers from 27 states and 7 countries, to give educational opportunities to children through collaborations with schools and other community groups (e.g. [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]), as well as provided opportunities for adults to participate and encourage art in local communities across the globe.

Wilhelmina Cole Holladay's interest in art was sparked as a student at [[Elmira College]] in New York, where she studied art history, followed by graduate work at the [[University of Paris]].  She is listed in ''[[Who's Who of American Women]]'', ''[[Who's Who in American Art]]'', ''[[Who's Who in the World]]'', and she holds many honorary degrees and achievement awards for her work in the arts community. In 2006 she received the [[National Medal of Arts]] from the United States and the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' from the French government. In 2007 Holladay received the Gold Medal for the Arts from the [[National Arts Club]] in New York City.

===New York Avenue Sculpture Project===
{{see also|Les Trois Grâces|Nana on a Dolphin}}
By 2015, a selection of sculptures will be installed along New York Avenue from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of [[Mount Vernon Square]]. The museums efforts are in part to bring "character" to an area where "there is a lot of good stuff going on," due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood.

[[Niki de Saint Phalle]]'s works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jacqueline Trescott | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts to turn D.C. corridor into sculpture alley | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/23/AR2010022304712.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museums installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works are meant to be contrasting to the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington. All five major median strips will eventually be made into "sculpture islands," as described by National Museum of Women in the Art's director [[Susan Fisher Sterling]]. Another inspiration for the project comes from the lack of innovative contemporary art in Washington, encouraging the evolution of an area that is in need of becoming hip and vibrant.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt; The second artist to be featured, whose works are on display March 8, 2012 – March 9, 2014, was [[Chakaia Booker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|url=http://womeninthearts.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/chakaia-booker-evocative-dynamic-works-in-the-new-york-avenue-sculpture-project/|date=March 7, 2012|title=Chakaia Booker: Evocative, Dynamic Works in the New York Avenue Sculpture Project|author=Orin Zahra|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has been sponsored by Medda Gudelsky, the D.C. Downtown B.I.D., the Philip L. Graham Fund, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Family Foundation, members of the museum, the D.C. Department of Transportation, among others.&lt;ref name="Pressphalle"&gt;{{cite web | author=Michelle Cragle | year=2010 | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts Announces Sculpture Project | work=Press Center | publisher=Niki Charitable Art Foundation | url=http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | accessdate=8 Feb 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306070929/http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | archivedate=2010-03-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These works will remain up for one year, before being returned to the artists foundation.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Blake Gopnik | title=Sculptures add color to New York Avenue, but are they art? | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703104.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
[[File:Young Girl with a Sheaf.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Claudel]], ''Young Girl with a Sheaf'', ca. 1890]]

The collection currently contains more than 4,500 works in a variety of styles and media, spanning from the 16th century to present day. Among the earliest works is [[Lavinia Fontana]]’s Portrait of a Noblewoman, ca. 1580. There are also a number of special collections, including 18th century botanical prints, works by British and Irish women silversmiths from the 17th–19th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmwa.org/collection/|title=Collection Highlights - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 1,000 unique and limited edition artists’ books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/library/artistbook.asp|title=Library &amp; Archives - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=www.nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 1,000 artists are represented, including [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Rosa Bonheur]], [[Chakaia Booker]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Lola Alvarez Bravo]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Camille Claudel]], [[Louisa Courtauld]], [[Petah Coyne]], [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]], [[Elaine de Kooning]], [[Lesley Dill]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sonia Gechtoff]], [[Marguerite Gérard]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Angelica Kauffman]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Justine Kurland]], [[Bettye Lane]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Hung Liu]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Martinez]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Gabriele Münter]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Sarah Miriam Peale]], [[Clara Peeters]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Jaune Quick-to-See Smith]], [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Elisabetta Sirani]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Lilly Martin Spencer]], [[Alma Thomas]], [[Suzanne Valadon]], and [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun]].

== Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center ==
The Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center (LRC) provides researchers with information about women visual artists from all time periods and nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/learn/library-archives|title=Library &amp; Archives - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=www.nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to scholars, students, researchers, curators, museum professionals, and the general public. The LRC collection includes 18,500 volumes of books and exhibition catalogues, 50 periodical titles, and research files on 18,000 individual women artists. These files include resumes, correspondence, reproductions, articles, and other ephemeral materials. The Arts and Entertainment Network Media Library holds approximately 500 videos, DVDs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials, including examples of video art, interviews with women artists, documentaries, and films directed by women.

Also available to researchers are The Nelleke Nix and Marianne Huber Collection: The Frida Kahlo Papers consists of more than 360 unpublished letters, postcards, notes, clippings, printed matter, and drawings relating to the artist's life and work.

In spring 2007, the LRC launched "[[Clara database|Clara: Database of Women Artists]]," a user-friendly searchable interface for biographic information on close to 18,000 historic and contemporary women artists from around the world. Since integrated within the NMWA web site, Clara has been decommissioned and is in the process of being moved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6830">'''Nature printing''' is a printing process, developed in the 18th century, that uses the plants, animals, rocks and other natural subjects to produce an image.  The subject undergoes several stages to give a direct impression onto materials such as lead, gum, and photographic plates, which are then used in the printing process.

[[Image:Nature print (Bradbury).jpg|thumb|Plate from ''The Nature-printed British Seaweeds'', (1859-60).]]

Another person attributed with the invention of the process, [[:de:Naturselbstdruck|''Naturselbstdruck'']], is [[Alois Auer]]; the first publication, of instructions for the process, was by this Austrian printer in ''The Discovery of the Natural Printing Process: an Invention ...''  Vienna, 1853. This was written in four languages by the author.  He shows the use of plants, a fossil fish, and lace impressed by roller onto a lead plate, this is hand coloured and transferred to the final print.  
[[Image:Nature print, Alois Auer.jpg|thumb|240px]]
Many others botanical and natural history illustrations had attempted to use techniques that were a 'shorthand', or for a type of accuracy, in the representation of subjects. Another printer, the Englishman [[Henry Bradbury]], immediately used Auer's 'nature printing' process to publish work of his own. These included two major botanical works; 
*''[[The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland]]'', [[Thomas Moore (botanist)|Moore, Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland; Edited by [[John Lindley]]. Nature-printed by Henry Bradbury. London: Bradbury &amp; Evans, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt;(1857) and the rendition of these species was readily adapted to the process; the two dimensional print would reveal form and detail for the identification of species.
*''The Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds'', W.G. Johnstone &amp; A. Croall. 1859-60.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, William Grosart &amp; Alexander Croall. ''The Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds: A History, accompanied by figures and dissections, of the algæ of the British Isles''. Four volumes. London: Bradbury &amp; Evans, 1859-60. Text available on Google books [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yaTjgEACAAJ&amp;dq=nature+printed+british+sea+weeds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy9_TitsrKAhUH4D4KHTfFCl8Q6AEILzAD here].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sherman Denton]] in his book ''As Nature Shows Them: Moths and Butterflies ...'' used the wings of the species he was describing by pressing them into the page itself. For this work he used over 50,000 insects.&lt;ref name=Dentonc1900&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denton|first1=Sherman Foote|title=As nature shows them : moths and butterflies of the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains : with over 400 photographic illustrations in the text and many transfers of species from life|page = vi|date=1900|publisher=J.B. Millet|location=Boston, U.S.A|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/45790#page/11/mode/1up|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auer method==
Auer's method can only be used with objects with tolerably flat surfaces, such as dried and pressed plants, embroidery and lace, and a few animals. The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, both of which are smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes.  For larger numbers of images, a facsimile to be used as the printing plate is made in copper by the [[electrotyping|electrotype]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Nature Printing|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otesánek''' is a [[Czech literature|Czech]] fairy tale created by [[Karel Jaromír Erben]] in the 19th century which tells the story of a fearsome and constantly hungry, living log of wood. In the story there are elements of narrative that are similar to more famous fairy tales such as [[The Adventures of Pinocchio]] and [[Little Red Riding Hood]]; despite this, the themes present in Otesánek appear nonetheless to be quite different from most other European fairy tales, with a particularly ambiguous [[moral]] which leaves a lot of room to subjective interpretation.

==Plot==
The story begins with a couple that for a long time has been waiting for a child, which however does not seem to arrive. One day the husband finds in the nearby forest a log of wood (Otesánek) that strangely resembles a baby and decides to bring it home. To the joy of the couple, the wooden baby comes to life and asks to be fed. Initially the couple is enthusiastic that their wish of having a child has finally been granted, however the situation soon takes a turn for the worse as they find themselves having to deal with the insatiable appetite of the baby, who will keep growing and eating until he will start eating even people, including his parents. The log anticipates each meal with a nursery rhyme in which he lists every previous meal he has done. The story eventually concludes with the death of Otesánek at the hands of an elderly lady of the village who rips open his chest with a hoe, thus killing the monster and freeing all those who were eaten by him, including his parents.

==Film adaptation==
The film ''[[Little Otik]]'', directed by [[Jan Švankmajer]], was released in 2000 and is greatly inspired by this fairly tale.

A '''parallel import''' is a non-[[counterfeit]] [[good (accounting)|product]] imported from another country without the permission of the [[intellectual property]] owner. Parallel imports are often referred to as [[grey market|grey product]] and are implicated in issues of [[international trade]], and [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/parallel_imports_e.htm|title=WTO - Glossary - parallel imports|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing is based on concept of [[exhaustion of intellectual property rights]]: according to this concept, when the product is first launched on the market in a particular jurisdiction, parallel importation is authorized to all residents in the state in question. Some countries allow it but others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Pages/ParallelImportsGrayMarket.aspx|title=Parallel Imports/Gray Market|website=www.inta.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing of pharmaceuticals reduces price of pharmaceuticals by introducing competition; [[TRIPS agreement]] in Article 6 states that this practice cannot be challenged under the WTO dispute settlement system and so is effectively a matter of national discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/factsheet_pharm02_e.htm|title=WTO - Intellectual property (TRIPS) - fact sheet - pharmaceuticals - 2|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of parallel importing is often advocated in the case of software, music, printed texts and electronic products, and occurs for several reasons:

# Different versions of a product are produced for sale in different markets: the UK edition of [[Top Gear Magazine]] is officially sold in the UK, and [[Top Gear Australia (magazine)|Top Gear Australia]] is officially sold in Australia. However some unofficial distributors in [[Australia]] also sell the UK edition of Top Gear Magazine.
# Companies, either the manufacturer or the distributor, set different [[price points]] for their products in different markets. Parallel importers ordinarily purchase products in one country at a price (P1) which is cheaper than the price at which they are sold in a second country (P2), import the products into the second country, and benefitting from [[arbitrage]], sell the products in that country at a price which is usually between P1 and P2.
# Consumers who are able to obtain more competitively priced items and may be able to avoid local sales taxes, are placed on an even footing with consumers who have less access to overseas sales online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Question ANswered |url=https://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |accessdate=16 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515131714/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some advocacy groups support parallel importing on the grounds of enhancing the free flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825182748/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=25 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International approach==
Parallel importing is regulated differently in different jurisdictions; there is no consistency in laws dealing with parallel imports between countries. Neither the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] nor the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] explicitly prohibit parallel importation.

===Australia===
The Australian market is an example of a relatively small consumer market which does not benefit from the economies of scale and competition available in the larger global economies. Australia tends to have lower levels of competition in many industries and oligopolies are common in industries like banking, supermarkets, and mobile telecommunications.

Private Enterprise will use product segmentation strategies to legally maximise profit. This often includes varying the service levels, pricing and product features to improve so called "fit" to the local marketplace. However this segmentation may mean an identical products at often higher prices. This can be termed "Price Discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winning entry for the Kirby Cup 2012 {{!}} Saving the right to parallel import in a digital world|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/winning-entry-kirby-cup-2012-saving-right-parallel-import-digital-world |date=22 Nov 2012 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the Internet, Australian consumers can readily compare prices globally and have been able to identify products exhibiting Price Discrimination, also known as the "[[Australia Tax]]".

In 1991, the Australian Government resolved to remove parallel import restrictions from a range of products except cars. It followed this up with legislation making it legal to source music and software CDs from overseas and import them into Australia. An Australian Productivity Commission report recommended in July 2009 that legislation be extended to legalise the parallel importing of books, with three years' notice for publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Andrew|title=Australia: Productivity Commission Recommends Removal Of Parallel Import Protection For Books|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=83242|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission also recommended abolishing restrictions on parallel importing of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charlwood|first1=Sam|title=Cheaper second-hand imported cars a step closer|url=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/cheaper-secondhand-imported-cars-a-step-closer-20140214-32prt.html|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Court of Australia [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/130.html decision] shows that parallel imported items with valid trademark are subject to [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/s123.html Section 123 of the Trade Mark Act].

Various Parliament of Australia committees have investigated allegations of Price Discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Representatives Committees|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ic/itpricing/subs.htm|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union/European Economic Area===
The [[European Union]] (and [[European Economic Area]]) requires the doctrine of international exhaustion to exist between member states (contracting states) but EU legislation for trade marks, design rights and copyright prohibits its application to goods put on the market outside the EU/EEA.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] has held that the [[exhaustion of rights|doctrine of international exhaustion]] governs parallel importation, subject to the EU rules above.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, parallel importation is permitted under both, the [[Trade Mark]] and (amended) [[Copyright]] Ordinance before The Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 came into force 6 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214013629/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Seven arrested for copyright infringement&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]]'s intellectual property rights law prohibits audiovisual articles marketed for export from being sold domestically, and such sale of "re-imported" CDs are illegal.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], legal precedent has established that parallel importation is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/135.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]], the US Supreme Court held that the [[first-sale doctrine]] applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad, thus permitting importation and resale of many product categories.

Moreover, Science, State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies, Appropriations Act of 2006 prohibits future FTAs from categorically disallowing the parallel import of patented products.&lt;ref&gt;Shayerah Ilias, Ian Fergusson, “Intellectual Property Rights and International Trade,” Congressional research Service, February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobiles==
{{mainarticle|Grey import vehicle}}

===United States===
The United States has unique automobile design legislation administered by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. Certain car makers find the required modifications too expensive. This creates demand for [[grey import vehicles]], where certain models are modified for individual customers to meet these requirements, at a higher expense than if this were done by the original manufacturer on an [[assembly line]]. This procedure interferes with the marketing scheme of the manufacturer, who might plan to import a less powerful car and force consumers to accept it. The Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988 basically ended the gray market by requiring manufacturer certification of  U.S.-bound cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Aaron|title=How To: Win the Car-Importing Game|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/how-to-win-the-car-importing-game/|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel-imported foodstuffs, etc.==
Markets for parallel imports and locally made products sometimes exist alongside each other even though the parallel imports are markedly more expensive. This may be for various reasons, but is mostly observed in foodstuffs and toiletry.

Due to the nature of hotels, travellers often have little information on where to shop except in the immediate vicinity. Grocery shops opened to serve brand-name hotels often feature parallel-imported foodstuffs and toiletry to cater to travellers so that they can easily recognise the product they have been using at home.

Foodstuffs and toiletry made from different plants may vary in quality because different plants may use materials or reagents (such as water used for washing, food additives) from different sources, although they are usually subject to the same standards by internal QC or public health authorities. A person may be allergic to the foodstuff or toiletry made by some plants but not others.

To sum up, the major reasons for such a market are:

* Lack of information
* Recognisability
* Avoidance of risk due to products by different plants
&lt;!--Appreciated if someone could improve clarity--&gt;

==Issues==
A manifestation of the philosophical divide between those who support various intellectual property and [[Criticism of intellectual property|those who are critical of it]], is the divide over the legitimacy of parallel importation. Some believe that it benefits consumers by lowering prices and widening the selection and consumption of products available in the [[Market (economics)|market]], while others believe that it discourages intellectual property owners from investing in new and [[innovation|innovative]] products. Some also believe that parallel imports tend to facilitate [[copyright infringement]].

This tension essentially concerns the [[rights]] and [[duty|duties]] of a protected [[monopoly]]. Intellectual property rights allow the holder to sell at a price that is higher than the price one would pay in a [[competition|competitive market]], but by doing so the holder relinquishes sales to those who would be prepared to buy at a price between the monopoly price and the competitive price. The presence of parallel imports in the marketplace prevents the holder from exploiting the monopoly further by [[market segmentation]], i.e. by applying different prices to different consumers.

[[Consumer organisation]]s tend to support parallel importation as it offers consumers more choice and lower prices, provided that consumers retain equivalent legal protection to locally sourced products (e.g. in the form of [[warranty|warranties]] with international effect), and competition is not diminished.

However, such organisations also warn consumers of certain risks in using parallel-imported products. Although the products may have been made to comply with the laws and customs of their place of origin, these products or their use may not comply with those in places where they are used, or some of their functions may be rendered unusable or meaningless (which may needlessly drive up prices). Electronic devices, however, suffer less from this type of risk because newer models support more than one user language.

==Examples==

===Australia===
Importation of [[computer games]] and computer game hardware from [[Asia]] is a common practice for some wholesale and/or retail stockists. Many consumers now take advantage of on-line stores in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United States]] to purchase computer games at or near half the cost of a retail purchase from the Australian RRP. Often the versions sold by the Asian retailers are manufactured in Australia to begin with. An example is [[Crysis]], which was available from Hong Kong on-line stores for approximately $50 AUD but whose retail cost in Australia was close to $100. Crysis was sold in Asia using identical versions of the game box and disc, right down to including Australian censor ratings on the box.

===Hong Kong===
{{See also|Parallel trading in Hong Kong}}
Importation of [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] [[toothpaste]] from [[Thailand]] into [[Hong Kong]]. The goods are bought in markets where the price is lower, and sold in markets where the price of the same goods is, for a variety of reasons, higher. Electronic goods like Apple's [[iPad]] are frequently imported in Hong Kong before they're official and resold to South-East Asian early adopters for a premium.

===New Zealand===
The practice exists of luxury [[automobile|car]] dealers in [[New Zealand]] buying [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[vehicle]]s in [[Malaysia]] at a low price, and importing the cars into New Zealand to sell at a price lower than the price offered by Mercedes Benz to New Zealand consumers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are also many parallel import dealers of electronics hardware. Parallel importing is allowed in New Zealand and has resulted in a significant lowering of margins on many products. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Poland===
There is an opinion, not scientifically proven, but very popular among people in Poland that "Western" washing powders are more effective in cleaning than Polish, because chemistry companies allegedly produce items of higher quality for Western Europe, not as good as for Poland. Because of that, there are companies and online stores importing Western chemistry supplies to Poland (for example from Germany), even if similar brands are available there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luna24.pl/produkty/proszki-do-prania,2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pralinka.pl/Chemia-z-niemiec/niemiecki-proszek-do-prania/|title=Proszki do prania z Niemiec - niemiecka chemia pralinka.pl|first=Trol|last=InterMedia|website=www.pralinka.pl|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Federation===
&lt;!-- according to the rg.ru article, external trade volume is 12 times that of internal trade --&gt;
According to [http://bablaw.livejournal.com/ Anatoliy Semyonov], trademark rights exhaustion turned national in 2002, and, as of April 2013, an act is being prepared that could make original goods imported without a permission of the producer officially "counterfeit" (by replacing things on which "a trademark is located illegally" with things "on which an illegally used trademark is located"). He notes that, according to the [[Criminal Code of Russia|Criminal Code]], illegal use of a trademark can be punished up to 6 years of imprisonment; and a similar article in the [[Offences Code of Russia|Offences Code]] makes goods with an illegal copy of a trademark subject to confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===European Union===
Some [[PlayStation Portable|Sony PSP]] video game consoles were imported into the [[European Economic Area]] from Japan up to twelve months prior to the European launch. The unusual component of this example is that some importers were selling the console for a higher price than the intended EU price, taking advantage of the relative monopoly they enjoyed. After the release the console was commonly imported from the USA where it was retailed for much lower price.

Other example are smart phones, which are being imported from China, where an average device can be bought for about $100 while a similar device would be retailed for about 200€ in the EU.

'''''Portrait of Émile Zola''''' is a painting of [[Émile Zola]] by [[Édouard Manet]]. Manet submitted the portrait to the 1868 Salon.
[[Image:Edouard Manet 049.jpg|thumb|right|220px]]

At this time Zola was known for his art criticism, and perhaps particularly as the writer of the novel [[Thérèse Raquin]].  This told the story of an adulterous affair between Thérèse, the wife of a clerk in a railway company, and a would-be painter named Laurent, whose work, rather like that of Zola's friend [[Paul Cézanne]], is denigrated by the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Ross King, ''The Judgment of Paris'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eleventh chapter the milieu of Manet's [[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe]] is evoked, in the murder scene, where Camille, the husband, goes out for the day with his wife and her lover to [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]].

On the wall is a reproduction of Manet's ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'', a controversial painting at the 1865 Salon but which Zola considered Manet's best work. "Behind it is an engraving from [[Diego Velázquez|Velazquez]]'s ''Bacchus'' indicating the taste for Spanish art shared by the painter and the writer. A Japanese print of a wrestler by [[Utagawa school|Utagawa Kuniaki II]] completes the décor."  A Japanese screen on the left of the picture recalls the role that the Far East played in revolutionizing ideas on perspective and colour in European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/emile-zola-3060.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=97ca12b598 musee-orsay]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Portrait of Juan de Pareja''''' is a painting by Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] of his assistant [[Juan de Pareja]], a notable painter in his own right, who was [[Slavery in Spain|enslaved]] and owned by Velázquez at the time the painting was completed. Velázquez painted the portrait in [[Rome]], while traveling in [[Italy]], in 1650.

==History==
In 1649, as court painter to [[Philip IV of Spain]], Diego Velázquez was sent to Rome to purchase works of art for the [[Alcázar]] in Madrid. Velázquez brought with him Juan de Pareja, a  [[Slavery in Spain|enslaved man]], who served as an assistant in the artist's workshop.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/437869 Metropolitan Museum of Art website]&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Rome, Velázquez executed an oil painting of Juan de Pareja, which was displayed as part of a larger exhibition of paintings at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] on 19 March 1650. According to Antonio Palomino's biography of Velázquez, the painting "was generally applauded by all the painters from different countries, who said that the other pictures in the show were art but this one alone was 'truth'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Palomino, Antonio | title= El Museo pictórico y escala óptica | year=1724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Velázquez painted the portrait of [[Juan de Pareja]], who was of Moorish descent,&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"/&gt; in his workshop, as an exercise in preparation for his official [[portrait of Pope Innocent X]]. The Pope, a ruddy-faced man who would be depicted in the bright pink and crimson robes of his office, presented a tricky study in both color and composition. Additionally, since he would be executing a portrait from life, Velázquez would be forced to work quickly while still capturing the essence of Innocent X's character. The ''Portrait of Juan de Pareja'' reflects Velázquez's exploration of the difficulties he would encounter in the Pope's portrait. To compensate for a restricted palette of colors, Velázquez adopted a loose, almost impressionistic style of brushwork to bring an intense vitality to his subject.

Juan de Pareja (circa 1610 – 1670) became an artist in his own right, and in 1654 he was freed by Velázquez.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"/&gt;

== Provenance and copies ==
The [[Provenance|painting's ownership]] between its first exhibition at the Pantheon in Rome in 1650 and the end of the eighteenth century is unknown. There is no record of the painting in Spain. The earliest record of the ownership of the painting was in essay written in 1765 by [[Francisco Preciado]], Director of the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]] in Rome. He stated that the painting owned by Cardinal Trajano D'Acquaviva (1694-1747) who lived in Rome.

The painting then reappears in the record as part of the dukes of Baranello's collection in [[Naples]] sometime in the 1700s. It was recorded as part of the collection of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], the [[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the Two Sicilies#Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Naples and.2For the Kingdom of Sicily|British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples]] from 1764 to 1798. The inventory of his residence in Naples, Palazzo Sessa, lists  "a portrait of a Moresco slave by Velazquez." Hamilton sent the portrait and his other works of art to London for safekeeping, on board the ship [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS Fondroyant]] the [[flagship]] of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], when he left Naples. Hamilton returned to England heavily in debt and the portrait was auctioned at [[Christie's]] in 1801. The auction catalogue listed the painting as Velazquez's "Portrait of a Moorish Slave, that was in his service, and became a great Painter". It sold for 39 guineas and disappeared from the record again.

It later surfaces in the collection of [[Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 2nd Earl of Radnor|Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie]], 2nd [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]], [[Salisbury]]. In a catalogue of the Radnor family's collection, published in 1909, stated that the portrait was part of the collection by 1814 and may have been acquired in 1811. It remained in the ownership of the Radnor family for over 150 years until it was sold at Christie's in London for the record sum of £2,310,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/dec/01/archive-velazquez-scarred-price-tag|title=From the Observer archive: 29 November 1970: A Velázquez now forever scarred by its £2m price-tag|last=Gosling|first=Nigel|date=2013-12-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2,200,000 guineas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/luxury/art-and-antiques/5-sales-made-christies-no-5-first-million-pound-picture-144183|title=The 5 sales which made Christie’s - No.5: The first million-pound picture - Country Life|date=2016-12-30|work=Country Life|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $5,544,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 5, 1971|title=Comment|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1971/06/05/comment-5350|journal=The New Yorker|volume=|pages=31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on 27 November 1970.

'''''Portrait of Père Tanguy''''', painted by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1887, is one of his three paintings of Julien Tanguy. The three works demonstrate a progression in van Gogh's artistic style after his arrival in Paris. The first is somber, and formed from a simple composition. The second introduces [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|van Gogh's Japanese prints]]. The last and most advanced in style, skill and color integrates [[Japanese art|Japanese]], [[Impressionism|Impressionist]], and other influences on the Parisian artist community. This painting conveys a sense of serenity that van Gogh seeks for himself. This last painting of Tanguy is in the [[Musée Rodin]], Paris.

==Van Gogh in Paris==
In 1886 van Gogh left the [[Netherlands]] never to return. He moved to Paris to live with his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], a Parisian art dealer. Vincent entered Paris as a shy, somber man. While his personality would never change, he emerged artistically into what one critic described as a "singing bird".&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; Although van Gogh had been influenced by great masters in the Netherlands, coming to Paris meant that he was exposed to Impressionists, [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], [[Pointillism|Pointillists]], and Japanese art (''see [[Japonism]]''). His circle of friends included [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], [[Paul Signac]], and others. The works of the Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artists [[Hiroshige]] and [[Hokusai]] greatly influenced van Gogh, both for the subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors without shadow.  In the two years from 1886 through 1888 he spent working in Paris, van Gogh explored the various genres, creating his own unique style.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | editor=Editors of Time-Life Books | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | pages=40, 69 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==
The brightly colored painting and confident subject represent a shift in Vincent's attitude.&lt;ref name="Meier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt; Van Gogh called his use of bright colors "gymnastics" that through experimentation created great depth, harmony and balance in his work.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt;  The painting contains a background of van Gogh's Japanese prints that were sold at Tanguy's shop.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt; On top of Tanguy's hat is [[Mount Fuji]];&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; [[Kabuki]] actors share the wall with cherry trees in bloom.&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt;

The Japanese paintings represent van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister during this period, "Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little – nothing – for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop."&lt;ref name="Meier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite book | title=The pursuit of spiritual wisdom: the thought and art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin | author=Maurer, N | publisher=Associated University Presses | location=Cranbury | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | pages=55, 59 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to capture serenity in his painting, Van Gogh paints Tanguy with a calm, contemplative nature. Historian of Symbolism Naomi Maurer describes him as having the "iconic tranquility of Buddha."&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;

Van Gogh died in 1890 and Tanguy four years after. Following Tanguy's death, his daughter sold the ''Portrait of Père Tanguy'' to sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref name="Strieter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nineteenth-Century European Art: A Topical Dictionary | author=Strieter, T | publisher=Greenwood Press | location=Westport, CT, USA | year=1999 | pages=174–175 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDr7Tbk__1kC&amp;pg=PA174 | isbn=0-313-29898-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Portrait of Père Tanguy,'' previously in Rodin's personal collection, is in the permanent collection at [[Musée Rodin]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Rodin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/welcome.htm |title=Rodin as a Collector (Extract from the work Rodin - Le musée et ses collections, published by Scala, Paris, 1996) |author= |date= |work=Collections |publisher=Musée Rodin |accessdate=March 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406115207/http://www.musee-rodin.fr/welcome.htm |archivedate=April 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Julien Tanguy==
Julien François Tanguy (1825 [[Plédran]] - 1894 Paris) was a paint grinder who sold art supplies and was also an art dealer,&lt;ref name="Gay"/&gt; one of the first to offer van Gogh's paintings for sale.&lt;ref name="Leeuw"&gt;{{cite book | title=The letters of Vincent Van Gogh | author=Leeuw, R | publisher=Penguin Group | location=London and other locations | origyear=1996 | year=1997 | page=329 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyX5lfrof6oC&amp;pg=PA329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His jovial demeanor and enthusiasm for artistry and artists made his shop one of the most favored art supply shops in Paris, and he was nicknamed ''Père'' ("Father") Tanguy.&lt;ref name="Gay"/&gt; Maurer calls Tanguy a father figure who shared his food and money with artists and showed their paintings with pride.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;

Tanguy took paintings as payment for paints,&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay"/&gt; which [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] said made entering his shop in [[Montmartre]], full of Impressionist paintings, like "visiting a museum".&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; In comparison to her husband, Tanguy's wife was less cooperative and more concerned with clientele paying outstanding charges.&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt; When Tanguy died, his friends staged an auction for his widow.&lt;ref name="Gay"&gt;{{cite book | title=Pleasure Wars | author=Gay, P | publisher=W.

[[Octave Mirbeau]] wrote a notice about him in ''[[L'Écho de Paris]]'' on 13 February 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8002580 |work= L'Écho de Paris|title=Le Père Tanguy|date=13 February 1894|accessdate=29 November 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three ''Portraits of Julien Tanguy''==
Van Gogh painted three portraits of Julien (Père) Tanguy.

'''San Bartolo Coyotepec''' is a town and [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] located  in the center of the Mexican state of [[Oaxaca]]. It is in the [[Centro District, Oaxaca|Centro District]] of the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Valles Centrales region]] about fifteen km south of the capital of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]].&lt;ref name="encmuc"&gt;{{cite web|title=San Bartolo Coyotepec|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20115a.htm|work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|publisher=[[Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal]]|accessdate=March  10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328232319/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20115a.htm|archivedate=2007-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town is best known for its [[barro Negro pottery|''Barro negro pottery'' - black clay pottery]]. For hundreds of years pottery has been made here with a gray matte finish, but in the 1950s a technique was devised to give the pieces a shiny black finish without painting. This has made the pottery far more popular and collectable.&lt;ref name="once"&gt;{{cite news |title= El proceso de elaboración de artesanías de barro negro de Oaxaca |url= http://oncetv-ipn.net/noticias/index.php?modulo=despliegue&amp;dt_fecha=2007-10-08&amp;numnota=46 |agency= Redacción Once Noticias |newspaper=Once Noticias |location=Mexico City |date=2007-10-08 |accessdate=2010-03-08 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The process of crafting barro negro crafts of Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"&gt;{{cite news |title= El arte y la magia de Dona Rosa |first=Alicia |last=Boy |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date= 2000-08-27 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The arte and magic of Doña Rosa }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The town is home to the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca (State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca) which was opened here in 2004, with a large portion of its collection consisting of barro negro pottery.&lt;ref name="oaxgob"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=75:museo-estatal-de-arte-popular-oaxaca&amp;catid=31:museos&amp;Itemid=38 |title= MUSEO ESTATAL DE ARTE POPULAR "OAXACA" |publisher=State of Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=Spanish |trans-title=State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca |accessdate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a barro negro mural on the recently  opened Baseball Academy.&lt;ref name="beisbol"&gt;{{cite news |title= Inaugura Harp Helú academia de beisbol en San Bartolo Coyotepec |url= http://www.e-consulta.com/oaxaca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11867&amp;Itemid=27  |newspaper= e-Consulta Noticias |location=Mexico |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Harp Helú inaugurates the academy of baseball in San Bartolo Coyotepec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Zapotec civilization}}
The area was the settled homeland of the ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Zapotec civilization]] going back at least 2500 years, with the oldest archeological finds being in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]].  Its [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec language]] name is ''Zaapeche'', place of many [[jaguar]]s ''(Panthera onca)''.&lt;ref name=artifices/&gt; In 1521, the area became an encomiendo under Bartolomé Sánchez who named the settlement, San Jacinto Leontepec. Later, this was changed to the current name. San Bartolo refers to the patron saint, Bartholomew and Coyotepec is from [[Nahuatl]] meaning "hill of coyotes."&lt;ref name=artifices/&gt;

[[Zaachila Zapotec]] is spoken in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{ethnolink|ztx|Zaachila Zapotec}} at ''Ethnologue''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pottery community of 2,000 years===
San Bartolo is a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] [[community]], which has been making [[pottery]] for about 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mentiras verdaderas’’ en alfarería |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/25938.8220-mentiras-verdaderas-8217-8217-en-alfare.html |newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon |location=Torreon, Coahuila |date= April 2, 2003 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title="True Lies" in pottery }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clay of this area produces a distinctive color, which for most of San Bartolo’s history was a [[Grey]] [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]]. This clay has been used to produce utilitarian objects such as [[jar]]s, [[Dishware|dish]]es and other storage containers.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrotizvargas"&gt;{{cite news |title= San Bartolo Coyotepec, Oaxaca |first= Hilda |last= Ortiz Vargas |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/entretenimiento/2008/14428/6/san-bartolo-coyotepec-oaxaca.htm  |newspaper=El |location=Oaxaca, Oaxaca |date=May 24, 2008 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:BartoloChurchSBC1.JPG|thumb|left|The Church of San Bartolo, with ancient [[Zapotec civilization]] [[Pyramid]]s in the left background.]]The techniques for making the pottery have changed little during these centuries, with plates serving as potters’ wheels and design remaining traditional. One change has been the replacement of underground pits by [[kiln]]s for firing the pieces.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt; However, the most important innovation has been a polishing method devised by ceramic artist and [[pottery|potter]] Doña Rosa in the 1950s. Doña Rosa discovered that by polishing the nearly dry clay before firing, the gray color turned to a shiny black.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; This has made the pottery far more popular, and many pieces are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utilitarian.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; Since then, the aesthetic qualities of "barro negro" (black clay) pottery has become further appreciated due to the work of artisan-sculpture Carlomagno Pedro Martinez, who has displayed his barro negro work nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt;

===Spanish era===
The end of the [[Pre-Columbian era]] arrived with [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest and occupation]] of the [[Zapotec peoples]] region in 1521. It was first renamed 'San Jacinto Leóntepec,' It then changed again to 'San Bartolomé Coyotepec,' by Bartolomé Sanchez, a soldier of [[Hernán Cortés]] awarded a local [[Encomienda]]. The first church was built in 1532. From its Spanish foundation was one of the larger settlements with three neighborhoods. This settlement was laid out by the same architect that designed the city of Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;
[[Vicente Guerrero]] passed through here after he was taken prisoner, and [[Porfirio Díaz]] hid here during the [[French Intervention in Mexico]].&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

==The town==
The center of the town is similar to that of the city of Oaxaca, with a main plaza, parish church and municipal palace. The eastern side of the main plaza is dominated by a [[ceiba]] tree.&lt;ref name=artifices/&gt; In the [[tianguis]] or other markets, one can find regional dishes such as [[mole (sauce)|mole negro, mole coloradito]], cequeza, higaditos and stews made from chicken or turkey. There are some pre-Hispanic remains of buildings which were ceremonial centers or houses for the ruling class.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; The rest of the town is divided into three neighborhoods called "centro" or "San Bartolo," "San Mateo" and in the north "Santa María." Very near there are two other communities called Animas Trujano and San Juan Bautistas la Raya founded around the same time as San Bartolo Coyotepec, but they are not considered part of the town proper.&lt;ref name=artifices/&gt; Next to the town is the hill called Zaapech or Jaguar Mountain which has always been considered sacred.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt; 
                                                                              
One of the major festivals here is [[Candlemas]]. The patron saint, [[Bartholomew the Apostle]] is feasted in August. During festivals such as these, local traditional dances such as De la Pluma and De los Jardineros Moros y Cristianos can be seen. Both date from the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]].&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

===''Mercado Artesanal'' (Crafts Market)===

However two of the main attractions for the town are  Mercado Artesanal (Crafts Market) filled mostly with barro negro pottery and the ''Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca'' (State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca).

===State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca - MEAPO===

[[File:WallMEAPO.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Display of local [[Textile arts]] at MEAPO - State Museum of Popular Art of [[Oaxaca]].]]The [[Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca|Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca - MEAPO, the State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca]],  was founded in 2004 to promote and preserve the traditional crafts of this state. The museum was designed by and is cared for by a commission of craftsmen from San Bartolo Coyotepec.  The museum sponsors events such as the "Tianguis artisanal", a crafts [[flea market]], along with other civic groups.&lt;ref name="expo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Expo venta artesanal en San Bartolo Coyotepec |url=http://www.diariodespertar.com.mx/cultura/27796-Expo-venta-artesanal-San-Bartolo-Coyotepec.html |newspaper=Despertar |location=Oaxaca |date=January 29, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Expo and sale of crafts in San Bartolo Coyotepec |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722224506/http://www.diariodespertar.com.mx/cultura/27796-Expo-venta-artesanal-San-Bartolo-Coyotepec.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The museum has three halls.
*The first exhibits some of the finest pieces of [[barro negro pottery]] from San Bartolo Coyotepec as well as archeological finds from the area.
*The second contains 92 pieces of prizewinners from the Concurso Estatal de Cerámica "Benito Juárez" (Benito Juarez State Ceramics Competition)  which is sponsored by the 'Artesanias e Industrias Populares del Estado de Oaxaca' -ARIPO, and contains various types of pottery and ceramics from [[Santa Maria Atzompa]], San Marcos Tlapazola, Tamazulapan, [[Ocotlán de Morelos|Ocotlán]], and [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]].
*The third hall contains examples of the [[woodworking]] of the [[San Martín Tilcajete]] community. Craftsmen from this community helped with the building of the museum and [[Mask#Latin America|Mask]]s are the featured item here. The permanent collection contains pieces from about 300 artisans in Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="hrotizvargas"/&gt;

The museum’s roots extend to 1905, when local resident Manuel Guzmán donated land for the establishment of a cultural center. The site was used first as a municipal library and then as a primary school. However,  it was not until 1994 when a group of youths worked to build a museum that would be dedicated to ''barro negro pottery''. That same year, the state government allocated 25,000 pesos to rehabilitate the building on the site, and local artist Carlomagno Pedro Martinez raised 80,000 pesos to install modern equipment.&lt;ref name="expo"/&gt;  In 1996, the museum was founded as the community museum, with  its initial collection. In that year, it sponsored, along with ARIPO -  Artesanías e Industrias Populares del estado de Oaxaca, the first crafts competition. The museum struggled for a while financially until it signed a cooperation agreement with the 'Instituto Oaxaqueño de las Culturas,' the Oaxaca Institute of Cultures, which required a restructuring of the museum. In 2002, the community museum closed with the aim of building the current one. 

In 2004, the current museum opened with the aim of presenting the crafts history of the entire state of [[Oaxaca|Oaxaca, Mexico]]. The museum has held temporary exhibits such as "Mujeres tejiendo historias" (Women knitting stories), "Grandes Maestros del Arte Popular de Oaxaca" (Grand Masters of Popular Art in Oaxaca) and "Historia y evolución del barro negro" (History and evolution of [[barro negro pottery]]).&lt;ref name="expo"/&gt;  The new museum opened with new furniture and designed to international standards. The idea is to create a collection of popular art that represents the eight regions of the state of Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="oaxgob"/&gt;

The mission is to promote Oaxacan handcrafts and popular art to the state's, Mexican, and international communities, as well as foster exchanges among [[artisan]]s and promote tourism based on [[craft]]s. This includes the [[weaving]] and [[textile arts]] in Oaxacan traditions. The museum was built here to decentrale state cultural institutions.&lt;ref name="oaxgob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meapohis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meapo.oaxaca.gob.mx/ante.html |title=HISTORIA DEL MUSEO |publisher=Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca |location=San Bartolo Coyotepec |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of the museum |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100223011955/http://www.meapo.oaxaca.gob.mx/ante.html |archivedate=February 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum offers guided tours in Spanish and English, workshops for adults and children, and spaces to rent for events.&lt;ref name="oaxgob"/&gt;

For almost all of the town’s history, the color of the local pottery was a dull dark gray, until Doña Rosa Real discovered a way to create a shiny black finish t create ''barro negro pottery''.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;  The innovation  made the pottery more popular and famous, with [[Nelson Rockefeller]] having a collection of her pieces.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3594-mexico-s-mezcal-monkey-collectible-ceramic-folk-art-from-oaxaca |title= Mexico's Mezcal Monkey: collectible ceramic folk art from Oaxaca |first=Alvin |last=Starkman  |date=January 31, 2010 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doña Rosa died in 1980, but the tradition of making the ''barro negro pottery'' is being carried on by Doña Rosa’s daughter and grandchildren who stage demonstrations for tourists.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; The [[workshop]] is still in the family home, where shelves and shelves of shiny black pieces for sale line the inner [[courtyard]].&lt;ref name="donafodors"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/mexico/oaxaca/review-176168.html  |title= Mexico's Mezcal Monkey: collectible ceramic folk art from Oaxaca Alfarería Doña Rosa  |publisher=Fodors Travel Guides |accessdate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being the origin of [[black]] [[polished]] [[clay]], the pieces at the Doña Rosa Workshop are less expensive than in other parts of Mexico.&lt;ref name="ajimenez"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barro negro de San Bartolo |first=Alejandro |last=Jiménez |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/41974.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2007-08-12 |accessdate= |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008091855/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/41974.html |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cantaro===

[[File:MezcalCantaroDRSBC.JPG|thumb|175px|A cantaro jar for serving [[mezcal]].]]
Two pottery pieces which are indicative of San Bartolo are the traditional [[Cantaro]], a large jar which can be used for liquid storage or as a musical instrument and the "chango mezcalero" or mezcal monkey. This is a clay container in the shape of a [[monkey]] to hold [[mezcal]], Oaxaca main [[distilled spirit]], which has become a collectable folk art item. The container can be painted in bright colors or left in its gray color with detailed etching. The small opening at the top is plugged by a stopper of cork or [[corncob]]. These bottles are sized to hold about 700 to 1000 milliliters of liquid and were originally meant to serve as decorative containers in [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Two families claim to have originated this clay bottle. The first is that of Doña Rosa. The family believes that Doña Rosa’s husband, Juventino Nieto, invented the design at the request of ''[[cantina]]'' operators from the city of [[Oaxaca]]. Other animal forms were also designed as created as well, but the monkey one gained notoriety. The other family to lay claim to the mezcal monkey is that of Marcelo Simón Galan, now deceased. This family claims that he used to travel with his grey pottery pieces, which included [[water bottle]]s and jars. Like the Doña Rosa family, this family claims the design was created upon request, with Marcelo doing the potting and others the painting. One of Marcelo’s mezcal monkeys is on display at the state crafts museum.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

===Carlomagno Pedro Martinez===

[[File:TzompantliMEAPO.JPG|thumb|right|225px|"Mural de la Conquista" by artist [[Carlomagno Pedro Martínez]] at the ''State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca''-MEAPO]]Another promoter of ''barro negro pottery'' from San Bartolo Coyotepec is Carlomagno Pedro Martinez. He was born here into a pottery-making family. He was named after Charlemagne by his grandmother, who was an admirer of the king.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt; From a young age showed talent in fashioning figures in clay. When he was grown, he attended the Fine Arts Workshop of [[Rufino Tamayo]] in [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca city]]. He has become the first [[Pottery|potter]]-artist-[[sculptor]] in the medium, winning his first recognition in 1985 for his work [[Tlaquepaque]], [[Jalisco]].  His fame increased with his development of [[human skull]]s made of ''barro negro'' in the years that followed.&lt;ref name="hermano"&gt;{{cite news|title=En vida Hermano En Vida Carlomagno Pedro Martinez |first=Luis |last=Soria Castillo |url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/index.php?mod=leer&amp;id=112416&amp;sec=capital&amp;titulo=EN_VIDA_HERMANO_EN_VIDA_CARLOMAGNO_PEDRO_MART%CDNEZ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121208134933/http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/index.php?mod=leer&amp;id=112416&amp;sec=capital&amp;titulo=EN_VIDA_HERMANO_EN_VIDA_CARLOMAGNO_PEDRO_MART%CDNEZ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-08 |newspaper=El Imparcial |location=Oaxaca |date=2010-02-13 |accessdate=2010-03-08 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, he has exhibited his work in dozens of expositions and has won three national level awards. His work has also  been featured in five published books.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt; Martinez’s work has been exhibited in countries such as the United States, [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]], [[Lebanon]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], and  [[Japan]], with one of the latest exhibits in [[New York City]] in 2008. In that same year, he created a [[mural]] in ''barro negro'' at the Baseball Academy in San Bartolo Coyotepec sponsored by the [[Alfredo Harp Helú]] Foundation.&lt;ref name="hermano"/&gt; Each piece Carlomagno makes is unique in some way, but certain themes such as [[oral history|oral histories]], [[Folktales of Mexico#Prehispanic Mexican Tales|indigenous legend]]s, certain Christian themes and death, called "our grandmother."&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt;

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec is the governing authority for the seven other communities: Reyes Mantecón, Cuarta Sección, La Guelavaca (El Tule), El Guapo (San Francisco), La Magdalena, La Soledad, Paraje la Colorada and Paraje la Era.&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msVc9rGy?url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these communities cover an area of 45.93km2&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; and have a total population of just over 8,000 people.(inegi)  The municipality borders the municipalities of [[Santa María Coyotepec]], [[Santa Catarina Quiane]], [[San Martín Tilcajete]], [[Santo Tomás Jalieza]], [[San Juan Teitipac]] and [[Villa de Zaachila]].&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

The most important elevations are Piedra Redonda, Chivaguia Grande, Chivaguia Chica, Guinise Grande, Loma del Cuche, La Peñas and Guibetes. The Atoyac and Valiente Rivers pass through here. The municipality has a [[temperate]] climate with winds mostly from the north.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;
 
[[Agriculture]] employ about 19% of the population growing [[vegetables]] such as corn, beans and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] [[blossom]], as well as decorative flowers such as daisies, [[Tagetes lucida|Mexican marigold]]s and [[poinsettia]]s. [[Orchard]]s here produce [[citrus|orange]]s, [[mango]]s, [[mamey sapote]]s, [[black sapote]]s, [[guava]]s and other [[tropical fruit]]. Livestock includes domestic fowl, pigs, cattle and sheep. About 33% are involved in mining and industry, with most of this population dedicated to the making of ''barro negro pottery''. The rest of the population, about 45% is employed in commerce.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

===Padre, family, and community===

In 1997, Father Manuel Marinero announced that he was in love with a member of the parish church. The Catholic Church responded by immediately putting an end to Marinero’s 24 year career as a priest. However, since then the local community has continued to support him as their spiritual leader. At least as of 2002, the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec has officially been without a priest as Marinero is not recognized. However, the people here still called him "Padre" (Father) and he continues to live in the house that has been traditionally reserved for parish priests with his wife and two children. The Church has asked him to move but the house belongs to the town and the residents want him to stay. It is not unknown for Mexican priests to have significant others, but it is kept hidden and numbers are not known. Marinero’s case is unusual because it is public.&lt;ref name="padrecasado"&gt;{{cite news |title=Aceptan feligreses a padre casado |first=Mary |last=Jordan |url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=84563&amp;tabla=nacion |agency=Washington Post |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 19, 2002 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Parishioners accept married priest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615035122/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=84563&amp;tabla=nacion |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2004, Marinero began to publicly support gay marriage as well&lt;ref name="anodis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anodis.com/nota/1845.asp |title=Manuel Marinero, un cura de la comunidad lésbico-gay |date=2004-03-04 |publisher=ANODIS |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Marinero, a priest for the lesbian-gay community |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231141756/http://anodis.com/nota/1845.asp |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academy of Baseball===

In 2009 the Academy of [[Baseball]] was founded in San Bartolo Coyotepec by [[Alfredo Harp Helú]]. The academy has six instructors and can accommodate sixty students of between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The goal is to prepare young people who hope to have a career in the sport, while supporting the completion of their education. It is the first of its kind in Mexico and the founder hopes that there will be more. The facilities cover more than ten hectares and include a library, computer center, three [[baseball field]]s, and living quarters for students.  Murals were commissioned for the project including "El camino del Sol for el cielo" by José Luis Garcia and a ''barro negro'' mural by Carlomagno Pedro called "Juego en el inframundo."&lt;ref name="beisbol"/&gt;

'''Santa Fe University of Art and Design''' ('''SFUAD''') was a [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit]], accredited four-year university located in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]], US. The university was built from the College of Santa Fe, a Catholic facility founded as '''St. Michael's College''' in 1859, and renamed '''The College of Santa Fe''' in 1966. After financial difficulties in 2009, the campus was purchased by the City of Santa Fe, the State of New Mexico, and [[Laureate Education]], and reopened with a narrowed focus on the film, theater, and other arts. As the Santa Fe University of Art and Design it became a secular college of 950 students.&lt;ref name=petersons/&gt; According to the U.S. Department of Education, as of 2017 the overall graduation rate is 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?188146-Santa-Fe-University-of-Art-and-Design|title=College Scorecard - Santa Fe University of Art and Design|date=2016|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university closed in May 2018.&lt;ref name=closure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santafeuniversity.edu/public/default_site/files/Official_Statement_for_Website.pdf|title=Official Statement - Santa Fe University of Art and Design|date=2017|publisher=Santa Fe University of Art and Design|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{seealso|St. Michael's High School#History}}
St. Michael's College was established at the behest of Archbishop [[Jean-Baptiste Lamy]], who had arrived in New Mexico in 1851 to find that formal schooling in the territory was nonexistent. After establishing the Loretto Academy for girls in 1852, Lamy recruited the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle Christian Brothers]] to open a similar school for boys, and St. Michael's held its first classes in the fall of 1859. In the 1870s, the school appointed a new leader, Brother Botulph, who oversaw its growth into an institution of higher learning. Under Botulph, St. Michael's began offering high school diplomas, and later, teaching certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mission and History | url=https://www.stmichaelssf.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=346686&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=755200 | publisher=St. Michael's High School | accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 it received a charter from the territorial legislature, making it the oldest chartered college in New Mexico.&lt;ref name=bizeducation&gt;[http://santafebiz.org/about/education Colleges and Universities], City of Santa Fe Economic Development&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the school completed a new [[Lamy Building|main building]] which still stands in altered form on Old Santa Fe Trail.

[[Image:LamyBuildingSantaFeNM0.JPG|thumb|left|The 1878 [[Lamy Building]] originally housed St. Michael's College]]
Eventually, with different types of educational institutions becoming more sharply delineated, St. Michael's phased out its post-secondary courses by the end of [[World War I]] to operate strictly as [[St. Michael's High School]]. However, in the 1940s, the school's former principal Brother Benildus of Mary decided to re-establish St. Michael's College as an institution of higher learning. In 1944 he launched a fundraiser to build a new college on the existing campus which fell short of the goal. However, he got a second chance when the former Bruns Army General Hospital on Cerrillos Road was declared surplus property at the end of [[World War II]]. In 1947, Benildus managed to secure a portion of the hospital complex totaling {{convert|125|acre|ha}} and 39 semi-permanent wooden buildings for the new college, which was ready to begin classes in the fall. By 1949 the college had over 200 students, and in 1961 it completed its first permanent building, Brother Benildus Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=St. Michael's College Steeped in SF History | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18296167/the_santa_fe_new_mexican/ | accessdate=March 15, 2018 | work=Santa Fe New Mexican | date=May 28, 1961 | via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the Christian Brothers changed the name of the school to the  College of Santa Fe.&lt;ref name=bizeducation /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11235">The '''Seattle Camera Club''' (SCC) was an organization of photographers active in [[Seattle]], Washington, during the 1920s. It was founded in 1924 by Japanese immigrants and thrived for the next five years. The SCC was the only Japanese American photography club to include both Caucasians and women photographers as members, and because of their inclusivity their members were among the most exhibited photographers in the world at that time.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=158}}

==History==

The 39 charter members of the club were all Japanese men. Unlike other prominent clubs of Japanese photographers, they decided at the beginning to welcome women and Caucasian members.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=19}} The driving force behind the club’s formation was Dr. Kyo Koike, who was a well‒respected medical doctor in Seattle’s [[Issei]] community.

They held monthly meetings at 508½ Main Street near Dr. Koike’s office. At these meetings members critiqued each other’s prints and discussed current ideas about photography. Dr. Koike wrote about these discussions in their monthly bulletin, as well as descriptions of photography trips the members had taken, names of those members who had exhibited recently, and commentaries about photography in general.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=157}}

The club’s bulletin was called ''Notan'', which is a Japanese term that roughly translates as “light and shade”. These were qualities that defined the primary elements of a Japanese style of [[pictorialism]] that most of the original members prized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Shelley Sang‒Hee|title=Claiming the Oriental Gateway: Prewar Seattle and Japanese America|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2010|page=84|ISBN=9781439902134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their photographs contained strong lighting and rhythmical patterns that emphasized the artistic quality of a scene.

In 1925 the club began its own salon, which originally featured photographs by its own members but later expanded to an international field of photographers. The artistic strength of their membership is indicated by the fact that in 1926 members of the club showed a collective 589 prints in different exhibitions around the world.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=158}} That same year ''Photo‒Era'' magazine offered a trophy for the photography club whose members won the most awards in the magazine’s competitions. The first winner of the trophy was the Seattle Camera Club.{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=66}}

The club reached its peak membership in 1925 with 85 members, including several photographers who in lived in other areas of the country.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=158}} Two prominent Seattle women, [[Ella E. McBride|Ella McBride]] and [[Virna Haffer]], were among the club’s members by that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://henryart.org/exhibitions/shadows-of-a-fleeting-world-pictorial-photography-and-seattle-camera-club|title=Shadows of a Fleeting World: Pictorial Photography and Seattle Camera Club|accessdate=May 20, 2016|author=Henry Art Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one‒quarter of the members then were Japanese Americans.{{sfn|Tsutakawa|1993|p=55}}

Soon thereafter the membership in the club began to decline, primarily due to increasing economic difficulties that led up to the 1929 [[Great Depression]]. Many members held low-paying jobs, and with increased prices and a scarcity of jobs they could no longer afford to buy film or other photographic supplies.{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=71}} On October 11, 1929 the club held a farewell meeting. Only 7 members attended, and they formally disbanded the club at that time.

Some of the more well-to-do members, like Koike and Matsushita, continued to make photographs and exhibit them when they could. All of their efforts ended with the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] in December, 1941. Soon thereafter almost all of the Japanese American community in Seattle was transported to the Japanese American internment camps in [[Minidoka National Historic Site|Idaho]] or [[Fort Missoula Internment Camp|Montana]].{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=72}}

==Prominent Members==

'''Kyo Koike''' was a medical doctor who had a thriving practice in the Japanese community in Seattle. His professional income allowed him not only to concentrate on his photography but to underwrite many of the expenses of forming the club. He was the editor of the club's newsletter ''Notan''. During World War II all of his photographic equipment was confiscated by the U.S. government, and he was taken to the [[Minidoka War Relocation Center|Minidoka National Historic Site]] in Idaho. He remained there until the end of the war, but while there he fell ill and never recovered. He died shortly after he was allowed to return to Seattle in 1947. He left all of his photographs and extensive records of the Seattle Camera Club to fellow club member Iwao Matsushita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/what-became-of-the-members-and-the-work-of-the-seattle-camera-club/ |title=What became of the members and the work of the Seattle Camera Club?|accessdate=May 20, 2016|first=Michael|last=Upchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hideo Onishi''' (1890‒after 1934) was employed as a restaurant cook, but he was a prolific and very successful photographer. In 1926 he was the club’s top exhibitor for the year, and that same year more than 1,000 people attended an exhibition of his photographs at the Japanese Commercial Club in Seattle. He sold 233 copies of his prints at that exhibition and gave the profits to SCC.&lt;ref name=MW2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/exhibits/making-waves/photographers/|title=Making Waves: Japanese American Photography 1920‒1940|author=Japanese American National Museum|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Asakichi Kunishige''' (1978‒1960) was one of the original members of SCC and one of only a few club members who had formal training in photography. In 1911 he attended photography school in Illinois, and after moving to Seattle he worked in the darkrooms of [[Edward Curtis]] and Ella McBride.{{sfn|Tsutakawa|1993|p=73}} Because of his training and experience he was one of the technical experts of the club. He created and sold his own photographic paper, Textura Tissue, which was a favorite of club members because it emphasized the soft qualities that Pictorial photographers prized.{{sfn|Reed|2016|p=153}} During World War II he and his wife were sent to the Minidoka Internment Camp in Idaho. After their release they returned to Seattle, but he did not take up photography again.

'''Soichi Sunami''' (1885‒1971) learned photography in Seattle while working as an assistant at the studio of Ella McBride. In 1922 he moved to New York to study at [[Art Students League]], where there he photographed student dancers and artists. He also continued showing his photographs at SCC and was one of the most active non‒resident members of the club. Later he became of the main photographers for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and continued to work there for 38 years.&lt;ref name=MW2016/&gt;

'''Virna Haffer''' (1899-1974) was an accomplished, innovative, internationally renowned photographer, printmaker, painter, musician, and published author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/virna-haffers-photos-resurrected-at-tam/ |title=Virna Haffer’s photos resurrected at TAM.|accessdate=May 9, 2018|first=Michael|last=Upchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in 1899 in Aurora, Illinois, Virna Haffer and her family made the move to the Utopian community of Home, in South Puget Sound in Washington State in 1907.&lt;ref name="Henderson, Christina S. 2011"&gt;Henderson, Christina S., Francis, David F., Bullock, Margaret E., Haffer, Virna A. A Turbulent Lens: The Photographic Art of Virna Haffer. Tacoma Art Museum. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Haffer began her journey as a professional photographer when she was just 15 years old when she became the apprentice of the accomplished photographer, Harriette H. Ihrig.&lt;ref name="Henderson, Christina S. 2011"/&gt; She opened her own portrait photography studio in Tacoma, Washington and began publishing her photographs in 1924. Haffer was known for experimenting with unusual, quirky techniques and created her own artistic style that stretched the boundaries of artistic classifications in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40491806 |title= Good American Subjects Done Through Japanese Eyes: Race, Nationality, and The Seattle Camera Club, 1924-1929.|first= Shelly|last=Sang-Hee Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haffer's work was eccentric; she produced pictorialist, modern, surreal, and documentary style work. Virna Haffer's work was first exhibited in 1924 in the Fifth Annual F&amp;N Salon of Pictorial Photography, and in 1928 at the Seattle Camera Club's Fourth International Exhibition. By 1930 her work was internationally recognized, and often appeared in publications such as the ''American Annual of Photography''. In addition, she won recognition and prizes in photographic competitions in the United States in the 1930's.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Martin W. Against The Odds: Women Pioneers in The First Hundred Years Of Photography. St. Martins Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960's she took an interest in producing photograms, and was so successful that in 1969 she published a book about the process of making a photogram called ''Making Photograms: The Creative Process of Painting With Light''.&lt;ref name=BNWR2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cascadiavolunteers.org/PDFarticles/BiographyNWRealism.pdf|title=Biography NW Realism|author=Cascadia Art Museum Volunteers|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haffer's work was also the subject of several solo exhibitions not limited to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960; Museum of Science &amp; Industry, Los Angeles, 1964; New York Camera Club, 1967 and the Museum of Contemporary Arts &amp; Crafts, NYC, 1968.&lt;ref name=VH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlecameraclub.com/virna_haffer.html|title=Virna Haffer|author=Seattle Camera Club|accessdate= May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a service mark is federally registered, the standard registration symbol [[registered trademark symbol|&amp;reg;]] or "Reg U.S. Pat &amp; TM Off" may be used (the same symbol is used to mark registered trademarks).  Before it is registered, it is common practice (with some legal standing) to use the [[service mark symbol]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;℠&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; (a [[superscript]] SM).

The service mark symbol is mapped in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|2120|Service mark}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2100.pdf
|title=The Unicode Standard 7.0, Letterlike Symbols
|publisher=Unicode, Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Unicode-capable browser is needed to display this character properly, which appears similar to "&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;". The HTML entity is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8480;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Usage ==
A service mark differs from a trademark in that the mark is used on the advertising of the service rather than on the packaging or delivery of the service, since there is generally no "package" to place the mark on, which is the practice for trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Lawrence E.|title=Primer on Trademarks and Service Marks|journal=St. Mary's Law Journal|date=1986|volume=18|page=138|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/stmlj18&amp;div=13&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[private carrier]] can paint its service mark on its vehicles, such as on planes or buses. Personal service providers can place their service marks on their delivery vehicles, such as on the trucks of [[plumbers]] or on [[moving van]]s.  However, if the service deals with communications, it is possible to use a service mark consisting of a sound (a [[sound trademark]]) in the process of delivering the service.  This has been done in the case of [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]], which uses a tone sound followed by a woman speaking the company's name to identify its long distance service; [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], which uses the sound of a [[lion]]'s roar; and [[RKO Pictures]], which used a [[Morse code]] signal for their motion pictures.

Under United States law, service marks have a different standard of use in order to count as a use in commerce, which is necessary to complete registration and to stop infringement by competitors. A trademark normally needs to be used on or directly in association with the sale of goods, such as on a store display. As services are not defined by a concrete product, use of a service mark on the uniforms or vehicles of service providers or in [[advertisement]]s is instead accepted as a use in commerce. However, like trademarks, service marks must pass a test of distinctiveness for it to be qualified as a service mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=Donna L.|title=Trademarks and Service Marks and Internet Domain Names: Giving ICANN Deference|journal=Arizona State Law Journal|date=2001|volume=33|page=637|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/arzjl33&amp;div=23&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group|Thrifty, Inc.]] attempted to submit a service mark application that described aspects of their business (uniforms, buildings, certain vehicles) as "being blue." The application was rejected for not being specific enough, and the rejection was upheld on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In re Thrifty, Inc., 274 F.3d 1349, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2001)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15159379864415021322|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3228">'''The Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture''', or '''ARC''', was founded in October 1961 by three people, Alfred Barr, the art critic and founder of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], and Marvin Halverson an American Protestant theologian sometime of the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] and the author of a 1951 booklet, ''Great Religious Paintings''.&lt;ref&gt;Halverson M., [http://lccn.loc.gov/54004313 ''Great Religious Paintings''], New York, H. N. Abrams, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its aims and program are based on the deep and complex relationship between religion and the arts.  Its first board of directors included these three as well as [[Unitarian Universalist]] theologian and parish minister, [[James Luther Adams]]; mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], principal developer of the merger forming the [[United Church of Christ]], [[Truman B. Douglass]]; Congregationalist parish minister and theologian [[Amos Wilder]], and [[Stanley Romaine Hopper]], theologian and co-founder of the first Theology and Literature program in the United States.

Among the more than 300 Fellows of the Society have been [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Sallie McFague]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[John Updike]].

During the late 1960s most of the individuals involved in the published discourse pertaining to the field of [[theopoetics]] were either fellows or members of SARCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keefe-Perry|first=L. B. C.|title=Christianity and Literature|journal=Christianity and Literature|year=2009|volume=58|issue=4|url=http://theopoetics.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Theopoetics-Process-and-Perspective1.pdf|accessdate=11/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another major focus of the Society has been the role of myth in culture resulting in two publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell (ed.)|first=Joseph|title=Myth, Dreams and Religion|year=1970|publisher=E. P. Dutton &amp; CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently SARCC sponsors public lectures and currently publishes a newsletter, Seedbed. Previously it has published a periodical entitled "ARC Directions."

The archives of SARCC are maintained at the [[Harvard_Divinity_School#Andover-Harvard_Theological_Library|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]&lt;ref name="Library Holdings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture, 1961-2003|url=http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/bms00555.html|publisher=Andover-Harvard Theological Library|accessdate=26 November 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stetind in Fog''''' ({{lang-no|Stetind i tåke}}) is an oil painting by [[Peder Balke]] from 1864.

==Genesis==
Peder Balke got the inspiration for the painting during his first extended trip in 1832 to seek out North Norwegian nature. The dramatic landscape along the northern Norwegian coast impressed him and he returned to Stetind as a motif on several occasions later in life. Similar motifs are also in the 26 sketches that he sold to King [[Louis Philippe of France]], which are now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris.

[[File:Stetind_2009_2_crop.JPG|thumb|left]]
Stetind is situated on the [[:no:Stefjorden|Stefjorden]], at the headwaters of the [[Tysfjorden]]. In a [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] poll it was chosen as Norway's national mountain.&lt;ref name="NRK"&gt;{{cite web |ref=CITEREFMikalsenBudalen |last=Mikalsen |first=Kjell |last2=Budalen |first2=Andreas |date=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web |ref=CITEREFThorsn.C3.A6sHarnangAskheim2016 |last=Thorsnæs |first=Geir |last2=Harnang |first2=Harald |last3=Askheim |first3=Svein |date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painting ==
The painting is a dramatic composition in the Romantic tradition and depicts the relationship of man to the forces of nature. The mountain of Stetind is positioned in the middle of the picture, which has a fairly low horizon line. A gray fog dominates the painting. Out in the wind are two boats and a small group of people standing on a rock knoll looking out over the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063612/NO_280_007.html|title=Stetind in Fog|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==
The painting was bought by the [[National Gallery (Norway)|National Gallery]] in Oslo in 1980. The National Gallery also has two smaller versions of the same scene.

In 2011 Stocktown x South Africa premiered at Cinemafrica film festival in Stockholm, Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinemafrica.se/sv/filmer/dokumentarer/216-stocktown-x-sydafrika Article in Cinemafrica programme sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was featured in various international news media and blogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anotherafrica.net/art-culture/3183|title=Give it Up to Stocktown X South Africa: They in the Hizouse  {{!}} Another Africa|website=www.anotherafrica.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africandigitalart.com/2011/05/stocktown-x-south-africa-video/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afroklectic.blogspot.com/2011/03/stocktown-x-south-africa.html|title=AFROKLECTIC: stocktown X South Africa|website=afroklectic.blogspot.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lizletter.com/2011/03/18/stocktown-x-south-africa-a-short-story-of-african-street-culture/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.thenewpop.com/2011/04/05/stocktown-x-south-africa-a-road-movie-trailer/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kingsizemagazine.se/Fashion.aspx?ArtNo=19563&lt;/ref&gt; including being featured on CNN &lt;ref&gt;[CNN 2011 http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/04/stocktown.south.africa.documentary/ Online CNN article]&lt;/ref&gt; and shown at international exhibitions and film festivals, such as at the Victoria and Albert museum in London.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/f/afropolitans-24-june-2011/ V &amp; A museum programme] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106223844/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/f/afropolitans-24-june-2011/ |date=2011-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swedish Educational Broadcasting Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Stocktown X Sydafrika:|url=http://www.ur.se/id/165977|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa In The Picture Festival in Amsterdam, The Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africainthepicture.nl/nl/programma/filmsA-Z/51/STOCKTOWNXSOUTHAFRICA.html&lt;/ref&gt; Basel African Cinema in Basel, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;http://aktienmuehle.ch/aktienmuehle/Aktivitaeten/Agenda.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
One of the first public exhibitions was the [[graffiti]] exhibition '''The Arrow''' which was organized in conjuncture with the music festival Fanclub, held outside of Stockholm July 24 to 26 in 1998. Graffiti legends such as Blade, [[Futura 2000]], Quik and [[Seen (artist)|Seen]] showcased their art on canvas in one of the most celebrated and controversial exhibitions of [[graffiti]] art in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metro.se/se/article/2006/08/14/07/2542-23/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Polisen vill sätta stopp för graffiti-utställningen”: Expressen 19980722&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Stocktown participated in the Swedish Japanese exchange ''Swedish Style in Tokyo''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/sneakers-ar-mycket-mer-an-skor_157467.svd|title=Sneakers  är mycket mer än skor {{!}} SvD|last=Thungren|first=Stefan|work=SvD.se|access-date=2018-09-06|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music festivals &amp; concerts===
Within the framework of the Stockholm [[European Capital of Culture]] of 1998, Stocktown organized the hip hop element '''Stocktown 1998''' of the well attended Fanclub festival in Lida, south of Stockholm. All of the four elements of hip hop culture, [[B-Boying]], [[DJing]], [[MCing]] and [[graffiti]]) were featured, rather than the typical focus of music festivals on only rappers and to a lesser extent DJs. DJ’s such as [[Cut Chemist]] &amp; DJ Nu-Mark (from [[Jurrassic Five]]), as well as [[DJ Babu]] (of the [[Beat Junkies]]/[[Dilated Peoples]]) had [[turntablism|turntablist]] performances that were previously almost unheard of in Swedish music festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hem.passagen.se/bboyswe/stocktown.html Article about B-Boying]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film festivals===
On October 2 to 4 1998, Stocktown together with alternative film festival Popcorn organized '''Blaxplo''' as a tribute to classical [[Blaxploitation]] movies such as [[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]], [[Coffy]] and [[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]] but also to give a proper background to the cultural roots of contemporary street culture. Going beyond the exploitative aspect of the classics, the event highlighted the plight of the black community in [[United States]] by organizing a well attended seminar and discussion on the contemporary [[prison-industrial complex]] in the [[United States]] and resistance to it with scholar of comparative religion [[Mattias Gardell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.nu/arkiv/id/220/ Article in film.nu archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the film festival Popcorn developed into a music film festival in 2002, Stocktown was chosen to curate the films about hip hop and reggae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.nojesguiden.se/artiklar/popcorn-aer-tillbaka|title=Popcorn är tillbaka!|work=NÖJESGUIDEN|access-date=2018-09-06|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sunlight''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Frank Weston Benson]] currently in the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
Sunlight is created in the [[American impressionist]] style. It is a portrait of a woman, who has been identified as Benson's daughter, Eleanor, standing on a hill, looking out towards the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off [[Penobscot Bay]] in [[Maine]]. She is in a white dress that is getting ruffled by the wind blowing off the ocean. Her left hand is up, shielding her face from the sun, while her right hand is planted on her hip, a pose Benson used multiple times. Because of the woman shielding her eyes form the sun, it is likely that the [[sunlight]] is the actual subject of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalog Entry on Sunlight|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/sunlight-benson-frank-weston|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
Frank W Benson started working with the Impressionist style at the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref name="Bedford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bedford|first=Faith Andrews|title=Benson Biography|year=1999|url=http://www.frankwbenson.com/bensonbio.html|accessdate=2 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704183753/http://www.frankwbenson.com/bensonbio.html|archivedate=4 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started exclusively using the style by 1909. Benson was one of the forerunners of American Impressionism, especially within the [[Ten American Painters]]. Benson was known for painting the idealized world, especially that of the leisure of [[New England]].

Benson was, like most Impressionists, very interested in [[light]]. Benson himself stated that, "I follow the light, where it comes from, where it goes."&lt;ref name="Bedford"/&gt;

===Acquisition===
Painted in 1909, the painting was included in the Sixth Annual Exhibition of Works by American Artists, December 4, 1910 - January 1, 1911. It was later purchased from the artist by the John Herron Art Institute, now Indianapolis Museum of Art, in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provenance of Sunlight|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/sunlight-benson-frank-weston#provenance-text|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Final Destination''''' (alternatively known as '''''Final Destination 4''''') is a 2009 American [[3D film|3D]] [[supernatural horror film]] written by [[Eric Bress]] and directed by [[David R. Ellis]], both of whom also worked on ''[[Final Destination 2]]''. Released on August 28, 2009, it is the fourth installment of the [[Final Destination (film series)|''Final Destination'' film series]], and the first to be shot in [[High-definition video|HD]] [[3D film|3D]]. It is currently the highest-grossing ''Final Destination'' film, earning $186 million worldwide but also received the worst critical reception of the franchise. 

==Plot==

In 2009, College student Nick O'Bannon visits the McKinley Speedway with his girlfriend Lori Milligan and their friends Hunt Wynorski and Janet Cunningham. While watching the race, Nick has a premonition of a horrible car accident that sends debris into the stands, causing the stadium to collapse. When Nick panics, a fight breaks out and several people leave the stadium, including Lori, Hunt, Janet, security guard George Lanter, mechanic Andy Kewzer, his girlfriend Nadia Monroy, racist tow truck driver Carter Daniels, and mother Samantha Lane. As Nadia berates the group, a stray tire flies out of the stadium and decapitates her.

Several days after the accident, Carter tries to set a fire on George's lawn for preventing him from saving his wife, but a chain reaction causes him to be dragged down the street on fire before his tow truck explodes. The next day, Samantha is leaving the beauty salon when a rock propelled by a lawn mower is shot through her eye, killing her. After reading about the events in the newspaper and [[Final Destination series|the past disasters]], Nick becomes convinced that Death is after them. Hunt and Janet don't believe them, but they manage to convince George to help. The group visits the mechanic shop to warn Andy, but he is killed when a CO2 tank launches him through a chain link fence. After receiving a premonition involving water, Nick tries to warn Hunt, who has gone to a country club pool. At the same time, George and Lori try to find Janet, who becomes trapped in a malfunctioning car wash, and they narrowly manage to save her. Hunt drops his lucky coin in the water after accidentally turning the pool's drain on. When he dives in, he is sucked down to the drain, where the increasing suction eventually sucks his organs through the drain pipe. Afterward, George admits that he tried to commit suicide several times, but all attempts have failed. Nick believes saving Janet must have ruined Death's plan and the group celebrates.

Four days later, Nick begins to see more omens and remembers asking cowboy Jonathan Groves to switch seats prior to the accident, meaning he is next. Nick and George track Jonathan down at a hospital, where he remained in traction recovering from the accident. They witness him being crushed by an overflowing bathtub that falls through the ceiling. As they leave, George is suddenly hit by a speeding ambulance and Nick realizes that Lori and Janet are still in danger. He tracks them down at a mall cinema and convinces Lori to leave, but Janet refuses and is killed by flying debris when a chain reaction causes the screen to explode. A multitude of explosions race Nick and Lori through the mall until they are trapped on a malfunctioning escalator, Lori is dragged into the gears and killed. This turns out to be another premonition, but George is killed by the ambulance before Nick can warn him.

At the mall, Lori begins seeing omens as well. Having failed in his premonition, Nick runs back to the mall to stop the explosion before it occurs. He is pinned to a wall by a nail gun but manages to stop the fire before it spreads to several combustible barrels, saving everyone. Two weeks later, Nick notices a loose scaffold prop while heading into a café and warns a construction worker about it before going inside. While talking with Lori and Janet, he starts to see more omens and alludes to the theory that his predictions were red herrings meant to lead them to where they needed to be for Death to strike. Just as he realizes this the scaffold outside collapses, causing a truck to swerve and crash into the coffee shop, killing all three of them. Janet is crushed under the tires, Lori is decapitated by the impact, and Nick is propelled into a wall, dislocating his jaw.

==Production==

===Development===
After the success of ''[[Final Destination 3]]'', which was initially planned to be in 3D,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miska|first=Brad|title=SET VISIT PART I: FINAL DESTINATION 4: 3-D Explodes in Our Face!|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEjm7pklbAwCml|work=[[Bloody-Disgusting]]|date=November 20, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Bress wrote a script, which impressed producer Craig Perry and [[Warner Bros.]] enough to green-light a fourth installment. [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] was on board to direct, but because of scheduling conflicts with ''[[Dragonball Evolution]]'', he decided to drop out. Consequently, the studio executives opted for [[David R. Ellis]] to return because of his work on ''[[Final Destination 2]]''. He accepted because of the 3D.&lt;ref name="setinterview"&gt;{{cite news|author=B.

===Filming===

Although shooting was to be done in [[Vancouver]], which was where the previous three films were shot, David R. Ellis convinced the producers to shoot in [[New Orleans]] instead to bring business to the city, and because the budget was already large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Edward Douglas|title=''Final Destination 4'': The 3-D Set Visit!|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=6070|work=ShockTillYouDrop.com|date=May 14, 2008|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening crash sequence at "McKinley Speedway" was filmed at [[Mobile International Speedway]] in [[Irvington, Alabama]]. Filming began in March 2008 and ended in late May in the same year.&lt;ref name="FD4 Plot Opening"/&gt; Reshoots were done in April 2009 at [[Universal Studios Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miska|first=Brad|title=Behind-the-Scenes Footage of ''Final Destination 4'' Reshoots|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/15974|work=Bloody-Disgusting|date=April 22, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack attracted generally favorable reviews. Christian Clemmensen of [[Filmtracks.com]] gave the score 3 out of 5 stars and felt Tyler was "capable [...] to further explore new stylistic territory while making substantial use of the structures and tone of [predecessor composer] [[Shirley Walker]]'s music." His approach to the scores were called "intelligent", and provide "adequate if not strikingly overachieving recordings is testimony to his immense talents."

The reviewers were also impressed with the extension of the sound used by Walker in ''[[Final Destination 3]]''. "It relates to an affection for Walker's contribution to the industry," said an unnamed critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/final_destination09.html |title=''The Final Destination'' review |work=Filmtracks.com | date=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A SoundNotes reviewer grades the film with an impressive score of 7.5/10, remarking "Brian Tyler slugs his way through the inadequacies of ''The Final Destination'' and produces a score with reasonable entertainment value and enough of an appeal to make it function well apart from the woeful film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scorenotes.com/soundtracks/finaldestination.html |title=''The Final Destination'': Soundtrack Review |work= ScoreNotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''The Final Destination'' was initially scheduled for a DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] release on December 22, 2009. The film was pushed back to January 5, 2010 in the US. Both the DVD and Blu-ray Disc included two pairs of 3D glasses with each set and featured a 2D version on the disc, along with additional scenes. Only the Blu-ray Disc version included two alternate endings, a "making of" featurette about the deaths, storyboard visualization and a preview of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34418/the-final-destination-crashes-blu-ray-and-dvd |title=''The Final Destination'' Crashes onto Blu-ray and DVD |work=[[DreadCentral]] | date=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray Disc release, also a combo pack, includes a standard DVD of the film.

In [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores, some of the DVDs included an exclusive ''Final Destination'' comic book.

The movie was released uncut in Australian theaters with an [[Australian Classification Board#Film and video game classifications|MA15+]] (Strong horror violence, sex scene) rating. When the movie's DVD/Blu-ray Disc release was reviewed, the ACB (Australian Classification Board) noted several scenes in the 2D version that exceeded the guidelines of the MA15+ category. There were two editions released in Australia: a DVD version which only contains a censored 2D version (most of the blood effects taken off and gore trimmed) and a DVD release awarded an R18+ rating (High impact violence) with both uncensored 2D and 3D versions (and 3D glasses included). The covers between the two releases vary.

==Reception==
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 29% of 95 critics gave the film a positive review, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 4.2 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_destination_final_death_trip_3D/ |title=The Final Destination |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's consensus is: "With little of the ingenuity of previous installments, ''The Final Destination'' is predictable, disposable horror fare." [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 30 based on 14 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/finaldestination4 | title=''The Final Destination'': Reviews | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | date = January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Persecutor''''', also known as '''''Forgive Me Natasha''''' and less commonly as '''''Sergei''''', is the [[autobiography]] of [[Sergei Kourdakov]], a former [[KGB]] agent who persecuted Christians in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s, but defected to Canada in 1971 and converted to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].&lt;ref name="montreal"&gt;{{cite news |last=Diebel |first=Linda |title = Political refugee turns evangelist &amp;ndash; Russian deplores loss of God here |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]] |date=June 19, 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19720619&amp;id=6PchAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xaEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=831,5102237 |doi= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sovsec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Soviet Security and Intelligence Organizations 1917-1990: A Biographical Dictionary and Review of Literature in English |last=Parrish |first=Michael |year=1992 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0-313-28305-2 |page=544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="front"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergei Kourdakov Article #1 |url=http://frontiernet.net/~jamsch/Sergei.1.html |author=Marilyn and John Schreiber |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was finished shortly before his death in January 1973 and published [[posthumous work|posthumously]].&lt;ref name="pub-tp"&gt;Publisher's Note: {{cite book |last1=Kourdakov |first1=Sergei |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |others= |title=The Persecutor |publisher=Fleming H.

==Background==
''The Persecutor'' details Sergei Kourdakov's early life in [[Novosibirsk Oblast]], his life as an [[orphan]], the raids he led on private Christian assemblies while a [[Soviet Navy|Naval]] academy student in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]], his [[defection]] to Canada, and his new life in Canada and the United States. The book opens with Kourdakov's escape to Canada. Beginning with the second chapter, the book flashes back to Kourdakov's childhood.

==Criticism==
Although largely accepted, ''The Persecutor'' has been met with varied criticism regarding its authorship and accuracy. Some, such as Albert W. Wardin, believe that the biography was at least partially written by members of [[Underground Evangelism]], the Christian organization which Kourdakov was a member of that helped smuggle [[Bible]]s into communist countries.&lt;ref name="ox"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wardin Jr. |first1=Albert W. |last2= |first2= |year=1974 |title=The Persecutor |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=346 |url=http://jcs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/16/2/346-a |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wardin also claims that the book gives a distorted view of evangelical life in the Soviet Union, stating that "the allegation that for years before the late 1960s there was not even one Protestant church in Novosibirsk is untrue" and that "the figure of 30,000 Initiative Baptists in Kamthatka [...] and that of over 150 attacks in two years seems unbelievably high."&lt;ref name="ox" /&gt;

In 2004, United States Christian journalist Caroline Walker released a drama [[documentary]] about ''The Persecutor''. Claiming to have been given a vision from God,&lt;ref name="fms"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgive Me, Sergei |url=http://www.forgivemesergei.com/ |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; she traveled to [[Siberia]] to investigate various parts of book. Through the film, she claims that contrary to her own expectations, there are many inconsistencies in the autobiography, such as the section dealing with Sergei's experience in the Barysevo Orphanage as a child.&lt;ref name="fms-a"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgive Me, Sergei - Irony of a 70th Year Anniversary Celebration |url=http://www.forgivemesergei.com/anecdote.asp |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary, titled ''Forgive Me, Sergei'' (a pun on the autobiography title), was co-produced and directed by 
Polish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Damian Wojciechowski, whom she met during her investigation. He was also attempting to film a documentary on Kourdakov's life, but was struggling with inconsistencies in the book.
{{Quote|"On the first film shoot, I recognized that the book was much further from the truth than what I had first thought and might simply be fiction."|Damian Wojciechowski&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgive Me, Sergei - Director|url=http://www.forgivemesergei.com/director.asp|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The documentary received multiple awards at film festivals.&lt;ref name="awd"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgive Me, Sergei - Awards &amp; Nominations |url=http://www.forgivemesergei.com/awards.asp |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''true name''' is a [[name]] of a thing or being that expresses, or is somehow identical to, its true [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]].  The notion that [[language]], or some specific [[sacred language]], refers to things by their true names has been central to philosophical study as well as various traditions of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], religious [[invocation]] and mysticism ([[mantra]]s) since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/glossary/g/Magical_Name.htm Magical Name] (paganwiccan.about.com)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/wiccan-name.html Finding Your Wiccan Name] (wicca-spirituality.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and religious contexts==
The true name of the Egyptian sun god [[Ra]] was revealed to [[Isis]] through an elaborate trick. This gave Isis complete power over Ra and allowed her to put her son Horus on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geraldine (1981). ''Gods &amp; Pharaohs from Egyptian Mythology.'' London, England: Eurobook Limited. pp. 24–25. {{ISBN|0-87226-907-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socrates]] in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' considers, without taking a position, the possibility whether names are "conventional" or "natural" ("true name" [τῇ ἀληθείᾳ ὄνομα]), that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify &lt;ref&gt;pp. 4 &amp; 18, [[David Sedley]], [http://assets.cambridge.org/052158/4922/sample/0521584922ws.pdf ''Plato's Cratylus''], Cambridge University Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (this [[Conventionalism|anti-conventionalist]] position is called [[Cratylism]]).

[[Hellenistic Judaism]] emphasized the divine nature of ''[[logos]]'', later adopted by the [[Gospel of John]].  The true [[name of God]] plays a central role in [[Kabbalism]] (see [[Gematria]], [[Temurah (Kabbalah)|Temurah]], [[YHWH]] [the [[tetragrammaton]]]) and to some extent in [[Sufism]] (see [[100th name of God]]).
The ancient [[Jews]] considered God's true name so potent that its invocation conferred upon the speaker tremendous power over His creations.  To prevent abuse of this power, as well as to avoid blasphemy, the name of God was always [[taboo]], and increasingly disused so that by the time of [[Jesus]] their [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] was supposedly the only individual who spoke it aloud&amp;nbsp;— and then only in the [[Holy of Holies]] upon the [[Day of Atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stuart Gordon, ''The Encyclopedia of Myths and Legends'', pp. 480-1, Headline Book Publishing, London, 1993 {{ISBN|0-7472-3936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in a Biblical context, in the tale of [[Jacob]]'s nocturnal [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestling with an anonymous angel]], the angel refuses to reveal his own name to Jacob even after the angel's submission at dawn.  Thereafter Jacob obtains a new name which signifies his successful struggle to God and man, and names the place to commemorate his surviving an encounter with the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 32:22-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary pre-industrial peoples guard secret names which are only used in solemn rituals.  These names are never mentioned and kept from general knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, James, "Tabooed Words" in ''The Golden Bough'', first volume abridged edition, (New York: Mentor, 1959), pages 235-246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore and Literature==
In Jewish tradition, when several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as "[[Alter (name)|Alter]]" ({{lang-yi|אלטער}}, literally "old"), or ''Alterke'', the view being that the [[Angel of Death]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it. 

When captured by [[Polyphemus]], [[Homer]]'s [[Odysseus]] is careful not to reveal his name; when asked for it, Odysseus tells the giant that he is "[[Outis|Οὖτις]]", which means "nobody"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3Dou%29%2Ftis οὔτις] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*ou%29%3Dtis Οὖτις], Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;. But later, having escaped after blinding Polyphemus and thinking himself beyond Polyphemus' power, Odysseus boastfully reveals his real name, an act of [[hubris]] that was to cause enormous problems later. Knowing his name, Polyphemus was able to call upon Odysseus the revenge of his father, the god [[Poseidon]]. Many later episodes of the [[Odyssey]] depict Odysseus facing the relentless hostility of Poseidon - which he could have avoided had he persisted in keeping his real name secret.   
 
According to practises in [[folklore]], referred to as 'the Law of Names'; knowledge of a true name allows one to affect another person or being [[Magic (paranormal)|magically]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 134, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is stated that knowing someone's, or something's, true name therefore gives the person (who knows the true name) power over them. This effect is used in many tales,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 260 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the German fairytale of ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'': within Rumpelstiltskin and all its variants, the girl can free herself from the power of a supernatural helper who demands her child by learning its name.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 128, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legend of [[Saint Olaf]] recounts how a [[troll]] built a church for the saint at a fantastic speed and price, but the saint was able to free himself by learning the troll's name during a walk in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''[[Child Ballads|The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]'', v 1, p 95, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the belief that children who were not baptised at birth were in particular danger of having the [[fairy|fairies]] kidnap them and leave [[changeling]]s in their place may stem from their unnamed state.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 115 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scandinavian variants of the ballad ''[[Earl Brand]]'', the hero can defeat all his enemies until the heroine, running away with him, pleads with him by name to spare her youngest brother.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 91, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scandinavian beliefs, more magical beasts, such as the [[Neck (water spirit)|Nix]], could be defeated by calling their name.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 95-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason significant objects in Germanic mythology, which were considered to have some kind of intrinsic personality, had their own names too, for example the legendary Sword [[Balmung]].

Medieval beliefs about [[witchcraft]] indicated that the [[Devil]] baptized witches with a new, secret name.

In the folklore of Northern England, there was the belief that a [[boggart]] should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.

[[Giacomo Puccini]] used a similar theme in the opera [[Turandot]]. The plot turns on whether or not Princess Turandot could learn the name of her unwanted suitor. If she does, she could execute him; if she doesn't, she would have to marry him.

==In cryptography==
The term "true name" is sometimes used in [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]] to refer to a name that is assumed to uniquely identify a principal in a global namespace (for example, an [[X.500]] or [[X.509]] [[Distinguished Name|Distinguished name]]). This usage is often critical, with the implication that use of true names is difficult to enforce and unwise to rely on.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} &lt;!-- possible ref: Cryptography and the Politics of One's True Name, Leonard N. Foner (in True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier) -- but I haven't actually read it --&gt;

==In popular culture==
In [[fantasy]] where magic works by evoking true names, characters often go to great lengths to conceal their true names. In some settings, such as [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea (book series)|Earthsea]]'', this is true for all beings. In others, as in [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[The Magic Goes Away]]'', it applies only to those of magical inclination, as where a wizard is revived from the dead only by another who found his name, and even then only with great difficulty. Finding a true name may require arcane procedures. In ''Earthsea'', a wizard must listen for and give the hero his true name; this is performed in both Le Guin's ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' and ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]''.

*In Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Nine Billion Names of God]]'', when all of God's names are discovered by Tibetan monks, the universe ends.
*In [[Glen Cook|Glen Cook's]] ''[[The Black Company|Black Company]]'' series, speaking a sorcerer's true name aloud can snuff out their magical power. All the magic users in the series are referred to by pseudonyms, and many of them went to great lengths to kill anyone who knew their original names.
*In [[Christopher Paolini|Christopher Paolini's]] ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'', magicians can control someone by learning their true name, and use the true name of inanimate objects in spells. 
*[[Patricia Wrede]], in her novel ''[[Snow-White and Rose-Red]]'', has a character not succumb to a spell because the caster did not know the name he was baptized by.
*[[Patricia McKillip]], in her novel ''[[The Forgotten Beasts of Eld]]'', wizards, including the main character Sybel, can call people and creatures using their true name.
*In ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'', [[Poul Anderson]] has the doctor who delivers a baby issue not only a regular birth certificate, but a secret one, with the newborn's name; the hero, born before such precautions were routine, is glad to hide his daughter's true name. 
*In the ''[[Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' by [[Jonathan Stroud]], a magician cannot have full control over a demon if the demon knows the magician's true name. As a result, all magicians have records of their true names destroyed during childhood and take a new name around adolescence.  
*In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', all people and gods also have true names which give great but not total power over them. ''[[The Lightning Thief]]'', a previous novel of Riordan's, also emphasizes on the importance of using names, particularly the names of gods.
*In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Bilbo Baggins]] uses a great deal of trickery to keep the dragon,  [[Smaug]], from learning his name; even the sheltered hobbit realizes that revealing his name would be very foolish.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 261 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Likewise, in Ursula K. Le Guin's ''Earthsea'' canon, and specifically in her seminal short story "[[The Rule of Names]]", knowledge of a dragon's or human's true name confers power over them.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack, Charlotte, ''Ursula K. Le Guin'', (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*True names and [[The Speech (fiction)|speech]] are the basis for magic in [[Diane Duane]]'s ''[[Young Wizards]]'' series. 
*The dragons of ''[[Deltora Quest (series)|Deltora Quest]]'' believe that knowledge of their true name gives others power over them, and will thus only reveal it to trusted confidants or in dire need.
*The concept is also prominently present in  ''[[The Kingkiller Chronicle]]'' by Patrick Rothfuss.&lt;ref&gt;Rothfuss, Patrick:The Name of the Wind, 27 March 2007, DAW Books Hardcover {{ISBN|978-0-7564-0407-9}}, pages=662}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' utilizes the concept as well.
*Multiple variants of magic utilizing or grounded in the power of true names have appeared in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], though never as a bedrock element of the game. For instance, certain spells are more powerful if the target's true name is known.&lt;ref name="d20SRD"&gt;The spell 
*In the Cold Cereal Trilogy true names were used to control a person. Nimue (the Lady of the Lake) used it to freeze people.

''[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trapTheSoul.htm Trap the Soul]'' is one such example, where knowledge of a true name allows the capture of even those immune to magic.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the role-playing setting [[World of Darkness|One World of Darkness]], the concept of True Names is very expansive. The True Name of a being is like a platonic blueprint to the creature. A human's True Name can even change after life-altering events. It is a description of the being, from its internal organs to its very soul. All living creatures have one, but those with more intelligence have more complex True Names. A [[Fallen angel|Fallen]] has a True Name given directly by God, but they are unpronouncable by mortal tongues because they are not words or names in the traditional sense; rather, they are a collection of abstract sounds and concepts, such as the sound of a hundred children laughing at once or the wind whistling over the entrance of a cavern. A Fallen's Celestial Name will suffice to fill out the power a True Name has over other beings. Magic is also easier to cast and stronger against a target whose True Name is known.
*In [[Jim Butcher]]'s ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' a wizard or other magical being can gain power over anyone by knowing their name, if the invoker has heard it spoken by its owner; however, as humans' names change with their nature, their magical power generally decays after a time.
*In the ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", the Carrionites are a species of witch-like beings who use words as a form of magic power. Particularly potent is someone's name, but it will only work once. The Doctor repels the Carrionites at one point using their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Doctor Who|date=May 2014|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1-4422-3481-9|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImuYAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;ots=3JybWyieMo&amp;dq=doctor%20who%20carrionites%20and%20the%20power%20of%20names&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=doctor%20who%20carrionites%20and%20the%20power%20of%20names&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the Doctor's true name must never be said or "silence will fall".
*In the [[manga]] series ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', a [[shinigami]] (death god) must learn the true name of his or her sword, known as a [[zanpakutou]].
*In the television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', recurring antagonist [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] (portrayed by [[Robert Carlyle]]) stresses on the importance of using someone or something's proper name.
*In the book series The Symphony of Ages by Elizabeth Haydon, the main character Rhapsody is a bard who discovers the gift of True Naming, giving her the ability to do many wondrous things such as changing a person's nature, freeing them of magical slavery or granting them new supernatural abilities to even camouflaging a group of adventurers in plantlife to avoid detection by assassins and bandits.
*In the book series Skulduggery Pleasant by Derek Landy, every person has a name that they choose which is used to protect their other names: a name that is given to them at birth which can be used to control a person to a limited extent and a true name which can be used to control that person to an unlimited degree.
*In Superman comics, the 5th-dimensional imp Mr. Mxyzptlk can be banished from our dimension if he is tricked into reciting his own name backwards (Kltpzyxm).      
*The [[SCP Foundation]] object "Taboo" is described as a location containing objects and beings capable of appearing when their names are said and stealing the names of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo|title=[REDACTED PER PROTOCOL 4000-ESHU] - SCP Foundation|last=|first=PeppersGhost|date=|website=www.scp-wiki.net|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character remembering their true name may be an important means of maintaining mastery of their own life. In [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s movie ''[[Spirited Away]]'', the witch who runs the bathhouse, Yubaba, ensures loyalty by stealing the names of her subjects. For example, one of the witch's most loyal subjects, the spirit of the Kohaku River, has his name taken and is given a slave name: Haku. He forgets his name, and it is in this way 'taken' from him; he warns [[Chihiro Ogino]] against the dangers of forgetting her own name. She frees him when she recognises him and he then remembers and 'takes back' his name and is freed from the clutches of the witch.

In the [[cyberpunk]] genre following [[Vernor Vinge]]'s 1981 ''[[True Names]]'' and the work of [[William Gibson]], much of the plot involved interactions between people's virtual selves in [[cyberspace]].  Learning a fellow hacker's real-world name (i.e., their "true name") could allow you to turn them in to the government or otherwise blackmail them, conveying a kind of power that could be considered analogous to the equivalent concept of myth and legend.

The '''World Architecture Festival''' (WAF) is an annual festival and awards ceremony, one of the most important events dedicated to the architecture and development industry. The first four events were held in [[Barcelona]], from 2008 to 2011, at which point the festival moved to [[Singapore]] for four years. Since 2016, host cities have included [[Berlin]] and [[Amsterdam]]. At the festival around 200 shortlisted projects compete for awards in 31 categories. One of these projects is awarded the World Building of the Year title. All the entries are published in the World Buildings Directory online database&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|tittel=Online database|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/|utgiver=World Buildings Directory|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The World Architecture Festival was first held in 2008 as a "festival and live awards competition dedicated to celebrating and sharing architectural excellence from across the globe." The first four festivals were held in Barcelona; since 2012 the annual events have been hosted by [[Singapore]], [[Berlin]], and [[Amsterdam]]. Several hundred projects are entered in the competition for the awards and more than 200 of these are shortlisted for live presentation at the festival. All the presentations of the entries are collected in the World Buildings Directory. The architects pay a submission fee to enter a project for a WAF Award and travel to where the festival is arranged to present the project live if it is shortlisted. The entries are voluntary and the festival does not control who submits projects. In 2011 the Inside Festival (for interior architecture and design) was added in the same venue and arranged at the same time as WAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|forfatter=John Hill|tittel=Talking WAF - Interview with Paul Finch (Email interview)|url=http://www.world-architectsXX.com/pages/waf-interview-paul-finch|utgiver=world-architects, eMagazine|dato=04.08.2013#sthash.NrKVjdbX.dpuf|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 2008 festival ===

The World Architecture Festival was held for the first time on 22–24 October 2008 in [[Barcelona]]. Its programme director was Paul Finch. An important part of the festival was the awards programme. The competition was open to building completed within the past 18 months, between January 1, 2007 and June 20, 2008. There were 722 entries competing in 17 categories, comprising 96 building types from 63 countries. After a preselection, 224 projects from 43 countries have been shortlisted. All the shortlisted architects presented their work during the festival and the winners competed for the top award, the World Building of the Year. The judging panel was headed by Norman Foster and included [[Stefan Behnisch]], [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]] and [[Zaha Hadid]] among the 40 architects on the panel. 1,900 visitors from 70 countries attended the festival.&lt;ref name="Hanman" &gt;{{Kilde www|forfatter=Natalie Hanman|tittel=World building of the year shortlist announced|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/30/world.architecture.festival.awards|utgiver=''[[The Guardian]]''|dato=Wednesday 30 July 2008 11.30 BST|besøksdato=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|forfatter=Olivia McDowell|tittel=World Architecture Festival|url=http://www.specifier.com.au/projects/museums/38584/World-Architecture-Festival.html|utgiver=Specifier Magazine|dato=2008|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|tittel=World Architecture Festival Awards, Culture Category, Finalist|url=http://www.garethhoskinsarchitects.co.uk/info/awards/world-architecture-festival-awards-culture-category-finalist|utgiver=garethhoskinsarchitects.co.uk|dato=2008|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|tittel=The World Architecture Festival - 22–24 October|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/events/the-world-architecture-festival-22-24-october/3115978.article|utgiver=bdonline.co.uk/, Building Design 2011|dato=8 August 2008|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|tittel=Winners announced par / by World Architecture Festival|url=http://www.v2com.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=272:winners-announced-at-world-architecture-festival-2008&amp;catid=35:projetsarchitecture&amp;Itemid=142|utgiver=v2com.biz|dato=October 24, 2008|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Specifier 2008"&gt;[http://www.specifier.com.au/projects/museums/38584/World-Architecture-Festival.html Olivia McDowell:''World Architecture Festival'' in The Sepcifier], retrieved 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|tittel=World Architecture Festival 2009|url=http://www.architectural-intelligence.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=236|utgiver=architectural-intelligence.com|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">The '''World Crafts Council AISBL (WCC-AISBL)''' is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that was founded in 1964 to promote fellowship, foster economic development through income generating craft related activities, organize exchange programs, workshops, conferences, seminars, and exhibitions—and in general, to offer encouragement, help, and advice to the craftspersons of the world. The organization is now formally registered in Belgium as an international organization and ''AISBL'' is there the french shortcut for an ''international [[association without lucrative purpose]]''. The WCC is organised into five regions: Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The organization is affiliated to [[UNESCO]].

The WCC was founded in 1964 by [[Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay|Kamaladevi Chattopadhay]] and [[Aileen Osborn Webb]] (who had founded the [[American Craft Council]] in 1943.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftvic.org.au/resources/craft-culture/2002/global-peace-through-craft-the-formation-of-the-world-crafts-council ''Global Peace Through Craft: The Formation of the World Crafts Council'', By Sandra Alfoldy], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The WCC (Europe) meets once a year and the 2011 meeting was held in [[Dublin, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture360.org/event/dublin-world-crafts-council-europe-conference/ ''Dublin: World Crafts Council Europe conference'', by Judith Staines], 17 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Crafts Council meets every four years. In 2012, the General Assembly occurred in [[Chennai]] when [http://www.kaivalam.com/ Usha Krishna] was the President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaivalam.com ''Kaivalam''] Kaivalam Craft Summit&lt;/ref&gt; After this General Assembly the Presidency will move from India to China. Mr. Wang Shan was the president, Ms. Jing Chen was the Secretary General. In 2014, WCC Golden Jubliee Celebration Summit was held in Dongyang, China, more than 2000 craftpeople from 63 countries participated. In 2016, the General Assembly occurred in [[Isfahan, Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://isfwcc.ir/wcc18th/Introduction.aspx , ''The 18th General Assembly of the World Crafts Council Isfahan''], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; from September 22 to 29.

'''Yuri Ivanovitch Manin''' ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий Ива́нович Ма́нин}}; born 1937) is a Russian mathematician, known for work in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[diophantine geometry]], and many expository works ranging from [[mathematical logic]] to [[theoretical physics]]. Moreover, Manin was one of the first to propose the idea of a [[quantum computer]] in [[Timeline of quantum computing|1980]] with his book "Computable and Uncomputable".&lt;ref name="manin1980vychislimoe"&gt;{{cite book| author=Manin, Yu. I.| title=Vychislimoe i nevychislimoe|trans-title=Computable and Noncomputable| year=1980| publisher=Sov.Radio| url=http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip| pages=13–15| language=Russian| accessdate=2013-03-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510173823/http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip| archivedate=2013-05-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Manin gained a doctorate in 1960 at the [[Steklov Mathematics Institute]] as a student of [[Igor Shafarevich]]. He is now a Professor at the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik]] in [[Bonn]], and a professor [[emeritus]] at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/99|title=Yuri Manin {{!}} Max Planck Institute for Mathematics|website=www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.math.northwestern.edu/people/emeriti/ |title=Emeriti Faculty: Department of Mathematics - Northwestern University |website=www.math.northwestern.edu |language=en |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manin's early work included papers on the arithmetic and [[formal group]]s of [[abelian varieties]], the [[Mordell conjecture]] in the [[global function field|function field]] case, and [[algebraic differential equation]]s. The [[Gauss–Manin connection]] is a basic ingredient of the study of [[cohomology]] in families of [[algebraic varieties]]. He wrote a book on [[cubic surface]]s and [[cubic form]]s, showing how to apply both classical and contemporary methods of algebraic geometry, as well as [[nonassociative algebra]]. He also indicated the role of the [[Brauer group]], via [[Grothendieck]]'s theory of global [[Azumaya algebra]]s, in accounting for obstructions to the [[Hasse principle]], setting off a generation of further work. He also formulated the [[Manin conjecture]], which predicts the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties. He has further written on [[Yang–Mills theory]], [[quantum information]], and [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].

Manin had over 40 doctoral students, including [[Vladimir Berkovich]], [[Mariusz Wodzicki]], [[Alexander Beilinson]], [[Ivan Cherednik]], [[Alexei Skorobogatov]], [[Vladimir Drinfeld]], [[Mikhail Kapranov]], [[Vyacheslav Shokurov]], [[Arend Bayer]] and [[Victor Kolyvagin]], as well as foreign students including [[Hà Huy Khoái]], now the most senior mathematician in Vietnam.   He was awarded the [[Brouwer Medal]] in 1987, the [[Schock Prize]] in 1999 and the [[Cantor Medal]] in 2002.  In 1994, he was awarded the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]]. In 2010, he received the [[Bolyai Prize]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

In 1990 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4514 |title=Y.I.
